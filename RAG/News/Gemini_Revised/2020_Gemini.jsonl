He called it a public health issue, stating the current law forces many women, particularly those with limited resources, into unsafe, illegal abortions.  The government estimates 350,000 illegal abortions occur annually.  Fernández emphasized a state's responsibility to protect citizens, including women's right to choose.  Amnesty International Argentina praised the announcement, while Archbishop Jorge Eduardo Scheinig criticized it as a \"culture of death.\"  Abortion is currently illegal in Argentina except in cases of rape or risk to the mother's life.  A similar bill failed in the Senate in 2018.  Uruguay, Guyana, and Cuba are the only other Latin American countries with legal early-term abortion."}

The study, released online before formal publication, considered air travel and international cases to arrive at its estimate.  While Chinese authorities reported three deaths and linked the virus to a Wuhan seafood market, the researchers noted the possibility of human-to-human transmission.  The virus, first appearing in December, had spread to Thailand, South Korea, and Japan by January 20.  In response, several countries, including the U.S. (at San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York airports), Singapore, and Hong Kong, implemented enhanced screening measures for passengers arriving from Wuhan."}

{"title": "Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far", "content": "Astronomers have discovered the nearest known black hole to Earth, located approximately 1010 ± 195 light-years away in the HR 6819 system within the Telescopium constellation.  This is significantly closer than the previously nearest known black hole, V616 Mon, estimated at over 3000 light-years.  Visible to the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere, HR 6819 is the first such system known to contain a black hole.  Initially identified as a binary system, further observation revealed a third, unseen object: a black hole with a mass of at least 4.2 solar masses.  Its presence was detected through its gravitational effect on a nearby star, which orbits the black hole in 40.333 ± 0.004 days.  Unlike many black holes, this one lacks an accretion disk.  The system includes a B3 III star orbiting the black hole and a rapidly rotating Be star.  The research, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, suggests HR 6819 is similar to the LB-1 system and is estimated to be 15–75 million years old.  The study is dedicated to Stanislav Štefl."}

{"title": "COVID-19 may spread like flu, say scientists", "content": "A February 2020 study in *The New England Journal of Medicine* suggested SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, spreads similarly to influenza.  Researchers found the virus in both upper and lower respiratory tracts of infected volunteers, including an asymptomatic individual, indicating potential for person-to-person transmission by unaware carriers.  This contrasts with SARS, which primarily affects the lower respiratory tract.  The findings imply that containing COVID-19 may require different strategies than those used for SARS, potentially mirroring influenza containment efforts.  While the R0 value for SARS-CoV-2 remains uncalculated, its transmission characteristics suggest a higher human-to-human spread capability than other novel coronaviruses."}
{"title": "Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists", "content": "A new study from the Florida Museum of Natural History, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that spiky frog skulls evolved independently at least 25 times.  Researchers analyzed CT scans of 158 frog species, finding that similar skull structures—including spikes, grooves, and specialized jaw joints—evolved in frogs with similar ecological niches, regardless of evolutionary relatedness.  Hyperossification, characterized by spikes, grooves, or ridges, was often associated with frogs consuming large prey, enabling powerful bites.  Spikes may also provide protection against predators, potentially rupturing venom sacs in venomous species.  Other bone formations, like fang-like projections, aided in prey capture and combat.  The study's authors suggest that this repeated evolution of spiky skulls indicates the reactivation of ancient developmental pathways in response to environmental pressures.  This research, part of the NSF-funded oVert project, builds upon a 1973 survey, leveraging modern CT scanning technology to analyze a significantly expanded database of frog species."}

{"title": "Neanderthals 'knew what they were doing': Archæologist Dr Naomi Martisius discusses her findings about Neanderthals' behaviour with Wikinews", "content": "New research reveals Neanderthals in southwest France, 50,000 years ago, selectively used large bovid ribs to create bone tools (lissoirs) despite the abundance of reindeer bones at the sites.  Analysis of five tools from Abri Peyrony and Pech-de-l’Azé I, using non-destructive ZooMS (Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry), identified the bone source through collagen analysis of the tools' storage containers. This innovative technique, previously used only on much younger artifacts, confirmed the Neanderthals' preference for stronger bovid ribs, likely due to their superior resistance to breakage during use.  The findings, published May 8th in *Nature's Scientific Reports*, suggest a higher level of sophistication than previously attributed to Neanderthals."}

The RIAA claimed youtube-dl circumvented copyright protection measures and facilitated unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material, citing a test in the script's source code that included copyrighted song URLs.  The notice didn't cite any instances of actual copyright infringement or damages.  Youtube-dl, a FLOSS script written in Python, downloads videos from numerous websites, including YouTube, and is used for various purposes, including archiving, research, and accessibility.  Its maintainers argued it's a legitimate tool with many lawful uses.  Following the takedown, the source code was widely redistributed via alternative means, exemplifying the Streisand effect.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the RIAA's action as disappointing and counterproductive.  A former maintainer suggested removing the problematic test cases as a potential solution."}

{"title": "Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews", "content": "Red Hat announced it will fully shift investment from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream, ending CentOS Linux.  This follows Red Hat's 2014 acquisition of CentOS and its subsequent control of the CentOS governing board (five of nine members are Red Hat employees). CentOS, a free, binary-compatible clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), will be replaced by CentOS Stream, a rolling release distribution that precedes RHEL's development cycle.  While Red Hat frames this as a natural evolution to foster community innovation, the move has sparked significant community backlash, particularly given the accelerated end-of-life date for CentOS 8 (December 31, 2021, versus the original May 2029). CentOS 7 will receive maintenance until June 2024.  Former CentOS founder Gregory Kurtzer launched Rocky Linux, aiming for 100% bug-for-bug compatibility with Enterprise Linux as a downstream build, in response.

{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "A study published in *Nature Astronomy* demonstrated that *E. coli* and yeast can thrive in 100% hydrogen and helium atmospheres.  This challenges the assumption that oxygen is essential for all life.  Researchers cultured these organisms in 100% air, 100% hydrogen, 100% helium, and 80/20 N₂-CO₂.  Growth, though slower than in air, occurred in all anaerobic environments, with the organisms switching to less efficient anaerobic respiration and fermentation.  Yeast growth was slower in the absence of oxygen due to its role in synthesizing essential biochemicals.  This discovery expands the possibilities for habitable exoplanets, particularly those with expansive hydrogen-rich atmospheres, which are easier to detect with emerging technologies.  The study also identified gases released by *E. coli* in hydrogen atmospheres as potential biosignatures for exoplanet life detection, prompting astronomers to broaden their search criteria.  The James Webb Telescope's capabilities may allow observation of smaller exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars."}
