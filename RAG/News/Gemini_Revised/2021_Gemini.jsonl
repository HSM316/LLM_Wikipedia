The investigation will examine actions by both the Israeli Defense Forces and Hamas, though Israel, a non-member state, disputes the ICC's jurisdiction.  Israel strongly condemned the decision as antisemitic and hypocritical, vowing to fight it.  The US, also a non-member, reiterated its commitment to Israel's security and asserted the ICC lacks jurisdiction, while the Palestinian Authority welcomed the investigation.  Hamas also voiced support.  The 2014 Gaza conflict resulted in significant civilian casualties on both sides, according to UN and Israeli estimates."}

{"title": "International Criminal Court rules its jurisdiction includes Palestine", "content": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled its jurisdiction extends to areas of Palestine occupied by Israel since 1967, including Gaza and the West Bank.  The 2-1 decision cited Palestine's membership in the Rome Statute, but the court clarified it wasn't ruling on Palestinian statehood or borders.  While Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda welcomed the ruling's clarity, she stated the office would analyze it before determining next steps.  Bensouda previously alleged war crimes by both Israeli forces and Hamas.  The ruling was praised by Palestinian officials and groups like Human Rights Watch, but condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as antisemitic and a perversion of justice. Israel argues the ICC is improperly addressing political matters and that jurisdiction shouldn't extend to disputed territories. The U.S. also opposed the ruling, asserting Palestine isn't a sovereign state and therefore ineligible for ICC membership.  Both the U.S. and Israel, while unsigned to the Rome Statute, reject the court's jurisdiction."}

The NPC's draft decision, including recommendations from Vice Chair Wang Chen, grants a committee electing Hong Kong's chief executive the power to vet all legislative council candidates.  Political scientist Willy Lam predicts this will disqualify anyone deemed disloyal to the Chinese Communist Party.  Beijing's liaison office claims widespread Hong Kong support for the changes.  These reforms build upon last year's national security law, which has already led to the detention of 47 pro-democracy activists following an informal primary poll.

{"title": "European Union to reduce carbon emissions by 55% of 1990 levels by 2030", "content": "The EU agreed to a new climate law, raising its 2030 emissions reduction target to at least 55% below 1990 levels, aiming for net-zero by 2050.  This surpasses the previous 40% target for 2030.  The law establishes an independent advisory body and boosts investment in carbon sinks.  While MEPs claim this ensures a 57% net reduction,  others estimate a 52.8% cut in actual emissions.  The agreement allocates at least 30% of the EU's €1.8 trillion long-term budget to climate concerns.  Poland, relying heavily on coal, remains the only EU member opposing climate neutrality, targeting a 30% emissions reduction by 2030.  The UK has set its target at 78% reduction by 2035.  Reactions were mixed, with some praising the ambition and others criticizing it as insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal and deeming the process rushed.  Current measures project a 46% reduction by 2030, while EU emissions fell by a quarter between 1990 and 2019."}
{"title": "Irish Finance Minister Donohoe criticises OECD's global minimum corporate tax rate", "content": "Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe criticized OECD-led talks on a global minimum corporate tax rate, arguing smaller countries like Ireland need to use tax policy to offset larger countries' advantages.  He insisted any deal must accommodate Ireland's 12.5% rate, which benefits companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook and contributes significantly to Ireland's corporate tax revenue (projected to reach €12.5 billion by 2025).  Donohoe argued this low rate attracts jobs and investment, advocating for \"appropriate and acceptable tax competition\" below the US-proposed 21%. He said current proposals could shrink Ireland's corporate tax base by 20%, reducing tax receipts by €2 billion in 2025.  While acknowledging some Irish companies pay less than others internationally, Donohoe defended his country's rate as stimulating investment and growth.  Others commented that the issue is political rather than solely about tax change, and that a resolution is likely, helped by the US' willingness to address concerns.  However, political-level discussions haven't yet occurred, and a previous EU ruling ordering Apple to pay back taxes was overturned."}

Saied invoked Article 80 of the constitution, citing an imminent threat to national institutions, and assumed executive power.  He plans to appoint a new prime minister and will maintain the suspension for 30 days, also lifting parliamentary immunity.  Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi, of the Ennahdha party, denounced the actions as a coup, claiming Saied failed to consult him or Mechichi as required.  Other parties echoed this condemnation.  Despite the suspension, Ghannouchi attempted to access parliament but was blocked by the army.  Saied warned of an armed response to further violence.  The move follows a year of conflict between Saied and Mechichi amid Tunisia's economic crisis and high COVID-19 death toll (over 18,000 in a population of 12 million)."}

{"title": "UK pay freeze on public sector employees will end next year", "content": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak will end the public sector pay freeze affecting 2.6 million employees and raise the National Living Wage by 6.6% in his Wednesday budget.  The pay rise, starting next spring, follows a consultation and will be determined by independent advisors.  Around 5.7 million public sector workers could receive a pay increase, alongside approximately two million minimum wage earners. The National Living Wage (for over-23s) will increase to £9.50 per hour, while other minimum wages will also rise.  However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that universal credit recipients will see a smaller net increase due to tax and benefit changes.  Labour criticized the plan as underwhelming, advocating for a £10 minimum wage and measures to combat exploitative practices.  While the Daily Mirror reports Sunak is considering a £10.50 hourly wage and lowering the National Living Wage age to 21 by 2024, Sunak justified the pay rise as appropriate given the economic recovery and public sector workers’ pandemic contributions.  Analysis reveals a significant pay gap between public and private sector workers, with those affected by the freeze earning nearly 8% less than their private sector counterparts."}

{"title": "New Zealand raises interest rates in second straight month to 0.75%", "content": "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised its official cash rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 0.75% on November 24, 2021, its last meeting of the year.  This followed a 4.9% inflation rate in the third quarter—the highest since December 2007.  The hike, widely anticipated, followed substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus during the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing unemployment to a low and inflation to a more than decade-high.  This stimulus, coupled with low interest rates and housing shortages, doubled house prices over seven years, making New Zealand's housing the least affordable in the OECD.  The RBNZ cited rising oil and transport costs, and supply shortfalls as factors driving inflation, forecasting rates to reach 2.5% by 2023 and higher in 2024.  However, other projections place the OCR at 2% by mid-2022 (Capital Economics) or 3% by Q3 2023 (Westpac), with a possible 0.5% increase at the February 2022 meeting.  The October 6th increase to 0.5% was the first in seven years, delayed from August due to the Delta variant and Auckland lockdown.  Governor Adrian Orr described the 25-basis-point increases as a balanced approach, while acknowledging consideration of a 50-basis-point hike. He warned homeowners with high leverage to prepare for higher rates, noting that previous taxes on property investors failed to curb rising house prices, which the RBNZ views as unsustainable.  Globally, while stimulus is winding down, responses to rising inflation vary. The U.S. 6.2% inflation rate (highest in 31 years) is pressuring the Federal Reserve. The Bank of England and ECB also face criticism, while the Reserve Bank of Australia maintains its stance against rate increases until at least 2024.  Conversely, Norway, the Czech Republic, and South Korea have already increased rates, with South Korea expecting another hike.  The New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% following the announcement, with government bonds also declining."}
