However, he emphasized the lack of remorse and the deplorable violence inflicted on Thagipur, whose life was taken due to Musa's reaction to his romantic autonomy. The killing occurred in Wentworth Point after Musa found Thagipur with another woman.  Following an argument, Musa drove her car into Thagipur, pinning him against a wall.  While Musa claimed it was an accident, a jury found her guilty of murder.  Despite her difficult past, Justice Button stated he believed Musa had a chance of becoming a valued community member in the future and aimed to balance this with the gravity of her crime.  Musa will be eligible for parole in 2034."}

China claimed the balloon was a meteorological research craft blown off course.  The balloon's trajectory over the U.S. prompted Secretary of State Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing, citing a violation of U.S. sovereignty.  The balloon was shot down over the Atlantic Ocean after President Biden authorized the military to wait until it was over water to minimize civilian risk. China condemned the action as an overreaction.  A second Chinese surveillance balloon was also identified traversing Latin America, with China again claiming it was a civilian weather balloon.

{"title": "Study: floods, droughts more intense in past 20 years due to higher global temperatures", "content": "A NASA Goddard Space Flight Center study published in Nature Water reveals a strong link between rising global temperatures and intensified water-related extreme weather events over the past two decades.  Using data from GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites, researchers Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li identified 1,066 regions experiencing extreme wet or dry periods (2002-2021), with increasing severity since 2015.  The study showed a correlation between global mean temperature and the total intensity of these events, including a record South American drought (2015-2016) and extensive flooding in sub-Saharan Africa.  Experts concur that this amplified wet-dry cycle necessitates adjustments in water resource management, flood control, and infrastructure planning to mitigate the increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events projected under continued warming.  The study highlights the global impact of climate change, extending beyond average temperature increases to encompass the intensity and frequency of impactful weather events."}

However, critics, including the Sierra Club, highlight the project's significant environmental impacts, including the destruction of wetlands, freshwater consumption, and substantial greenhouse gas emissions (estimated at 613 trillion pounds of CO2 equivalent over 30 years), arguing it contradicts recent climate legislation.  The project's history includes legal challenges resulting in a temporary injunction and the reversal of a previous environmental impact statement due to insufficient analysis of foreign emissions and alternative proposals.  Development began in 2018, with initial approval in 2020 subsequently overturned.  The project's ultimate approval follows a complex legal and political battle."}

Although the companies expressed compassion, the families' attorney stated they were expecting a guilty verdict.

Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed Bakhmut's capture, citing internal Russian bureaucracy as a significant obstacle.  Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar confirmed ongoing fighting, stating Ukrainian forces control certain industrial and infrastructure facilities and maintain a partial encirclement.  She highlighted the failure of Russian forces to fully surround the city and their losses in surrounding heights.  Zelenskyy initially stated Bakhmut was \"only in our hearts,\" a sentiment echoed by a representative of the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces who described the city as razed but with Ukrainian forces maintaining some positions.  Russian President Putin declared the \"liberation\" of Bakhmut, a claim the Institute for the Study of War deemed tactically insignificant.  Analysts suggested the fall of Bakhmut, while providing a tactical advantage to Russia, would not be a decisive turning point in the war. Zelenskyy previously warned that Bakhmut's capture could pressure international support for a compromise settlement unacceptable to Ukraine.  The eight-month battle, characterized by heavy casualties on both sides and widespread destruction, followed earlier Russian successes in the nearby town of Soledar. Allegations of war crimes, including beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers, have emerged from the conflict.  At the G7 summit, Zelenskyy met with President Biden, securing an additional $375 million in US aid, and discussed the training of Ukrainian forces on F-16 fighter jets.

This is part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to clear a backlog of 92,000 asylum claims by year-end.  The questionnaires, reportedly 10-32 pages long with 40-50 questions, must be completed in English within 20 working days; failure to do so may result in claim withdrawal.  While the government assures claims will be assessed meritoriously, critics argue the process burdens applicants who may lack English proficiency or access to support.  The measure is controversial, with some claiming it facilitates asylum approvals while others express concerns about its impact on vulnerable individuals and the fairness of the process.  The Home Office plans to potentially expand the questionnaire system to other applicants.  Meanwhile, record migrant crossings and a record asylum claim backlog fuel the government's focus on immigration reform, including upcoming legislation to restrict asylum claims from illegal entrants.  Opposition parties criticize the government's approach, arguing for a faster, fairer system and stronger action against criminal gangs facilitating illegal crossings."}
{"title": "US condemns Russian Defense Minister for awarding pilots who intercepted US drone", "content": "The White House condemned Russia's awarding of the Order of Courage to two Su-27 pilots for allegedly colliding with a US MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea.

A declassified video released by US European Command appears to show the collision. Russia denies responsibility, attributing the crash to the drone's maneuvering and claiming the pilots prevented airspace violation.  While the US suggests the collision may have been unintentional but due to pilot incompetence, Russia asserts the incident demonstrates US direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict.  Disagreements exist regarding the date Shoigu awarded the medals.  The incident has raised concerns about potential escalation."}

Russia and China argued their mandate focused on economic issues.

While the IMF Managing Director suggested outright bans on cryptocurrencies if regulation fails, the US Treasury Secretary advocated for a strong regulatory framework.  The meeting highlighted the need for multilateral coordination to address the worsening debt crisis in countries like Ethiopia, Ghana, Sri Lanka, and Zambia.

While a state-level conviction wouldn't affect his presidential campaign, a president cannot pardon those convicted on state charges.  The indictment details numerous alleged attempts to pressure Georgia officials, including Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to alter the election results.  It also names Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman as co-defendants, and describes the involvement of several others, including alleged attempts to present false electors and compromise voting machines.  The indictment mentions 30 additional individuals involved in the conspiracy but does not charge them.  Mark Meadows, Trump's former chief of staff, is charged with attempting to gain unauthorized access to a Cobb County civic center and soliciting a public officer to violate their oath.
