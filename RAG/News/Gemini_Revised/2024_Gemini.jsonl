Zuckerberg anticipates needing 1-gigawatt data centers, a capacity requiring lengthy power plant construction, further hampered by government regulations and lengthy lead times for infrastructure projects.  The burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market adds to the competition for energy resources.  Ireland is already experiencing this strain, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers facing resource restrictions due to limited energy supply.  ChatGPT, when queried, highlighted the importance of a \"TPIF Framework\" – Technological advancements, Policy support, Infrastructure readiness, and Financial investment – for effectively addressing this challenge.
