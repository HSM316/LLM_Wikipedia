The five board members responsible for overseeing government services in the district will now be appointed directly by DeSantis. \n\nThe governor announced his appointments, which include Tampa attorney Martin Garcia as chair, Bridget Ziegler (wife of state Republican Party chairman Christian Ziegler), attorneys Brian Aungst and Mike Sasso, and Ron Peri, whose ministry has been described by The Guardian as promoting Christian nationalism. These appointments will require confirmation from the Florida Senate.\n\nDuring the bill signing event in Lake Buena Vista, DeSantis declared: \"Today the corporate kingdom finally comes to an end [...] There’s a new sheriff in town, and accountability will be the order of the day.\" \n\nThe new legislation also changes the district's name to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and strips it of the authority to approve the construction of a stadium, airport, or nuclear power plant.\n\nDeSantis and Disney have had conflicts, particularly over the company's opposition to the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, often referred to as the \"Don’t Say Gay\" law by critics, which prohibits teaching about gender identity and sexuality to students in kindergarten through third grade.\n\nEstablished in 1967, the special district granted the Walt Disney Company control over local services, including sewage, zoning, and fire prevention. Disney World is the largest employer in central Florida, with 75,000 workers, and attracted 36.2 million visitors in 2021, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, DeSantis is expected to run for the US presidency in the 2024 election."}
{"title": "European Commission, five EU members agree to permit members to ban domestic sale of some Ukrainian agricultural products", "content": "**Thursday, May 4, 2023** \n\nOn Friday, the European Commission (EC) finalized an agreement with EU member states Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia regarding imports of wheat, maize, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds from Ukraine. \n\nThe deal entails a compensation package of 100 million euros for farmers and permits these five nations to restrict Ukrainian products from entering their domestic markets while allowing the transit of goods through their territories. Additionally, the EU agreed to extend the one-year suspension of duties on Ukrainian products for another year, pending approval from the European Parliament and its members. \n\nValdis Dombrovskis, the EU's chief trade official, announced the agreement, stating, \"I'm pleased to inform you that we have reached a political consensus on Ukrainian agrifood imports within the EU. We have collaborated with the five neighboring EU member states and Ukraine to address this issue.\" \n\nEC President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that the deal aims to \"preserve both Ukraine's export capacity to continue feeding the world and support the livelihoods of our farmers.\"\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki remarked, \"We have successfully finalized agreements with the European Union concerning the ban on the import of these agricultural products, which primarily destabilized the Polish market.\"\n\nAfter the EU lifted tariffs amidst Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cheaper products flooded these countries' markets, leading to an oversupply. The intention behind lowering tariffs was to facilitate the movement of goods to targeted markets in the Middle East and Africa, as Black Sea ports remained contested.\n\nLogistical challenges hampered the re-export of Ukrainian goods, contributing to local price declines and triggering protests from farmers. On April 4, the EC introduced \"emergency support measures\" providing over 56 million euros to Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria, although this amount was only a fraction of the losses farmers faced.\n\nDespite this support, dissatisfaction grew among farmers, prompting Poland to announce a ban on imports from Ukraine on April 15. Hungary followed suit the same day, while Slovakia imposed its ban on April 17 and Bulgaria on April 19, allowing only those products en route to other nations through Bulgaria. Romania opted not to impose restrictions but sought \"preventative measures\" from the EU concerning Ukrainian imports. \n\nBulgaria’s Minister of Agriculture, Yavor Gechev, emphasized, \"Bulgaria is in solidarity with Ukraine, but a local glut is occurring in the agricultural market; instead of serving as export corridors, our countries are turning into warehouses.\" \n\nIn light of the bans, members – along with the EU – condemned these unilateral actions, citing the bloc's single market principles. Arianna Podestà of the EC remarked to CNN, \"It is crucial to note that trade policy falls under the EU's exclusive jurisdiction, and, accordingly, unilateral actions are unacceptable.\"\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna stated ahead of the deal, \"The flow of Ukrainian agro-exports is essential for the Ukrainian economy, which has been severely impacted by the ongoing Russian war. Therefore, extending the suspension of import duties, quotas, and trade defense measures on Ukrainian exports to the EU should be a shared priority.\""}

On the same day, the US conducted airstrikes against Syrian groups tied to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nA US official informed CNN on March 25 that two aerial attacks the previous day on Coalition forces at the Mission Support Site Conoco and Green Village caused injuries to one US soldier—who was reported to be in stable condition—and inflicted structural damage.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization, reported on March 25 that the US strikes resulted in the deaths of three Syrian government soldiers, along with 11 Syrian and five non-Syrian fighters aligned with the government.\n\nOn the same day, President Joe Biden emphasized, \"Make no mistake: the United States does not – does not – seek conflict with Iran. But be prepared for us to forcefully protect our people. That's exactly what happened last night. We're going to continue to keep up our efforts to counter terrorist threats in the region.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Syrian foreign ministry rejected the US assessment of the intended targets of the March 23 airstrikes and asserted that Syria would \"end the American occupation.\" Similarly, the Iranian foreign ministry accused the US of targeting \"civilian sites\" and condemned the strikes.\n\nThe US-led Operation Inherent Resolve in Syria has been ongoing since 2015, spanning multiple presidencies. In October of that year, the US helped establish the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it continues to support with training and weapons.\n\nAl Jazeera reported that following its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the US assured SDF leaders it would maintain its presence in Syria. Kino Gabriel, a former spokesperson for the SDF, stated, \"They [the Americans] were very clear that this is not the same as Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn August, the Syrian government demanded the immediate withdrawal of US troops, with its foreign ministry declaring, \"The American side must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its military forces that are present on the territory of Syria illegally, refrain from stealing and smuggling Syrian oil and wheat, and stop providing cover and protection for armed separatist and terrorist groups operating from the illegal American military base 'Al-Tanf.'\"\n\nOn March 8, the US House of Representatives voted 321–103 against a resolution calling for the withdrawal of approximately 900 US troops stationed in Syria, primarily in the south and east. The resolution, sponsored by Representative Matt Gaetz, noted, \"Congress has never authorized kinetic participation of U.S. Armed Forces in Syria.\" In contrast, Representative Gregory Meeks argued, \"This measure forces a premature end to our mission at a critical time for our efforts.\""}

Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto delivered the official accession documents to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels.\n\nThe accession was celebrated with the raising of the Finnish flag at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, while the NATO flag was hoisted in Helsinki. Finland's membership effectively doubled the length of NATO's borders with Russia, as the country shares a 1,340-kilometer (833-mile) border with its eastern neighbor.\n\n\"Until now, we have defended our country alone,\" stated Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen. \"From now on, we can rely on getting support should we face challenges. And of course, we stand ready to assist others in need.\"\n\nIn response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Finland's membership an \"encroachment on our security and national interests,\" adding that Russia would closely monitor NATO activities in Finland and take \"countermeasures.\"\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinistö expressed that \"Finland's membership is not directed against anyone and does not alter the principles or goals of our foreign and security policy\" in a statement following the transfer of accession documents.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg remarked, \"President Putin aimed to reduce NATO's presence through his invasion of Ukraine, but he is achieving the exact opposite. Finland is now a full member, and soon Sweden will follow.\"\n\nPublic support for NATO membership surged in Finland and Sweden after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, reaching approximately 80% in Finland. Both countries submitted their applications to join NATO on May 18. Membership requires approval from all existing NATO members.\n\nTurkey, under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, initially delayed the applications due to Finland and Sweden’s asylum grants to members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey designates as a terrorist entity. However, last week Turkey's Grand National Assembly voted to approve Finland's application.\n\nSweden still seeks approval from Hungary and Turkey before it can finalize its NATO membership. Hungary's objections stem from Sweden's criticism of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's government. Additionally, a Quran-burning protest organized by a far-right group in Sweden in January drew condemnation from Turkey.\n\nHistorically, Finland's ties with Russia have been complex. After losing the Finnish War to Sweden in 1809, Finland became a Grand Duchy within the tsarist Russian Empire until the Russian Civil War in 1917, when Finland declared independence. The Soviet Union invaded Finland in 1939, leading to the Winter War, which concluded in 1940 with territory ceded to the Soviets. Finland later allied with Germany during World War II before signing an armistice in 1944, resulting in further territorial losses. Under President Urho Kekkonen, Finland adopted a formal policy of neutrality in 1956."}

Dowden indicated that this program will begin \"later this year\" and will extend to various eligible buildings, including courts, schools, local councils, police stations, and fire stations, where he believes the portraits will be displayed with pride.\n\nIn an article for The Mail on Sunday, he stated, \"For decades, public buildings have quietly showcased images of the Queen, serving as a reminder of her unwavering commitment as our most steadfast public servant. Now, as a new reign begins, we are ensuring that schools, town halls, and other public buildings can continue this tradition by offering them a new portrait of the King, fully funded by the Government.\"\n\nWhile Dowden praised the £8 million initiative as \"a fitting tribute to our new sovereign,\" Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, criticized the effort as a \"shameful waste of money.\" He accused the government of having \"lost the plot,\" emphasizing, \"At a time when a majority of local councils are raising taxes and cutting public services, and when schools and hospitals are struggling, spending even £1 on this nonsense would be £1 too much.\"\n\nA Cabinet Office source revealed to the Daily Mail that the list of eligible institutions will be made public following the coronation of Charles and Queen Consort Camilla on May 6, as well as the release of their official portraits by Buckingham Palace. Smith called for the Cabinet Office to \"scrap this scheme and direct the money where it’s really needed.\"\n\nIn contrast, John Glen, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, stated, \"These new portraits continue a very British tradition to celebrate this momentous occasion [of the coronation].\" Although plans for the coronation ceremony include a shorter format, a source within the committee responsible for its planning told The Sun on February 19 that even a 'slimmed down coronation' could cost around £100 million, a cost expected to be offset by \"worldwide TV rights\" and increased tourism.

The Brazilian football legend, who was declared a \"national treasure\" by the Brazilian government in 1961, was 82 years old.\n\nPelé's official Instagram account shared the news, stating: \"Inspiration and love marked the journey of King Pelé, who peacefully passed away today... [he] enchanted the world with his genius in sport, halted a war, undertook social initiatives globally, and spread what he believed to be the ultimate solution to all our problems: love.\"\n\nBorn on October 23, 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Pelé grew up in poverty and worked as a shoeshiner. His nickname \"Pelé\" originated from his mispronunciation of \"Bilé,\" the name of a local footballer. At 15, he was recruited by Santos, a local football club, and quickly ascended to the adult team. By 16, he had joined the Brazilian national team.\n\nPelé was a reserve during the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, but during the final, he was brought onto the field. He scored a memorable goal, dribbling past defenders and shooting into the net, a moment now regarded as one of the greatest plays in football history. At just 17, he helped lead Brazil to victory.\n\nPelé suffered an injury during the 1962 World Cup in Chile but still claimed another title with his team. Brazil qualified for the 1966 Cup in England, where they were eliminated in the group stage. Despite being considered the world's top player, Pelé vowed never to return to the World Cup, which England won.\n\nHe made a triumphant return to the World Cup in 1970 in Mexico, where Brazil reached the final against Italy. Pelé scored the first goal in that match, securing his third World Cup victory.\n\nAfter retiring from Santos FC in 1972, Pelé turned down offers from European clubs and made a comeback in 1975 with the New York Cosmos in the North American Soccer League. Following a famous match in 1976 against Santos, where he played for both teams, Pelé announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nHis autobiography, \"My Life and the Beautiful Game,\" published in 1977, popularized the nickname for the sport, which the Associated Press acknowledged.\n\nPelé had been hospitalized for over a month at Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo while being treated for colon cancer, first diagnosed in 2021. The hospital attributed his multiple organ failure to complications from the cancer.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his death, current Brazilian footballer Neymar posted on Instagram, \"Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art and entertainment... Football and Brazil both reached new heights thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”\n\nFrench footballer Kylian Mbappé tweeted, \"The king of football has left us, but his legacy will never be forgotten...

The agreement with Nware would also encompass titles owned by Activision should the acquisition proceed.\n\nReuters characterized the Microsoft-Nware partnership as an effort to alleviate concerns that the Activision acquisition would negatively impact competition. Microsoft has previously secured deals with other companies, including Nvidia and Boosteroid, allowing them to stream both Activision and Microsoft titles. Both Nvidia and Boosteroid criticized the CMA's decision, with Nvidia expressing hopes for a favorable resolution for cloud gaming.\n\nIn response to these agreements, the CMA stated that \"implementing the ineffective remedy would have replaced market forces with ongoing regulatory obligations overseen by the CMA, when competitive forces in a free market are much better placed to achieve the right outcome.\" They described such remedies as \"behavioral,\" aiming to regulate the behavior of businesses contrary to their commercial interests. The CMA noted that Microsoft's proposals did not adequately accommodate different cloud gaming service models, particularly multigame subscription services, nor were they sufficiently open to other operating systems beyond Windows.\n\nMicrosoft has announced plans to challenge the CMA's ruling, with Activision pledging to \"work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal.\" Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit to block the Activision purchase.

Gershkovich was arrested by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in Yekaterinburg, in the Ural Federal District, facing charges that carry a potential penalty of up to twenty years in prison.\n\nThis marks the first time a US journalist has been detained for espionage since the Cold War, which concluded with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response to his arrest, WSJ released a statement strongly denying the FSB's allegations and calling for the immediate release of Gershkovich, expressing solidarity with him and his family.\n\nThe FSB confirmed that Gershkovich held valid press accreditation but accused him of attempting to acquire confidential information regarding the operations of a Russian military-industrial complex enterprise. Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that he engaged in \"activities that have nothing to do with journalism.\" Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov emphasized, \"It is not about suspicion; it is about the fact that he was caught red-handed.\"\n\nFluent in Russian, Gershkovich has spent his entire career reporting on the former Soviet Union, including tenures with The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse, and The New York Times.

These sanctions followed a meeting between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US lawmakers, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, at the Reagan Library in California on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ministry prohibited Chinese entities from engaging with the US organizations, stating, \"The Hudson Institute and the Reagan Library have provided a platform and facilitated Tsai's separatist activities, which seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" Similar sanctions were applied to the Taiwanese Prospect Foundation and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats.\n\nThe Ministry also announced that the directors of the Taiwanese organizations, former Reagan Library executive director John Heubusch, and the library's chief administrator Joanne M. Drake, along with Taiwan's representative to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, are banned from entering China and any assets they might have in the country will be frozen.\n\nHudson Institute President John P.

[…] To quickly oversee this technology on national security grounds, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list, which will be published before the summer.\"\n\nThe specific products affected have been identified \"with surgical precision\" to minimize disruption to value chains and ensure an equitable international playing field. \n\nThis announcement follows three months of negotiations with the United States, which implemented extensive export restrictions in October to limit Chinese firms' access to foreign chips and manufacturing tools due to concerns about military applications. US officials acknowledged that the effectiveness of these measures would be diminished without international cooperation. The Associated Press reported in January that Dutch and Japanese officials reached an agreement on similar restrictions during discussions in Washington, D.C., which included separate meetings that month between US President Joe Biden and the prime ministers of both countries.\n\nIn November, Schreinemacher remarked to reporters in Brussels that the Dutch government was in discussions with the US, emphasizing their alignment on security concerns regarding China and reiterating that Dutch national security interests are paramount. \n\nWhile she did not comment on the potential for similar restrictions, the minister acknowledged the observed adverse effects of US export controls on Dutch companies as being justified by national security interests.\n\nASML Holding, based in Veldhoven, North Brabant, and Europe's largest technology company, is a key player in producing laser lithography systems essential for computer chips. The company operates offices in Beijing and Shenzhen, with a regional headquarters in Hong Kong, and reported that about 16% of its 2021 sales, exceeding €2 billion, were to China.\n\nAmong the products ASML sells are advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems, which are highlighted in Schreinemacher's letter as \"very specific technologies in the semiconductor production cycle on which the Netherlands has a unique and leading position.\" ASML's website states that the company will need to obtain export licenses for the shipment of its most advanced immersion DUV systems. However, it clarifies that not all immersion lithography tools are impacted and based on \"our expectation of the Dutch government’s licensing policy, and the current market situation, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on\" either its 2023 or long-term financial outlooks.\n\nThis follows a November 11 assurance from CEO Peter Wennink that a scenario where Chinese chipmakers are unable to expand their capacity may result in a \"temporary hiccup,\" but would not significantly alter the long-term market landscape because \"ultimately those chips need to be made.\" ASML estimates near-zero growth in sales to China for 2023, predicting approximately €2.2 billion, while overall sales are expected to grow by 25%.\n\nKey concerns remain, including whether ASML will be permitted to service DUV machines already sold and the specifics of the restrictions. While Schreinemacher's letter refers to \"the most advanced [DUV] immersion lithography and deposition,\" it does not specifically mention ASML, which interprets \"most advanced\" to refer to its 'critical immersion' systems.\n\nCurrent restrictions have prevented ASML from supplying China with its most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography systems since 2019, of which it is the sole global producer. These limitations were imposed following US fears regarding their potential dual-use for military purposes.\n\nChina has condemned these restrictions as detrimental to regular trade relations, with its Ministry of Commerce stating that the US \"should stop the wrongdoings immediately and provide fair treatment to companies from all around the world, including Chinese firms.\" \n\nDespite the ongoing tensions, a US State Department spokesperson told CNBC that while \"China is pursuing asymmetric decoupling,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated, \"we do not want to sever China’s economy from ours.\" \n\nSources cited by Reuters anticipate that Japan will update its export policies as soon as this week."}

Despite leading a Republican Party that secured a narrow majority in the midterm elections, about twenty conservative members consistently opposed McCarthy’s leadership.\n\nTo resolve the stalemate, McCarthy made substantial compromises, including lowering the number of votes required to initiate a 'motion to vacate', or vote of no confidence, to just one.\n\nUltimately, fourteen Republican holdouts either switched their votes to support McCarthy or chose to vote 'present' to abstain on the twelfth ballot, with one additional member, Andy Harris, switching on the thirteenth.\n\nA chaotic episode unfolded after McCarthy’s defeat on the fourteenth ballot by a narrow margin, contradicting his earlier predictions of victory. The scene escalated when his ally, Mike Rogers of Alabama, had to be restrained from confronting Florida's Matt Gaetz. Notably, this moment occurred on January 6, exactly two years after the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nOn the decisive fifteenth ballot, Gaetz changed his vote to 'present', leading to a tally of 216 Republicans voting for McCarthy, six voting 'present', and all 212 Democrats supporting their leader, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nFollowing the vote, Republicans erupted into chants of \"USA!

According to reports from the BBC and Sky News, the Conservatives lost over 1,000 councillors compared to 2019, while the PA news agency noted that accounting for those who left the party between elections, the loss totaled 960 councillors. Labour gained 635 seats, while the Liberal Democrats flipped 416 and the Green Party gained 200. \n\nThough the Conservatives gained control of two authorities, they lost 45 overall.

Once inside, the mob vandalized furniture and erected barricades to hinder law enforcement from entering. \n\nNeither chamber of Congress was in session, and Lula was in São Paulo state at the time; however, some staff members were present at the presidential palace and awaited aerial evacuation, according to CNN Brazil. \n\nJustice Minister Flávio Dino condemned the acts on Twitter, stating: \"This absurd attempt to impose their will by force will not prevail. The government of the Federal District [Brasília] has ensured there will be reinforcements.\" He also confirmed he was at the ministry's headquarters. \n\nSenate President Rodrigo Pacheco noted he was in 'permanent contact' with the Governor of the Federal District, Ibaneis Rocha, who is \"concentrating the efforts of the entire police apparatus in order to control the situation.\" \n\nWorld leaders have condemned the violence and offered their support to Lula. Spain's Pedro Sánchez expressed his \"full support to President Lula and to the institutions that were freely and democratically chosen by the Brazilian people,\" while Chile's Gabriel Boric labeled the events a \"cowardly and vile attack on democracy.\" Colombia's Gustavo Petro remarked, \"Fascism decides to conduct a coup.\" \n\nLula defeated army captain Bolsonaro in a contentious election on October 30, the results of which many protesters dispute, claiming they were fraudulent. One protester, identified as Lima, told Agence France-Presse: \"We need to re-establish order after this fraudulent election.\" Bolsonaro had previously made unfounded allegations about the electronic voting system and did not formally concede defeat. \n\nOn the eve of Lula's inauguration on January 1, Bolsonaro left Brazil for Florida, where he remains; he is a staunch ally of Donald Trump. His supporters had previously camped outside military barracks to rally support for a potential military coup. On December 13, protests escalated as demonstrators attempted to storm police headquarters, setting buses and cars on fire. The Associated Press suggested that Congress and the Supreme Court may have been less secure on a Sunday, making them more vulnerable to attack. \n\nThe January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol saw supporters of Donald Trump attempt to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's election victory. In August, Thomas Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil under Barack Obama, remarked to The Guardian that Bolsonaro's team had closely studied the January 6 incident to understand why an incumbent president failed to overturn election results."}

In the first ballot on Tuesday, all 212 House Democrats voted for their leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, while 203 House Republicans supported their leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy. Additionally, 19 Republicans cast their votes for other candidates. As no candidate achieved the required 218-vote majority, the House moved to a second ballot for the first time since 1923.\n\nThe second ballot reflected the same totals for Jeffries and McCarthy, but the 19 Republicans who opposed McCarthy voted as a bloc for Representative Jim Jordan, despite his withdrawal from the race and endorsement of McCarthy.

The resolution was introduced by Republican Representative Matt Gaetz on February 21. \n\nGaetz expressed, \"I do not believe what stands between a caliphate and not a caliphate are the 900 Americans who have been sent to this hellscape with no definition of victory.\" The Associated Press reported that a US operation in Syria just four days prior resulted in the wounding of four US servicemembers and the elimination of a senior Islamic State leader. \n\nOn his congressional website, Gaetz contended, \"Congress has never authorized kinetic participation of U.S. Armed Forces in Syria.\" \n\nOpposing the resolution, Representative Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, warned that withdrawing forces might lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State. \"The withdrawal of this legal, authorized US troop deployment must be based on the total defeat of ISIS,\" he added. \n\nRepresentative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, remarked, \"This measure forces a premature end to our mission at a critical time for our efforts,\" though he also voiced concerns regarding an indefinite US presence in Syria.\n\nSince September 2014, the US has conducted military operations in Syria against the Islamic State as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. These operations have been justified under the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001 (AUMF) and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution. The 2001 AUMF, the longest actively used AUMF in US history, was initially passed to authorize military action in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, while the 2002 AUMF first authorized the Iraq War.\n\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report, congressional efforts to establish a new authorization for anti-Islamic State operations began in late 2014. On June 17, 2021, the House passed H.R.256, which aimed to repeal the 2002 AUMF.

Additionally, the company plans to extend its services across the entire San Francisco peninsula in California.\n\nChief Product Officer Saswat Panigrahi expressed confidence in the service, stating, \"We are feeling tremendous wind at our backs.\" He revealed that Waymo is currently facilitating 10,000 fully autonomous rides for public passengers each week, with expectations to grow that number to 100,000 by next summer. \"I want to clarify that these are external riders; this does not include rides provided to our own employees,\" Panigrahi added.\n\nPanigrahi described the Phoenix area as the \"largest contiguous AV area in the world,\" with Waymo set to extend its operations to a 180-square mile (466 square kilometer) region that includes the resort town of Scottsdale, complementing its existing coverage of Phoenix and the East Valley’s Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe.\n\nIn San Francisco, Waymo plans to offer rides for free, 24/7, except in neighborhoods like Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach, which will only accommodate staff and select volunteers known as Trusted Testers. The company has requested permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to institute fees in San Francisco, which, if approved, would make it the first city to host robotaxi services from two companies, as General Motors-owned Cruise has been charging for rides in certain areas since June.\n\nHowever, Waymo One vehicles have faced challenges in San Francisco, with the Associated Press reporting instances like sudden stops on streets—one incident involved five robotaxis halting simultaneously due to fog and obstructed traffic.

He noted, \"I accept that she suffered many traumatic and horrific experiences over the years.\"\n\nMusa arrived in Australia as a refugee in 2004, having lost many family members to war and poverty.

However, the jury did not find Trump liable for rape.\n\nTrump responded to the verdict on his Truth Social app, calling it \"A DISGRACE,\" and indicated his intention to appeal during an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nWhile visiting his properties in Scotland and Ireland, Trump claimed he would participate in the trial's final stages but did not accept the judge's offer to submit a motion by May 7 to reopen the case and testify.\n\nIn his now-public video deposition, Trump stated he had \"absolutely no idea who this woman [Carroll] is,\" and described her as \"not my type.\" Furthermore, he mistakenly identified her as his second wife, Marla Maples, when shown a group photo including both women.\n\nTrump reiterated remarks from the Access Hollywood tape, suggesting he could grab women by their genitals because he was \"a star,\" later adding, \"Unfortunately or fortunately.\"\n\nCarroll, a former advice columnist for Elle, testified for three days. When defense attorney Joe Tacopina inquired why she did not scream during the alleged assault, she responded: \"One of the reasons women don't come forward is because they're always asked, 'Why didn't you scream?' Some women scream. Some women don't. It keeps women silent.\" \n\nTacopina also questioned Carroll about why she did not file a police report in spring 1996; she explained that she felt too \"ashamed.\" She shared: \"I was born in 1943.

Griffith indicated that the initial application of a digital pound is expected to be for settling wholesale financial transactions; however, he suggested that existing private, fiat-backed stablecoins could fulfill this role in the meantime due to public policy considerations. \n\n\"I would rather be right than be first,\" he stated, stressing the importance of addressing public policy issues accurately. Griffith hopes that the first regulatory framework for crypto assets in the UK will be incorporated into the Financial Services and Markets Bill currently under discussion in the House of Lords. He noted that adopting \"potentially disruptive game-changing technology\" could greatly benefit the UK's fintech and financial sectors.\n\nGlobally, central banks are actively exploring digital currencies, with China piloting a digital yuan in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The European Union (EU) is also set to release draft legislation later this year to establish and regulate a digital euro. The European Central Bank is expected to conclude its two-year investigation into a digital euro in July, leading to three years of implementation.\n\nConsumer protection has become a key concern during the challenging period for cryptocurrencies, which has seen a decline in Bitcoin's value and the collapse of the major exchange FTX. The EU has introduced comprehensive regulations for crypto markets, set to take effect in 2024.

The occurrence of 'most extreme' events (among the 30 wettest or driest) rose from three to four per year during 2015 to 2021.\n\nThe study reported an increase in the wet-to-dry event ratio from 15° S to 20° N, while noting a decrease in three regions between 15° N and 50° N, supporting the hypothesis that extreme events inversely affect wet and dry areas. The most intense drought recorded was the South American drought from 2015 to 2016, while significant flooding persisted in sub-Saharan Africa from 2002 to 2021, peaking with Lake Victoria reaching its highest levels in 2020.\n\nRodell expressed surprise at the strong correlation between global intensity and temperatures, stating to the Associated Press, \"I was surprised to see how well correlated the global intensity was with global mean temperatures.\" He elaborated to CNN, acknowledging a significant connection between the overall intensity of these events and temperature records during the warmest years.\n\nAddressing the study's implications, Rodell emphasized that as the world warms, the intensity and frequency of wet and dry events are likely to increase. “The study underscores the pervasive impact of climate change,” he noted, highlighting that rising temperatures lead to more severe weather events affecting people globally.\n\nClimate specialist Richard Seager from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory warned that future water resource and flood management strategies should anticipate that both wet extremes will become wetter and dry extremes drier, emphasizing that human-driven warming amplifies climate extremes.\n\nPark Williams, a bioclimatologist at UCLA, remarked on the significance of using satellite monitoring to understand continental water patterns, indicating that this research will be pivotal for future generations seeking to grasp humanity's evolving understanding of the Earth's systems.\n\nCNN also quoted climatologist Kim Cobb, Director of the Brown University Institute for Environment and Society, who described the study as providing a \"new lens\" on the changing water cycle, linking various incidents of droughts, floods, and wildfires to the global analysis. She stated that the findings bolster existing trends seen in rainfall data and climate model outputs, offering crucial evidence for emergency planning, infrastructure development, agricultural practices, and water resource management amid ongoing global warming.\n\nRodell has served as Acting Deputy Director of Earth Sciences for Hydrosphere, Biosphere, and Geophysics at Goddard since 2021, while Li has been an assistant research scientist at Goddard and the University of Maryland since 2017.\n\nThe United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2021 a 70% increase in the frequency of droughts that typically occur every decade, along with a 30% rise in flooding events. Furthermore, scientists warn that global warming could heighten instances of 'weather whiplash', characterized by rapid shifts between extreme weather conditions, as seen recently in California, which has suffered both a megadrought and severe rainstorms.\n\nAccording to the National Integrated Drought Information System, droughts and floods account for approximately 20% of annual extreme weather-related economic losses in the United States."}

The Department revoked leases covering 68,000 acres (275 square kilometers) within the Bear Tooth Unit in the northeast NPR–A, while granting three out of ConocoPhillips' requested five drilling sites.\n\nAccording to the Department's record of decision, the approved plan \"requires the fewest ice roads, fewest total miles of infield pipelines, least water use, fewest vehicle trips, fewest fixed-wing aircraft trips, fewest helicopter trips, and fewest acres of screeding.\" U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, expressed her relief on Twitter the same day, stating: \"I'm so relieved that an economically viable Willow Project is being reapproved. What a huge and needed victory for all Alaska.\"\n\nA January Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) outlined the project's potential environmental impacts, estimating it would destroy approximately 532 acres (2 km²) of wetlands, consume around 1.5 billion gallons (5.7 billion liters) of freshwater, and emit approximately 613 trillion pounds (278,036 metric megatons) of gross carbon dioxide equivalent over its planned 30-year duration.\n\nThe development of the project's master plan began in 2018, with the BLM releasing its Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on August 15, 2020. At that time, Audubon Alaska and several indigenous and conservation organizations criticized the process, claiming the Trump Administration was rushing to accommodate ConocoPhillips' timeline without adequately considering local community input.\n\nThe Department of the Interior issued a Record of Decision on October 26, 2020, authorizing up to three drill sites along with supporting infrastructure, including processing and support facilities, gravel access roads, and pipelines. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt noted that this decision would help sustain oil flow through the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline for decades while also providing federal and state revenue and assistance to affected native communities.\n\nHowever, on February 13, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit temporarily blocked ConocoPhillips from commencing construction activities related to the Willow project. The following August, a U.S. District Court in Anchorage overturned the August 2020 EIS, stating it failed to analyze foreign greenhouse gas emissions, overlooked alternative proposals, and did not adequately address the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act's mandate to prioritize \"maximum protection\" for surface values in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA).\n\nIn January 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order pausing \"new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters,\" fulfilling a campaign promise. U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty subsequently issued a preliminary injunction against this pause, making it permanent last August and asserting that the administration lacked the authority to halt lease sales.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 mandated the U.S. Department of the Interior to lease the lesser of 60 million acres (240,000 km²) offshore and 2 million acres (8,100 km²) of federal lands annually for oil and gas development, along with any amount requested by industry. The Willow project received backing from various Alaska Native organizations and all three members of Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, who emphasized its economic significance for local communities. Senator Dan Sullivan, also an Alaska Republican, described it as \"one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state's history.\" On February 20, the Alaska House of Representatives unanimously passed House Joint Resolution 6, expressing support for the project.\n\nNevertheless, Sierra Club Senior Campaign Representative Mike Scott condemned the project, stating: \"The Willow project would have a devastating effect on public lands and our climate. Approving it after passing the largest climate bill in history would be a giant step in reverse.\""}

This marked the conclusion of the first corporate manslaughter trial in French history. Judge Sylvie Daunis acknowledged that Airbus had demonstrated negligence on four occasions and Air France on one, but emphasized that \"a probable causal link isn't sufficient to characterize an offense.\" She reaffirmed the corporations' civil liability, noting that Air France had previously compensated families of the victims and scheduled a hearing for additional civil damages on September 4.\n\nIf convicted, both companies faced potential fines of up to €225,000 each. Air France-KLM reported revenue of €7.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, while Airbus reported €20.64 billion for the same period. Additionally, Reuters reported that the parties had reached undisclosed settlements.\n\nClaire Durousseau, whose niece was among the 216 passengers from 33 countries aboard AF447, expressed her devastation following the verdict, stating, \"Our lost ones have died a second time. I feel sick.\" Danièle Lamy, president of the victims' families association Entraide et Solidarité AF447, described the families as \"mortified and overwhelmed\" after enduring over a decade of \"chaotic\" legal disputes, including the nine-week trial last year. \"The loser first and foremost is French justice,\" she remarked.\n\nAttorney Alain Jakubowicz, representing the families, stated, \"We're told Air France and Airbus are responsible, but not guilty. We were waiting for the word 'guilty'.\" Both defendants expressed their sympathy towards the families and reiterated their commitment to enhancing safety.\n\nThe plaintiffs, consisting of victims' family members, contended that the prosecution's arguments for acquittal were based on a lack of evidence linking corporate liability to the crash, noting that the pilots were ultimately responsible. Air France asserted that the exact causes of the accident may never be known.\n\nJudge Daunis found Airbus negligent for failing to replace the model of pitot tubes—airspeed sensors with a history of issues—and for not appropriately analyzing incident reports to identify problems with the sensors. She indicated that the cockpit display did not adequately inform pilots of issues compared to the information provided to air traffic controllers. Investigators relied on encoded alerts to determine the crash's causes before finding the main wreckage in 2011.\n\nThe judge also determined that Air France acted negligently by not informing pilots about prior problems with the pitot tubes. AF447, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, disappeared into the Atlantic Ocean on May 31, 2009. The main wreckage was located by robotic submarines from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on April 3, 2011, and the aircraft's cockpit voice recorders were retrieved in May.\n\nInvestigators from the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) concluded that ice had accumulated on the pitot tubes, disabling the aircraft’s autopilot and autothrottle, leading to a stall that generated warnings which the pilots ignored—an explanation with which Airbus concurred. Air France, the National Airline Pilots Union, and Entraide et Solidarité AF447 criticized the BEA for allegedly focusing its investigation on the airline rather than probing Airbus. According to Euronews, the AF447 crash led to new regulations concerning sensor testing and pilot training."}

Haley, who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is set to challenge her former boss, Donald Trump, the prior president. Other potential contenders include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, U.S. Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, former Vice President Mike Pence, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to Politico. In hypothetical opinion polls, Haley has struggled to keep pace with Trump and DeSantis.\n\nIn her announcement video titled \"Strong & Proud,\" Haley stated, \"Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections. That has to change.\" She criticized President Joe Biden's record, asserting, \"The Washington, D.C. establishment has failed us over and over again. [...] It's time for a new generation of leadership [...] I'm Nikki Haley, and I'm running for president.\"\n\nThe following day, Haley held her inaugural rally in Charleston, South Carolina. According to Politico, the event was more understated compared to Trump's usual energetic rallies.\n\nTaylor Budowich, spokesperson for Trump’s super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., labeled Haley as \"just another career politician,\" noting that she initially opposed Trump before resigning to serve in his administration. \"Now, she's telling us she represents a 'new generation'. Sure just looks like more of the same, a career politician whose only fulfilled commitment is to herself,\" Budowich remarked.\n\nAt 51, Haley contrasted her age with Biden, who is 80, and Trump, who is 76, calling for \"mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years\" and urging a move away from \"the stale ideas and faded names of the past.\" She emphasized, \"America is not past our prime [...] It’s just that our politicians are past theirs.\"\n\nBorn Nimrata Nikki Randhawa to Sikh immigrants from India in Bamberg, South Carolina, Haley reflected on her heritage in her announcement video, saying, \"I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants: not Black, not white. I was different.\" If nominated, she would become the first female and first non-white Republican presidential nominee, and if elected, the first female president and the first president of Indian descent in the U.S.\n\nHaley began her political career in 2004, winning her first race against a senior South Carolina state representative. She became the first non-white female governor of a U.S. state in 2010 at the age of 38, won reelection in 2014, and delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s 2016 State of the Union address.\n\nIn 2015, following a racially motivated shooting in Charleston, Haley attended the victims' funerals and successfully advocated for the removal of a Confederate flag from the state capitol. She criticized Trump's refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan during his 2016 campaign but later expressed her support for him after his election. \n\nTrump appointed Haley as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2017. During her time in office, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council, citing their anti-Israel stance. Haley resigned in late 2018, with both she and the Trump administration offering no explanation for her departure, although Trump stated that it had been planned six months prior amid a public disagreement over sanctions on Russia."}

The nationalist party secured 144 of the 462 contested seats, a significant increase from 105 in the 2019 local elections, and it surpassed the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which maintained its 122 seats from 2019. The Alliance Party finished third, increasing its representation from 53 to 67 seats. The Ulster Unionist Party gained 54 seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party won 39 seats, with the remaining 36 seats shared among independents and other parties. A total of 807 candidates competed in the elections.\n\nSinn Féin clinched the most seats in six local councils, whereas the DUP remained the largest party in the other five. Northern Ireland councils are responsible for setting tax rates, planning development, and providing essential services such as waste disposal and public park maintenance.\n\nAccording to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the largest nationalist and unionist parties must jointly form a government in semi-autonomous Northern Ireland. However, the government has been in limbo since DUP First Minister Paul Givan resigned in February 2022, refusing to participate thereafter. Givan resigned in opposition to checks imposed by the Northern Ireland Protocol on goods flowing from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland, while the border with EU member Ireland remained unmonitored. In February, the UK and EU introduced the Windsor Framework to alleviate these trade checks, but the DUP rejected the proposal.\n\nIn the May 2022 elections for the Belfast-based Northern Ireland Assembly, Sinn Féin made history by overtaking the DUP to become the largest party for the first time. \n\nSinn Féin's vice president, Michelle O'Neill, stated that the election represented a chance to convey a clear message in support of effective leadership and to push for the reestablishment of the Assembly. She urged joint efforts from the UK and Ireland to resolve the ongoing political stalemate.\n\nDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson emphasized that they are seeking a mandate to negotiate amendments to the trade regulations, asserting, \"This is about ensuring that Northern Ireland's ability to trade with the rest of the United Kingdom is respected and legally protected, restoring our place in the union.\""}

In a Statement of Administration Policy, Biden remarked that the bill, S. 316, would have \"no impact\" on current military operations, as none \"rely primarily on the 2002 AUMF.\"\n\nTruthout anticipates that the Senate will vote on S. 316 within the next week. If passed, the bill would eliminate the use of the 2002 AUMF as a legal basis for military actions both in and outside Iraq, which Truthout described as a \"symbolic end\" to US military involvement in the region. The 1991 and 2002 AUMFs initially authorized the Gulf and Iraq Wars, respectively, and multiple US presidents have since invoked the 2002 AUMF to justify military operations in Syria.\n\nOn June 17, 2021, the House of Representatives approved a repeal of the 2002 AUMF, but the bill did not advance in the Senate. Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks criticized the ongoing reliance on it, stating, \"Repeal is crucial because the executive branch has a history of stretching the 2002 AUMF's legal authority.\" A resolution seeking to withdraw all US troops from Syria failed to pass the House on March 8.\n\nSenate Bill S. 316 was introduced on February 9, has 45 cosponsors, and received approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a 13–8 vote on March 8.

This initiative is part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to address the nation’s backlog of 92,000 asylum claims by the end of the year.\n\nWhile standard security, criminal, and health checks will still be conducted, the face-to-face interview requirement will be eliminated to \"streamline\" processing for these five nationalities, which have a claim acceptance rate exceeding 95%. The questionnaires range from 10 to 32 pages and include 40 to 50 questions. They must be completed in English, with the government advising the use of \"online translation tools\" if necessary, and returned within twenty working days. According to a leaked internal letter reviewed by Sky News, failure to return the questionnaire without a reasonable explanation may lead to the withdrawal of the asylum claim, though the government will issue a reminder after the deadline and consider extensions.\n\nOfficials indicated to BBC News that all claims will be assessed on their merits, and the i reported that no one will be denied solely based on the questionnaire responses. A similar fast-track system for 3,000 Afghan refugees, supported by the British Red Cross in September 2021, was reportedly rejected by Prime Minister Boris Johnson over concerns it could be seen as amnesty, an assertion the Home Office disputes, along with worries it could strain welfare and housing resources.\n\nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her party's support for such measures \"for months,\" criticizing the Home Office for not implementing this approach sooner, especially for safe countries like Albania, after the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recommended it two years ago. She stated, \"Labour has a common-sense plan to fast-track cases, establish return agreements for unsuccessful claims, and take stronger action against criminal gangs involved in dangerous small boat crossings.\"\n\nFigures released today show that a record 45,756 migrants crossed the Channel last year, pushing outstanding asylum claims to over 150,000, also a record. Sunak has prioritized migration issues, with new laws expected next month that ban illegal migrants from claiming asylum in the UK. The Home Office letter indicated that the use of questionnaires might expand to include other claimants awaiting asylum decisions in the future, though no current plans for such an expansion exist.\n\nOn Wednesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman commented on GB News that the current situation regarding illegal arrivals is \"unsustainable\" and burdensome on local communities. However, the introduction of questionnaires has drawn criticism for potentially easing the process for some asylum seekers and imposing challenges for those who may not speak English or lack access to assistance or legal counsel.\n\nThe Guardian highlighted some complicated questions in the forms with intricate language, such as: \"Were you subject to human trafficking or modern slavery during your journey to or after your arrival in the UK?\" Critics like immigration barrister Colin Yeo and Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants campaigner Caitlin Boswell have voiced concerns. Boswell noted, \"People fleeing desperate circumstances need quicker and fairer asylum decisions, but this government’s approach is clumsy and could jeopardize their safety. No one’s right to refuge should be at risk because they struggled to complete a lengthy form in a language they do not understand.\"\n\nFollowing the leak, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon told Sky News that any changes to the process \"must be well thought out.\" He welcomed efforts to reduce the backlog but argued against creating more bureaucratic hurdles and threats to withdraw applications. \"It is not fair or reasonable to expect people who have lived in uncertainty for months or years to complete a lengthy form in English within a few weeks, especially when they lack legal support and English proficiency.\"\n\nDuring Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Sunak defended the government's approach while promising a forthcoming \"formal update\" from Braverman, stating, \"The Home Secretary and I are working diligently to advance this legislation.

If that’s considered bravery, then their criteria differ significantly. It’s absurd and offensive. We can't determine if the pilot intended to ram the drone, but the video evidence is quite clear.”\n\nOn March 14, the United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) reported that the incident took place at 07:03 CET (06:03 UTC) over international waters, identifying the Russian aircraft involved as Sukhoi Su-27s. \n\nU.S. Air Force General James B. Hecker, commander of USAFE-AFAFRICA, stated: “Before the collision, the Su-27s engaged in reckless and environmentally damaging behavior by dumping fuel and flying directly in front of the MQ-9.”\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, commenting on the incident on MSNBC on March 15, suggested, “Our best assessment is that the crash was likely unintentional and might stem from significant incompetence on the part of the Russian pilot.”\n\nThe following day, the United States European Command (EUCOM) declassified a 42-second video clip from the incident, which showed two passes made over the drone. After the second pass, which EUCOM claims resulted in a collision, the footage cuts out briefly before returning to reveal damage to the drone's propeller. The MQ-9's operators intentionally crashed the drone into the sea, citing the damaged propeller as the cause.\n\nRussia has denied responsibility for bringing down the drone or that a Russian jet made contact, asserting that the drone's \"sharp maneuvering\" caused its crash. Samir Puri, a visiting lecturer in war studies at King's College London, informed Al Jazeera that while the video does not establish intent, it is likely that Russian pilots operate aggressively to display their dominance over the skies, suggesting that Americans cannot conduct intelligence flights unchallenged.\n\nNikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Security Council of Russia, asserted, “The Americans consistently claim they are not involved in military operations. This incident is further evidence of their direct involvement in these activities— in the war.”\n\nThe Guardian speculated that the incident could escalate tensions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There was some confusion in media reports regarding when Shoigu presented the awards, with CNN and Insider stating it occurred on March 17, while Sputnik and The Hill reported that it happened on Wednesday.\n\nShoigu's Ministry of Defense claimed the pilots “prevented the violation of airspace boundaries established for the special military operation by the American MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle.”"}

The ship, a Japanese merchant vessel, was transporting prisoners of war (POWs) when it was torpedoed by the United States Navy in 1942 during World War II, resulting in the deaths of 1,080 individuals.\n\nThe wreckage was discovered at a depth of over 4,000 meters (13,123 ft) northwest of Luzon, Philippines, surpassing the depth of the RMS Titanic wreck. The Silentworld team, in collaboration with deep-sea specialists from Dutch company Fugro and supported by the Department of Defence, conducted a twelve-day search around Luzon utilizing an unmanned underwater vehicle equipped with sonar technology.\n\nOn July 1, 1942, POWs captured in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, were being transported aboard the Montevideo Maru to Hainan, which was under Japanese occupation. The POWs included civilians and military personnel from fourteen countries, with 864 being Australian Army troops. The Montevideo Maru was not marked as carrying POWs, leading a United States Navy submarine to fire torpedoes at the ship, resulting in its sinking.\n\nThe Silentworld Foundation noted that no plans were in place to recover human remains from the Montevideo Maru; however, they are considering commemorative events for July 1, the anniversary of the sinking. \n\n\"This brings to an end one of the most tragic chapters in Australia's maritime history,\" Marles stated. \"[Knowing] the location of this wreck provides comfort and relief to so many Australian families.\"\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese remarked, \"The extraordinary effort behind this discovery speaks to the enduring truth of Australia's solemn national promise to always remember and honor those who served our country.\"\n\nLieutenant General Simon Stuart added, \"I want to thank the Silentworld team and the dedicated researchers, including the Unrecovered War Casualties team at Army, who have never given up hope of finding the final resting place of the Montevideo Maru. A loss like this resonates through the decades and reminds us all of the human cost of conflict. Lest we forget.\""}

Hurtado emphasized that \"most of the victims were killed or injured by snipers reportedly shooting randomly at people in their homes or on the streets.\"\n\nHurtado also highlighted the alarming trend of armed gangs forcibly recruiting children, linking this to the loss of protection due to school closures. She noted that half of the population is facing food insecurity as food prices soar, with over 160,000 Haitians living in precarious conditions, a quarter of whom are in makeshift shelters with limited access to sanitation.\n\nThe call for a support force has gained international traction since Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry first requested assistance in October, according to The Guardian, amidst a backdrop of past failed foreign interventions in Haiti. The report indicated that the U.S. has approached Brazil to lead such a force. Brazil previously co-led a peacekeeping mission in Haiti from 2004 to 2017; Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira commented earlier this year, \"I think we need to seek other solutions – I don’t know if sending troops or a peacekeeping operation is the solution.\"\n\nAs reported by Agence France-Presse (AFP), a political and economic crisis has been escalating in Haiti since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, which ignited infighting among politicians. The AFP also noted school closures due to the perilous environment, which has seen students, teachers, and parents caught in crossfire and targeted for kidnappings.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres advocated for the establishment of a \"rapid action force\" to support the Haitian police in 2022.

The NPS typically restricts access to parts of the park when the Merced River is expected to exceed 10 feet (3 m) above normal, as this is when roads and other vital infrastructure may begin to flood.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasted temperatures this weekend to be 10°F (5.5°C) to 12°F (6.5°C) above average, which is expected to accelerate snowmelt. This winter's snowpack has reached a record high, estimated at 240% above average. \"I've been in Yosemite for 27 years, and I've never seen this much snow,\" Gediman remarked, noting that some areas received as much as 15 feet (5 m) of snow in February."}

In fact, I'm exhausted.\" He added, \"It has been an honour and privilege to serve the people of the state in my community over this time. It is way beyond what I could ever have imagined my career would amount to. WA [Western Australia] has provided me with the opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, McGowan reflected on his time in office, saying, \"I've loved the role. I've loved being able to deliver on our agenda for the benefit of our State and I've loved the challenge of solving problems, making decisions, getting outcomes, and helping people.\"\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese praised McGowan's leadership, stating, \"He has been a great Premier of his proud state, an extraordinary leader for WA Labor and a trusted friend. In unprecedented times, Mark always held to his convictions and always sought to do the right thing by his state.\"\n\nAlbanese revealed that McGowan had informed him of his decision to step down earlier on Monday. Under McGowan's leadership, the COVID-19 pandemic boosted his approval rating to 91%, and in the 2021 state election, Labor secured 53 of 59 lower-chamber seats.

A US citizen since 2008, Cumming has been a vocal critic of the now-repealed Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition of same-sex marriage, as well as the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy that barred openly LGBT individuals from serving in the US Armed Forces.\n\nAt the time of receiving the OBE, he remarked, \"I see this honour as encouragement to go on fighting for what I believe is right and for what I take for granted as a UK citizen. Thank you to the Queen and those who make up her birthday honours list for bringing attention to the inaction of the US government on this issue. It makes me very proud to be British, and galvanised as an American.\"\n\nHowever, following the repeal of those laws and the discussions surrounding the role of the monarchy and the legacy of British colonialism that arose after Elizabeth II's death in September, Cumming felt that \"the great good the award brought to the LGBTQ+ cause back in 2009 is now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire.\"\n\nHistorically, other celebrities have also returned OBEs in protest of social issues. For example, in 2020, Welsh actor Michael Sheen announced the return of his OBE received in 2009 due to the \"tortured history\" between Wales and the UK. Musician John Lennon returned his MBE in 1969 in response to the UK's involvement in the Nigerian Civil War and its support for the United States during the Vietnam War.\n\nCumming's notable film credits include *GoldenEye* and the *Spy Kids* trilogy. He won Tony Awards for producing the musical *A Strange Loop* (2022) and for his performance in *Cabaret* (1998). In 2019, he expressed pride in his role on the television series *Instinct*, which was the first US network drama to feature a gay lead character. Remembering the canceled show, he noted it was significant as it was where \"millions of people will have seen a same-sex marriage portrayed for the first time.\""}

During the ceremony in Wellington, Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, representing King Charles III, appointed Hipkins as prime minister and Carmel Sepuloni as the first Pasifika New Zealander to hold the position of deputy prime minister.\n\nHipkins, 44, was elected unopposed to lead the Labour Party on January 22, and he is set to guide the party into the upcoming elections in October amid economic challenges and declining popularity over the past two years in the face of a stronger conservative opposition.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Hipkins, who managed New Zealand's COVID-19 response under Ardern’s leadership, remarked: \"This is the biggest privilege and responsibility of my life [...] I’m energized and excited by the challenges that lie ahead.\" He emphasized that addressing the cost of living would be an \"absolute priority\" for his new government, although he refrained from detailing specific measures so soon after taking office. Recent quarterly consumer spending figures indicated that New Zealand's inflation rate remains high at 7.2%, primarily driven by rising housing and food costs.\n\n\"New Zealanders will absolutely see in the coming weeks and months that the cost of living is at the core of our work program [...] It is our number one priority as a government, and they will witness tangible evidence of our commitment,\" he told reporters, while cautioning against making hasty promises.\n\nSepuloni expressed her appreciation for her new role and commended Hipkins’ election. On the same day, she highlighted the significance of this moment for the Pacific community, given her own heritage of Samoan, Tongan, and New Zealand European descent.\n\nHipkins, addressing the economic situation, promised to combat what he termed a \"pandemic of inflation.\" He stated, \"COVID-19 and the global pandemic created a health crisis. Now it has led to an economic one, and that will be the focus of my government.\" He also assured that economic concerns would not overshadow other crucial issues such as climate change, which he described as \"one of the biggest intergenerational challenges we face.\"\n\nChristopher Luxon, Leader of the Opposition, extended his congratulations to Hipkins and Sepuloni via text but criticized the Ardern government's performance as a \"spectacular failure,\" claiming Hipkins would only provide \"more of the same.\"\n\nDespite previously serving as Minister of Education and Minister of Police, Hipkins is largely recognized as the 'architect' of New Zealand's COVID-19 policies. However, as noted by the Associated Press, he and his colleagues have not achieved the same level of recognition as Ardern, who emerged as a \"global icon for the left.\"\n\nArdern announced her resignation after nearly fifteen years in Parliament, citing a lack of energy to continue. She is expected to remain an MP until April, allowing her to step down without triggering a by-election prior to the October elections. \n\nFirst elected to the prime ministership in a coalition government in 2017, Ardern won a landslide re-election three years later. Her tenure included navigating the nation's deadliest terrorist attack, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn her final remarks as prime minister on Tuesday, Ardern expressed that the people were \"the joy of the job.\" The following morning, staff and supporters gathered to bid her farewell as she exited the Parliament building.\n\nWilliam and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, publicly thanked Ardern and her family for their \"friendship, leadership, and support\" over the years, particularly during the time of the Queen's passing."}

A subsequent search operation involving ships and ROVs led to the discovery of debris about 1,600 feet (488 meters) from the bow of the Titanic on June 22. Rear Admiral John Mauger of the US Coast Guard stated that the debris was \"consistent with a catastrophic implosion of the vehicle.\"\n\nOn June 18, a United States Navy acoustic detection system identified an \"anomaly consistent with an implosion or explosion\" in the vicinity where the Titan was last located. An official informed NPR that the Navy opted to continue the mission \"as a search and rescue and make every effort to save the lives on board.\" Search crews reported hearing sounds at 30-minute intervals; however, Carl Hartsfield from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute mentioned that some claimed the sounds were \"banging noises.\" Mauger clarified that \"[t]here doesn't appear to be any connection between the noises\" and the missing submersible.\n\nDue to the extreme pressure at that depth, an implosion would have instantly claimed the lives of the five individuals on board: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, British executive Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman, British businessman Hamish Harding, and French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet."}

Although there was strong demand, with bids exceeding £11 billion, yields reached a fifteen-year high due to traders' expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) would continue to raise interest rates amid ongoing high inflation, which has eroded returns.\n\nOn June 22, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee raised its bank rate for the thirteenth consecutive time, increasing it from 4.5% to 5%. This decision followed \"significant upside news in recent data\" indicating persistent inflationary pressures. HSBC asset strategist Joseph Little commented to Reuters that the BoE might raise its main interest rate to as much as 6%, citing that \"inflation pressures show greater persistency and momentum than in other Western economies, pushing the Bank into a hawkish stance.\" Additionally, Reuters reported that investors anticipated rates might rise to around 6.25% by December before declining.\n\nThe impact of these higher interest rates is evident, as the same gilts with a maturity date in October 2025 sold for an average yield of 4.874% last month and 3.634% in January.

These charges emerged from accusations of pursuing unlawful means to discount legitimate votes and to subvert the election results, which led to current President Joe Biden's victory and the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya stated that Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is assigned to oversee the case, intends to schedule a trial during an August 28 hearing. Both prosecutors and Trump's legal team are expected to propose their preferred trial timelines by that date. However, Upadhyaya indicated that Chutkan might allow Trump to skip the hearing.\n\nLead prosecutor Thomas Windom asserted that proceeding swiftly with the trial would be beneficial for the case, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normal courtroom order. In contrast, defense attorney John Lauro argued for more time, stating that the weighty issues at hand required thorough analysis of the evidence provided by the prosecution. He noted, “The US has had three and a half years to investigate this matter,” requesting adequate time to prepare a fair defense.\n\nUpadhyaya assured that there would be a fair process and trial. She also advised Trump of the conditions of his freedom, including a prohibition on discussing the case with witnesses without legal counsel present, warning that noncompliance could result in arrest.\n\nThe arraignment, lasting 27 minutes, was witnessed by three law enforcement officers who had resisted the Capitol attack, including retired Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell.

Trump's legal team has contended that Special Counsel Jack Smith violated Trump’s freedom of speech by charging him criminally.\n\nStanding in the rain at Reagan National Airport before his flight back to New Jersey, Trump lamented it was a \"very sad day for America.\" He claimed, \"This is the persecution of the person that’s leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot...

But to conduct a good election that people can trust, you don’t change the rules in the middle of the game.”\n\nProsecutors have requested Judge Chutkan to impose a protective order to prevent Trump from disclosing sensitive evidence from discovery after he posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!” Prosecutors argued this could potentially intimidate witnesses.\n\nTrump's attorneys responded on Monday, acknowledging some documents should remain confidential but arguing against a blanket gag order, citing the constitutional right to free speech. They stated, \"In a trial about First Amendment rights, the government seeks to restrict First Amendment rights.\"\n\nThe government countered, noting that Trump's legal team had commented on the case in the media. A hearing on this issue has been scheduled for Friday.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump expressed on Truth Social: \"There is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge 'assigned' to the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case [...] Everybody knows this and so does she! We will be immediately asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for a venue change, out [of] D.C.\" He suggested that West Virginia was \"politically unbiased\" compared to D.C.\n\nOn August 1, a federal grand jury indicted Trump on charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, alleging that he actively participated in efforts to contest the election results. This indictment followed a state-level indictment in New York related to falsifying business records and another federal indictment in Miami concerning the retention of classified documents.\n\nFulton County, Georgia, is also investigating Trump and his supporters for alleged attempts to influence the state's election results.\n\nUnlike an impeachment, a conviction unrelated to insurrection would not have legal consequences for Trump's campaign. The indictment stated that Trump exhausted his legal remedies to contest the election results, including seeking court relief and calling for audits, while participating in a conspiracy to perpetuate his claims of victory. He referred to the election as \"crooked\" before traveling to D.C. for his arraignment.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump knowingly disseminated false claims, aware they were not supported by evidence, to generate widespread distrust and anger among the public regarding the election's legitimacy. It also details Trump's attempts to persuade state officials to change election results and his failed effort to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to prevent the counting of electoral votes.\n\nThe grand jury also highlighted Trump's statements made during a rally on January 6, which preceded the Capitol riots, where attendees violently clashed with law enforcement. Congress reconvened later that day, with Pence overseeing the certification of the election results.\n\nProsecutor Jack Smith characterized the events as \"an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy [...] fueled by lies by the defendant.\"\n\nA bipartisan committee in the US House of Representatives, following an extensive investigation, recommended charging Trump with aiding an insurrection and obstructing an official proceeding. In 2021, Judge Chutkan ordered the release of Trump’s presidential records to the committee, a decision made contrary to Trump's objections, which were subsequently referenced in the August 1 indictment. Just hours before his arraignment, Trump criticized Chutkan, branding her as \"unfair\" on social media."}
{"title": "US Supreme Court blocks stay on federal regulation on privately made firearms", "content": "**Thursday, August 10, 2023**\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5–4 vote, temporarily reinstated a 2022 regulation on \"ghost guns,\" or privately made firearms (PMFs). This regulation defines PMFs as firearms that are neither produced nor marked with a serial number by a \"licensed manufacturer.\" The Court's decision stays a lower court's suspension of the regulation while the Biden administration pursues its appeal.\n\nIn a June ruling, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, determined that the administration lacked the authority to redefine ghost gun parts and kits as firearms. He argued that, according to Congress, a firearm cannot be considered \"weapon parts or aggregations of weapon parts,\" regardless of their potential to be assembled into a functioning firearm.\n\nThe ATF's final rule 2021R-05F, known as the \"Frame or Receiver\" rule, establishes new restrictions requiring serial numbers on \"easy-to-build\" gun kits and further clarifies what constitutes a receiver. The rule mandates that sellers conduct background checks on buyers of kits that contain the necessary parts to construct a firearm. Previously, such kits were available without these requirements. The ATF's goal with the Frame or Receiver rule is to ensure proper marking, recordkeeping, and traceability of firearms.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, stated, \"Americans across the country will be safer thanks to the Supreme Court’s decision today to maintain ATF's life-saving ghost guns rule while the appeals process unfolds.\"\n\nIn response to the ruling, Cody J. Wisniewski, representing the Firearms Policy Coalition, expressed disappointment, stating, \"We're deeply disappointed that the Court has paused our victory over ATF's rule, effectively redefining 'firearm' and 'frame or receiver' under federal law.\"\n\nThe Gun Control Act of 1968 did not address privately-made firearms intended for \"personal, lawful\" use, making their creation legal as long as the individual could legally own a firearm. For certain regulated items, such as machine guns under the National Firearms Act, the ATF is responsible for approval and registration, mirroring the process for purchasing from a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder.\n\nAccording to the ATF, advancements in technology and the widespread availability of manufacturing instructions have led to a rise in privately-made firearms. The ATF has reported an increase in unserialized firearms found during criminal investigations, which prompted the creation of the \"Frame or Receiver\" rule."}

This marks the first federal indictment of a former US president. \n\nTrump's attorney, Jim Trusty, announced that Trump plans to attend a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday following a summons. According to the indictment, Trump and his aides transported hundreds of classified documents from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, as his presidency concluded in January 2021. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) began seeking these documents in May 2021. By January 2022, Trump’s staff turned over 197 documents, labeled ranging from \"CONFIDENTIAL\" to \"TOP SECRET,\" which led NARA to request an investigation from the US Department of Justice (DoJ) the following month.\n\nThe indictment reveals that staff member Walt Nauta, Trump's co-defendant, discovered documents in December 2021, one of which was marked \"SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY,\" indicating it should only be shared with the US and other members of the Five Eyes alliance. Trump also reportedly stored classified documents at his Bedminster, New Jersey club. The indictment includes a partial transcript of a conversation where Trump informed an interviewer, a publisher, and two aides that he was sharing secret information with them that he had not declassified prior to leaving office, contradicting his earlier claims about all documents held at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdditionally, the indictment alleges that a Trump attorney made false statements to the FBI and DoJ last June, asserting that she and her colleague were providing all classified documents when, according to the indictment, Trump had directed Nauta to move documents out of the room while the second attorney conducted a search for compliance with a May 2022 grand jury subpoena. In August, the FBI, equipped with a warrant and security camera footage that appeared to show Nauta moving documents, executed a search at Mar-a-Lago and seized 102 documents labeled classified.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith filed the charges in the Southern District of Florida District Court. He was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate both the January 6 US Capitol attack and Trump's handling of classified documents."}

She also stated that regulating LCMs is consistent with the nation’s historical approach to managing particularly dangerous firearms to safeguard public safety.\n\nThe judge highlighted comments from Mark Hanish, former Vice President of Marketing and Sales at manufacturer Surefire, who testified that the same LCMs are sold to both the U.S. Department of Defense and civilians.

The grand jury alleged that they \"refused to accept that Trump lost\" the 2020 election, both in Georgia and nationally, and knowingly participated in a conspiracy to unlawfully alter the election outcome in Trump's favor.\n\nThe indictment stated that the conspiracy aimed to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity in Fulton County, elsewhere in Georgia, and in other states. Following the indictments, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis informed the press that the accused had eleven days to surrender.\n\nTrump was charged under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), along with his co-defendants. His charges included three counts of soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, two counts each of conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree and false statements and writings, conspiracy to file false documents, and filing false documents. \n\nOn the day of the indictment, Trump asserted, \"I didn't tamper with the election!\" His 2024 presidential campaign characterized the prosecution led by Willis as \"election interference,\" claiming the \"timing of this latest coordinated strike\" by a biased prosecutor in a predominantly Democratic jurisdiction undermined public trust. Trump has previously called for Willis's disqualification based on her public comments regarding the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced via his social media platform, Truth Social, that a \"Large, Complex, Detailed but Irrefutable REPORT on the Presidential Election Fraud which took place in Georgia\" was nearly ready and would be presented at a major news conference on Monday at 11:00 A.M. in Bedminster, New Jersey. However, on Thursday, he retracted that announcement, stating that his lawyers preferred to submit what he called \"Irrefutable & Overwhelming evidence of Election Fraud & Irregularities\" through formal legal filings as they sought to dismiss the indictment.\n\nThis fourth case follows prior indictments of Trump on charges of falsification of business records in New York City, purposeful retention of classified documents in Miami, and efforts to subvert the 2020 election results in Washington, D.C. Unlike impeachment and conviction by Congress, a criminal conviction unrelated to insurrection would not affect Trump's presidential campaign; however, as the charges are at the state level, he cannot issue pardons or dismiss state prosecutors.\n\nThe 98-page indictment named an additional 30 individuals involved in the conspiracy, though they were not charged. It details Trump's attempts to persuade state officials, including Governor Brian Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to alter election results—most notably during a phone call on January 2, 2021, during which he asked Raffensperger to \"find\" votes to overturn Biden's victory.\n\nThe indictment alleges Trump made false claims of election fraud and enlisted individuals to act as false electors, with state Republican Party chairman David Shafer and Cathleen Latham among those charged. Some participants were reportedly informed by the Trump campaign that they would only cast their electoral votes if legal attempts to contest Biden's win succeeded. The grand jury also indicted Shafer and Mike Roman, another participant in the scheme.\n\nFurthermore, Trump’s attorneys allegedly made multiple attempts to persuade the Republican-majority Georgia legislature to address their election fraud claims. The indictment also mentioned Jeffrey Clark, a top official at the U.S. Department of Justice, who prepared a never-sent letter urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session regarding the election results.\n\nAdditionally, the grand jury accused several defendants of falsely alleging election crimes against Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman, using these claims as a basis to pressure Georgia's legislature to change the election outcome.\n\nMark Meadows, Trump’s former Chief of Staff, is also facing charges. The grand jury accused him of trying to gain unauthorized access to a Cobb County civic center where audits of election-related signatures were taking place in December 2020. He was indicted for violating RICO and soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, linked to the scheduling of Trump's call with Raffensperger.\n\nThe indictment also charged Latham with participating in efforts to compromise ballots and election machinery in Coffee County, Georgia. In Georgia, prosecutors can convene special grand juries for investigations, and Willis did so about a year into her probe in 2022. Testimony before the special grand jury included individuals like Eastman, Giuliani, Meadows, and Ken Chesebro, who were subsequently charged by the regular grand jury. Others who testified included former national security advisor Mike Flynn and Republican legislators Senator Lindsey Graham and Representative Jody Hice.\n\nBoth Willis and Judge Robert McBurney, who oversaw the special grand jury's proceedings, indicated that Shafer was at the highest risk of prosecution among the pro-Trump electors."}

Flight data revealed that approximately thirty minutes into the flight from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, the aircraft began descending rapidly at nearly 8,000 feet per minute before ceasing altitude transmission around 6:19 PM (15:19 UTC) after fluctuating between gaining and losing altitude from a cruising height of approximately 28,000 feet.\n\nThe Federal Air Transport Agency confirmed that an investigation has begun, identifying other passengers on board as Sergey Propustin, Evgeniy Makaryan, Aleksandr Totmin, Valeriy Chekalov, Dmitry Utkin—who served as a Wagner field commander and was linked to military intelligence, Nikolay Matuseev, and crew members Commander Aleksei Levshin, co-pilot Rustam Karimov, and flight attendant Kristina Raspopova.\n\nRussian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied any involvement in the crash, stating, \"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding this incident and the tragic deaths of those on board, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. Naturally, the West presents this speculation with a specific bias. This is all sheer lies... It is best to rely on facts, but currently, those facts are still being gathered through the ongoing investigation.\"\n\nDuring a televised address yesterday, President Vladimir Putin expressed \"sincere condolences to the families of all the victims,\" referring to Prigozhin as a \"talented businessman\" whom he had known since the early 1990s. He added, \"He was a man with a complicated fate, who made significant mistakes in life... He achieved results that were necessary both for himself and for our collective cause in recent months.\"\n\nAccording to a U.S. official who spoke with ABC News, the prevailing theory is that an explosion, possibly from a bomb, caused the crash. This assessment was reinforced by Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, who indicated that while intelligence suggested Prigozhin was \"likely killed\" in the crash, there was no current evidence of a surface-to-air missile being involved. Earlier reports from U.S. government sources also mentioned an explosion as a potential cause.\n\nWhile vacationing in Lake Tahoe, U.S. President Joe Biden commented to the press that he did not \"know for a fact what happened but I'm not surprised.\" He added, \"Not much happens in Russia without Putin's involvement, but I don't know enough to know the answer.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, suggested that the \"demonstrative elimination of Prigozhin and the Wagner command two months after the coup attempt is a signal from Putin to Russia's elites ahead of the 2024 elections.\"\n\nKnown as \"Putin's chef,\" Prigozhin was born in 1961 in Saint Petersburg, then Leningrad. He began his criminal history with a twelve-year prison sentence for robbery and fraud in 1981, from which he was released in 1990.\n\nSamantha de Bendern of the Royal Institute of International Affairs remarked in a Sky News interview that Prigozhin quickly transitioned from working in a flea market hot dog business to becoming a key figure in the new post-Soviet Russian elite through food contracts awarded by the government.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. indicted Prigozhin over alleged financial support for the Internet Research Agency, which the Department of Justice accused of attempting to interfere with U.S. political processes, including the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPrigozhin claimed to have established Wagner in 2014, which fought alongside pro-Russian rebels in the War in Donbas and also operated in various African nations, including Mali, Mozambique, and Sudan. U.S. estimates suggested that by late March 2022, Wagner fielded 1,000 fighters in Ukraine, which grew to 50,000 by December, with many of these fighters being recruited from prisons.\n\nIn November, Prigozhin infamously stated that \"[a] dog receives a dog's death\" in reference to the brutal killing of a Wagner deserter. The Institute for the Study of War has accused Wagner of committing war crimes.\n\nAs Wagner troops engaged in intense battles for Bakhmut, Prigozhin publicly demanded ammunition from Russian military leaders, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. After capturing the city and receiving praise from Putin, he criticized the military for failing to provide adequate support and threatened to withdraw his forces.\n\nOn June 23, Prigozhin called for the resignation of military leadership and ordered his forces to advance on Moscow, resulting in clashes that reportedly left around fifteen government soldiers dead. However, he later chose to turn back and seek a peaceful resolution. A deal brokered by Belarus allowed Prigozhin and Wagner forces to avoid legal consequences for their rebellion.\n\nOn July 3, Prigozhin stated on social media that his intentions had been to combat treachery and mobilize society, asserting that significant progress was made and promising further victories at the front. His first video since the rebellion surfaced on Monday."}

{"title": "US: Russian fighter jet's flare damaged drone over Syria", "content": "**Wednesday, July 26, 2023**\n\nUS Air Forces Central reported that a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jet flew dangerously close to a US MQ-9 drone conducting an anti-ISIS mission over Syria on Sunday. The statement indicated that the Russian pilot released flares, one of which damaged the MQ-9's propeller, although the drone returned safely to its base.\n\nLieutenant General Alex Grynkewich, commander of US Air Forces Central, commented, \"The Russian fighter's blatant disregard for flight safety detracts from our mission to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.\" He urged Russian forces in Syria to immediately halt what he described as \"reckless, unprovoked, and unprofessional behavior.\" As of Tuesday, Russia had not issued a response.\n\nUS officials noted a rise in interactions between Russian and US military aircraft in Syrian airspace. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated last week during a press conference, \"There is a bit of an uptick, but I wouldn't overstate it too much. Our forces have adequate rules of engagement and authorities to defend themselves.\" He also mentioned that analysts were investigating the reasons behind this increase.\n\nBoth nations maintain a military presence in Syria, with Russia backing President Bashar al-Assad's regime and the US conducting Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIS with about 900 troops. The Syrian and Russian governments have expressed opposition to the US presence in Syria. In March, the US House of Representatives voted against a resolution that would have mandated the withdrawal of US forces from the region."}

The festivities commenced at Place Saint-Corentin in the city center.\n\nMore than 1,000 participants marched in the parade, carrying signs with messages like \"Free Hug\" and \"All Mobilized Against Hateful and Reactionary Drifts\" (French: tous.tes mobilisé.e.s contres les dérives haineuses et réactionnaires).\n\nReports of crimes against LGBTQ individuals in France rose by 28% from 2020 to 2021. Activist Vincent Autin addressed this troubling trend during an interview with Radio France Internationale in April, stating, \"This wave of LGBT-phobia that exists in France, which emerged during the demonstrations against the same-sex marriage law, has never been effectively pushed back.\"\n\nWikinews reporter Ash Thawley spoke with festival attendee Maïwenn."}
{"title": "UK Conservative Party loses two seats in by-elections, retains former PM Johnson's", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\n**Sunday, July 30, 2023**\n\nIn the by-elections held on July 20, the UK Conservative Party lost control of Somerton and Frome, as well as Selby and Ainsty, while managing to retain their seat in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. These shifts followed the resignations of Members of Parliament (MPs) David Warburton, Nigel Adams, and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Conservative Party had previously held all three seats in the past three elections: 2015, 2017, and 2019. The Liberal Democrats' Sarah Dyke won in Somerton and Frome, capturing approximately 55% of the vote. Following her victory, she stated that the Conservatives had \"let down and taken [voters] for granted for far too long.\"\n\nDavid Warburton resigned from his position in June after being suspended by the Conservative parliamentary group in April of the previous year due to an inquiry involving admitted cocaine use and allegations of sexual harassment. Labour secured victory in Selby and Ainsty with a 46% vote share, sending Keir Mather to the House of Commons as the youngest member at just 25 years old. Mather remarked that the party had \"rewritten the rules on where Labour can win.\"\n\nFormer MP Nigel Adams stepped down last month, citing a desire to pursue opportunities in the private sector, particularly after he did not receive a resignation honor from Boris Johnson. In Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Conservative Steve Tuckwell won with 45% of the vote share and a majority of 495 votes, attributing the Conservatives' victory to opposition against Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's proposed Ultra Low Emission Zone expansion.\n\nBoris Johnson resigned from Parliament immediately before a committee published the Partygate report, which examined the accuracy of his testimony regarding alleged lockdown breaches. He criticized the report as \"riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice,\" claiming he had no formal means to contest its findings.\n\nPrior to the election results, Amanda Milling, the MP for Cannock Chase, declined to comment on the by-elections. Since December 2021, the Conservative Party has consistently lagged behind the Labour Party in Politico's Poll of Polls. In October, Labour's support reached a peak of 52% following Liz Truss's ascension to the premiership. As of July 24, Labour was polling at 46%, while the Conservatives stood at 26%."}
{"title": "NASA's OSIRIS-REx arrives in Houston, US after returning asteroid samples to Earth", "content": "**Tuesday, September 26, 2023**\n\nOn Monday, a capsule from NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security – Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft, containing samples from the asteroid Bennu, arrived in Houston, Texas. The capsule was headed to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) after successfully landing in the Utah Test and Training Range the previous day. This marked NASA's first return of asteroid samples.\n\nAs of Sunday, the capsule was in a cleanroom where the sample container was undergoing a nitrogen purge to preserve the samples' purity by preventing contamination from Earth's atmosphere. Staff plan to disassemble the container, catalog its contents, and eventually distribute samples to researchers at other institutions.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson praised the OSIRIS-REx team for their \"picture-perfect mission — the first American asteroid sample return in history,\" emphasizing that the findings will enhance our understanding of the solar system's origins and formations. He also noted that the samples could provide insights into asteroids that may pose a threat to Earth.\n\nOSIRIS-REx launched in September 2016 and reached Bennu in December 2018. For nearly two years, NASA scientists meticulously selected the optimal site for sample collection. In October 2020, the spacecraft used a robotic arm to touch the asteroid's surface and inject nitrogen gas to collect material. Approximately 8.8 ounces of debris was secured in its receptacle out of around six metric tons of material. The spacecraft initiated its return journey to Earth in May 2021.\n\nThe sample capsule was released from an altitude of 63,000 miles as OSIRIS-REx passed by Earth. It entered the atmosphere at 10:42 EDT (1442 UTC) and landed about ten minutes later. Recovery teams utilized radar and other instruments to track the capsule, ensuring its secure transport to JSC.\n\nSince its launch, OSIRIS-REx has traversed 3.86 billion miles. With the sample-return phase now complete, the spacecraft will continue its mission towards the asteroid Apophis. To reflect its new purpose, the mission has been renamed to Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-APophis EXplorer (OSIRIS-APEX)."}

The Department aims for \"fair consideration and back pay\" for those affected by the alleged discrimination, along with other damages as determined by the court and a commitment from SpaceX to change its hiring practices to prevent future discrimination.\n\nThe government contends that the company, founded and owned by Elon Musk, misrepresented its hiring capabilities, claiming it could only employ U.S. citizens or permanent residents due to export regulations. This stance reportedly discouraged asylees from applying for jobs.\n\nAdditionally, the government asserts that SpaceX did not adequately consider applications for various positions, including those requiring advanced degrees, as well as roles for welders and cooks."}

Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley interviewed David Rock, a University of Birmingham student residing in Selly Oak, after he rode the extension from approximately 16:30 to 17:30 on the same day.\n\nThis new segment, located in the Metro's Zone 4, branches off from an existing line after The Royal. The terminus for that line, Wolverhampton St George's, will remain operational, with \"every other Metro [terminating there] as part of a 'shopper's service',\" according to the Midland Metro Alliance. The alliance cited the \"convenient location close to Wolverhampton's shopping district\" as a reason for keeping this stop open. It is expected to close \"later this autumn\" for maintenance work, as stated in a press release from the West Midlands Metro.\n\nThe extension faced delays and was initially scheduled for completion in 2019. The Metro has now shifted its focus to future service expansions, including the extension to Brierley Hill."}
