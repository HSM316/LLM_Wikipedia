{"title": "Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan resigns over Brexit border checks", "content": "**Friday, February 4, 2022**\n\n**The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) First Minister of Northern Ireland, Paul Givan, Resigns in Protest Against Brexit Checks**\n\nPaul Givan, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and a member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has resigned effective midnight Friday in response to his party’s protests against checks on goods coming from Great Britain, a requirement established under the Northern Ireland Protocol during the Brexit negotiations.\n\nUnionist leaders in Northern Ireland have vehemently opposed the terms of the Protocol, which has been a contentious issue since the UK’s departure from the European Union. Givan’s resignation also means that Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill will be removed from office, leading to a paralysis of the devolved Executive at Stormont. This development hinders the legislative body's ability to enact crucial policies, including a three-year budget, an energy bill grant, and the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions. Nevertheless, other Stormont ministers will continue in their roles until the next elections are held in May.\n\nIn an emotional press statement, Givan remarked that the institutions of Northern Ireland are \"being tested once again,\" noting that the delicate balance established by the Belfast and St Andrew's agreements has been affected by the UK-EU Brexit agreement. He cited the \"cornerstone\" principle of consent included in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, which led to the creation of the power-sharing Executive. Despite his resignation, he expressed his \"earnest desire for all sections of the community to soon be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully functioning executive through the resolution of the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point.\"\n\nGivan described his resignation after nearly eight months in office as \"the end of what has been the privilege of my lifetime - to serve as the First Minister of Northern Ireland,\" highlighting that he never expected to have this opportunity when he was first elected as Lagan Valley MLA in 2011, succeeding Arlene Foster after her resignation in June 2021.\n\nOpposition parties have criticized the decision, labeling it \"reckless and self-serving,\" particularly by Sinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy, and officials from both the British and Irish governments. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called for an early election, emphasizing that \"the DUP's actions have consequences, real consequences for people struggling.\" Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie denounced the resignation as destabilizing, stating it creates \"more hardship for the people of Northern Ireland\" and is ultimately pointless, as \"the Protocol will still be there.\"\n\nWhile McDonald condemned the inaction on the budget and healthcare investment as driven by \"the DUP's narrow and self-serving political interests,\" others voiced alarm over the potential paralysis of government services. UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, described the move as \"extremely disappointing\" and urged for reinstatement to \"ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland.\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated the UK government's commitment to a resilient Northern Ireland Executive.\n\nTaoiseach of Ireland Michéal Martin characterized Givan’s resignation as \"a highly damaging move.\" Through a spokesperson, he stressed that \"it is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people, especially as we emerge from the Covid pandemic.\" He urged the DUP to fully engage with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which the Protocol safeguards.\n\nMartin also indicated that ongoing talks between the UK and EU, of which Ireland is a member, \"must be given every chance to succeed.\" He mentioned that the European Commission has proposed serious initiatives addressing implementation issues related to the Protocol. Givan had previously told reporters that he was resigning because Unionists were being required \"to be seen and not heard\" regarding the Protocol.\n\nOn Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič held a video conference to discuss the Protocol, which they view as the \"only solution\" to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Šefčovič labeled Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots’s recent decision to suspend certain checks for goods entering Northern Ireland as \"very unhelpful.\" The two will reconvene on February 11.\n\nUnionist politicians have firmly voiced their stance on the Protocol. Following Givan's resignation, DUP party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson stated it \"represents an existential threat to Northern Ireland's place within the Union.\" He criticized the UK government for not upholding the New Decade, New Approach agreement, which facilitated the DUP’s return to the Executive in January 2020, ending a three-year stalemate after the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.\n\nAccording to the Irish Independent, the timing and particulars of Givan's resignation were confirmed in a meeting among senior DUP members earlier on Thursday. Poots's directive to halt sanitary and phytosanitary checks not mandated by December 31, 2020, reportedly followed legal advice suggesting that he could cease checks without Executive approval. While the UK government maintained that it would not intervene in what it sees as a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive, it faced accusations of breaching international law from Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Šefčovič asserted that it is essential for checks to continue, while a spokesperson for Johnson expressed support for \"a swift resolution.\""}

Previously known as the Washington Redskins, the team has faced longstanding criticism from Native American organizations, which argued that using names like \"Redskins\" perpetuates offensive stereotypes. Unlike terms such as \"Indians\" or \"Braves,\" the term \"Redskin\" is recognized by many, including Ray Halbritter of Oneida Nation Enterprises, as \"a dictionary-defined slur.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, team president Jason Wright expressed that the new name \"embodies the values of service and leadership that characterize the DMV [D.C., Maryland, Virginia region].\" Current and former players Jonathan Allen and Gary Clark praised the team's new uniforms, which prominently feature a letter \"W.\" Allen noted that while the name itself doesn't hold historical significance, the excitement generated by players showcasing their new uniforms is sure to engage fans.\n\nTeam owner Daniel Snyder had long resisted a name change, even once suggesting he would capitalize the name. However, in June 2020, a coalition of 87 sponsors, including FedEx, Nike, and Pepsi, urged the team management to change the name, highlighting the growing backlash against its use. The decision to rebrand was influenced by feedback from fans, a former player, and Native Americans, led by consultant John Wright. Although fans expressed interest in variations of \"Red Wolves,\" many related names and imagery had already been trademarked.\n\nResponses from Native American leaders have been mixed. Crystal Echo Hawk of IllumiNative stated that the team has an opportunity to \"put a horrible chapter to rest,\" but emphasized that \"there's still a lot of healing that needs to happen,\" indicating that the team's efforts toward reconciliation are not yet complete. \n\nFawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), criticized the team's management for failing to adequately address the harm caused by the former name. She stated, \"Without an apology, without any measure of accountability, and without fulfilling the honored commitments they made to tribal nations in 2020 to right this wrong, the NFL and Snyder are simply 'Commanding' a continued course of open, intentional, and profit-driven racism and erasure.\"\n\nCurrently, approximately one thousand sports teams in the United States use Native American-themed names, a decrease from around three thousand in the 1990s. Organizations like the American Indian Movement and NCAI continue to advocate for these teams to transition to non-Native American names and mascots."}

The approval was first reported late Tuesday. Plans for a battery energy storage system have been suspended due to fire safety concerns. Scheduled for construction by OSMI Australia Pty in 2023, this wind farm will become the first of its kind built in a plantation in Victoria.\n\nIn late 2021, a planning panel reviewed testimony from local residents, community groups, and OSMI representatives. The panel subsequently recommended approval in a comprehensive 224-page report but noted that information regarding the siting and fire safety measures for the battery energy storage system was inadequate for endorsement at this stage.\n\nOSMI executive director Peter Marriott emphasized that the battery energy storage system is \"certainly not a key part of the project\" but expressed a willingness to explore its potential, highlighting their interest in the findings from the CFA and WorkSafe investigation into the Moorabool battery fire.\n\nIn response to the decision, Nationals member for Gippsland South Danny O'Brien pointed to a recent court ruling halting nighttime noise emissions from a Tarwin Lower wind farm, questioning how the Minister could approve the Delburn project shortly thereafter, especially in light of local opposition.

{"title": "Federal judge rejects hate crime plea in Arbery killing", "content": "**Thursday, February 3, 2022**\n\nOn Monday, Judge Lisa Godbey Wood of the U.S. District Court in Brunswick, Georgia, rejected a guilty plea from Travis McMichael, who had offered to plead guilty to federal hate crimes in the death of Ahmaud Arbery. It is rare for a U.S. judge to turn down a plea agreement that would have waived McMichael's right to appeal.\n\nMcMichael expressed his willingness to plead guilty to attacking Arbery out of racial animosity, which would categorize Arbery's murder as a hate crime. Under the proposed plea deal, McMichael would have served the first 30 years of his sentence in federal prison, followed by a transfer to a Georgia state prison for the remainder of his life. Even if his state charges were later overturned, he would still face many years behind bars.\n\nIn court, federal prosecutors encouraged Judge Wood to accept the plea deal, but Arbery's family opposed it. Wanda Cooper-Jones, Arbery's mother, stated that allowing the men who killed her son to choose their confinement would be a betrayal: \"Granting these men their preferred choice of confinement would defeat me. It gives them one last chance to spit in my face.\"\n\nProsecutors asserted that they had consulted with the victim's family regarding the plea deal beforehand, a claim disputed by Cooper-Jones' legal team. \n\nJudge Wood indicated that Cooper-Jones' statement influenced her decision, but the primary reason for her rejection was her desire to avoid being restricted to the 30-year sentence proposed by the prosecution and McMichael's defense.\n\nThis decision raises uncertainty about whether Gregory McMichael, Travis's father and also implicated in Arbery's death, will proceed with a planned guilty plea. \n\nIn February 2020, the McMichaels and a third man, William Bryan, pursued Arbery, 25, in trucks as he jogged through their suburban Georgia neighborhood. Travis McMichael confronted Arbery on foot and shot him. Bryan recorded a cellphone video of the incident, which later circulated online.\n\nIn November 2021, all three men were convicted of murder in Glynn County Superior Court, receiving life sentences, although only Bryan was eligible for parole. At that time, Georgia lacked its own hate crime statute, prompting prosecutors to pursue federal charges against the men.\n\nJury selection for Travis McMichael's federal hate crimes trial is set to begin on Monday, February 7."}

{"title": "30,000-year-old Austrian statue traced to stone from Italy", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\n**March 5, 2022**\n\nIn a study published on Monday in *Scientific Reports*, researchers from the University of Vienna and the Vienna Natural History Museum revealed that the stone used to carve the Venus of Willendorf originated from northern Italy, located hundreds of miles away from where the sculpture was found, across the Alps.\n\nDating back 30,000 years, the Venus of Willendorf is among the oldest known examples of human art, standing at approximately 4.3 inches (11 cm) tall. Like many prehistoric statuettes, it depicts a female figure characterized by pronounced physical features such as a large stomach and prominent breasts. Unlike most similar artifacts, which were typically carved from ivory or bone, the Venus is crafted from oolite, a type of limestone. Researchers believe it was created by the Gravettian culture, likely using flint tools. The sculpture is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love.\n\nTo determine the origins of the stone, scientists compared rock samples from locations as far west as France and as far east as Ukraine with microscopic analyses of the Venus. Oolite, a sedimentary rock formed by layers of silt and other materials, allows for the identification of individual grains and shell fragments. Notably, one tiny shell fragment in the Venus came from a creature that lived during the Jurassic period, although the stone was harvested and shaped much later.\n\nUnlike previous assessments that focused solely on the exterior, this study utilized computed tomography to examine the interior of the statue without causing damage. The scan revealed that the stone bore little resemblance to oolites found near Willendorf, but closely matched those from Lake Garda in Italy, over 350 miles (563 km) away, on the other side of the Alps and the Danube River. A potential but less likely source of the stone could be in Ukraine, situated over 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) east of where the statue was discovered in Wachau, Austria, in 1908.\n\nLead author Gerhard Weber speculated that the stone could have been transported during human migration: \"When the climate or prey situation changed, [people] moved on, preferably along rivers,\" he noted.\n\nThe researchers suggest that these findings offer new insights into the travel patterns of prehistoric humans in and around the Alpine region. The study received funding from the state of Lower Austria."}

This discovery by the Endurance22 expedition comes over a century after the vessel was trapped by sea ice off the Antarctic coast and subsequently sank to the bottom of the Weddell Sea.\n\nRemarkably, the ship appears to be in excellent condition, preserved by the cold waters. The timbers look intact, and the name Endurance is clearly visible below the stern, alongside the five-pointed star Polaris, both unchanged despite the passage of time.\n\nSubmersible craft deployed by Endurance22, which was formed and funded by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust, captured images of the Endurance at a depth of approximately 3,008 meters (9,868.8 ft). These vehicles were launched from the expedition's main vessel, the South African icebreaker S.A.

Sir Ernest Shackleton, a pioneer in British Antarctic exploration during the early 20th century, and his crew became stranded when the ship became trapped in sea ice and was gradually crushed. They camped on the ice until they were able to launch lifeboats and ultimately reach safety.

However, the past month recorded the lowest levels of Antarctic sea ice since the inception of satellite monitoring, enabling the multinational team assembled by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust to make this significant discovery.\n\nExpedition leader Dr. John Shears remarked on the successful expedition, stating: \"We have made polar history... and successfully completed the world's most challenging shipwreck search.\" He emphasized the accomplishments of humanity when working together in overcoming obstacles.\n\nMenson Bound, the director of exploration, added: \"It is not just about the past; we are bringing the story of Shackleton and the Endurance to new audiences, especially the next generation, who will be responsible for safeguarding our polar regions and our planet. We hope our discovery will inspire young people with the pioneering spirit, courage, and fortitude of those who sailed the Endurance to Antarctica.\""}
{"title": "Ballarat candidates debate climate at election forum", "content": "**Sunday, May 8, 2022**  \n\n**Ballarat, Australia** — In the lead-up to the upcoming Australian federal election, four candidates vying for the Division of Ballarat gathered last Sunday at the Ballarat Tech School for a climate-focused forum organized by the local group Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions (BREAZE).  \n\nPresent were sitting Labor MP Catherine King, Greens candidate and former mayor John Barnes, Australian Federation Party candidate Kerryn Sedgman, and independent candidate Alex Graham. Local Liberal and Liberal Democrats candidates sent their apologies for not attending.  \n\nThe event kicked off with a climate action rally outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and Town Hall, featuring speeches from representatives of BREAZE, Extinction Rebellion, Environment Victoria, the Public Transport Users Association, and Ballarat Trades Hall.  \n\nThe forum commenced with candidates each delivering a three-minute summary of their climate policies before fielding questions from the public. Barnes asserted that \"the Greens have the most ambitious program of any party on addressing climate change\" and indicated that if the Greens held the balance of power, they would push Labor towards \"the reforming zeal of past generations,\" referencing former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. He emphasized the Greens' target of a 75% emissions reduction by 2030 and a commitment to end coal mining, burning, and exports within the same timeframe.  \n\nIndependent candidate Alex Graham expressed his passion for the environment, claiming to offer \"the best policy.\" He proposed a referendum that would enable the Australian government to \"write its own money supply into existence,\" suggesting this would provide \"money beyond the pale to totally restore our environment.\"  \n\nIncumbent MP Catherine King reflected on her two decades in Parliament, noting a lack of progress on climate issues. She pointed to the previous Labor government's unsuccessful attempts to legislate climate policies, such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), which she claimed were \"completely and utterly dismantled\" after the 2013 election.  \n\nKing highlighted Labor's Powering Australia policy announced in December 2021, stating it enjoys support from groups including the Business Council of Australia, National Farmers' Federation, and various environmental organizations. The policy outlines a commitment to achieving a 43% emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 while focusing on job growth and increased renewable energy.  \n\nKerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party promised to prioritize community perspectives, reading directly from the Federation's climate policy: \"carbon is not the enemy. Toxic pesticides are the true enemy.\" She argued that pesticides are the primary source of nitrous oxide (N₂O), which is \"300 times worse than carbon.\"  \n\nFollowing the candidates’ opening statements, the public was invited to ask questions. The first question requested the candidates' top two priorities for climate action. Barnes identified \"prompt action\" and transforming the economy towards sustainability as priorities, while Graham suggested a limitless supply of money could eradicate climate issues and enhance Australia’s model for the world. He indicated his priorities would be increasing funding and introducing new technologies.  \n\nKing prioritized expanding renewable energy in the grid and noted her intention to integrate a climate section within the Transport and Infrastructure Department, along with plans to establish a network of electric vehicle charging stations. Sedgman emphasized that soil regeneration was vital for carbon sequestration and advocated for immediate educational efforts and community engagement on climate issues.  \n\nThe event was momentarily disrupted by an attendee questioning a vague \"ninety-year suppression order\" related to alleged paedophiles, which was dismissed by organizers. King labeled it a \"QAnon conspiracy theory.\"  \n\nThe discussion then shifted to the proposed Western Victorian Transmission Network, an overhead line from Bulgana to Sydenham. Graham suggested his referendum could lead to federal subsidies for underground transmission lines beneath the Western Highway, asserting that financial interests should not interfere with environmental protection. King highlighted concerns about the proposed transfer station's location and indicated that regulatory processes required reform.  \n\nSedgman admitted to her limited knowledge of the background King referred to and expressed a desire to engage with those affected. Barnes criticized AusNet's consultation process regarding the transmission line and hoped an extended timeline for the environmental impact statement would allow for better community input. He also noted that AusNet had claimed underground construction would be thirteen times more expensive than overhead alternatives, a figure contradicted by a study from the Shire of Moorabool, which found it would only be five times more costly.  \n\nCandidates were queried about their stance on innovations like direct air capture. Barnes asserted, \"the best way to sequester carbon is not to release it in the first place,\" deeming mechanical carbon removal a \"pipe dream.\" Graham humorously remarked he would consult a friend who might be able to achieve it. King noted that while such technology is still developing, A$3 billion is earmarked in Labor's Powering Australia plan for advancing new emission-reducing technologies. Sedgman highlighted the urgent need to address deforestation rates.  \n\nWhen asked about committing to no new coal and gas infrastructure, King confirmed that a moratorium on such developments is not part of Labor's policy, although she asserted the party would refrain from investing taxpayer funds in them. Graham, with a background in the industry, pledged to phase out every coal-fired power station as swiftly as possible and prohibit new coal plants. He also vowed to shut down coal mines and ban fracking.  \n\nBarnes reiterated the Greens' commitment to heeding the International Energy Agency's advice, vowing to prevent new coal, gas, or oil projects and to close all coal-fired power stations by 2030, substituting them with renewable energy sources. He emphasized the necessity of reducing emissions before the global temperature rises by 1.5 °C.  \n\nOne audience member posed a hypothetical about how candidates would respond if, after the election, Labor achieved a clear majority versus if the Greens held the balance of power. King pointed out that the \"beauty of power in Australia\" is the non-requirement for legislation, but emphasized Labor's commitment to pursuing 43% emissions reduction and net-zero emissions by 2050. Barnes affirmed the Greens would advocate for more ambitious targets if they were in the balance.  \n\nThe candidates were also asked about Beyond Zero Emissions' proposal to transform northern Australia into the \"battery of Asia.\" Barnes portrayed Australia as a potential \"energy superpower,\" noting that effective government policy could drive market support. King claimed Labor's Powering Australia plan could generate over 600,000 jobs and echoed the sentiment that Australia should strive to be a renewable energy superpower and lead technology exports.  \n\nThe final question addressed the potential job losses from transitioning to renewable energy in coal-dependent communities like the Hunter Valley. Graham called for a \"basic, living universal wage,\" while Sedgman questioned who would qualify for new jobs under existing mandates. King referred to diminishing demand for fossil fuels, asserting the importance of preparing workers for the inevitable transition to rewarding renewable jobs. Barnes outlined the Greens' proposal to allocate A$19 billion over ten years to aid communities impacted by the transition away from fossil fuels, emphasizing the importance of retraining programs and maintaining existing incomes for a decade if workers struggle to find equally lucrative positions. He underscored that it is crucial to support mining communities with dignity.  \n\nThe forum concluded with representatives from Environment Victoria presenting an open letter, signed by 125 individuals, calling for \"faster and fairer climate action.\" The letter advocated for a replacement of \"coal, oil, and gas with clean energy,\" a national plan to significantly reduce climate pollution this decade with strict targets, and an expedited rollout of renewable energy projects aimed at creating a \"healthy, prosperous economy while ceasing any new fossil fuel energy generation projects.\""}

The victims were taken to three different hospitals, where two men were pronounced dead at the scene and another succumbed to his injuries later. Three individuals are in serious condition, while four others sustained minor injuries. \n\nThe shootings began at a pub on Dizengoff Street, where five victims were initially reported. Additional shootings occurred on J. L. Gordon Street and in nearby areas. Security forces from Shin Bet killed the alleged gunman after a shootout near a mosque in the southern Tel Aviv neighborhood of Jaffa. The suspect has been identified as a 29-year-old Palestinian man from Jenin, a city in northern West Bank.\n\nPrime Minister Naftali Bennett, speaking at HaKirya on Friday, extended his condolences to the families of those killed and expressed hopes for the swift recovery of the injured. He noted that the perpetrator was not affiliated with any organization but had received assistance and weapons. \"Those who aid and abet terrorists must understand that the consequences of their actions will be severe,\" he stated. Bennett also described celebrations in Jenin following news of the attack, highlighting instances of incitement to violence from the terrorist's family. \"As a nation and a state, we will need patience, resilience, and heightened vigilance,\" he added. \"Above all, we must maintain our belief in the justice of our cause in this land.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a statement saying, \"We are closely monitoring developments and will remain in regular contact with our Israeli partners, standing firm against senseless terrorism and violence.\" \n\nMarch saw a surge in attacks in Israel, including a shooting in Bnei Brak, just east of Tel Aviv, which resulted in five fatalities."}

Notably, three Republican senators—Susan Collins (Maine), Mitt Romney (Utah), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)—broke with their party to support Jackson. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the vote and would have cast a tiebreaking vote if necessary.\n\nJackson and President Joe Biden observed the proceedings from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Biden nominated Jackson on February 25 to succeed retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. During his presidential campaign in 2020, Biden pledged to nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court. Senate confirmation is required for all presidential nominations. \n\nOn March 21, Jackson was introduced to the Senate by Thomas B. Griffith, a former judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals. In her opening remarks, she stated, \"My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers they faced growing up, my path was clearer. If I worked hard and believed in myself, I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.\" She concluded her remarks by committing to support and defend the Constitution and American democracy should she be confirmed.\n\nDuring the second day of confirmation hearings, Senator Josh Hawley (Republican; Missouri) questioned Jackson regarding her handling of child pornography cases, specifically referencing a three-month prison sentence she imposed in United States v. Hawkins, despite a two-year sentence being sought by prosecutors and Federal Sentencing Guidelines recommending eight years. Jackson defended her decisions, arguing that the guidelines fail to differentiate among defendants and need reform. She emphasized, \"Congress has given judges the discretion to make individualized decisions based on various factors, including the age and circumstances of the defendant.\" In this case, the defendant was eighteen years old. \n\nOn the third day, Jackson was asked about applying Constitutional provisions crafted over two centuries ago to contemporary issues. She explained, \"It's a process of understanding the core foundational principles of the Constitution as originally intended and applying those principles to modern-day situations.\" \n\nSenators Lindsey Graham (Republican; South Carolina) and Ted Cruz (Republican; Texas) continued their questioning regarding light sentences, leading Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (Democrat; Illinois) to intervene frequently on Jackson's behalf. While Durbin noted the interruptions, he was accused of filibustering in favor of the nominee.\n\nOn the final day of the hearings, March 24, Durbin announced that the Judiciary Committee would convene on March 28, potentially setting the stage for a vote on Jackson for April 4. Jackson was absent that day as the Senate heard testimony from other witnesses, including Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who praised Jackson's extraordinary background and legal expertise.\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (Republican; Tennessee) sought access to confidential pre-sentencing reports from Jackson's previous child pornography cases, reports that are protected to safeguard victims. Durbin denied her request, stating, \"I would not want that on my conscience, that we did this for some political exercise, which I think is totally unnecessary, and someone was harmed as a result of it. I'm going to resist it every step of the way.\"\n\nOn April 4, the Judiciary Committee voted 11-11 on Jackson's nomination, resulting in a deadlock that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) later broke with a vote, sending it to the Senate floor.\n\nBefore her nomination, Jackson held several significant positions, including clerk for Breyer, federal public defender, federal district court judge, member of the sentencing commission, and attorney in private practice. The Supreme Court is composed of eight associate justices and one chief justice."}

{"title": "Entomological Society of America renames invasive moth", "content": "**Tuesday, March 8, 2022**\n\nOn Wednesday, the Entomological Society of America officially renamed the caterpillar previously known as the \"gypsy moth\" to \"spongy moth,\" as part of its Better Common Names Project. Its scientific name remains Lymantria dispar.\n\nThe society announced the decision to remove the former name last July, but it was not until last week that the name \"spongy moth\" was unanimously chosen. Magda Matache, a Romani scholar from Harvard University's Roma Program, stated, \"Gypsy is considered a racial slur by many Romani people. It carries a very painful history, and it is offensive.\" The Romani, or Roma, have faced significant prejudice in both Europe and North America.\n\nThe 57 members of the Project who worked on this species reviewed public comments and evaluated over 200 suggested names. The name \"spongy moth,\" derived from the French \"spongieuse,\" was proposed in January. The term \"spongy\" describes the sponge-like appearance of the egg masses that protect the animal's eggs throughout winter. This new name also aligns with its common names in other languages, such as \"sponge-spinner\" in German and \"sponge-knitter\" in Turkish. According to CNN, the species is most likely to spread to new areas during its egg stage, as they can be transported on firewood or vehicles.\n\nNative to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, the spongy moth is a highly destructive invasive species in North America, having first arrived on the continent in 1869. The caterpillars are brown, covered in spines, and feature blue and red spots. They can completely defoliate trees, with spongy moth caterpillars having stripped 1 million acres of North American forests annually since 1980. \n\n\"They essentially behave like The Very Hungry Caterpillar, consuming everything in their path in deciduous forests,\" said Jessica Ware of the Entomological Society of America, referencing the popular children's book. \"'Spongy moth' is already starting to appear in media stories and other online resources, which we're excited about. However, we recognize that this name change won't be immediate,\" she added. \n\n\"Particularly in printed materials or regulations related to L. dispar, it will take time to phase in the use of the new name. The ESA will continue to provide resources to support organizations in adopting this change.\" \n\nThe Entomological Society of America is the world's largest professional organization for insect scientists."}
{"title": "Financial Action Task Force places United Arab Emirates on money laundering 'grey' list", "content": "**Tuesday, March 8, 2022**\n\nOn March 4, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed the United Arab Emirates on its global grey list due to \"strategic deficiencies\" in its efforts to combat \"money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing,\" subjecting it to increased scrutiny. The UAE joins 23 other countries on the list, including regional neighbors Jordan, Syria, Yemen, as well as Pakistan and Turkey, with all actively cooperating with the FATF. While a grey listing is less severe than a 'black' listing—which includes Iran and North Korea—it may harm the UAE's reputation as a business-friendly destination.\n\nThe grey listing could lead to unfavorable rate adjustments, increased transaction costs, and stiffer competition with fellow Gulf state Saudi Arabia. A report from the International Monetary Fund published in May 2021 indicated that grey-listing typically results in an average negative impact of 7.6% on a country's GDP, amounting to approximately USD 27.3 billion based on the UAE's 2020 GDP figures.\n\nAccording to the Paris-based FATF, being grey-listed signifies that the country is committed to swiftly addressing the identified strategic deficiencies. A follow-up evaluation in November 2021 noted progress in four key areas, with the UAE deemed \"compliant\" or \"highly compliant\" with 36 out of 40 recommendations. Since passing a federal decree on money laundering in 2018 to align with international standards, the UAE has established four specialized courts for prosecutions. Additionally, in December 2020, it formed an Executive Office focused on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the FATF has called for improvements in risk management in specific sectors and enhancement of both domestic and international investigations into money laundering.\n\nIn response, the Executive Office stated: \"The UAE will continue its ongoing efforts to identify, disrupt, and penalize criminals and illicit financial networks, in alignment with FATF's findings and the UAE’s National Action Plan.\" The Office also emphasized its commitment to \"close coordination with our international partners.\" Former UAE Foreign Affairs Minister Anwar Gargash tweeted that the UAE remains \"resolute in strengthening strategic cooperation with our partners to address this global challenge.\"\n\nKatherine Bauer, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, criticized the UAE's \"inherent vulnerabilities to illicit finance\" arising from its position as a regional commercial and financial hub, noting that the necessary changes will not occur overnight. The UAE was implicated in the Panama Papers leak in 2016 as \"home to a thriving trade in financial secrecy,\" according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which implicated numerous Emirati officials in questionable activities, including Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's connection to a cybersecurity firm alleged to be involved in espionage.\n\nThe ICIJ described the UAE as \"a center for financial crime,\" highlighting that \"mass surveillance and the monarchy's firm grip on the courts and media make it difficult to challenge the system or expose suspect business dealings.\" Jodi Vittori, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, remarked that \"the U.S. seems to have turned a blind eye to [the UAE's] role in facilitating illicit finance, conflict minerals, and organized crime.\"\n\nThe decision to grey-list the UAE was made during the FATF's sixth plenary session, held under a German presidency from March 2 to 4. During the same session, Zimbabwe was removed from increased monitoring, while France was recognized for having a \"robust and sophisticated\" financial framework, albeit with areas for improvement."}

This marks North Korea's third missile launch of the year, with state media claiming it flew approximately 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) before crashing into the sea.\n\nThe missile, described as \"the Juche weapon representing the power of the DPRK\" and possessing \"superior maneuverability,\" was test-fired for \"final verification of overall technical specifications,\" according to state reports. However, in an email to Al Jazeera, Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul stated that the \"so-called hypersonic weapon is not technologically ready.\" Initially, South Korean military authorities downplayed the missile's significance, but later assessments indicated it demonstrated \"improvement,\" as reported by the Yonhap News Agency.\n\nEarlier this year, North Korea conducted two missile tests: one on the previous Wednesday and another on Monday, both confirmed by South Korea and the Japanese coast guard. The first launch was described by state media as a winter resilience test. North Korea had previously tested its first hypersonic missile, the Hwasong-8, on September 28. Defense expert Ankit Panda from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace indicated that last Wednesday's missile was not the Hwasong-8 but rather a new model showcased at an October weapons exhibition in Pyongyang. Post-September test, Panda referred to the Hwasong-8 as a \"significant milestone\" in comments to the BBC.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations (UN) missions of Albania, France, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint call for dialogue and condemned the initial missile test. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield labeled it \"a significant threat to regional stability.\" On Tuesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressed concerns regarding the tests, especially with the upcoming presidential election scheduled for March.\n\nAccording to the BBC, hypersonic missiles are faster and have a longer capability to evade radar detection compared to traditional ballistic missiles."}

{"title": "Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick resigns amid criticism", "content": "**Saturday, February 12, 2022**\n\nDame Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, resigned on Thursday after losing the support of Mayor Sadiq Khan. Her resignation came just hours after she told BBC Radio London that she had \"absolutely no intention\" of stepping down. In her farewell address, Dick stated that Khan \"no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership,\" indicating that the mayor had left her \"no choice but to step aside.\"\n\nKhan had placed Dick \"on notice\" on February 2, requiring her to implement reforms within the police service in response to a report on police conduct released the day before. The report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) highlighted \"disgraceful\" incidents of bullying, discrimination, misogyny, and sexual harassment within the force. Dick had previously weathered several scandals since 2019, including accusations of misleading the public over the inconclusive Operation Midland investigation, from which she was ultimately cleared.\n\nRecent scrutiny has focused on claims of \"institutional corruption\" within the Met, a charge that Dick denies. This includes offensive remarks—racist, sexist, homophobic, and Islamophobic—made by some officers at Charing Cross railway station from 2016 to 2018. The February 1 report indicated that nine of fourteen officers investigated for sharing derogatory and sexist messages in private group chats continue to serve in the force, with two having been promoted to sergeant.\n\nThe Met also faced criticism for its sluggish investigation into \"Partygate,\" a series of gatherings held at Downing Street in violation of Covid-19 restrictions. Sources have expressed disappointment within the Greater London Authority and the Home Office regarding the police's scandals, with some attributing these issues to Dick's defensiveness.\n\nIn a statement, Khan expressed dissatisfaction with Dick's response to his demands for necessary reforms aimed at rebuilding public trust in the Met. He underscored the urgency of addressing the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, and discrimination still present in the force. Following the report's release, an initial meeting with Dick was deemed inadequate, leading to her resignation before a subsequent meeting could take place.\n\nPublic discontent also arose over the Met's handling of Sarah Everard's murder, committed by former officer Wayne Couzens. Four individuals were arrested during a vigil for Everard last year for breaching Covid-19 restrictions. The Met gained further ridicule in October when it advised women concerned about an approaching officer to call 999 or engage with bystanders rather than seek immediate safety. This was part of a new strategy addressing sexual violence and the creation of a dedicated unit for tackling predatory offenders.\n\nBoth the Met and the government are conducting inquiries into the force’s handling of Everard's case, led by an independent review under Baroness Louise Casey. Additionally, in December, two constables were sentenced to 33 months in prison for sharing inappropriate photos of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, leading to accusations of racism and dehumanization from their mother, Mina Smallman.\n\nIn her earlier interview with Radio London, Dick insisted she would not resign, expressing her frustration with the February 1 report's findings. She maintained accountability and asserted the Met's capability, while acknowledging the damage to its reputation caused by \"awful findings\" alongside other recent distressing incidents.\n\nWhile she claimed to have initiated a \"real transformation\" within the police force, she expressed that she was not complacent and warned of potential future incidents of embarrassment or disgrace in the ongoing efforts to eradicate misconduct. BBC correspondent Lauren Moss noted that Dick's resignation marked the first time she publicly acknowledged the issues.\n\nResponses to Dick's departure were mixed. Former IOPC superintendent and Met officer Nursit Mehtab viewed her resignation as a necessary step to combat a \"sub-culture\" of sexism and racism within the force. Mehtab highlighted the damaging impact of the violent sentiments expressed in the communications of officers on public trust, especially among women and girls.\n\nAlastair Morgan, whose brother Daniel was murdered, criticized Dick for bringing nothing but delays and disappointments to his family's pursuit of justice. Some activists echoed this sentiment, including groups like Reclaim These Streets and Sisters Uncut. Ricky Waumsley, whose partner was one of the victims of serial killer Stephen Port, expressed his approval of Dick's resignation, asserting accountability for the Met's failures.\n\nCalls for substantial change within the police remain. Ruth Davidson of the charity Refuge emphasized that a leadership change alone does not resolve the ingrained misogyny within the institution, advocating for comprehensive reform across the UK. Mehtab reiterated that the issues at the Met cannot be dismissed as a few \"bad apples,\" a term frequently used by the force in deflecting criticism. Journalist Robert Verkaik likened the current scandals to the 1970s Operation Countryman investigation, which led to numerous resignations and retirements among Met officers.\n\nNevertheless, Dick received support from Ken Marsh, chair of the Met Foundation, who argued that she should have been granted more time to rebuild public trust in the police. Khan, along with Home Secretary Priti Patel and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, expressed gratitude for Dick's service. Johnson, who is currently under investigation for his own role in Partygate, acknowledged Dick's dedicated service to the country.\n\nKhan committed to collaborating closely with Patel to swiftly appoint a new commissioner to restore public trust in London’s police while ensuring safety. Dick will serve in a caretaker role until a successor is appointed. \n\nHaving joined the force as a constable in 1983, Dick led the anti-gang Operation Trident in 2003 and was cleared of personal culpability in the investigation following the July 7, 2005 London bombings.

{"title": "Court finds UK allowed undervalued Chinese imports into EU", "content": "**Friday, March 11, 2022**\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) determined that the United Kingdom failed to meet its responsibilities as a former European Union member by permitting \"undervalued imports of textiles and footwear from China\" into EU markets.\n\nThe European Commission contended that HM Revenue and Customs did not fulfill its obligations under EU law, resulting in inadequate collection of customs duties and value-added tax payments for imports of Chinese clothing and footwear between 2011 and 2017. An investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in 2017 revealed that over half of the imported products were found to be priced below \"the lowest acceptable prices\".\n\nThese lowest acceptable prices serve as a risk assessment tool created by OLAF to identify \"imports presenting a significant risk of undervaluation\". OLAF alerted member states about the potential for \"extreme undervaluation\" by shell companies during bilateral discussions with the UK in 2015 and 2016. Nonetheless, the ECJ concluded that British authorities did not employ this metric in their monitoring efforts from 2011 to 2014.\n\nConsequently, the UK failed to conduct \"appropriate customs controls,\" allowing the products to circulate freely within the internal market. For instance, fraud investigators in 2017 discovered that women’s trousers from China were declared at €0.91 per kilogram, which was €0.53 less than the market price for cotton. The Commission estimates this situation cost the EU budget approximately €2.68 billion (around $2.9 billion) from 2011 to 2017, as 80% of customs duties contribute to funding the EU budget.\n\nHowever, the ECJ rejected the Commission’s request for the UK to repay this sum due to discrepancies in the calculations provided, which were deemed not to meet the \"requisite legal standard\". The UK continues to fall under ECJ jurisdiction for infractions committed during its EU membership, even after exiting the EU in January 2020. The court mandated that the UK cover four-fifths of the legal costs incurred by Brussels since OLAF first raised concerns in 2017.\n\nWhile the UK has the option to challenge the fine, it cannot contest the judgment itself. The imposed fine of €2.68 billion is an increase from the original €1.99 billion identified from a sophisticated fraud scheme. Although the current figure pertains to the 2011-2017 period, the investigation initially focused on evidence gathered from 2013 to 2016 at the ports of Felixstowe and Dover in England.\n\nAt that time, a spokesperson for then-Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the sum was \"not a bill. It's an estimate,\" and emphasized, \"we don't recognize the figures.\"\n\nThe Luxembourg-based court concluded that the British government failed \"to apply effective customs control measures or to accurately record the correct amounts of customs duties.\" It further noted that the \"inadequate nature of checks undertaken by the UK customs authorities\" allowed fraudulent shell companies to relocate their operations to the UK.\n\nAdditionally, the ECJ found that the UK did not provide the Commission with all the necessary information for its own calculations.\n\nThe UK continued to resist EU methodologies for assessing undervalued goods, a stance supported by Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Portugal, and Slovakia. Among these, Portugal, Slovakia, and the UK, alongside Malta and Spain, were identified as having \"major undervaluation hubs\" during the first month of OLAF's 2014 Operation Snake.\n\nBritish ports, especially Dover, emerged as primary entry points for Chinese goods before they cleared European customs and were distributed across the continent. In 2016, Bruno Collin, head of a French anti-fraud operation, expressed frustration to Politico Europe regarding the lack of cooperation from British authorities, stating they provided only \"extremely vague answers\" to French inquiries, if they responded at all.\n\nWhen OLAF initially reported on the UK's \"continuous negligence\" in combating fraud, HM Revenue asserted to Politico Europe that it maintained an \"excellent record in tackling fraud and rule-breaking of all kinds.\" However, Collin remarked: \"They don't make an effort.\""}

The motion argued that \"anyone who supports biological men playing in female sports, regardless of age group, level, or code, is complicit in eroding the integrity of female sport and, consequently, women's rights.\" It contended that transgender women pose \"insurmountable physical advantages,\" creating an \"unfair competitive edge\" and safety risks for other athletes in women's sports.\n\nThe motion was defeated by a vote of 49 to 33, with support from the KAP, the Liberal National Party (LNP), and Pauline Hanson's One Nation, while the Labor government and the Greens opposed it. KAP leader Robbie Katter addressed Parliament, stating he believed the issue was \"important for parents.\" He expressed concern for his young daughters and said, \"Imagining them at 15 or 17 years old, post-puberty, competing against someone who might transition to female, that doesn't sit well with me.\" Katter emphasized he did not want to deny anyone the chance to compete in sports but noted that there is a \"distinct advantage when you cross over.\" He also referenced the upcoming federal election, indicating the need to take a stance on relevant social issues.\n\nQueensland Sporting Minister Stirling Hinchliffe opposed the motion, labeling it a \"blatant dog whistle\" and asserting, \"This is not a debate about sport or women's rights. It is an attempt to instigate fear and division, unnecessarily dragging an extreme right-wing narrative into this parliament.\" He criticized making generalizations based solely on gender identity, calling such a move \"draconian and bigoted.\"\n\nRepresentatives from all parties except the LNP participated in the debate, which lasted around 30 minutes. KAP Hinchinbrook MP Nick Dametto suggested there might be individuals who would exploit gender identity to enter women's sports, saying, \"we may see an opportunity for guys who now identify as women to put on a wig and jump into women's sport because maybe they are washed up at the NRL,\" arguing that allowing \"full access\" for transgender individuals in female sports was neither fair nor safe. One Nation MP Stephen Andrew supported the motion, claiming that failure to advocate for the rights of all individuals could lead to the eventual disappearance of women's sports.\n\nThe two Greens representatives opposed the motion. Amy MacMahon, representing South Brisbane, asserted that \"this motion today is not about women; it is about stoking transmisogyny for cheap political gain.\" She advocated for equal pay for women athletes, increased visibility of women's sports on television, and programs to encourage female participation in sports.

{"title": "Ten-year Tennessee study shows preschool associated with poorer student performance", "content": "**Friday, February 11, 2022**\n\nA team led by Dale Farran challenged the notion that prekindergarten provides long-term benefits for children in a recently published paper in Developmental Psychology. The research involved 2,990 low-income children from Tennessee, USA, who applied to the state's free public preschools. This study utilized a natural experiment design, as enrollment was determined by lottery rather than merit. Researchers recorded the academic and personal achievements of the students from preschool through sixth grade nearly a decade later.\n\nFindings revealed that, while pre-K graduates initially seemed better prepared for school, their peers who did not attend preschool eventually caught up. By the end of second grade, those who had not participated in preschool were outperforming their counterparts who had. The gap continued to widen: by sixth grade, students who skipped preschool exhibited fewer disciplinary problems, lower absenteeism rates, and were less likely to require special education services. There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the two groups.\n\nIn 2015, then-Governor of Tennessee Bill Haslam questioned whether the quality of preschool programs could be a contributing factor. Steven Barnett from Rutgers University's National Institute for Early Education Research concurred, pinpointing several flaws in the state's approach to establishing new preschools, particularly the absence of quality control, which left uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of classroom instruction.\n\nAll preschool classes included in the study were taught by licensed teachers in the same facilities as public schools for older children. A similar research effort focused on Boston, Massachusetts, published in 2021, indicated that preschool was associated with improved academic and disciplinary outcomes, which contradicted Farran's findings.\n\nFarran hypothesized that the unexpected results might stem from the level of control and discipline exerted by teachers. Most Tennessee preschool instructors were certified to teach pre-K through fifth or eighth grade, meaning their specialized training for children under five was limited. Additionally, since the preschools were part of larger public school buildings, students often spent considerable time being escorted between classrooms, bathrooms, and cafeterias, where both their movement and noise levels were carefully managed.\n\nAs of 2022, Tennessee ranked 38th out of 50 US states in terms of K-12 education quality, according to the World Population Review.

{"title": "UK clarifies foreign, domestic response to cost of living crisis", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\nMonday, March 14, 2022\n\nWikinews recently obtained clarification from the United Kingdom Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) concerning the government's measures in response to the cost of living crisis stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe UK government foresaw Russian escalation against Ukraine for several months and coordinated responses with NATO and the European Union. Following the invasion in February, many \"swift retributive responses\" were enacted, including an unprecedented sanctions package that encompasses \"financial, trade, aircraft, shipping, and immigration sanctions\" aimed at pressuring Russia to halt actions destabilizing Ukraine. A recent commitment by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Tuesday to phase out Russian oil and natural gas in the UK by year's end is part of these sanctions.\n\nThis announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden's declaration of a ban on imports of Russian oil, coal, and gas. However, a UK government spokesperson emphasized caution, stating: \"We cannot have a cliff-edge where oil and gas are abandoned overnight. Turning off the taps would jeopardize energy security, British jobs, and industry, making us even more reliant on foreign imports.\"\n\nThe European Commission is similarly cautious, planning to reduce the EU's Russian import dependence by two-thirds this year and to cease imports \"well before 2030.\" While Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas, much of the UK's energy is generated domestically. The spokesperson highlighted this distinction: \"Our single largest source of gas comes from the UK Continental Shelf, with most imports from reliable suppliers such as Norway. There are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK to Russia, and Russian imports accounted for less than 4% of total UK gas supply in 2021.\"\n\nMinisters continue to engage regularly with energy-intensive industries to manage costs and maintain energy supply. A government FAQ published on February 25 noted that the UK has three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, while Germany has none, urging European countries to reduce reliance on Russian gas through alternative supplies.\n\nA press release issued Tuesday specifically condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion as \"illegal.\" The spokesperson remarked: \"We continue to monitor the impacts of Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on the cost of living in the UK and will keep our approach under review.\" The release asserted that Russian oil \"is already being ostracized by the market\" and assured that \"in a competitive global market for oil and petroleum products, demand can be met by alternative suppliers.\"\n\nDespite these measures, high inflation, already linked to rising petrol costs, continues to escalate. The Bank of England previously projected inflation would climb to about 7% in spring, up from 5.4% last year, with some economists estimating it could near 8% next month.\n\nConsultancy firm The Centre for Economics and Business Research significantly reduced its 2022 growth expectations from 4.2% to 1.9% on Tuesday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) reported that the £9 billion financial support package from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak would offset only about one-fifth of the increase in household energy bills.\n\nA government spokesperson acknowledged concerns regarding the cost of living, stating: \"We have introduced a generous support package worth around £21 billion, including a £150 council tax rebate from April and a £200 energy bill discount in October, aimed at quickly reducing energy costs for most households.\" They added: \"This financial year and next, we are providing support to families worth around £20 billion, including adjustments to Universal Credit to ensure that work pays, freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down, and providing £9.1 billion to assist 27 million households with their energy bills.\" Notably, all these measures were implemented before the Russian invasion commenced on February 24.\n\nOn February 3, it was announced that homeowners in England within Council Tax bands A-D would receive £150 off their council tax payments, alongside a £200 energy bill discount in autumn, which would be automatically repaid over five years—a move criticized by Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer as a \"forced loan.\"\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, Starmer criticized Sunak for proposing this loan approach. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the £20 billion support package as \"unprecedented\" and pledged to present an energy independence plan in the coming days.\n\nIn his autumn budget statement on October 27, Sunak announced alterations to Universal Credit and the continued freeze on fuel levies. Changes included reducing the Universal Credit taper rate from 63 pence to 55 pence and a sustained freeze on fuel duties that have not been lifted in twelve years, saving motorists an estimated £1900.\n\nThe budget statement outlined a \"radical simplification\" of alcohol duties, reducing taxable bands from fifteen to six while suspending a planned increase, resulting in a £3 billion loss to HM Treasury. This proposal received backing from numerous organizations, including the British Beer and Pub Association.\n\nDespite these measures, criticisms persist regarding their effectiveness. With Sunak's spring statement anticipated on March 23, Conservative MPs have urged the Chancellor to explore additional options. A source indicated that officials in HM Treasury are contemplating alternatives, citing the unprecedented rise in oil prices.\n\nAnalysts have projected that household gas and electricity bills could soar to £3000 annually following the invasion. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced it would increase the cap on default energy tariffs by 54% to £1971 starting in April. \n\nAlthough oil prices stabilized below USD 120 per barrel on Wednesday, Brent Crude briefly reached a high of $147.50 per barrel, remaining significantly elevated compared to pre-invasion levels. To mitigate the financial strain on British consumers, Sir Keir advocated for increased nuclear energy, renewable resources, and home insulation during PMQs. Johnson defended the government's record on renewables, asserting that the UK is \"the Saudi Arabia of wind power.\" The spokesperson reiterated the need to phase out reliance on Russian oil and gas in Europe, emphasizing a shift towards nuclear and renewable energy.\n\nThe spokesperson noted: \"Companies and skilled workers across the UK gas sector are striving to maximize production this winter, supported by several new wells and fields commissioned recently.\" However, the spokesperson did not address Wikinews' inquiry regarding the Abigail oil field development, approved on February 2 by an Israeli firm. Previously, the Oil and Gas Authority director stated that oil and gas will remain integral to Britain's energy framework for decades.\n\nContinuing, the government spokesperson remarked: \"The issues we are currently facing are primarily due to high international gas prices, not supply insufficiencies. Additional UK oil and gas licensing is not expected to bring immediate relief.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has called for the implementation of a windfall profits tax on major fossil fuel companies, including BP and Shell, which reported record-breaking profits for 2021 last month—BP’s profits soaring to $12.8 billion from a loss of $5.7 billion in 2020, and Shell’s climbing to $19.3 billion from $4.85 billion in 2020.\n\nFollowing BP's announcement, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated on Twitter, \"The chancellor’s energy plans last week left families more worried than ever. It’s time for Labour’s plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut bills.\" However, during PMQs, Johnson cautioned against a windfall tax, describing it as a \"sober, responsible approach\" and warning that such a tax could prompt oil companies to raise their prices further, complicating efforts to lessen dependence on Russian oil and gas.\n\nThe UK government spokesperson reiterated concerns, stating: \"A windfall tax could jeopardize £14 billion worth of impending investment opportunities, risking energy supply security and almost 200,000 jobs reliant on the industry. Oil and gas firms in the North Sea already face a tax rate on their profits that is more than double that levied on other businesses, having contributed over £375 billion in production taxes to date.\"\n\nThe government also faces criticism for its plans to retrofit homes lacking proper insulation. Following the cancellation of the green homes grant last March, which only installed 5800 energy efficiency measures, the spokesperson responded: \"We are investing nearly £6.6 billion to support the installation of energy efficiency measures in low-performance homes, particularly for low-income homeowners and tenants. The Heat and Buildings Strategy outlines our comprehensive approach to initiating the transition to low-carbon heat and developing the heat pump market, including a new £450 million Boiler Upgrade Scheme, the £950 million Home Upgrade Grant, and the £60 million Heat Pump Ready research program.\""}

During a press conference to unveil the deal on Wednesday, Niinistö remarked that Russia was \"ready to attack a neighboring country,\" and if Russia expressed concern over Finland joining NATO, he would respond with, \"you caused this; look in the mirror.\"\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Finland, led by Marin, is expected to announce its position on NATO membership tomorrow. According to Politico, the party is \"almost certain to favor membership.\" If this aligns with their position, Finland could potentially join the alliance as early as Monday.

{"title": "Koalas labeled as 'endangered' in eastern states of Australia", "content": "**Monday, February 14, 2022**\n\nOn Friday, Australia's federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, announced the classification of the koala as an endangered species in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. This decision follows proposals from the World Wildlife Fund Australia (WWF-Australia) and other organizations made in 2020. Previously, the koala was designated as a vulnerable species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) continues to list it as vulnerable in other parts of the world.\n\nFactors contributing to the decline in the koala population include natural disasters, particularly the devastating bushfire season of 2019-2020, which reportedly \"killed, injured, or affected\" around 60,000 koalas, according to WWF-Australia. Additionally, ongoing challenges such as drought, urbanization, and habitat destruction have exacerbated the population decline. In response, the government has announced initiatives aimed at preventing the koala's extinction.\n\nA report released in April 2020 highlighted a 50% decline in koala populations in Queensland and a 62% drop in New South Wales since 2001. This prompted WWF-Australia, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), and Humane Society International (HSI) to recommend that the IUCN revise the species' status, which had remained 'vulnerable' for a decade. A New South Wales inquiry in June 2020 warned that without effective intervention, koalas could face extinction by 2050.\n\nIn her announcement, Ley stated that these alarming trends \"have led to the advice\" regarding the species’ status change. She emphasized the importance of this decision as a potential turning point for koala conservation, asserting that \"there is still time to save this globally iconic species.\" Ley stressed the need for stronger laws and incentives for landholders to protect koala habitats, noting that AUD 74 million (USD 52.9 million) has been allocated to support these initiatives.\n\nHowever, some conservation groups have voiced their concerns. Deborah Tabart, president of the Australian Koala Foundation, asserted that the species is also endangered in Victoria and South Australia, criticizing the federal government for permitting habitat loss. HSI campaign director Alexia Wellbelove urged the government to address broader environmental issues, advocating for a review by Graeme Samuel, the former head of the competition watchdog, who previously concluded that the government had failed to take adequate conservation measures and called for a reevaluation of environmental standards."}

If the acquisition had succeeded, it would have represented the largest deal since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and one of the biggest transactions involving companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nA successful deal would likely involve integrating GSK’s division into Unilever's beauty and personal care business, which has faced profit margin challenges due to COVID-19 lockdowns and rising costs for plastics and petrochemicals.\n\nUnilever's website mentioned that it had approached GSK and Pfizer regarding a potential acquisition, stating that GSK Consumer Healthcare “would be a strong strategic fit.” However, GSK indicated that the proposals were carefully evaluated by its board but were unanimously rejected, concluding they were \"not in the best interests of GSK shareholders\" and did \"not reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times noted that the latest proposal lacked an acquisition premium or acknowledgment of corporate synergies. GSK and Pfizer's joint venture was expected to generate GBP 500 million in cost savings by this year, with substantial cost synergies anticipated. BBC business editor Simon Jack highlighted that a typical takeover premium could be around 30%, although this might be offset by GSK's projected GBP 10 billion in debt, part of a total net debt of GBP 22 billion reported for Q3 2021.\n\nThe GSK board assessed the proposals in light of a planned demerger of GSK Consumer Health into a separate PLC later this year. Jack noted that GSK maintained an \"open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.\" However, Unilever's proposal did not consider the standard takeover premium, the potential value of cost savings, or the board's confidence that Consumer Health could achieve \"superior organic sales growth\" of 4% to 6% in the medium term. Analysts from Goldman Sachs and Barclays valued GSK Consumer Healthcare at around GBP 50 billion, while Jeffries Group set a lower estimate of GBP 45 billion.\n\nCurrently, there are no ongoing talks between Unilever and either Pfizer or GSK, with Unilever stating, \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\" Under CEO Alan Jope, Unilever has focused its investments and marketing on brands that convey a strong environmental or social purpose, while strategically streamlining its portfolio in sectors like beauty products and tea. Jope had previously expressed Unilever's intent to pursue smaller acquisitions in areas such as luxury beauty and wellness.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, remarked to the BBC that this would be a \"high risk deal,\" especially considering investor caution regarding GSK's performance amid rising inflation, which he believes favors \"consumer goods with loyal customers.\" Despite Unilever's strong cash flow, the company has recently missed targets for sales and profit margins, exerting additional pressure on the CEO.\n\nAdditionally, GSK CEO Emma Walmsley is facing increased scrutiny from activist shareholders Elliott Management Corporation and Bluebell Capital Partners due to the unit's struggles in developing a COVID-19 vaccine and her perceived lack of scientific expertise. GSK is engaged in ongoing vaccine development in collaboration with French biopharmaceutical firm Sanofi and announced preliminary results from Phase 3 trials last month.\n\nIn 2018, Unilever acquired several consumer nutritional products from GSK, including its flagship product Horlicks, and merged its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever, with GSK Consumer Healthcare India."}
{"title": "Bans off Our Bodies protests occur across United States after leaked Supreme Court draft", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\nOn Saturday, May 14, 2022, thousands participated in the \"Bans Off Our Bodies\" protests, which organizers claimed were held in over 380 cities and towns across the United States. Demonstrators called for the government to uphold the legality and accessibility of abortion services. Earlier this month, Politico released a leaked draft of a US Supreme Court decision indicating that a majority of justices were prepared to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Protests occurred in major cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York, with approximately 20,000 participants in Washington D.C. alone.\n\n\"It's the most critical issue right now because if the leaked opinion takes effect, it could impact various rights—not just reproductive choice but also healthcare rights,\" said Ann Hoffman, a 79-year-old protester in Washington D.C., who has been advocating for women's rights since the 1970s.\n\nA small group of anti-abortion counter-protesters also gathered in Washington D.C. on the same day. One counter-protester, 24-year-old Anna Lulis from Virginia, held a sign that read, \"Women's rights begin in the womb.\" Police ensured the two groups remained separate, though some confrontations occurred.\n\nIf Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, the legality of abortion would revert to individual states. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that 26 of the 50 states are \"certain or likely\" to impose abortion bans. Many states have already enacted \"trigger laws\" that would automatically ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nThe leaked draft pertains to the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which was presented to the Court last December. Mississippi had implemented a law prohibiting nearly all abortions after 15 weeks, based on the assertion that a 15-week-old fetus could potentially survive outside the womb with medical assistance. Traditionally, it is understood that a fetus cannot survive outside the uterus until 24 weeks. Through state representative Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi requested that the Supreme Court overturn its 1973 ruling affirming women's constitutional right to abortion, while Jackson Women's Health Organization, the last remaining abortion clinic in the state, contends there is no basis for such a reversal.\n\nEarlier this week, US Senate members attempted to pass federal legislation that would ensure the legality of abortion nationwide, thereby overriding state laws, but fell short of the required votes for approval.\n\nDespite Roe v. Wade, many states have enacted laws restricting abortion access or complicating the process, for instance, by instituting mandatory waiting periods that necessitate patients taking additional time off work. Recently, Texas passed legislation limiting abortions to the first six weeks after the last menstrual period, a timeframe when many women may be unaware of their pregnancy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has encouraged Americans to support pro-abortion-rights candidates in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections."}

{"title": "UK defers junk food deals, advertisement restrictions", "content": "**Tuesday, May 17, 2022**\n\nThe United Kingdom's Department of Health and Social Care announced on Friday that the implementation of restrictions on multibuy promotional deals and online and TV advertising for junk food will be postponed for one year. \n\nThis delay impacts the planned ban on promotions encouraging multiple purchases of foods high in fat, salt, or sugar, such as buy one, get one free offers and complimentary soft drink refills. Additionally, the restrictions on paid TV advertisements before 9 p.m. and online advertising will also be deferred. \n\nAccording to a Department press release, the postponement is attributed to the \"unprecedented global economic situation\" and aims to provide businesses \"more time to prepare for the restrictions on advertising\" while allowing the government to \"review and monitor the impact\" of the multibuy ban. The statement noted, \"Economies around the world have faced higher-than-expected global energy and goods prices, leading to increased costs across supply chains that affect both businesses and consumers.\"\n\nThe ban on multibuy deals will now take effect in October 2023, while the advertising restrictions are postponed until January 2024. However, placement restrictions for such products in stores, at checkouts, and on supermarket websites and apps will still be enforced starting in October 2022 as originally planned. \n\nChef and campaigner Jamie Oliver criticized the decision as \"a wasted opportunity\" that could undermine the obesity strategy, calling for \"real leadership\" from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ensure a healthier future for young people. He was supported by Barbara Crowther of the Children's Food Campaign and Graham MacGregor, a cardiologist and campaigner at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nWhile Public Health Minister Maggie Throup emphasized the government's commitment to helping individuals lead healthier lives, Labour's Andrew Gwynne described the decision as a reversal.\n\nThe press release reiterated the government's priority to address obesity, which it claims will help alleviate the strain on the NHS as it recuperates from COVID-19 backlogs. Media, Data and Digital Minister Julia Lopez highlighted an investment of £550 million to improve access to sport and physical activity nationwide, demonstrating the commitment to tackling childhood obesity.\n\nGwynne argued that Johnson's desire to maintain his position is prioritizing Conservative MPs' ideologies over children's health, stating, \"Instead of cutting childhood obesity, preventing ill-health and easing pressure on the NHS, this chaotic government is performing another U-turn.\" The Independent reported that some backbench Conservative MPs criticized the delay, viewing it as a reinforcement of a \"nanny state.\"\n\nReports suggest that Johnson made the decision following a ministerial meeting on the cost of living last Wednesday, where ministers outlined the potential financial impact of the bans on food and advertising agencies. Additionally, The Guardian and The Independent noted speculation that the government might ultimately scrap the restrictions altogether. MacGregor lamented that Johnson had the opportunity to leave a significant legacy in combating obesity but instead capitulated to his MPs and an aggressive food industry, which had begun to comply with the proposals.\n\nWhen the restrictions were initially announced in November 2020, 800 food and drink manufacturers, including Britvic and Kellogg's, criticized the ban as \"disproportionate,\" claiming that the evidence supporting these proposals was insufficient. Last month, Kellogg's even took legal action against the government regarding product placement restrictions.\n\nThe Food and Drink Federation supported the delay, citing \"high inflation\" as a logical reason, whereas the Children's Food Campaign contended that multibuy deals do not benefit consumers financially but rather encourage greater junk food purchases. Recent figures revealed that two in five Britons are purchasing less food as the Bank of England warns that inflation could exceed 10% this year.\n\nThe press release also promised a public consultation on TV and paid online advertisements in the coming weeks. Broadcasters could stand to lose over £200 million in annual revenue if the ban on junk food advertising post-watershed is enacted.\n\nIn light of these developments, the government promoted its recently passed calorie labeling laws and efforts to alleviate the cost of living. The Department also announced plans to publish a Health Disparities white paper and launch a Better Health: Rewards scheme aimed at addressing obesity."}
{"title": "Hungary extends fuel price cap", "content": "**Wednesday, February 16, 2022**\n\nOn Saturday, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced a three-month extension of Hungary's price cap on standard motor fuels, originally implemented on November 15 and set to expire on Sunday. The government aims to curb inflation and support the economy with this initiative, although it does not provide compensation to petrol stations for their losses. A general election is scheduled for April 3, where all opposition parties in Parliament, except one, have united to challenge the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance, which has been in power for twelve years.\n\nOrbán made the announcement during his annual speech, stating, \"The 'price-stop' has proven effective, so we will extend it for an additional three months.\" The official gazette, Magyar Közlöny, published the corresponding government resolution No. 39/2022 the following day. A week earlier, Deputy Finance Minister András Tállai informed the news agency MTI that tax authority inspections of over 2,000 fuel stations found no recurring violations of the price cap, although 12 stations were fined a total of HUF 3.2 million (USD 10,140). \"The stations are adhering to the established rules, which is evident in the absence of repeated violations over the past three months,\" Tállai added.\n\nOrbán noted, \"We have the fifth lowest fuel price in the European Union. Currently, we pay 480 forints per liter, but without the 'price-stop,' we would be paying well over 500 forints.\" According to price-aggregator site holtankoljak.hu, uncapped prices have reached HUF 512 for gasoline and HUF 530 for diesel, with wholesale prices surpassing consumer prices since February 4. Data from the aggregator indicated that three stations permanently closed in the first week of February due to the price cap. By law, the government can appoint new operators for these closed stations.\n\nOn November 10, the government introduced the HUF 480 (USD 1.52) price cap, with further details communicated to the press the following day. The corresponding act, government resolution No. 624/2021, was published in the official gazette on the day of the announcement, while follow-up resolution No. 626/2021, published on November 13, outlined the implementation process. The cap applies to unleaded 95 and standard diesel fuels, excluding liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and premium fuels. However, stations that do not sell standard fuels must offer premium fuels at the capped price.\n\nAs a result, retail petrol stations incur losses as they cannot negotiate wholesale prices. During a press briefing on November 11, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Gergely Gulyás stated that there are no plans to compensate these losses, adding that \"vendors cannot be forced to trade.\" The following day, Ottó Grád, secretary general of the Hungarian Petroleum Association, indicated that owners of small, independent stations might consider closing. Contrary to Gulyás' comments, the detailed resolution stipulates that petrol stations cannot close temporarily or reduce their operating hours.\n\nThe government has also indicated that it does not plan to lower tax rates on fuel. Last week, the European Commission’s oil bulletin revealed that taxes account for 47% of the consumer price for unleaded 95 and 45% for standard diesel in Hungary. Cumulative data from the Hungarian Petroleum Association for 2021 shows that unleaded 95 represents 79% of all gasoline sales, while standard diesel constitutes 88% of diesel sales in the country. Between 2020 and 2021, consumer prices surged for unleaded 95 from HUF 332 to 506 and for standard diesel from HUF 341 to 517, according to price-comparison site holtankoljak.hu. Additionally, 444.hu reported that deteriorating HUF-USD exchange rates contributed to rising prices even in July, despite declining crude oil prices.\n\nThe Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported that inflation reached 7.9% in January. In his speech announcing the extension, Prime Minister Orbán claimed the fuel price cap has reduced inflation by 0.5%."}

{"title": "Scientists announce decoy-proof Ebola antibodies", "content": "**Saturday, March 19, 2022**\n\nA groundbreaking study published on Thursday in *Cell* unveils a new antibody treatment for the lethal diseases caused by the Ebola virus and its relatives. Researchers from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases have identified two antibodies, 1C3 and 1C11, that effectively target both Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus.\n\nCurrently, there are no available vaccines or antibody treatments specifically for ebolaviruses other than Zaire ebolavirus. LJI President and CEO Erica Ollmann Saphire emphasized the significance of discovering antibodies with such broad efficacy, stating, \"Finding antibodies with this breadth is important because we don't know which virus in the genus of ebolaviruses is going to break out next.\"\n\nAmong the six ebolaviruses known to science, Zaire and Sudan are the deadliest, with the 2010 outbreak of the Zaire virus resulting in over 11,000 fatalities. A key advancement reported in this study is the use of cryogenic electron microscopy to visualize how and where the antibodies interact with the viruses.\n\nThe research revealed that antibody 1C3 binds to the viral glycoprotein not in the usual lock-and-key manner, but rather sideways, simultaneously blocking three binding sites. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by attaching to their antigens. Meanwhile, 1C11 disrupts the virus's ability to enter human cells. Since Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses employ remarkably similar mechanisms, 1C11 proves effective against both.\n\nThe primary advantage of these new antibodies lies in their resistance to cross-reactivity. When viruses like Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses invade the body, they often release excess glycoprotein that can mislead antibodies, causing up to 90 percent to bind to this decoy rather than the actual virus. In contrast, 1C3 and 1C11 specifically target the genuine pathogen.\n\nThis specificity allows treatments utilizing 1C3 and 1C11 to be effective even at lower doses compared to other therapies. Preliminary tests in non-human primates have shown that even minimal doses were 100 percent effective, suggesting that human treatments may be more economically viable than previously thought.\n\nLJI scientists highlight two significant benefits of using these antibodies. First, they enable the treatment of patients with unidentified ebolavirus species using an effective antibody cocktail targeting multiple viruses—a crucial factor when time is critical. Second, these antibodies could remain effective in patients at later stages of the disease.\n\nThe experiments were conducted using samples donated to Emory University by two Ebola survivors."}

The ruling, which opposed the Russian invasion, was rejected by Russia and China.\n\nUkraine initiated the case on February 26, just two days after the onset of the invasion. Russia characterized its actions as a \"special military operation\" aimed at safeguarding Russian-speaking communities in Eastern Ukraine from alleged genocide, a claim that Ukraine contests as baseless. During the proceedings, Russia argued it was acting in self-defense.\n\nUkrainian representative to the ICJ, Anton Korynevych, asserted, \"Russia must be stopped.\" Ukraine argued that the United Nations Genocide Convention does not allow for invasion as a form of defense against genocide and denied any intentions or actions that could be construed as such.\n\nThe court ultimately ruled in favor of Ukraine, stating, \"The civilian population affected by the present conflict is extremely vulnerable. The 'special military operation' conducted by the Russian Federation has led to numerous civilian casualties and injuries.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky celebrated the decision on Twitter, declaring, \"Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case.\" He also emphasized, \"Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further.\"\n\nPreviously, Russia had boycotted the ICJ hearing, filing a response on March 7 that claimed the court lacks jurisdiction in this matter.

{"title": "Scientists use DNA analysis to track elephant poaching networks", "content": "**Friday, February 18, 2022**\n\nA study published on Monday in Nature Human Behaviour by a team primarily from the University of Washington Center for Forensic Science has revealed a novel application of DNA analysis techniques, originally developed for human dental studies, to trace ivory poached from African elephants. In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the researchers successfully identified criminal networks responsible for the poaching of these endangered animals and the smuggling of their valuable tusks across international borders.\n\nThe scientists analyzed DNA samples from 4,320 tusks confiscated from both African bush (Loxodonta africana) and African forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) elephants over 49 separate ivory smuggling incidents in twelve countries from 2002 to 2019. Their findings indicated that tusks from closely related elephants, or even from the same individual, were frequently found in different shipments passing through the same ports. The study also highlighted how these criminal networks adjusted their operations between various port cities, suggesting that poachers killed elephants and separated the tusks at intervals along the smuggling routes.\n\nThe research team, which has been investigating DNA analysis of poached tusks for several years, previously discovered in 2018 that two tusks from distinct shipments originated from the same animal, indicating that both shipments came from the same kill and were trafficked by the same criminal network. This study marks the first documented identification of tusks linked to elephants within the same familial group.\n\nLead author Dr. Samuel Wasser emphasized the significance of these findings: \"Identifying close relatives suggests that poachers are likely returning to the same populations repeatedly—year after year—resulting in tusks being acquired and smuggled out of Africa by the same criminal networks.\" He further noted that this strategy complicates law enforcement efforts to track and seize ivory shipments, given the tremendous pressure to rapidly process large volumes of goods at ports.\n\nWasser expressed hope that similar studies would furnish law enforcement with a broader array of evidence to effectively prosecute poachers and their collaborators by establishing verifiable connections among different ivory caches. The authors concluded that their research could assist authorities in understanding how poachers collaborate.\n\nHumans have utilized ivory from elephant tusks for artistic, decorative, and practical purposes since prehistoric times. Despite numerous countries outlawing ivory sales, poaching continues to claim the lives of tens of thousands of elephants each year.\n\nThe study's authors include researchers from the University of Washington, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Kenyan organization SeeJ-Africa, the Kenya Wildlife Service, and Singapore's National Parks Board."}

The AFP cautioned that price gouging could result in a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of AUD 66,000.\n\nAccording to Australian law, price gouging occurs when an individual or business purchases a rapid antigen test kit from a retailer and then sells it for more than 20% above the purchase price. This regulation does not apply to businesses that acquire kits from wholesalers. The AFP has the authority to seize test kits and transfer them to the national medical stockpile if they suspect price gouging is taking place.\n\nIn a statement, the AFP reported that two investigations have been initiated in New South Wales and Queensland, with more anticipated in the future. These investigations will be managed by Taskforce LOTUS, established by the AFP in 2021 to address risks associated with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The taskforce will refer allegations of price gouging to specialized strike teams deployed across Australia.\n\nAFP Assistant Commissioner Nigel Ryan emphasized that the AFP will maintain a zero-tolerance policy for profiteering from rapid antigen tests. \"The AFP will utilize its full authority to combat RAT price gouging. Not only is this practice unethical, but it is also illegal, and the AFP is committed to using its extensive resources to safeguard the public from such unlawful exploitation,” Assistant Commissioner Ryan asserted.\n\n\"Commonwealth and state agencies are collaborating on this matter, and under Taskforce LOTUS, the AFP has no qualms about enforcing the law to ensure the safety of Australians. Those who violate the law could face up to five years in prison or a AUD 66,000 fine.

Griffin was acquitted of disorderly conduct in the same ruling.\n\nGriffin is among the hundreds of Americans charged in connection with the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, when Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence were counting electoral votes from the November 2020 presidential election. This trial marks the second related to these events and is the first bench trial.\n\nA founding member of Cowboys for Trump, Griffin faced charges of entering a restricted area and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. Prosecutors, led by Senior Assistant U.S. Attorney Janani Iyengar, contended that Griffin climbed over a wall and a temporary staircase to gain access to the Capitol. Judge McFadden remarked, \"All of this would suggest to a normal person that perhaps you should not be entering the area.\" Video evidence and testimony from another participant in the Capitol attack also supported the case against Griffin.\n\nThe judge emphasized that \"the defendant is never seen engaging in the kind of property destruction or physical violence\" depicted in the government's presentation of the crowd's actions. He further noted that none of Griffin's statements on that day specifically incited violence, characterizing them as free speech rather than disorderly conduct. Griffin's attorneys argued that there were no signs indicating \"do not enter\" within the Capitol.\n\nMcFadden's ruling establishes a precedent, clarifying that the Capitol was a restricted area on January 6 due to the presence of Secret Service personnel protecting Vice President Pence. Griffin's legal team contended that the building no longer qualified as restricted once Pence was evacuated to a secure underground location, marking the first public disclosure of Pence's whereabouts during the attack.\n\nGriffin is the first January 6 defendant to undergo a bench trial. In U.S. courts, defendants typically have the right to a jury trial but may opt for a judge-only trial. The only other January 6 defendant to be tried thus far was Guy Reffitt, who was convicted on five counts in a jury trial earlier this month.\n\nAfter the verdict, Griffin stated to the media, \"I wear January 6 like a badge of honor,\" claiming that the U.S. government was responsible for orchestrating the situation that led to the Capitol storming. He is scheduled for sentencing on June 17, 2022.\n\nJudge McFadden was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump. \n\nOn January 6, 2021, a significant crowd gathered in Washington, D.C., for a rally supporting then-President Trump, who had repeatedly asserted that he, rather than Joe Biden, was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. Trump addressed the protesters, encouraging them to march to the Capitol, although he did not incite violence.

Although it was adopted as a national flag in 1995, the copyright remained with Thomas, meaning that the flag could only be used with his permission or compensation.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the flag would now be treated similarly to the national flag, which can be used by anyone as long as it is displayed in a \"respectful and dignified way.\" Morrison declared, \"All Australians can now put the Aboriginal Flag on apparel such as sports jerseys and shirts, paint it on sports grounds, include it on websites, in paintings and other artworks, and use it digitally and in any other medium without seeking permission or paying a fee. We've freed the Aboriginal Flag for Australians.\"\n\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt expressed that, \"Over the last 50 years we made Harold Thomas’ artwork our own — we marched under the Aboriginal Flag, stood behind it, and flew it high as a point of pride. Now that the Commonwealth holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and no one can take it away.\"\n\nThe commercial implications surrounding the flag became apparent in 2019 when WAM Clothing, a licensed clothing company, issued notices to the National Rugby League and Australian Football League, claiming that jerseys worn during Indigenous rounds infringed on their copyright. At that time, Wyatt encouraged football fans to protest the claim by wearing the flag. Similar notices were reportedly issued to several other organizations.\n\nUnder the deal, the government allocated A$20.05 million to Thomas and other license holders to secure copyright and buy back the rights of license holders. The government has committed to:\n\n- Transferring future royalties from commercial flag sales into a fund supporting NAIDOC Week;\n- Establishing a A$100,000 scholarship in Thomas' honor for Indigenous students to cultivate leadership skills;\n- Accepting and displaying a painting by Thomas commemorating the flag's 50th anniversary and the transfer of copyright;\n- Creating a web portal dedicated to the flag's history and education.\n\nBangarang woman Geraldine Atkinson expressed her enthusiasm about the flag being passed to the government, stating the announcement provided Indigenous Australians with something to celebrate on Australia Day. She remarked, \"When I read it, it was the first I’d heard about it, and I punched the air, I was so excited [...] We're not going to be celebrating the day, but we're going to be celebrating our flag. We'll celebrate that we can fly our flag and wear it on our shirts.\"\n\nWhile Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe welcomed the news, she raised concerns regarding the deal, saying, \"I’m worried that the Commonwealth owning the copyright over our flag has implications for the unceded sovereignty and self-determination of our people [...] We need genuine discussions about what it means for the Commonwealth to hold the copyright of our flag and whether other models of community ownership were seriously considered. For now, this is a win.\"\n\nLabor Party Senator Malarndirri McCarthy indicated she would scrutinize the deal during the upcoming Senate budget estimates, expressing, \"I look forward to examining the details of this deal, particularly regarding the copyright and custodianship of the flag. Scott Morrison and the Indigenous Affairs Minister also need to clarify the funding source for this deal.\""}

The threat interrupted Coveney’s speech during the \"Building Common Ground\" peace-building event at the John and Pat Hume Foundation and led to the evacuation of over twenty-five homes.\n\nPolice reported that between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, a white Vauxhall van was hijacked near Shankill Road. The driver, who was reportedly threatened by two gunmen while his family was in danger, was forced to carry what was believed to be explosives. Initially, he drove to a nearby street where the device was placed inside the vehicle before proceeding to the Holy Cross Chapel, adjacent to the Houben Centre where Coveney was addressing attendees.\n\nCoveney had just begun his speech when security personnel alerted him to the bomb threat, leading to his swift evacuation to a \"secure location\" by the PSNI and Gardaí, according to priest Gary Donegan, who spoke before him.\n\nAttendee Sarah McKinley from Downtown Radio and Cool FM described the driver as a \"workman, clutching a tool bag outside\". She noted he was in tears, apologizing to guests after informing security, and appeared \"completely shell-shocked\", conveying that he had been hijacked and ordered to drive the van to the Centre.\n\nMcEwan stated that the driver is currently hospitalized but did not provide details regarding his condition. He emphasized the harrowing situation the driver faced: \"Just think about this: the victim believed at this point he was driving a van containing a live bomb — while his family was being threatened.\"\n\nAccording to McEwan, a security threat persists in Northern Ireland, with \"an attack is likely\". He refrained from commenting on whether the weapons used to threaten the driver were real, mentioning that the perceived danger felt genuine at the time. He also did not confirm if Coveney was the specific target or if he required increased security. Coveney and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar have previously been depicted in loyalist graffiti.\n\nA source told The Irish Times that loyalists are blaming Irish ministers, including Coveney and Varadkar, for feeling undermined by the contentious post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The Irish Independent reported that the hoax was related to this Protocol and had been planned ahead of time.\n\nThis incident follows the UK counter-intelligence agency MI5's recent decision to lower its terrorist threat assessment for Northern Ireland from 'severe' to 'substantial'. At that time, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis remarked that the change reflected \"the significant progress that Northern Ireland has made, and continues to make, towards a more peaceful, prosperous, and safer society,\" while also emphasizing the need for vigilance against the \"minority\" threatening peace.\n\nPoliticians across Ireland and the UK condemned the threats. Coveney expressed his \"saddened and frustrated\" feelings regarding the victimization of the driver. Lewis condemned the hijacker as part of the \"small minority willing to use violence to advance their goals\".\n\nColum Eastwood, leader of the Northern Irish Social Democratic and Labour Party, called the Foundation \"an organisation dedicated to promoting peace and reconciliation\" and characterized the attack as an attempt to revert the progress made. Tim Attwood from the organization asserted, \"A suspect device will not stop the work of the John and Pat Hume Foundation.\"\n\nThe hoax caused disruptions in local schools and a nursing home, and Donegan mentioned that it even resulted in a funeral being canceled: \"Whatever mindless people did what they did today, they must remember there’s a family grieving who now didn’t even have a funeral.\" McEwan noted that the incident was \"clearly designed to cause maximum disruption to the local community\".\n\nBefore the interruption, Coveney had remarked to attendees, \"The patient work of reconciliation and deepening of relationships must continue on our own island.\" His address was scheduled to transition into a panel discussion."}

{"title": "Italian President Sergio Mattarella re-elected for second term, ending successor row", "content": "**Saturday, January 29, 2022**\n\nSergio Mattarella, the incumbent President of Italy, was re-elected for a second seven-year term yesterday after an eighth round of voting to find a successor. At 80 years old, Mattarella had previously voiced his intention to step down, even renting an apartment in Rome in anticipation of leaving the presidential Quirinal Palace. However, he reconsidered after key figures, including Prime Minister Mario Draghi, urged him to continue for the sake of \"stability\" in the Republic. His first term was scheduled to conclude on February 3.\n\nDuring deliberations with parliamentarians seeking his continuation, Mattarella remarked, \"I had other plans, but if needed, I am at your disposition.\" The attempt to find a new president involved seven rounds of fruitless voting within an electoral college of 1,009 \"grand electors,\" which includes 321 Senators, 630 Members of the Chamber of Deputies, and 58 regional delegates.\n\nReuters noted that Parliament's inability to converge on a compromise candidate left \"deep scars, with potentially dangerous repercussions for political stability\" within the Draghi-led coalition. When Mattarella successfully overcame the two-thirds majority requirement to secure his re-election, it was met with \"loud and prolonged applause\" in the Chamber of Deputies, where he received a total of 759 votes.\n\nStatements from party leaders were largely supportive of Mattarella's continued presidency. Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-migrant party Lega per Salvini Premier, stated, \"Italians don't deserve more days of confusion,\" affirming the need for \"President Mattarella at the Quirinale and Draghi in government.\" Although Draghi had been considered a potential candidate, he described Mattarella's re-election as \"splendid news for Italians\" and expressed gratitude for the President's response to parliamentary will.\n\nSalvini, whom Euronews reports eyes the Prime Minister role, conveyed his desire for Mattarella to remain in office, emphasizing the need to move beyond \"no's\" and cross vetoes. He advocated for a reconsideration of the presidency, despite his endorsed candidates failing to secure necessary majority votes after being \"rejected by the left.\" Support for Mattarella also came from Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, and Roberto Speranza, Minister of Health and head of the social democracy party Article One.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, president of the centre-right party Forza Italia, also backed Mattarella, stating that \"[u]nity today can only be found\" under his leadership. In contrast, Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right opposition party Brothers of Italy, sharply criticized the decision, claiming Parliament has shown it is \"not fit for Italians.\" She accused allies of \"bartering away\" the presidency and called for a \"re-founding\" of the bloc, expressing surprise if Mattarella accepted re-election despite his previous rejections. Meloni endorsed Draghi for the role instead, which could lead to a vacant Prime Minister position and early elections.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, praised Mattarella, referring to him as \"the guarantor of everybody, impartial, and authoritative.\" Conte had resigned as Prime Minister in 2021 over the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough predominantly ceremonial, the presidency carries significant power during political crises, with responsibilities that include appointing the Prime Minister and dissolving Parliament. This comes amid a climate of political fragmentation in Italy, where governments typically last around a year. Mattarella has been credited with resolving the brief 2021 government crisis by appointing Draghi to lead a broad coalition tasked with overcoming the worst economic challenges Italy has faced in decades. Wolfango Piccoli from advisory firm Teneo remarked that the political landscape has become increasingly challenging for Draghi's government as it approaches the next general election.\n\nBBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen assessed that the choice to re-elect a reluctant incumbent would likely be viewed by critics as a sign of Italy's political divisions. There were calls for Italy to elect its first female president or a younger candidate, although candidates must be over 50. The failure to pursue such candidates highlighted \"the lack of imagination of [Italian] MPs to think beyond the status quo.\" According to Forza Italia national co-ordinator Antonio Tajani, support for Mattarella was the only consensus among most MPs.\n\nMattarella, regarded as a traditional yet unassuming President, was first elected in 2015. He previously served as Minister of Public Education, Minister of Defence, Deputy Prime Minister, and Constitutional Court judge, as well as holding a parliamentary seat for two decades. His father was a founder of the Christian Democracy party, and his brother Piersanti Mattarella was President of Sicily before his assassination in 1980.\n\nOther potential candidates mentioned last week by Agence France-Presse included former Prime Ministers Giuliano Amato and Paolo Gentiloni, and former Chamber of Deputies President Pier Ferdinando Casini. Female candidates considered were current and former Ministers of Justice Marta Cartabia and Paola Severino, along with Senate President Elisabetta Casellati."}

This thruster maneuver concluded the spacecraft's month-long journey that began in late December, which followed years of delays and budget overruns. During its anticipated five- to ten-year mission, the telescope aims to study the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang.\n\nThe journey, referred to as \"30 days of terror\" by Sky & Telescope, included the successful unfurling of its 21-foot (6.4-meter) wide mirror, deployment of its sunshield, and cooling of its instruments to below 50 degrees Kelvin as it traveled to the L2 Lagrange point.\n\nL2 is a stable location for spacecraft, where the gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth are balanced. Full scientific operations are expected to commence later this year, involving 13 teams of scientists. The primary mission will focus on locating the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang to gain insights into the origins of the universe. The nominal mission duration is five years, with an ambition to extend it to ten. Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, which operates much closer to Earth, James Webb will orient its instruments away from the Sun, enhancing image clarity.\n\nThe telescope was launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on December 25 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, after arriving in October. The launch was postponed by a week due to adverse weather conditions. \n\nProject development for the James Webb Space Telescope by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began in 1996, with an original launch target of 2007 at an estimated cost of USD 550 million. After contracting Northrop Grumman for construction, mission managers revised the anticipated launch to 2010, with costs projected between USD 1 billion and USD 3.5 billion. Redesign efforts to lessen technical demands delayed the launch to 2013, now estimated at USD 4.5 billion. A project review ordered by the US Congress in 2010 postponed it further to 2015.\n\nIn 2011, the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies considered canceling the project over an estimated cost of USD 6.5 billion. A new launch plan was set for 2018, costing USD 8.8 billion, but technical issues and the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately postponed the launch to 2021."}

This is less than we ask of factory workers.”\n\nA follow-up email emphasized: “Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office each week. Furthermore, the office must be the location where your actual colleagues are present, not some remote pseudo office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.”\n\nWhile Electrek notes that many companies are reconsidering their COVID-19 work-from-home policies, Reuters indicates that major Silicon Valley companies do not mandate a full-time return to the office. Google, for instance, has implemented a \"hybrid working approach,\" allowing employees to work in the office three days each week while telecommuting for the remaining two days since April.\n\nIn his second email, Musk defended his position, questioning the productivity of companies that don't enforce office attendance: “There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while [...] Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in.” He recounted his own experience, stating that he “lived in the factory so much” during 2017-18 to prevent Tesla’s bankruptcy.\n\nStephen Knight, executive director of the workers' health group Worksafe, commented to Reuters that mandating all employees to return to the office is likely to lead to health outbreaks, noting Tesla's past disregard for worker safety, including violations of local public health orders during the pandemic's early days. \n\nIn May 2020, Musk reopened a factory in Fremont against local guidance, resulting in 440 reported coronavirus cases in the following months. He has also recently commended Chinese workers for their dedication, contrasting this with American workers' tendency to \"avoid going to work at all.\"\n\nAccording to a January Pew Research Center survey published on February 16, 61% of U.S. adults currently working from home are doing so by choice, with 77% reporting that they telework at least occasionally. \n\nIn a March 3 tweet, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal stated, “Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work, including working from home full-time forever.

{"title": "Ethics chief: UK PM's reforms after Partygate \"highly unsatisfactory\", won't \"restore public trust\"", "content": "**Friday, June 3, 2022**\n\nJonathan Evans, Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has criticized UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed alterations to the ministerial code, labeling them as \"highly unsatisfactory\" in light of the recent Partygate revelations. The watchdog has condemned the revisions introduced last week, which permit ministers to remain in their positions after violating the code and continue to limit the ethics adviser from initiating investigations without the Prime Minister's consent. Evans emphasized that without allowing the adviser, currently Lord Geidt, the autonomy to independently review ministerial conduct, \"suspicion about the way in which the ministerial code is administered will linger.\"\n\nIn a blog post on gov.uk, Evans expressed the Committee’s position that infractions of the code should be associated with a range of graduated sanctions rather than the existing \"all-or-nothing approach\" that has previously unsettled prime ministers. However, he noted that the government's reforms maintain the requirement for investigations into the code to be contingent on the Prime Minister’s approval, even while introducing variable penalties. Evans underscored that the proposed graduated sanctions—including public apologies, fines, or requests for resignation—should function as part of a comprehensive set of reforms that include enhanced autonomy for the ethics adviser.\n\nJohnson dismissed Geidt's assertion that there was a \"legitimate question\" regarding whether receiving a fixed penalty notice for violating Covid-19 restrictions in June 2020 constituted a breach of the code. In a letter on Tuesday, the Prime Minister stated: \"taking account of all the circumstances, I did not breach the code\" and emphasized that in clarifying the parliamentary record, he had \"followed the principles of leadership and accountability.\"\n\nGeidt expressed concern over a \"circular process\" that risks rendering the ministerial code ridiculous and reportedly considered resigning on Tuesday. He indicated that he had advised Johnson’s aides that the Prime Minister \"should be ready to offer public comment on his obligations under the ministerial code,\" but received no response.\n\nEvans concurred, elaborating that \"an adviser who believes their advice will be rejected will simply not provide counsel, leading to a pattern of resignations.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Conservative MPs continue to submit letters of no-confidence to the 1922 Committee, chaired by Sir Graham Brady. According to a BBC compilation on Wednesday, 28 MPs have publicly called for Johnson's resignation, nearing the threshold of 54 letters required. Those dissenting include former ministers, committee chairs, and backbenchers across the Brexit spectrum. The Independent reported that at least thirty MPs want the Prime Minister to step down.\n\nRecent rebel MP Simon Fell of Barrow and Furness expressed disbelief in a letter to constituents over the government’s handling of the pandemic, stating, \"It beggars belief that when the government was doing so much to help people during the pandemic, a rotten core with an unacceptable culture carried on regardless of the restrictions placed on the rest of us.\" Another MP, Caroline Dinenage from Gosport, openly expressed her lack of confidence in Johnson, stating, \"He has stated that measures have been put in place to achieve [systemic change], but until I see real evidence of leadership that is listening and changing, I’m afraid I am not prepared to defend it.\"\n\nFrontbench ministers accused the dissenting Tories of performing \"the opposition's work,\" with Culture Minister Nadine Dorries asserting that the focus on malcontents is \"a sideshow, quite frankly, rather than focusing on the real challenges.\" Home Secretary Priti Patel urged colleagues to \"forget it.\"\n\nJohnson overruled the findings of Geidt's predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, who concluded in 2020 that Patel had \"not consistently met the high standards expected of her.\" Allan ultimately resigned, recognizing it was the Prime Minister's prerogative to determine whether a minister's actions constituted a breach of the ministerial code, but he stated, \"I feel that it is right that I should now resign.\"\n\nTim Durrant, associate director for the Institute for Government, told The Guardian: \"The fact that behavior and propriety have been such an issue for this government has really exposed the limits of the code and of Lord Geidt’s role.\""}

The Posidonia australis is believed to have started cloning itself approximately 4,500 years ago and spans around 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) in Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This area was submerged relatively recently, within the last 8,500 years.\n\nIn their research, the scientists analyzed 18,000 separate genetic markers to explore samples for restoration projects, only to discover that the seagrass was a single organism that had cloned itself multiple times. Dr. Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, expressed his surprise, stating, “We thought 'what the hell is going on here?'... We were completely stumped.\" Co-author Jane Edgeloe explained that comparing the DNA of the samples revealed the seagrass meadow was indeed a single plant.\n\nMeasuring at least 180 kilometers (112 miles) in length, this plant is roughly three times the size of Manhattan and stands as the largest known plant and clone globally. The seagrass dwarfs the previous record-holder, a 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States. It grows at a maximum rate of 35 centimeters per year, which aids scientists in estimating its age.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, noted that the plant's survival benefits from retaining all chromosomes from both parents, contributing to its genetic diversity—a rarity among asexual reproducing plants. While the seagrass does not reproduce sexually, subtle DNA variations may help explain its enduring existence.\n\nAssociate Professor Kathryn McMahon from Edith Cowan University, although not part of the study, is a seagrass expert. She stated that seagrass typically lives between 2,000 and 100,000 years, making the estimated age of this plant—around 4,500 years—fit within the normal lifespan. McMahon also expressed confidence in the researchers' methods and described the conclusion that it was a single organism as \"amazing.\"\n\nDespite its massive size, nearly 10% of the seagrass has been destroyed over the past decade due to cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which NBC News attributes to climate change. The bay features relatively high salinity, with temperature fluctuations ranging from 15 °C (59 °F) to 30 °C (86 °F)."}

However, due to Alaska's instant-runoff voting system implemented in 2020, she ultimately won with 51.47% after Begich, the candidate with the least votes, was eliminated. Peltola will serve the remainder of Young's term until the midterm elections in November, where both Palin and Begich plan to run again.\n\nPeltola became the first Democrat to occupy the seat since Begich Sr., who was presumed dead after his plane went missing in 1972. CNN reporter Eric Bradner noted that Palin's defeat could heighten concerns among Republicans about regaining control of the House. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight analyst Nathaniel Rakich labeled Palin as a “very flawed” and controversial candidate, suggesting that she was less likely than Begich to win against Peltola in a direct contest.\n\nFollowing the election, Palin criticized the ranked-choice voting system, calling it “crazy, convoluted, and confusing.” Begich, while congratulating Peltola, remarked that “a vote for Sarah Palin is in reality a vote for Mary Peltola,” attributing Palin's loss to a lack of support from Alaskans."}

Before an audience of approximately 25,000 faithful, the sitting Pope encouraged Catholics to pray for John Paul I, born Albino Luciani, asking for his intercession to \"obtain for us the smile of the soul.\" Speaking from the popemobile, he noted, \"With a smile, Pope John Paul managed to communicate the goodness of the Lord\" and described him as \"a meek and humble pastor\" who \"lived without compromise, loving to the very end.\"\n\nBorn into poverty in northern Italy in 1912, Luciani was ordained a priest in 1935 and elevated to cardinal in 1973. He was elected pontiff following the passing of Pope Paul VI on August 26, 1978, but died on September 29, just a month later. Reflecting on John Paul I's legacy, Pope Francis remarked, \"How beautiful is a church with a happy, serene, and smiling face that never closes doors, never hardens hearts, never complains or harbors resentment, does not grow angry or impatient, and does not dwell in nostalgia for the past.\"\n\nIn Catholicism, beatification is the final step before sainthood and necessitates the validation of two miracles. Last year, Pope Francis attributed the miraculous recovery of a critically ill Argentine girl in 2011 to the intercession of John Paul I, with her parents’ prayers being a key factor. Another miracle needs to be approved for him to achieve sainthood.\n\nDespite being largely dismissed, the circumstances surrounding John Paul I's death have sparked conspiracy theories. The Vatican originally stated that a priest discovered his body but later corrected this to indicate that two nuns were the first to arrive. Although the Church has classified his death as a heart attack, no autopsy was conducted.\n\nStefania Falasca, the deputy postulator advocating for John Paul I's sainthood and author of several books about him, referred to the conspiracy theories as \"publicity-driven garbage.\" Meanwhile, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, reassured Italian television on Friday, stating, \"It was a natural death.

This means an average customer could face an additional annual cost of €579 for electricity and €526 for gas, based on average consumption figures of 4,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) for electricity and 11,000 kWh for gas.\n\nOn the same day, Russian energy giant Gazprom announced an indefinite halt of natural gas supplies to Europe through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline due to necessary repairs for a leak. \n\nEarlier this year, in March, Bord Gáis raised prices for its 513,000 commercial and residential customers, marking a 27% increase in electricity rates and a 39% hike in gas prices. In 2021, the company raised rates for electricity on three separate occasions and for gas twice. According to Daragh Cassidy of comparison site Bonkers.ie, average household bills have increased by €1,300 for electricity and €1,000 for gas over the past year, with current bills averaging around €4,000. This figure is close to the UK price cap of £3,549, from which over 70% of Ireland's gas supply is sourced.\n\nDave Kirwan, managing director of Bord Gáis Energy, expressed regret over the necessity of the price increase, emphasizing that the substantial rise in wholesale energy costs has left the company with no alternatives. He assured customers that the company would do its utmost to mitigate the impact and keep rates competitive, pledging to allocate 10% of operating profits towards an energy support fund in collaboration with organizations assisting those struggling to afford the price hikes.\n\nA financial report released on July 28 by parent company Centrica, based in the UK, indicated that Bord Gáis’ operating profits surged by 74% year-on-year in the first half of 2022, reaching £33 million (€38 million), in part due to resumed operations at the Whitegate power station near Cork.\n\nRising utility costs are increasing pressure on the Irish government, especially as it reported a €6.3 billion surplus from the first eight months of the year. Following Electric Ireland's announcement of residential rate increases of 26.7% and 37.5% for electricity and gas, respectively, starting October 1, Taoiseach Micheál Martin stated that the European Commission would introduce emergency measures to address market issues. He attributed these hikes to a \"broader exponential rise in energy prices\" and pledged a \"demand reduction approach\" aimed at lowering overall energy consumption. Martin also assured that the upcoming Budget would include measures to alleviate the cost of living burden on households.\n\nThe record surplus for the Exchequer was supported by unexpectedly high corporate tax collections in August and significant year-on-year increases in income tax and VAT revenues. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe emphasized the need for the government to balance protecting vulnerable households and businesses facing a major energy price crisis, while avoiding exacerbating inflationary pressures. He noted the stronger economic recovery following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions must be compared with the inflationary effects stemming from rising energy prices due to \"Putin's war\" in Ukraine, which are diminishing real incomes and undermining growth prospects domestically and internationally.\n\nLabour leader Ivana Bacik called for a \"unprecedented, urgent, and short-term response\" from the government, highlighting the unsustainability of the current situation for individuals, families, and small businesses. Her proposals include implementing a windfall tax on excess energy company profits—a measure Donohoe stated is under consideration—alongside immediate price caps and expanded eligibility for fuel allowances.\n\nEuropean Union ministers are scheduled to convene in Brussels next week, where Martin expects discussions of immediate actions to stabilize gas prices and a more structured market reform over the next year. Additionally, G7 countries, including EU members France, Germany, and Italy, agreed yesterday to impose a price ceiling on Russian oil, anticipated to take effect in December. Since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian energy supplies to Europe have been reduced, driving prices higher and raising concerns over potential blackouts. At the time of Nord Stream 1's operational suspension, the pipeline was only delivering one-fifth of its daily capacity, as noted by Jacob Mandel, a senior associate at energy consultancy firm Aurora."}
{"title": "Proud Boys indicted for conspiracy over January 6 U.S. Capitol riots", "content": "**Tuesday, June 7, 2022**\n\nA grand jury in Washington D.C. has indicted Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, the former chairman of the Proud Boys, along with four other members of the far-right organization on charges of seditious conspiracy in connection with the January 6, 2021 insurrection. The indictment alleges that the mob of Donald Trump supporters who breached the U.S. Capitol was not a spontaneous act but rather a meticulously planned operation aimed at obstructing Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThis marks a significant escalation in the legal troubles for Tarrio, who, alongside fellow Proud Boys Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola, is accused of conspiring to prevent then-President-elect Joe Biden from assuming office. All five individuals have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe indictment details meetings and planning sessions among the accused, including communication through encrypted messages. Prosecutors assert that they acquired Baofeng radios, enabling the rioters to coordinate their actions without detection. On January 6, they claim members of the Proud Boys dismantled metal barricades, facilitating the entrance of rioters into the Capitol. While Tarrio allegedly played a role in orchestrating the attack, he did not enter the Capitol building himself, as he had been arrested two days prior for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner, resulting in a five-month prison sentence.\n\nThe charge of seditious conspiracy has its roots in the American Civil War era, and if convicted, the accused could face up to 20 years in prison. \"Seditious conspiracy requires the use of force, and [Rehl] never used any force nor contemplated using any force,\" stated Carmen Hernandez, attorney for Zachary Rehl.\n\nFederal authorities have implicated over three dozen Proud Boys members in leadership roles during the Capitol attack, with several already having pleaded guilty or agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The Proud Boys identify as \"western chauvinists\" and have been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center."}

Prior to her meeting, Johnson met with the Queen to tender his official resignation.\n\nAs Foreign Secretary until this appointment, Truss won the leadership election against former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, securing a decisive victory among party members with a vote count of 81,326 to 60,399. Johnson's departure from office had been uncertain since he announced his resignation in July amid ongoing scandals.\n\nTruss steps into office at a challenging time, with the UK grappling with soaring food and energy costs that are expected to push inflation to a 42-year high of 13% in October. Additionally, the ongoing war in Ukraine and strained relations with the European Union present significant challenges for her administration, as reported by Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\nFollowing the party vote, Truss stated, \"I will deliver a bold plan to cut taxes and grow our economy. I will address the energy crisis by tackling people's energy bills while also focusing on long-term energy supply issues.\" She emphasized her commitment to the party's core beliefs: \"I know that our values resonate with the British people: Our beliefs in freedom, the ability to control your own life, low taxes, and personal responsibility. That’s why people voted for us in such numbers in 2019, and as your party leader, I intend to deliver on those promises across our great country.\"\n\nRishi Sunak shared a message on Twitter, urging unity behind the new Prime Minister: \"It’s right we now unite behind Liz Truss as she steers the country through difficult times.\" \n\nJohnson also voiced his support on Twitter, stating: \"I know she has the right plan to tackle the cost of living crisis, unite our party, and continue the great work of leveling up our country. Now is the time for all Conservatives to get behind her 100 percent.\"\n\nIn contrast, Labour Party leader Keir Starmer criticized Truss's proposed tax cuts, remarking, \"We've heard far more from the latest prime minister about cuts to corporation taxes over the summer than about the cost-of-living crisis.\""}

{"title": "Kenya's supreme court upholds election result", "content": "Kenya's Supreme Court upheld the results of the August 9 election on Monday, confirming William Ruto as the winner and dismissing allegations of widespread fraud presented by his rival, Raila Odinga. The election results, announced on August 15, indicated that Ruto secured 50.5% of the vote, while Odinga received 48.8%.\n\nOdinga's legal team attempted to bolster their argument by citing dissent from four of the seven electoral commissioners, who had publicly rejected the results after a dispute with the commission's chairman, labeling the process as \"opaque.\" \n\nHowever, the court found no credible evidence to support claims of fraud, interference, or technological failure, despite acknowledging internal \"dysfunction\" within the electoral commission. The ruling also noted valid reasons for delays in concurrent gubernatorial elections in certain areas, stating that there was no evidence to suggest these delays affected voter turnout.\n\nIn a bid to prevent future baseless legal challenges, the court reprimanded attorneys and petitioners for submitting falsified documents. Chief Justice Martha Koome condemned some petitions as forgeries containing \"sensational information,\" declaring the election of the president-elect as \"valid.\"\n\nRuto is set to be sworn in as Kenya's fifth president, succeeding Uhuru Kenyatta. Notably, despite Ruto having served as Kenyatta's deputy, the outgoing president endorsed his longtime opponent, Odinga, in this election, which marked Odinga's fifth bid for the presidency."}

This ride was notable for being the first full-circuit strata coaster, a category that includes roller coasters exceeding a height of 400 feet (122 m).\n\nTony Clark, Cedar Point's director of communications, released a statement saying, \"After 19 seasons in operation ... the world's first strata coaster, Top Thrill Dragster ... is being retired.\"\n\nThe announcement follows a serious incident on August 15, 2021, when a bracket fell from the ride, striking a guest in the queue and resulting in a severe brain injury. This incident led to the attraction's closure for the remainder of the 2021 and all of the 2022 seasons. The fallen bracket was later identified as a sensor intended to track the coaster cars' positions on the track.\n\nIn February 2022, Ohio officials cleared the park of any wrongdoing or indications that the ride was unsafe prior to operations.

The Danish Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday that the two nations have agreed to divide the island in two.\n\nThe agreement, pending parliamentary approval for full ratification, outlines an almost equal split of Hans Island between Canada and Denmark, with the border following a natural cleft on the island. While primarily symbolic, the pact represents a gesture of unity and cooperation between the two NATO allies. This development follows the formation of a working group in 2018 aimed at resolving the dispute, which has been humorously dubbed the \"Whisky War.\"\n\nThe dispute dates back to 1971, as Hans Island is situated roughly equidistant from Canada’s Ellesmere Island and Greenland, a Danish territory. The name \"Whisky War\" was coined after an incident in 1984 when Canadian troops left a flag and a bottle of Canadian whisky on the island. In response, Denmark's Greenland affairs minister Tom Høyem visited the island, replaced the Canadian flag with Denmark's, and left a bottle of Danish schnapps.\n\nThis playful rivalry evolved into a tradition where officials, scientists, and soldiers from both nations would visit the island to take down the opposing flag, raise their own, and leave either Canadian whisky or Danish schnapps for the other side to discover.\n\nIn a press release, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly described the Arctic region as a \"beacon for international cooperation, where the rule of law prevails.\" She emphasized that \"as global security is being threatened, it’s more important than ever for democracies like Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark to work together, alongside Indigenous peoples, to resolve our differences in accordance with international law.\"\n\nDanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jeppe Kofod remarked that sovereignty over the island has been contested \"for more than 50 years\" and noted that the collaborative efforts of both nations \"demonstrate our firm common commitment to resolve international disputes peacefully.\" Kofod expressed hope that \"our negotiation and the spirit of this agreement\" would serve as an inspiration for other countries, particularly at a time when respect for the international rules-based order is under pressure."}

The image, titled \"Webb's First Deep Field,\" reveals thousands of galaxies in the SMACS 0723 galaxy cluster, which is approximately 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. Notably, this image represents only a small section of the Southern Hemisphere sky. The composite image results from piecing together numerous smaller images taken across multiple wavelengths, achieving far greater depth than what was possible with the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb’s predecessor.\n\nSince entering its orbit around the L2 Lagrange point on January 24, located about 1,500,000 kilometers (932,057 miles) from Earth on the opposite side from the Sun, the telescope has begun its mission. This milestone followed a month-long journey that commenced in late December 2021, marked by years of delays and budget overruns. Operated over an expected lifespan of five to ten years, the telescope aims to study the most distant and earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang.\n\nThe journey, described as \"30 days of terror\" by Sky & Telescope, involved the successful deployment of its 21-foot (6-meter) wide mirror, the unfurling of its sunshield, and cooling to below 50 degrees Kelvin as it reached the L2 Lagrange point. This location provides a stable environment for spacecraft, where the gravitational forces of the Earth and the Sun are balanced. Full scientific operations will involve thirteen teams of scientists, with the primary mission focused on discovering the most distant and earliest galaxies to enhance our understanding of the Universe's origins. The nominal mission duration is set for five years, with an aspiration of extending it to ten. In contrast to the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits much closer to Earth, James Webb's instruments are positioned to face away from the Sun, resulting in enhanced image clarity.\n\nThe telescope was launched into space on December 25 by an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, following its arrival at the launch site in October. The launch was postponed by a week due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nDevelopment of the James Webb Space Telescope began in 1996 under NASA, originally intended for a 2007 launch at a budget of $550 million. After contracting Northrop Grumman for construction, mission managers later estimated that a 2010 launch would cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion. Technical redesigns increased the budget to an estimated $4.5 billion and delayed the launch to 2013. A project review mandated by the U.S. Congress in 2010 pushed the launch date to 2015.\n\nIn 2011, due to an estimated budget of $6.5 billion, the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies considered canceling the telescope project entirely. Plans for a 2018 launch with an estimated cost of $8.8 billion were subsequently delayed due to technical issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing the anticipated launch to 2021."}

He told attendees, \"It will be a really tough winter in Europe,\" and emphasized that the continent is facing a \"significant\" increase in energy prices. Van Beurden indicated that in a worst-case scenario, rationing of energy might be necessary.\n\nSeveral countries, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Poland, have already experienced gas supply suspensions from Russia due to their refusal to pay in roubles. Concerns are also mounting over the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, which may not reopen after its scheduled maintenance that began this week.\n\nLast month, Germany escalated its response to gas shortages by moving to the 'alarm' stage of its emergency plan. Italy is also facing gas shortages; the local energy firm Eni received only half of the gas it requested from Gazprom, its Russian supplier, last month. Moody's has warned that both Germany and Italy may be compelled to ration gas supplies if the Nord Stream 1 pipeline does not resume operations as planned on July 21.\n\nCurrently, Europe's natural gas storage is 62.6% full, with the European Commission mandating that levels reach at least 80% by November 1.

However, passing the constitutional amendment may be challenging, as it necessitates a two-thirds majority—80 votes—in parliament, and opposition parties, holding a total of 46 votes, have declared they will not support this change, criticizing it as a concession to Bulgaria regarding North Macedonia’s culture, language, and identity. Macron has emphasized that the deal does not question the existence of the Macedonian language, characterizing the agreement as a compromise supported by North Macedonia's ruling coalition.\n\nThe proposal has also sparked controversy in Bulgaria, with Prime Minister Kiril Petkov accepting the deal. However, some of his allies have labeled his decision to lift the veto on North Macedonian EU membership a \"national betrayal.\" Petkov faced political fallout, as the Bulgarian government collapsed following a no-confidence vote on June 22.\n\nNorth Macedonia has been an EU candidate since 2005, facing delays in the approval of membership talks first from Greece and more recently from Bulgaria.

This action followed a series of referenda held in the regions, deemed illegal by the international community, during Russia's ongoing invasion. On October 5, President Vladimir Putin enacted legislation to formally incorporate these territories.\n\nThe resolution, first introduced to the Security Council on September 30, designates the referenda and subsequent annexations as \"illegal\" and calls for Russia to \"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces.\" It encourages mediation through \"political dialogue, negotiation, mediation, and other peaceful means,\" while urging countries to \"refrain from any action that might be interpreted as recognizing\" any alterations to Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nThe initial resolution, drafted by Albania and the United States, was blocked in the Security Council due to Russia's veto power. Moscow attempted to secure a secret ballot for the General Assembly vote, arguing it would provide non-aligned nations with \"flexibility and breathing space,\" but this proposal was rejected. \n\nThe voting outcome showed broad support for the resolution, with 143 nations in favor, 35 abstaining, 11 not participating, and four—including Russia—voting against it (the others being Belarus, Nicaragua, and Syria)."}

Wickremesinghe, who previously served as acting president in the absence of his predecessor, secured the presidency by defeating his rivals with a vote count of 134 to 82, gaining support from members of the ruling Sri Lanka People's Front.\n\nFormer President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on July 13 and resigned from Singapore the following day, a decision that came after months of widespread unrest and protests triggered by a severe economic crisis characterized by soaring inflation, power outages, and shortages of essential goods.\n\nInitially, Wickremesinghe had offered to resign alongside Rajapaksa, but upon the latter's departure, he took on the role of acting president. Despite having served as prime minister under Rajapaksa's administration, which many critics blame for the economic mismanagement, Wickremesinghe's transition to presidency has sparked relatively few protests. \"He is here — and we will see what his actions are. If we don't get any food, any medicine, we'll be on the streets,\" a former protester stated.\n\nAnbarasan Ethirajan, writing for the BBC, highlighted concerns among some protesters who fear that Wickremesinghe may implement a crackdown on dissent. In response to these concerns, Wickremesinghe expressed his support for peaceful demonstrations but cautioned against occupying government buildings or attempts to overthrow the government.\n\nWickremesinghe brings a wealth of experience to his new role, having held numerous senior positions in his 45-year political career, including six terms as prime minister. He has previously run for the presidency twice without success. Local media indicates that his forthcoming cabinet may include ministers from opposition parties who are willing to collaborate with him.\n\nAs the new president, Wickremesinghe will focus on restoring stability while preparing to resume talks with the International Monetary Fund regarding a $3 billion bailout."}
{"title": "Conservationists capture most massive Burmese python in Florida history", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\n**Saturday, June 25, 2022**\n\nBiologists from the Conservancy of Southwest Florida reported Wednesday that they captured a Burmese python (Python bivittatus) measuring nearly 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighing 215 pounds (97 kilograms) in the Everglades wetlands. This may be the largest specimen of its species ever found outside its native range in Southeast Asia. An 18-foot, 9-inch (5.7 meters) Burmese python was found in 2020, but it weighed only 104 pounds (47.2 kilograms).\n\nIn a search documented by National Geographic, the team captured the current python in December 2021 by tagging a male \"scout snake\" named Dionysius with a GPS tracking device and releasing him in the western Everglades. Wildlife expert Ian Bartoszek, the project manager, explained, \"How do you find the needle in the haystack? You could use a magnet, and similarly, our male scout snakes are drawn to the largest females around.\"\n\nAs an invasive species in Florida, Burmese pythons pose a significant threat to native wildlife. The Conservancy's preferred strategy for limiting python breeding involves removing female snakes from the environment before they lay eggs. When the team noticed that Dionysius was spending several weeks in one location, they deduced he had found a sexually mature female and set out to capture her.\n\nThe retrieval process took twenty minutes of wrestling, requiring three adults to transport the snake to a vehicle. It was then taken to a laboratory in Naples, Florida, where it was euthanized. A necropsy revealed that the snake contained over 122 healthy but unfertilized egg follicles.\n\nPythons were introduced to Florida in the 1970s, likely when they were sold as pets. Individual pet owners have a history of illegally releasing exotic animals into the wild once they grow larger than expected. Additionally, the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 allowed animals from a serpent center to escape into the Everglades, where they began reproducing rapidly. \n\nSi"}

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby remarked, \"Few leaders receive the outpouring of love that we have seen.\" Outside the abbey, hundreds of thousands gathered in the streets of London to pay their respects and witness the procession.\n\nFollowing the funeral service, Elizabeth was transported to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where she was interred in the Royal Vault, the final resting place for many former British monarchs, and the Royal Regalia was removed from her coffin. Later that evening, a private family service took place at King George VI Memorial Chapel, where she was buried beside her husband, father, mother, and sister. \n\nElizabeth II passed away on September 8 at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland after a remarkable 70-year reign. The announcement of her death was made at 18:30 BST (UTC+1) via a formal notice outside Buckingham Palace. Earlier that day, members of the British royal family had traveled to Balmoral amid growing concerns for the monarch's health. Her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, had died in 2021 at the age of 99.\n\nFollowing her death, Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles, the former Prince of Wales, automatically became King, taking the name King Charles III. His eldest son, William, inherited the Duchy of Cornwall but retained his title of Duke of Cambridge. Charles was officially proclaimed King by the Accession Council in a televised ceremony at St James's Palace in London, attended by all living former prime ministers. \n\nIn a heartfelt statement, Charles said, \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\" \n\nJust two days prior to her passing, Elizabeth was still actively fulfilling her royal duties, having officially appointed Liz Truss as the new prime minister, succeeding Boris Johnson, who submitted his resignation to the Queen on the same day. \n\nTruss described Elizabeth as \"the rock on which modern Britain was built,\" stating she provided the \"stability and strength that we needed.\" She expressed that Britain is \"devastated\" by the Queen's death. Regarding the new monarch, Charles, Truss said, \"We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King.'\"\n\nBorn in London on April 21, 1926, as Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, she was not initially in the line of succession to the throne. Following King Edward VIII's abdication in 1936, her father, King George VI, ascended the throne, making Elizabeth the heir apparent. \n\nDuring World War II, Elizabeth began making public addresses at the age of 14, starting with a message to evacuated children. After turning 18, she served with the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a truck driver. \n\nIn 1947, she married Philip, with whom she had four children: Charles (1948), Anne (1950), Andrew (1960), and Edward (1964). \n\nElizabeth's reign was the longest in British history and the second longest for any monarch in recorded history, during which she worked with fifteen different prime ministers, beginning with Winston Churchill."}

This polyurethane serves as a substitute for traditional plastics in applications such as foams and footwear.\n\nThe research team conducted their experiments at the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier and Experimental Aquarium, cutting the polyurethane into cubes comparable in size and shape to those of EVA plastics. They observed that various marine bacteria and fungi adhered to the polyurethane, breaking it down into its constituent chemicals, which the microorganisms then consumed. After four weeks in the water, the polyurethane samples had already shown measurable signs of decomposition.\n\n\"Improper disposal of plastic in the ocean breaks down into microplastics and has become an enormous environmental problem,\" said Stephen Mayfield, a co-author of the study and director of the California Center for Algae Biotechnology. \"We've demonstrated that it's entirely feasible to produce high-performance plastic products that can also degrade in the ocean.\"\n\nAnnually, approximately 8 billion kilograms of plastic enter the oceans, where it can be mistaken for food by marine life. Natural processes contribute to the fragmentation of this plastic into microplastics, while larger pieces accumulate into massive formations, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. About half of the patch’s mass consists of commercial fishing debris, such as discarded nets. Reducing the amount of post-consumer plastic in the ocean could significantly alleviate the planet's plastic crisis.\n\nThis innovative polyurethane can be utilized to manufacture flip-flops and components for various types of shoes, which represent a substantial portion of global plastic waste."}

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Ukrainian troops have regained control of 6,000 square kilometers (2,400 square miles) of territory. The U.S. has indicated that many Russian soldiers are withdrawing from Ukraine, while Russia has acknowledged that its front lines have been breached. Although the confirmed death toll exceeds 1,000, the actual number may be significantly higher. The Kremlin has dismissed calls for peace negotiations, asserting that it will continue to pursue its objectives in the \"special military operation.\"\n\nUkrainian advances continued, with the retaking of Vovchansk reported on September 13 by Ukraine's border guard services. While unverified, the former mayor of Melitopol has claimed Russian troops have begun to withdraw. If Melitopol falls to Ukrainian control, it could disrupt Russian supply lines in the eastern Donbas region. In the recently liberated village of Chkalovske, resident Svitlana Honchar remarked on the hasty departure of Russian forces: \"They left like the wind. They were fleeing by any means they could,\" though she noted that some were left behind, stating, \"They were trying to catch up.\" President Zelenskyy has promised a \"return to normalcy\" for the areas recently liberated. Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar confirmed efforts to encourage Russian troops to surrender, distributing flyers that read, \"Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t matter to them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian officials are investigating the liberated territories to uncover any atrocities and assess alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces. In Balakliya, local authorities reported that Russian troops had established a \"torture chamber\" at the police station, allegedly keeping at least 40 individuals captive.\n\nNationalism in Ukraine remains strong, with the government releasing videos of burning Russian flags and abandoned, damaged military equipment. A video showed Ukrainians tearing down a sign that read, \"We are one people with Russia.\" Among the items left behind in the liberated areas are destroyed weapons and vehicles, particularly abandoned tanks.\n\nOn September 25, President Zelenskyy stated that despite fierce fighting in Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces continue to achieve success. \"This is the Donetsk region, our Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, and also the Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions,\" Zelenskyy said. Ukraine has also secured numerous bridges around the Oskil River in Kharkiv, while heavy fighting persists in southern Ukraine as efforts to reclaim a Russian-occupied town continue.\n\nIn Russia, criticism of the war is increasing. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to call up 300,000 reservists, prompting significant protests and condemnation from prominent lawmakers. In response, Zelenskyy characterized the Russo-Ukrainian war as \"a conflict driven by one man's ambitions.\"\n\nAdditionally, Russia announced a new referendum, claiming it will annex four invaded Ukrainian territories, which has escalated fears in Ukraine. Supporters of Ukraine, including the United States, remain cautious about declaring victory since Russia retains substantial military presence in the region, including missiles and other advanced weaponry. Russian artillery continues to cause damage, with recent shelling in Lozova resulting in three deaths and nine injuries, alongside ongoing bombardment in Kharkiv. However, Ukrainian forces appear committed to advancing into Russian-occupied territory."}
