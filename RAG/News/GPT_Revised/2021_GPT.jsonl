The scheme will continue until September, although businesses will be required to contribute 10% of wages in July and 20% in August and September as the program winds down. Support for self-employed individuals will also persist, with an additional grant available for the period from February to April.\n\nOther measures for workers include an increase in the minimum wage to £8.91 per hour starting in April and the extension of a £20 weekly boost in Universal Credit through September.\n\nIn terms of taxation, Sunak revealed plans for a rise in corporation tax to 25% in April 2023, which he noted would remain the lowest rate in the G7. Only businesses with profits exceeding £250,000—around 10% of companies—would be affected. Firms generating profits under £50,000 will continue to pay a corporation tax rate of 19%. Sunak confirmed that there would be no changes to income tax, national insurance, or VAT, with alcohol and fuel duties remaining frozen.\n\nFor the hospitality sector, VAT will stay at a reduced rate of 5%. Additionally, the contactless payment limit will be raised from £45 to £100 this year. Sunak also announced the establishment of new freeports in locations including East Midlands Airport, Felixstowe and Harwich, Humber, Liverpool City Region, Plymouth, Solent, and Thames and Teesside, aimed at reducing customs costs and encouraging investment."}

The investigation will be led by British lawyer Karim Ahmad Khan, who is set to take over as chief prosecutor on June 16.\n\nBensouda stated that \"[t]he decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years.\" She assured a \"principled, non-partisan approach\" to the case, emphasizing that it would be handled \"independently, impartially, and objectively, without fear or favor.\" The preliminary examination, completed in December 2019, indicated that \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe investigation will concentrate on alleged war crimes committed since June 13, 2014, shortly before an Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip. Bensouda noted that the specific priorities of the investigation would be \"determined in due time,\" identifying both the Israeli Defense Forces and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as potential perpetrators.\n\nPalestine has been a member of the ICC since 2015 and has long accused Israel of war crimes. Conversely, Israel, not a member of the ICC, asserts that the court lacks jurisdiction over Palestinian Territories, claiming that Palestine is not a sovereign state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ICC's decision as \"the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy,\" arguing that the court is \"turning a blind eye to Iran, Syria, and other dictatorships that are committing real war crimes.\" He added, \"Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists who deliberately target civilians, it's our soldiers who are war criminals.\" Netanyahu vowed to \"fight for the truth until we annul this scandalous decision.\" Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi described the ICC's decision as \"morally bankrupt and legally flawed.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price reaffirmed America's commitment to Israel's security, stating, \"[w]e will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security.\" Price also asserted that the ICC \"has no jurisdiction over this matter.\" Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Gilad Erdan, expressed intentions to \"continue working together\" with the U.S.\n\nThe United States, also not a member of the ICC, imposed targeted sanctions against the prosecutor's office during former President Donald Trump's administration. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee urged current President Joe Biden to maintain these sanctions, labeling the ICC's actions as \"illegitimate, politically motivated investigations.\" The U.S. also opposes the ICC investigation into American forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority's Foreign Ministry welcomed the ICC's decision as \"a long-awaited step that serves Palestine's tireless pursuit of justice and accountability,\" while urging the international community not to politicize \"these independent proceedings.\"\n\nHazem Qassem, a spokesperson for Hamas, which previously contended that rocket attacks on Israel in 2014 were legal under international law, expressed support for the ICC's decision: \"We welcomed the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people.\" He added that it \"is a step forward to implement justice, punish the occupation, and do justice to the Palestinian people.\"\n\nAccording to United Nations estimates, approximately 2,200 Palestinians, including 1,500 civilians, were killed during the 2014 Gaza war, known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. Israeli estimates indicate that at least 73 Israelis, including six civilians, lost their lives in the conflict.\n\nThe Israeli government has undertaken public relations and diplomatic efforts to obstruct the investigation, according to reports from the Associated Press."}

This incident occurred just days after new restrictions were introduced in Jordan, including stay-at-home orders, a military-enforced curfew, and fines of 100 dinars (approximately US$140) for individuals not wearing face masks.  \n\nPrime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh accepted their resignations, which were formalized in one of two Royal Decrees issued by King Abdullah II. The second decree appointed Deputy Prime Minister for Local Administration Tawfiq Kreishan to lead the Ministry of the Interior and State Minister for Legal Affairs Ahmad Ziadat to head the Ministry of Justice.  \n\nA recent surge in coronavirus infections, driven by variants of the virus, has resulted in at least 4,627 deaths and over 300,000 confirmed cases in the country of ten million. Officials attribute this increase to non-compliance with restrictions, leading to dozens of arrests for violating stay-at-home orders, while hundreds of businesses have also been closed, according to reports from Reuters."}

This initiative makes Wales the first of the UK nations to implement such a prohibition.\n\nThis new regulation adds to existing restrictions, which include a prohibition on smoking in enclosed public spaces since 2007 and a ban on smoking in cars with children since 2015. The Welsh government, led by the left-wing Welsh Labour party, stated that the aim of the ban is to reduce smoking prevalence among both adults and children by normalizing a smoke-free environment and encouraging smokers to quit.\n\nIn an innovative effort, two hospitals in southern Wales have introduced a button-activated speaker system to remind visitors that the premises are smoke-free. A similar initiative was trialed in 2016, where announcements recorded by local school children played upon pressing a button at hospitals throughout Wales.\n\nEluned Morgan, the Minister for Mental Health, Wellbeing, and the Welsh Language, expressed her pride in implementing this legislation, emphasizing that it will improve the health of future generations by reducing children's exposure to smoking. She remarked, \"We need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\n\nHowever, the government has faced criticism from several smokers' rights groups. Simon Clark, Director of the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco, described the law as \"taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut,\" arguing that there is no evidence that smoking outdoors poses a health risk to others, including children. He further criticized the ban on hospital grounds as unjust, highlighting that it targets smokers who may be stressed and seeking comfort from a cigarette, and noted that most smokers exercise discretion and avoid smoking near young children.\n\nWikinews reached out to Eluned Morgan's office for further insights into the rationale behind this ban."}

Last year, Moore captured the nation's heart by raising nearly £33 million for the National Health Service (NHS) by completing 100 laps around his garden to celebrate his 100th birthday. A World War II veteran, he served in the Burma campaign.\n\nHis daughters announced his passing, sharing that \"the last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable.\" They added that he was \"an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay in our hearts forever.\"\n\nBorn in Keighley, West Yorkshire, England, Moore joined the British Army in 1939. Following his military service, he worked as an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Bovington, Dorset. In 2007, he relocated to Bedfordshire, where his family lived.\n\nIn April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, he began his garden laps with the goal of raising £1,000 for the NHS. His efforts quickly gained widespread popularity, resulting in millions raised and setting a Guinness World Record for the most funds raised by an individual through a charity walk. He also released a duet with singer Michael Ball, which soared to number one on the UK charts, making Moore the oldest person to achieve this milestone. On his birthday, April 30, the British Army honored him with the title of honorary colonel, and in July, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Moore, calling him \"a hero in the truest sense of the word,\" and noted that he \"embodied the triumph of the human spirit.\" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer stated that \"Britain has lost a hero.\" A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Queen would send a private message of condolence to Moore's family. Flags at notable locations, including 10 Downing Street, were flown at half-mast in tribute.\n\nMoore had previously battled skin cancer and suffered a hip injury in 2018. He credited his hospital treatment with inspiring his fundraising efforts, describing the medical staff as \"marvellous.\" He is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren."}

The motion was initiated by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a global initiative advocating for the implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The council was called upon to write to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to express their support for the treaty.\n\nCouncillor Tony Crook proposed the motion during the council meeting, with Councillor Jane Greacen seconding it. While Crook recognized that the council has limited influence on nuclear weapon policies, he emphasized Australia's involvement in the nuclear fuel cycle, noting the \"untold misery\" that nuclear weapons have caused to communities worldwide. Councillor Arthur Allan expressed his opposition to the motion, agreeing with Crook and Greacen's sentiments but labeling the nuclear weapons issue as a \"federal matter,\" suggesting that the motion constituted \"virtue signalling.\"\n\nDeputy Mayor Mark Reeves supported the motion, arguing it represented a \"moral standing\" and reflected the community's views, humorously adding, \"nobody's said to me — 'You know what we need? A really good intercontinental ballistic missile in the shire.'\" Councillor Trevor Stowe dismissed the motion as \"feel-good stuff\" and an \"absolute waste of time.\" \n\nThe final vote resulted in a tie, with Crook, Greacen, Reeves, and Mayor Mendy Urie voting in favor, while Councillors John White, Kirsten Van Diggele, Allen, and Stowe opposed it. Councillor Sonia Buckley abstained from voting. Mayor Urie cast the deciding vote in favor of the motion.\n\nPreviously, the Australian government had boycotted discussions regarding the prohibition treaty, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stating that \"a ban treaty risks undermining the [non-proliferation treaty], which Australia rightly regards as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation and disarmament architecture.\" The opposition Labor Party has promised to sign and ratify the treaty if they secure electoral victory."}

In his response, Cavani wrote, \"Gracias, negrito,\" using a term that the FA deemed \"insulting, abusive, improper,\" and stated it \"brought the game into disrepute.\" They classified it as an \"aggravated breach\" due to its reference, either explicit or implied, to color, race, or ethnic origin.\n\nThe Uruguayan language academy clarified that terms like \"negro\" (black) and particularly its diminutive \"negrito\" — similar to terms like \"gordo\" (fatso) or \"gordito\" — are commonly used in an affectionate or friendly manner. The statement emphasized that \"[i]n fact, a person so addressed is not necessarily overweight or dark-skinned.\" Furthermore, it noted, \"Cavani's use of the term 'negrito' to address 'pablofer2222,' a fan of the football player, conveys an affectionate tone. Given the context, the individual addressed, and the variety of Spanish used, the term 'negrito'—especially because of its diminutive form—holds an affectionate value.\"\n\nIn summary, the statement from the Uruguayan language academy, signed by its president Wilfredo Penco, who is also a minister of the Electoral Court of Uruguay, concluded that \"the English Football Association has committed a serious injustice against a Uruguayan athlete of the highest international caliber and has highlighted its ignorance and errors regarding the uses of the language, particularly Spanish, without considering its complexities and contexts.\"\n\nThis was not the only Spanish language academy to support Cavani against the allegations of racism. The Argentine language academy, representing another country from the Río de la Plata Basin and sharing the Rioplatense variety of Spanish with Uruguay, called on the FA on December 22 to acquit Cavani and issue a formal apology for unjustly harming his reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, the hashtag #graciasnegrito trended on Twitter in Argentina and Uruguay, rallying support for Cavani in light of the sanctions he faced."}
{"title": "International Criminal Court rules its jurisdiction includes Palestine", "content": "**Monday, February 8, 2021**\n\nOn Friday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that its territorial jurisdiction includes areas of Palestine, drawing criticism from Israeli and U.S. officials. The judges, in a 2-1 decision, stated that Palestine's membership in the Rome Statute serves as the basis for this ruling. However, they clarified that the court will not address the statehood or borders of the disputed territory. In a 60-page legal brief, the ICC asserted its jurisdiction \"in the Situation in Palestine [...] extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\"\n\nChief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda welcomed the ruling for providing \"judicial clarity,\" but indicated that her office is currently reviewing the decision to determine its next steps, emphasizing adherence to its independent and impartial mandate. In December 2019, Bensouda stated that \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,\" identifying both the Israeli Defence Forces and the Palestinian group Hamas as possible offenders.\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh hailed the ruling as \"a victory for justice and humanity.\" The ruling was similarly praised by Hamas, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, and the international organization Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision as hypocritical, stating, \"[w]hen the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes, this is pure anti-Semitism.\" In a video message, he asserted, \"We will fight this perversion of justice with all our might!\" The Israeli government also criticized the ICC for overstepping its mandate by delving into political matters, contending that its jurisdiction cannot extend over borders that remain unresolved in peace negotiations. The Israeli military maintains systems aimed at preventing misconduct, but these have faced past scrutiny for being inadequate.\n\nThe United States expressed its opposition as well. State Department spokesman Ned Price stated that, despite President Joe Biden's intent to improve relations with Palestine, the U.S. firmly opposed Friday's ruling and the notion of Palestine qualifying as a member of the Rome Statute. Price reiterated, \"As we made clear when the Palestinians purported to join the Rome Statute in 2015, we do not believe the Palestinians qualify as a sovereign state and therefore are not entitled to membership as a state in international organizations, entities, or conferences, including the ICC [...] the court’s jurisdiction should be reserved for countries that consent to it or that are referred by the UN Security Council.\"\n\nBoth Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute and do not recognize the court's jurisdiction. The Israeli government has faced widespread international condemnation for building settlements in disputed territories, where nearly 700,000 people currently reside."}

The law is set to take effect on July 30, the earliest date following a recess in the legislative session.\n\nHouse Bill 1570, known as the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act, was initially vetoed by Governor Asa Hutchinson on Monday. However, his veto was overridden with a vote of 25–8 in the state Senate and 72–25 in the House of Representatives. The law prohibits healthcare professionals from administering puberty blockers, cross-sex hormone therapy, or gender-affirming surgery to individuals under eighteen, as well as from referring them to other providers. Representative Robin Lundstrum from Arkansas’ District 87 stated, \"[t]hey need to get to be 18 before they make those decisions.\"\n\nThe ban also affects minors who are already undergoing such treatments, with violators facing the loss of their medical licenses. While conservative organizations like The Family Council praised the bill, Governor Hutchinson described it as \"a product of the cultural war in America.\" He expressed hopes that his veto would encourage fellow Republicans nationwide to refrain from involving the state in parental and healthcare decisions.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, representing 67,000 pediatricians across the country, criticized the bill for denying essential medical care to young people. Madeline Deutsch, medical director at the University of California San Francisco, emphasized the widespread professional agreement on the necessity of transition treatments, stating, \"[t]here's tons of solid science supporting this approach.\" Dr. Robert Garofalo, head of adolescent and young adult medicine at a children’s hospital in Chicago, condemned the ban for \"[perpetuat[ing] the very things we know are harmful to trans youth].\"\n\nHolly Dickson, executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the ACLU, condemned the bill's supporters for \"[disregarding] widespread, overwhelming, and bipartisan opposition\" and continuing their \"discriminatory crusade against trans youth.\" She asserted that blocking trans youth from necessary care is \"not only wrong, it's also illegal,\" announcing plans for a lawsuit challenging the law. Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice with the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV project, reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to defending rights, stating, \"[w]e will always have your back and will be relentless in our defense of your rights.\"\n\nThe passage of this law follows similar anti-transgender measures enacted in Arkansas and other states, including a bill signed by Hutchinson on March 25 that bans transgender girls and women from competing in sports consistent with their gender identity, which Dickson described as \"discriminatory and shameful.\"\n\nIn the wake of the law's enactment, the pro-LGBTQ rights group Human Rights Campaign reported that over 100 bills targeting transgender individuals have been proposed, with similar legislation emerging in more than 20 states."}

This marks North Korea's first official withdrawal from the Olympics since its boycott of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, CBS News reported.\n\nAccording to South Korea's Ministry of Unification, this is the first instance of North Korea withdrawing from a major international sports event due to infectious disease concerns. While several athletes from various countries opted out of the 2016 Summer Olympics over fears of the Zika virus, North Korea did not participate in that event.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in had expressed hopes that the two nations could form a joint team, similar to the unified Korean Peninsula team at the 2018 Winter Olympics, as reported by Al Jazeera.\n\nAlthough North Korea claims to have no cases of COVID-19, Park Won Gon, a professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University, stated that the country has exhibited \"coronavirus-related neurosis\" since it implemented an emergency anti-virus system in January of the previous year. He noted that it is highly unlikely North Korea would secure sufficient vaccines for its population by July, when the Olympics are set to take place.\n\nIn November, Daily NK reported that North Korea had quarantined around 81,000 individuals, excluding soldiers, and by October 22, 32,011 people were in isolation.

The crisis has been exacerbated by COVID-19 border closures, according to The Korea Times.\n\nIn the statement, the director of the Research Institute for Nutrition Care of Children, part of the Academy of Medical Science of the DPRK, labeled the UN report as \"a sheer lie,\" \"seriously distorted,\" and \"a black-hearted act of hostility aimed at tarnishing the image of our country.\" The statement emphasized that the nutrition care of children is considered a top priority in North Korea, despite challenging conditions and shortages. It also contended that \"self-styled experts\" affiliated with the UN are distorting the reality in North Korea to suggest a severe \"malnutrition of children.\"\n\nThe UN report, published on March 10, relied on observations from Tomás Ojea Quintana, the special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea. In his findings, Quintana noted that COVID-19 has led to starvation-related deaths due to a decline in business operations. The report also mentioned that \"several individuals who violated anti-epidemic measures were reportedly executed in public.\" These alleged executions are said to have taken place in various cities, including the capital, Pyongyang, where one man was reportedly executed for engaging in 'illicit trade' with China.\n\nAdditionally, a report by The Korea Times cited an unnamed non-governmental organization stating that \"approximately 440,000 children, along with pregnant and lactating women, will not receive micronutrients, about 95,000 acutely malnourished children will lack necessary treatment, and roughly 101,000 kindergarten-aged children will not obtain fortified foods.\"\n\nNorth Korea's border restrictions, aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, have led to significant shortages of essential goods, including medicine, as reported by Reuters, citing Russia's diplomatic mission to North Korea. This situation has also triggered an \"exodus\" of foreign diplomats from the country, according to the same report."}

Alongside his responses, Stanley provided two links for the first two questions: the first included opinion pieces authored by him, and the second featured press releases from a think tank with which he is affiliated. These links can be found in the external links section.\n\nThe first opinion piece focused on housing, advocating for social housing to be limited to individuals who have lived in the UK for at least ten years, a 20% stamp duty on homes sold to foreign buyers, and the elimination of income tax relief for \"buy to let\" mortgages. The second piece criticized a recent hate speech law passed by the Scottish Parliament, arguing that it posed a threat to personal freedoms and the privacy and security of families in their homes.\n\nThe two press releases addressed COVID-19 issues. The first, released in late January 2020, urged mass flu and pneumococcal vaccinations for high-risk groups and the suspension of flights to and from China, barring medical relief flights. The second, issued on March 15, 2020, called for a series of measures, including closing the UK border, implementing a national lockdown, providing Universal Credit for all during the crisis, ensuring a guarantee of essential utilities, and national procurement of ventilators."}

The proposed measures stipulate that only \"patriots\" loyal to the People's Republic of China will be eligible to participate in elections. This move follows widespread protests against the government over the past two years, and it comes as 47 pro-democracy candidates and activists remain imprisoned under national security laws.\n\nDuring the annual work report, Premier Li Keqiang emphasized the need to \"resolutely guard against and deter\" foreign interference, addressing an audience of approximately 3,000 congressional members. This led to a draft decision incorporating recommendations from Wang Chen, the vice chair of the NPC's standing committee. The recommended changes include amendments to Hong Kong's constitution, which would empower the committee that elects the chief executive to \"directly participate in the nomination of all legislative council members\" and establish a \"qualification vetting system\" for the entire electoral process.\n\nPolitical scientist Willy Lam from the Chinese University of Hong Kong commented to Agence France-Presse that the proposed vetting committee would likely disqualify any candidates deemed disloyal to the Chinese Communist Party. Following the announcement, Beijing's liaison office noted that \"people from all walks of life in Hong Kong have voiced their support\" for the proposed changes.\n\nIn last year's work report, the introduction of national security laws granted the Chinese government enhanced powers to convict Hong Kong residents and bar them from running for office. As of Thursday, 47 pro-democracy activists and potential election candidates were still detained following an informal \"primary poll\" that prosecutors claimed aimed to \"overthrow\" the government.\n\nAdditionally, approximately a thousand protestors gathered outside the Hong Kong court on Monday, calling for the release of what they referred to as \"political prisoners,\" according to The Guardian. Those arrested faced charges on Sunday, with 32 denied bail partly due to the stringent conditions imposed by national security laws. Meanwhile, 15 defendants received bail despite opposition from prosecutors."}

The tremor was felt across the North Island and parts of the South Island. Additionally, two earthquakes measuring 7.4 and 8.1 were recorded near the Kermadec Islands by New Zealand's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Over a dozen aftershocks were reported, some reaching magnitudes of 5.4.\n\nAround 9:45 AM, NEMA issued a warning indicating potential land and marine hazards, anticipating flooding along the Northland coast from Cape Reinga to Whangārei and Ahipara, as well as areas along New Zealand's East Coast from Matata to Tolaga Bay. However, this advisory was later revised, and the tsunami warning was canceled by 2:48 PM. Updated notifications cautioned that \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" could persist for up to another 24 hours, urging residents to \"remain vigilant and take extra precautions.\"\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern expressed her concern on Instagram, stating, \"Hope everyone is OK out there – especially on the East Coast who would have felt the full force of that earthquake.\" In a press conference, Minister for Emergency Management Kiri Allan confirmed that the entire community of Ōpōtiki had been evacuated, commending residents for their prompt response: \"People have done the right things in the regions by picking up and packing up and staying calm.\""}

Ingenuity is part of the Perseverance mission, which primarily focuses on astrobiology. It is designed to fly, explore Mars, and collect rock samples in the search for signs of life.\n\nIngenuity had previously been stored in the belly of Perseverance, a car-sized rover that landed in Jezero Crater on Mars on February 18. The rover charged and kept Ingenuity warm. On Sunday, Ingenuity was released from the rover, which then moved away to expose the helicopter's photovoltaic array to direct sunlight.\n\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory issued a statement confirming that this was the first instance of Ingenuity surviving the night independently while directly exposed to the Martian atmosphere. In the statement, NASA highlighted that they had \"the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a significant achievement for the team.\" The temperatures on Mars can drop as low as -90 °C (-130 °F). The helicopter utilized energy from its solar array to power a small heater, protecting its electronics from the extreme cold.\n\nMars has just 1% of Earth's atmosphere, necessitating that Ingenuity's propellers rotate around three times faster to achieve flight than they would on Earth, according to ABC News. The helicopter has been engineered to be lightweight, weighing approximately 1.8 kilograms. Tim Canham from NASA noted, \"The processor on the helicopter is about 100 times more powerful than the processor on the rover itself.\"\n\nThe next step is a blade movement test scheduled for today, as reported by CNN. If successful, it will be followed by the first flight test, potentially occurring by Sunday. This would mark the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. Five flights are expected within the next 31 days. If successful, these flights will enable further movement of the helicopter, allowing it to collect rock samples and take photographs of its surroundings. Throughout the research period, Ingenuity will also measure its temperatures and monitor battery recharge performance.\n\nThe Perseverance rover is set to deliver images from Ingenuity to Earth, reportedly a few hours after they are captured. NASA indicated that the rover traveled a distance of 471 million kilometers to reach the crater."}

Organizers claimed an attendance of 25,000 at the protest, according to The Berlin Spectator.\n\nProtesters carried signs with slogans such as \"You can have our hatred, you do not get our rent. (Housing is not a commodity)\" in German: \"unseren hass den konnt ihr haben, unsere miete bekomm ihr nicht (wohnen ist keine ware)\" and \"The rich should pay! (Social struggles connect [us])\" in German: \"die reichen sollen zahlen (soziale kämpfe verbinden).\" Some demonstrators brought lids from frying pans, creating noise as the German word for lid is the same as that for rent cap, and they chanted, \"If you take a cover from us, we'll come back with thousands.\"\n\nThe rent cap was previously introduced by a coalition of the Social Democratic Party, the Greens, and the Left Party in response to rising rent prices. The appeal that led to the ruling was filed by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union alliance and the Free Democratic Party. The Berlin State Government's earlier ruling had frozen rents from February 2020 to February 2025 at June 2019 levels. Sebastian Scheel, the senator responsible for urban development, expressed his disappointment and suggested that either the federal government or individual states could now create laws to regulate rent."}

The United Kingdom and NATO also revealed similar troop withdrawal plans.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had set a May 1 deadline for troop withdrawal. Both the U.S. and NATO allies will begin their withdrawals on that date. The conclusion of the U.S. withdrawal will coincide with the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, which prompted the U.S.-led incursion into Afghanistan, now the nation’s longest war.\n\nSpeaking in the same room where former President George W. Bush announced the launch of airstrikes on Al-Qaeda training camps, Biden stated, \"We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. [...] We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result.\" Regarding the war's duration, Biden remarked, \"I'm now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth.\"\n\nBiden also referenced a worldwide threat assessment indicating that \"the Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield\" and emphasized that \"American troops shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries. That's nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely.\" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani expressed in a tweet, \"We will work with our U.S. partners to ensure a smooth transition.\"\n\nCurrently, around 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan, part of a NATO mission involving approximately 9,600 personnel; reports suggest that there could be as many as 1,000 special operations forces present as well. However, both U.S. and UK combat operations officially ended in October 2014.\n\nBiden asserted, \"It's time for American troops to come home,\" with the exit to be conducted \"responsibly, deliberately, and safely.\" While NATO and the UK will join the U.S. in significant troop withdrawals in the coming months, the U.S. will continue \"diplomatic and humanitarian work\" in Afghanistan, according to the BBC.\n\nNATO has stated that it has achieved its goal of \"preventing terrorists from using Afghanistan as a safe haven to attack us,\" and maintains that \"[t]here is no military solution to the challenges Afghanistan faces.\" A NATO statement declared: \"Our troops went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted together, and now we are leaving together.\" Germany's Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told the German broadcaster ARD, \"We'll go in together, we'll leave together. I am for an orderly withdrawal.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized cooperation during a meeting in Brussels, stating, \"I am here to work closely with our allies [...] on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together, and out together.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, when announcing the UK's \"drawdown,\" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace noted that while \"[t]he people of Afghanistan deserve a peaceful and stable future,\" \"the security of our people currently serving in Afghanistan remains our priority, and we have been clear that attacks on Allied troops will be met with a forceful response.\" He added, \"We must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten.\"\n\nAfter speaking with former President Bush, Biden stated, \"[W]e're absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, courage, and integrity of the women and men of the United States armed forces who have served.\"\n\nIn the Senate, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the withdrawal as \"a grave mistake,\" warning that \"[f]oreign terrorists will not leave the United States alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them.\" Republican Representative Liz Cheney described it as \"a huge victory, huge propaganda victory, for the Taliban, for Al-Qaida.\" Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan criticized the plan, arguing that \"the withdrawal of U.S. troops must be based on the facts on the ground, not arbitrary deadlines.\" Her fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren noted that Biden \"recognizes the reality that our continued presence there does not make the U.S. or the world safer.\" Former President Barack Obama also supported the decision, calling it \"the right choice.\"\n\nThe Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency warned the Senate about \"the potential terrorism challenge,\" indicating a \"significant risk\" posed by \"Al-Qaida and ISIS in Afghanistan\" to \"U.S. targets.\""}

In a statement published by the Rodong Sinmun, Kim Yo Jong remarked, \"The peaceful spring days of three years ago are unlikely to return,\" with Arirang News noting that the \"peaceful spring\" refers to inter-Korean meetings held in April 2018.\n\nIn her remarks, Kim labeled the South Korean authorities as \"all born with stupidity\" and \"dumb and deaf bereft of judgment.\" She expressed concerns about the military drills, which the North perceives as a threat, and indicated the potential closure of various inter-Korean organizations, including the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country and the Kumgangsan International Tourism Bureau. \"We are also considering the dissolution of the Kumgangsan International Tourism Bureau and other related organizations, as any cooperation and exchange with the South Korean authorities, who antagonize us, are no longer necessary,\" she stated.\n\nAt the conclusion of her statement, Kim cautioned, \"If it [the United States] wants to sleep in peace for the next four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at the outset.\"\n\nIn an interview with Arirang News, Yang Moo-Jin, vice president for public affairs at the University of North Korean Studies, interpreted Kim's message as an indication that \"the regime is willing to talk [...] as long as the South [Korean authorities] demonstrate sincerity by avoiding tensions through joint drills.\" Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University, observed that the North \"is reaffirming its long-held stance that there will be no talks unless sanctions against the regime are lifted.\" Meanwhile, Andrei Lankov, director of the Korea Risk Group, described the message as unremarkable, stating that similar sentiments emerge each spring and should not be overstated. He characterized the statement as \"business as usual\" and noted that, in the context of North Korean rhetoric, it is relatively mild."}

This vacancy arose in November following the death of Patriarch Irinej. Perić's formal enthronement is scheduled for today.\n\nOriginally named Prvoslav Perić, he was ordained as a monk in 1985 and became Metropolitan in 2014. He will now lead a congregation of 12 million followers across the former Yugoslav republics, including the disputed region of Kosovo, as well as dioceses in Australia, the United States, and Western Europe.\n\nPerić has previously expressed conservative, pro-government views, including a critique of Serbian journalist and human rights advocate Sonja Biserko in December. He has also advocated for the dismissal of vocal professors at the Faculty of Theology in Belgrade.\n\nA current controversy involves church property in neighboring Montenegro. A law enacted in 2019 mandates proof of ownership for properties built before 1918, while the relatively new Montenegrin Orthodox Church claims all Orthodox properties within the country, despite most being under Serbian Church control.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church does not recognize Kosovo's independence, mirroring the official stance of Russia and Serbia. Kosovo is home to numerous significant Orthodox religious sites and is regarded as a cradle of the faith. Notably, Perić was ordained a monk at the Decani monastery in Kosovo.\n\nThe election process involved 39 eligible bishops from the Holy Assembly of Bishops, who cast their votes in a secret ballot at Belgrade's Memorial Cathedral of Saint Sava. Following deliberations, three candidates were selected, and their names placed in envelopes. Perić's name was drawn at random, which believers interpret as an indication of the Holy Spirit's will.\n\nA thanksgiving service immediately followed the election.

The EMA's review included safety data from over 17 million vaccinated individuals across the EU and the United Kingdom, focusing on cases of rare blood disorders.\n\nIn a statement released on the EMA's website, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee affirmed that \"the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19, which itself can cause clotting problems and can be fatal, continue to outweigh the risk of side effects.\" The committee found no increased risk of blood clots associated with the vaccine, specific batches, or particular manufacturing sites, while noting a possible link between \"very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia.\"\n\nAn analysis of over 469 reports, including 191 from the European Economic Area, showed that \"[o]verall, the number of thromboembolic events reported after vaccination [...] was lower than that expected in the general population.\"\n\nSeveral countries in Europe and beyond paused vaccinations following reports of blood clots and fatalities among individuals who had received the vaccine, with Austria suspending specific batches. The World Health Organization (WHO) reiterated on Thursday that countries should continue to use the AstraZeneca vaccine. Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge stated that while \"we do not know whether some or all of the conditions have been caused by the vaccine or by other coincidental factors, [...] the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks.\" WHO planned to release further report findings on Friday.\n\nWhile countries can decide whether to heed EMA's guidance, many indicated they would only resume inoculations upon receiving its endorsement. Following a preliminary statement deemed \"encouraging,\" France and Italy indicated they would \"promptly restart\" vaccinations if the findings were positive.\n\nAstraZeneca maintained that its vaccine does not pose an elevated risk of blood clotting, reporting only 37 cases of blood clots among the 17 million vaccinated in the EU and the UK, a figure described as \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally\" and \"similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nThe recent suspensions have further complicated the European Union's vaccination efforts, already strained by significant supply shortages. French immunologist Alain Fischer remarked on France Inter that the decision to temporarily halt the rollout was \"not lost time,\" justified by \"a few very unusual and troubling cases.\" In comments to the BBC, University of Birmingham drug safety researcher Dr. Anthony Cox referred to the situation as a \"cascade of bad decision-making that's spread across Europe.\""}

{"title": "Wikinews discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman after GitHub re-enables public access to youtube-dl", "content": "**Wednesday, April 21, 2021**\n\nOn November 16, GitHub re-enabled public access to the youtube-dl repository, a command-line software tool for downloading videos from the internet. This decision followed a letter from Mitchell Stoltz, a Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), representing the maintainers of youtube-dl. GitHub had previously blocked the repository on October 23 after receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nLaunched in July 2008, youtube-dl is a free and open-source software written in Python that allows users to download videos from various websites. The RIAA's takedown notice claimed that youtube-dl violates 17 U.S. Code § 1201, alleging that the software was designed to circumvent the technological protections of streaming services and redistribute music videos without authorization. The source code included several unit tests to verify the software's functionality under different conditions, which included URLs of copyrighted songs.\n\nIn the letter to GitHub, EFF's Stoltz stated, \"This file contains a series of automated tests that verify the functionality of youtube-dl for streaming various types of video. The youtube-dl source code does not contain copies of these songs or any others [...] the unit tests do not cause a permanent download or distribution of the songs they reference; they merely stream a few seconds of each song to verify the operation of youtube-dl. Streaming a small portion of a song in a non-permanent fashion to test the operation of an independently created software program is a fair use.\" He emphasized that \"youtube-dl does not decrypt video streams that are encrypted with commercial DRM technologies.\"\n\nFollowing the restoration of public access on November 16, the URLs to copyrighted songs were removed from the source code and replaced with a test video uploaded by Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer of youtube-dl. Hagemeister had previously discussed the takedown with Wikinews.\n\nyoutube-dl features a small JavaScript interpreter that functions similarly to a web browser while receiving video data from servers. It includes \"extractors\" designed for various websites to manage content from different sources. The letter further explained that \"any software capable of running JavaScript code can derive the URL of the video stream and access the stream, regardless of whether the software has been approved by YouTube.\" It cited an analogy from J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings,\" where travelers translate a phrase on a door, saying \"say 'friend' and enter,\" illustrating how YouTube provides instructions for accessing video streams to anyone who inquires.\n\nShortly after public access was reinstated, Sergey M, a youtube-dl maintainer, expressed gratitude on GitHub: \"We would like to thank @github for standing up for youtube-dl and making it possible to continue development without dropping any features. We appreciate [GitHub] for taking potential legal risks in this regard. We would also like to thank [EFF] and personally [Mitch Stoltz] for invaluable legal help. Our main website hoster Uberspace is currently facing legal action in Germany for hosting our essentially business card website and has already incurred significant legal expenses.\"\n\nIn a tweet following GitHub's announcement, Stoltz compared youtube-dl to the videocassette recorder (VCR), stating, \"The VCR empowered people to take control of their personal use of free-to-air video, but it had to be saved from the copyright cartel. The same goes for youtube-dl. GitHub did the right thing here.\"\n\nyoutube-dl has become a key resource for thousands globally, facilitating the downloading of Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on Wikimedia Commons through a tool called video2commons. It also allows users to download content from LiveLeak, a platform for citizen journalism. Videos obtained through youtube-dl are often used for fair use purposes or as evidence.\n\nWhen copyright holders release their works, such as photographs, videos, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they permit others to freely use, share, or modify their work, provided proper attribution is given to the creator. YouTube hosts many recordings in the public domain that can be utilized for any purpose without restrictions.\n\nIn a blog post announcing the return of youtube-dl, GitHub stated, \"Although we initially took the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn't mean it can't also be used to access works in non-infringing ways. We also recognized that this project's code serves many legitimate purposes, including enhancing accessibility, preserving evidence for human rights advocacy, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or public domain videos.\" \n\nGitHub pledged to scrutinize future DMCA takedown notices carefully to dismiss \"unwarranted claims\" and promised to support software developers when claims are ambiguous. The GitHub Trust and Safety team will treat developer tickets as a \"top priority,\" and GitHub also announced a USD 1 million donation for a developer defense fund to protect open source developers from unjust DMCA claims.\n\nInitially, GitHub had blocked public access to several forks of youtube-dl following the DMCA notice in October. During the time public access was disabled, Sergey M continued to develop youtube-dl and hosted it on GitLab, another code-sharing platform. However, with the restoration of public access on GitHub, Sergey M has made the GitLab repository private.\n\nFollowing these developments, Wikinews contacted Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, who has long criticized DRM (digital rights management) and the implications of DMCA 1201, to discuss the associated harms."}

This marks an increase from the previous goals established in 2014, which aimed for a 40% reduction by 2030 and an 80-95% reduction by 2050.\n\nThe EU Climate Law, which was agreed upon after 14 hours of negotiations, also includes the creation of a 15-member independent body to provide guidance on climate policies and promotes increased investment in carbon sinks. European Parliament members (MEPs) assert that these measures will ensure the achievement of the 57% net reduction target. However, Barbara Mariani, a senior climate and energy policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau, challenges this assessment, arguing that the measures would only result in a 52.8% reduction in actual emissions.\n\nIn a press release from September 2020, the European Commission (EC) committed to presenting legislative proposals by June 2021, following extensive public consultation and impact assessments. These proposals may include restrictions on the amount of CO2 removal that counts towards the emissions reduction target, incentivizing member states to focus on actual emissions reductions rather than simply offsetting them. The release stated that adopting the new target promptly would enable the EU to express its enhanced climate ambition to international partners ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow.\n\nAs part of this decision, the EU plans to allocate at least 30% of its €1.8 trillion long-term budget to climate-related concerns. Poland has developed its own climate strategy, opting not to commit to climate neutrality and instead aiming for a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030. The country, which currently relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, is making strides towards renewable energy and the establishment of its first nuclear power plant, according to Reuters.\n\nEC President Ursula von der Leyen remarked that this decision sets \"the EU on a green path for a generation.\" In contrast, MEP Michael Bloss expressed disappointment, stating, \"We fought hard but achieved little,\" and labeled the law a \"big disappointment.\" Wendel Trio, Director of Climate Action Network Europe, criticized the target as being inconsistent with the Paris Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C by the century's end, describing the law as \"rushed\" and inadequate for leading global climate efforts.\n\nPascal Canfin, MEP and chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee, acknowledged the difficulty in amending the language to reflect a more ambitious target, noting, \"The compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, under existing measures, the EU is projected to achieve a 46% reduction in emissions by 2030. The EC's press release indicated that greenhouse gas emissions dropped by a quarter between 1990 and 2019.\n\nAdditionally, multiple reports indicate that the United Kingdom has set a target of a 78% reduction by 2035."}

He argued that smaller countries like Ireland \"need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries.\" \n\nSpeaking at a virtual seminar focused on international tax, Donohoe emphasized that any agreement must \"accommodate Ireland's 12.5% tax rate.\" This rate is particularly beneficial for large corporations such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, which together account for one in eight jobs in Ireland. According to CNBC, corporate tax receipts in Ireland reached €11.8 billion in 2020, with the Department of Finance projecting an increase from €11.6 billion in 2021 to €12.5 billion by 2025, as reported by The Irish Times.\n\nDonohoe stated that Ireland's competitive tax rates serve as an incentive to attract jobs and investment, asserting his support for an agreement that allows for \"appropriate and acceptable tax competition,\" but it must remain lower than the 21% proposed by the United States. \n\nHe called on nations to recognize the low tax rates in Ireland and other smaller countries, pointing out the \"advantages of scale, location, resources, and industrial heritage\" enjoyed by larger countries. Defending Ireland's long-standing 12.5% rate, he argued that it falls \"within the ambit of healthy tax competition\" and is instrumental in stimulating investment, growth, and innovation, which are central to Ireland's industrial policy. The Guardian reported that current proposals could reduce Ireland's corporate tax base by 20%, resulting in tax receipts being €2 billion lower than they would otherwise be by 2025, according to the Irish Department of Finance.\n\nBrian Keegan, the director of public policy at Chartered Accountants Ireland, remarked that the issue at hand is \"not tax change, it's political change.\" Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the OECD, noted that \"there is a new dynamic that is likely to bring us to a resolution,\" adding that the US's willingness to address expressed concerns simplifies an admittedly complex blueprint.\n\nA spokesperson for the Irish Department of Finance told CNBC on Monday that \"political level discussions on these issues have not yet taken place.\" \n\nThe Guardian also noted that many companies in Ireland pay significantly lower taxes on revenues compared to their counterparts in other countries, with Apple reported to have paid as little as 0.005% in 2014. A European Commission ruling in 2016 mandated that Apple pay €13 billion in back taxes owed to the Irish government; however, the ruling was overturned in July on the grounds that \"[t]he commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage.\""}

{"title": "World Trade Organization declares US tariff hike illegal, rules in South Korea's favour", "content": "**Revised News Article**\n\n**Thursday, January 21, 2021**\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in favor of South Korea regarding what it identified as excessive tariffs imposed by the United States on several of its products.\n\nThe eight tariffs, which affect large power transformers and four grades of steel, were implemented in 2012 and 2016 during the Barack Obama administration. The U.S. Department of Commerce justified these high rates—ranging from 9.49% to 59.72% on steel and 60.81% on transformers—by invoking the \"adverse facts available\" (AFA) provision. This provision requires companies accused of violations to provide extensive information, or else face substantial anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. Following unsuccessful negotiations, South Korea formally initiated a complaint with the WTO in February 2018.\n\nA three-member WTO panel determined that the U.S. Commerce Department had not adequately specified the information required from South Korean companies and had improperly disregarded or rejected some of the information provided. Consequently, the tariffs levied on companies such as Hyosung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems, Hyundai Steel, and POSCO were deemed inconsistent with WTO regulations.\n\nNevertheless, the panel did not support South Korea's assertion that U.S. authorities maintained an \"unwritten measure\" that promoted the use of adverse facts to justify heightened duties.\n\nThe United States has the option to appeal within 60 days; however, due to restrictions enacted by former President Donald Trump on the Appellate Body, it currently lacks sufficient members to do so.\n\nThe European Union has also backed the case, citing the impact on steelworkers in the UK, the Netherlands, and Italy as a rationale for its involvement. A related 2018 ruling between the United States and Canada uncovered similar concerns regarding the provision's application."}

French singer Barbara Pravi's entry \"Voilà\" finished in a close second with 499 points, while Swiss artist Gjon's Tears secured third place with \"Tout l'univers,\" garnering 432 points.\n\nAmong the 39 countries that participated this year, 26, including the host nation Netherlands and the Big Five—France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom—advanced to the finals. The competition commenced on May 18. Notably, three of the Big Five and the host finished at the bottom of the rankings, with the Netherlands receiving 11 points, Spain six, Germany three, and the UK landing in last place with zero points—all of which were from the public vote.\n\nDuncan Laurence, who won the 2019 edition of Eurovision in Tel Aviv with his song \"Arcade,\" had previously seen the Netherlands host the competition in 2020, which was canceled due to the escalating spread of COVID-19 in Europe.

Instead, a pre-recorded performance by Daði og Gagnamagnið was aired, which placed fourth with 378 points, just ahead of Ukrainian singer Go_A's \"Shum,\" which received 366 points.\n\nDuring the jury voting, Switzerland initially led with 267 points, followed closely by France at 248 points. Pravi expressed her excitement, stating, \"I think it is crazy that two French songs are at the top, thank you!\" Both the Swiss and UK national juries awarded 12 points to France, prompting Pravi to exclaim, \"Merci!\" while clapping and blowing a kiss to the Swiss team.\n\nItaly's strong public support, with 318 points from viewers, propelled them to victory. Upon winning, Måneskin's lead vocalist Damiano David declared, \"We just want to say to the whole of Europe, to the whole world, rock and roll never dies.\"\n\nAs this year's winner, Italy will host the next Eurovision Song Contest. Italy previously won Eurovision in 1990, and Måneskin's victory makes them the first band to win the competition since 2006, as noted by the BBC."}

Over the previous five days, heavy rainfall led to flooding and damage to farms and homes, with some areas receiving as much as a month’s worth of rain within just 48 hours, including 150mm at the Great Dividing Range, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).  \n\nBoM indicated on Tuesday that while the intensity of the rains was lessening and shifting eastward, water levels remained high in certain areas, with many flood alerts still in effect. Meteorologists noted that eastern regions might recover from flooding relatively quickly, but areas west of the Great Dividing Range could experience prolonged effects, potentially lasting weeks or months before water levels normalize. Additionally, thick fog is expected to develop over the coming weekend as air temperatures fall below the dew point at night, creating misty conditions, as reported by News.com.au.  \n\nIn Taree, NSW, ABC News reported multiple rescue operations for cattle caught in rivers and surf, including an incident where a dwelling was swept away on the owners' wedding day. A farmer on the Mid-North Coast lost both his home and livestock due to the flooding. In residential areas, Hawkesbury continued to see rising flood levels as of Monday. Ian Wright, a researcher from Western Sydney University, noted the flooding in Hawkesbury poses significant risks due to the area's terrain and the influx of water from nearby rivers, referencing a publication by the State Emergency Service on this topic.  \n\nOn Monday, NSW Police rescued an 80-year-old woman trapped in a car at River Road, Wyong, Central Coast, just moments before the vehicle was swept into the river. Local authorities urged the public to stay away from flooded areas. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a Road Weather Alert for all suburbs of Sydney on Monday. Government agencies, including Disaster Recovery Officer Simon Oliver from the Department of Primary Industries, announced plans to support those affected by the floods. Oliver stated, \"While it’s still early days, we are planning to provide support, including emergency fodder and assistance for those who need to move or dispose of stock.\"  \n\nBoM reported that weather conditions may improve on Wednesday, with a warmer, drier air mass expected to move in and a coastal low entering Bass Strait.

Since 1994, the area's six historical societies have received an annual grant of A$500 each from the council to assist with administrative costs. In her address, Johnson characterized historical societies as vital \"repositories of information for [the council],\" emphasizing the importance of keeping them \"alive and viable\" to continue providing necessary services.\n\nJohnson's appearance at the council meeting was unscheduled and followed the release of the council's draft budget on April 12, which allowed 28 days for public submissions. Representing the Latrobe Combined History Group, Johnson chose to speak in support of her written submission during the meeting.\n\nDuring her speech, Johnson highlighted the rising costs of communication, noting that postage expenses have doubled in recent years. While historical societies have sought to mitigate these costs by transitioning to the internet, Johnson pointed out that this shift still incurs expenses for domain names, software, and web development. Additionally, societies are mandated to test and tag their equipment; for instance, the Traralgon Historical Society faces annual costs exceeding A$250 for this requirement.\n\nJohnson noted that each society has had to adapt to increasing costs and demand. She cited the Traralgon Historical Society's decision to reduce the number of bulletins it produces and discontinue outsourcing their production to local businesses, a move she stated deprived \"income away from businesses within the town.\" She concluded her speech by asserting that historical societies \"need to remain here for future generations.\"\n\nIn her written submission, Johnson requested an increase to A$1000 per society and confirmed, in response to a question from Councillor Dale Harriman, that this proposal would cost the council an additional A$3000 beyond the current funding. Harriman remarked on the \"ongoing work [historical societies] are doing for council, of great benefit to the whole community,\" noting that the A$500 funding has remained unchanged for seventeen years.\n\nHarriman also inquired about what historical societies charge for their services. Johnson provided an example where the Traralgon and Moe societies created maps for identifying asbestos in residential housing, for which they charged A$400. Harriman responded that A$400 was \"less than it cost you to actually chase up and find them.\"\n\nThe Latrobe Combined History Group, represented by Johnson, encompasses six historical societies from Boolarra, Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Yallourn North, and Yinnar."}

Tragically, all 53 crew members aboard are now presumed dead, and wreckage from the submarine has been located.\n\nAir Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto reported that images received depict various parts of the submarine, including the rear vertical rudder, anchors, outer pressure body, and embossed dive rudder. The Navy announced on Saturday that the submarine is officially classified as sunk, rather than merely missing, having previously indicated that the oxygen supply would have been depleted by Saturday morning.\n\nReports indicate that items recovered from the submarine include a bottle of grease, prayer mats, and a piece of metal pipe. Tjahjanto stated that parts found near the submarine's last known location could not have escaped without water pressure, leading to the conclusion that they were remnants of the submerged vessel. \n\nAdditionally, Tjahjanto noted an oil spill in the vicinity, suggesting that the submarine may have experienced a leak either while descending to deep waters or when attempting to surface.\n\nThe search team is concentrating on pinpointing the submarine's exact location; however, authorities have cautioned that conducting a salvage operation would be challenging due to the depth of the water. The Singapore Navy's MV Swift Rescue submarine rescue vessel has contributed to the effort, deploying a robot to capture images. Support has also come from other nations, including Malaysia, the United States, India, and Australia, in the search for potential rescue.\n\nIndonesian ship KRI Rigel has been scanning the area believed to be the submarine’s resting place using multi-beam sonar and a magnetometer. Military chief Yudo Margono indicated that scans have confirmed the submarine is located at a depth of 850 meters, significantly exceeding its survivable limit of 500 meters. \"The cracks occurred gradually in various parts as it descended,\" Margono commented."}

In response to these events, the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus, prompting many European carriers, including Austrian Airlines, to avoid flying over Belarusian airspace and using its airports.\n\nAn Austrian Airlines official stated to TASS that the airline has suspended flights over Belarusian airspace \"until further notice,\" necessitating an adjustment of the flight route from Vienna to Moscow. \"The change in the flight path must be approved by the authorities.

Huntress Labs, a cybersecurity firm, claims that the attack was orchestrated by REvil, a ransomware group based in Russia. Kaseya promptly advised its customers to halt the use of its services upon discovering the breach.\n\nNBC News reports that the ransomware first impacted about 40 of Kaseya's clients, primarily companies managing internet services for various customers, some overseeing operations for thousands of businesses. John Hammond, a security researcher at Huntress Labs, noted, \"It's reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses.\" Kaseya alerted its customers about the attack on Friday afternoon, stressing the need to cease using its services immediately.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, REvil is a Russian organization that offers ransomware-as-a-service. BleepingComputer revealed that they received a sample of the ransomware used in the REvil attacks and noted demands of USD five million for decryption of the files; however, it remains unclear if all victims received the same ransom demand. Fabian Wosar, Chief Technical Officer at Emsisoft security firm, reported that affected customers were being asked for USD 44,999.\n\nThe Swedish grocery chain Coop was significantly impacted by the attack, forcing the closure of all 800 of its stores as its checkout systems were rendered inoperable. Therese Knapp, a Coop spokesperson, stated in an interview with Swedish Television, \"We have been troubleshooting and restoring all night, but have communicated that we will need to keep the stores closed today.\" Additionally, Swedish company Visma Esscom, which manages servers for businesses, was using Kaseya software, according to Reuters. Rail services in Sweden were also affected.\n\nIn response to the incident, U.S. President Joe Biden instructed intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the attack. He remarked that \"we're not certain\" who is to blame, further commenting, \"[t]he initial thinking was it was not the Russian government, but we're not sure yet.\" The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced it is \"taking action to understand and address the recent supply-chain ransomware attack.\""}
{"title": "130 countries at OECD summit agree to back global corporate tax rate", "content": "**Sunday, July 4, 2021**\n\nOn Thursday, 130 of the 139 countries and jurisdictions participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) summit on taxation reached a consensus to support a significant reform of the international taxation system. This reform aims to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate and effectively commits most of the world's economies to a two-pillar \"solution.\"\n\nAmong those endorsing the plan were regions such as Gibraltar, Hong Kong, and Montserrat, as well as recognized tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, in addition to all Group of Twenty (G20) countries. However, notable exceptions to the agreement include Barbados, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Kenya, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, with Peru abstaining due to its lack of a functioning government.\n\nThe countries that have signed on represent over 90% of global gross domestic product (GDP). The OECD described the framework as a product of \"negotiations coordinated by the OECD for much of the last decade,\" criticizing the \"century-old international tax system\" as \"no longer fit for purpose.\" The initiative received backing from U.S. President Joe Biden and follows a similar agreement from the Group of Seven (G7) on June 5 regarding international taxation.\n\nThe agreement, known formally as the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,\" adopts a two-pillar approach, with a final implementation plan expected by October. \n\nIf enacted, the first pillar would require multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profitability above 10% to allocate taxes on over USD 100 billion in profits from their home jurisdictions to other markets where they derive a minimum of one million euros or 250,000 euros, depending on the GDP of those markets. An OECD statement indicated the threshold for affected MNEs under the first pillar may be adjusted to those with turnover exceeding ten billion euros, based on a review to be conducted in seven years.\n\nThe second pillar introduces two \"Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules,\" requiring a top-up tax of at least 15%, along with a treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule\" slated to be implemented in 2023.\n\nThe OECD estimates that the combined impact of both pillars could increase global corporate income tax (CIT) reserves by between 1.9% and 3.2%, equating to approximately USD 50 billion to USD 80 billion. When considering the existing U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income, this growth in CIT reserves could rise to between 2.3% and 4%, or USD 56 billion to USD 102 billion. The OECD also highlights that this reform could mitigate tax avoidance practices, which it estimates cost countries between USD 100 billion and USD 240 billion in lost revenue annually.\n\nThe OECD anticipates a \"relatively small\" negative impact on investment and economic activity, projected at 0.1% of GDP in the medium to long term. Concerns raised include the potential loss of governments' ability to employ tax incentives for policy objectives and the costs associated with ensuring compliance.\n\nCountries opposing the agreement include Hungary and Ireland, which have historically pursued lower tax rates to attract foreign direct investment and currently maintain corporate tax rates below the proposed minimum of 15%. Ireland's corporate tax rate stands at 12.5%, while Hungary's is at 9%. Additionally, Ireland is projected to lose over two billion euros over the next four years due to the agreement. Estonia has a noted tax exemption on undistributed corporate funds, alongside instances where a 14% rate applies.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann stated in the press release that \"this historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere,\" adding that while it \"does not eliminate tax competition,\" it establishes multilaterally agreed limitations.\n\nPresident Biden indicated that this agreement brings the world \"striking distance of full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom,\" which U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described as a race \"no nation\" has won. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire referred to the initiative as the \"most important international tax agreement in a century.\"\n\nIrish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe acknowledged Ireland's reservations but expressed a commitment to the process, assuring the global community that \"Ireland will continue to play our part in reaching a comprehensive and, indeed, historic agreement.\" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán called the proposal \"absurd\" and emphasized that the country's low tax rates are not designed to attract specific companies to declare their taxes in Hungary, nor does it label the country a \"tax haven.\"\n\nVenice, Italy, is set to host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at a \"G20 High-Level Tax Symposium\" on July 9, as announced by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance."}

This development prevented what could have been the country's fifth election in two years.\n\nThe coalition, termed the \"government of change,\" announced by Lapid, has the backing of a majority of opposition parties in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. However, it still requires a parliamentary vote of confidence, which is expected to occur this week. If it passes, Netanyahu's longstanding tenure—totaling twelve years, making him Israel's longest-serving prime minister—would come to an end, with Yamina party leader Naftali Bennett stepping in. Bennett is known for his strong support of the controversial Israeli settlements in the West Bank and his opposition to an independent Palestinian state.\n\nUnder a rotation agreement established among the eight parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years of their four-year term, while Lapid will take on the role of foreign minister, according to CNN. The two leaders are set to swap roles on August 27, 2023, as reported by the BBC.\n\nThe coalition consists of parties with diverse interests, including the United Arab List, led by Mansour Abbas, which has made history by becoming the first Arab party in Israel to participate in forming a government. According to the Associated Press (AP), this agreement has secured various concessions for Abbas, such as legal recognition for Bedouin villages in southern Israel and a plan to invest ILS 30 billion to reduce crime in Arab communities.\n\nAs noted by the BBC, the other five parties contributing to the coalition's 62-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset include Blue and White (led by Benny Gantz) with eight seats, Yisrael Beiteinu (led by Avigdor Lieberman) with seven seats, the Israeli Labor Party (led by Merav Michaeli) with seven seats, New Hope (led by Gideon Sa'ar) with six seats, and Meretz (led by Nitzan Horowitz) with six seats. Yesh Atid is the largest opposition party with 17 seats.\n\nThe parties, despite their varied interests, unite in their desire to oust Netanyahu. In announcing the coalition, Lapid pledged that \"[t]his government will work for all the citizens of Israel, those that voted for it and those that didn’t. It will do everything to unite Israeli society.\" Michaeli expressed elation, stating, \"[t]oday, we succeeded. We made history.\" Gantz described the previous night as one \"of great hope.\" Abbas, reflecting on the complexity of joining the coalition, called the decision \"hard\" but emphasized the importance of reaching agreements.\n\nFormer Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told Al Jazeera, \"The situation in which eight medium and small parties are forming a coalition has never happened before.

This increase follows a rise of over 600,000 patients on the waiting list in the past three months. Despite this surge, the average wait time of just under eleven weeks has shown a steady decline since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced total hospital admissions, according to The Guardian.\n\nTotal admissions for surgery and general treatment saw a significant fourfold increase, reaching nearly pre-pandemic levels with 242,064 admissions in May, up from 54,550 a year prior, as reported by Sky News. In May 2019, there were 295,881 admissions for routine treatment.\n\nThe rise in demand is largely attributed to non-COVID-related cases; over two million people visited accident and emergency departments (A&E) last month, making it the busiest June on record. A blog post from the NHS Confederation warned that the rising demand for urgent, non-COVID-related healthcare among both adults and children is \"putting severe and unprecedented strain on the urgent care system,\" leading to unsustainable numbers of patients visiting A&E, consulting their GPs, and calling ambulances.\n\nDespite the increasing demand, wait times appear to be decreasing. Between April and May, the number of individuals waiting over 52 weeks for treatment fell by 50,000, though this figure remains thirteen times higher than last year. Additionally, patients waiting over eighteen weeks decreased by 83,000 during the same period. NHS medical director Stephen Powis noted this marked the first decline this year. However, only 67% of patients received treatment within eighteen weeks, falling short of the NHS standard of 92%, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe average wait for elective care has decreased to 10.8 weeks, down 29% from May last year, according to Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation. In a blog post, he stated that while the waiting list backlog is concerning at 5.3 million patients, it is encouraging that more people are seeking care, as this aligns with the NHS's purpose.\n\nTaylor also mentioned that the urgent care system is operating at \"winter-like capacity in the middle of summer,\" underscoring the need to approach the upcoming phase with caution, as disruptions to the care the NHS can provide are likely to continue, including in community settings.\n\nThe Guardian highlighted additional challenges, noting that nearly 25% of A&E patients waited over four hours to be seen. Moreover, only 75% of cancer patients were seen within two weeks of screening, below the 90% target, and urgent GP referrals fell short of the 85% target. An October analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support estimated that 50,000 fewer people received cancer diagnoses the previous year, warning that the backlog could increase by 4,000 missed diagnoses per month, potentially surpassing 100,000 by this October. In August, urgent referral activity in England lagged 11% behind 2019 levels.\n\nTo address these issues, the NHS announced a budget of one billion GBP to restore services and reduce the waiting list, as stated by The Guardian.\n\nOn Thursday, the UK reported 32,551 new COVID-19 cases and an additional 35 deaths. This marks an increase of over 4,000 cases from the previous week, the highest number since the week of January 27. Health Minister Sajid Javid commented that COVID cases \"could reach as high as 100,000\" ahead of the anticipated lifting of all remaining lockdown restrictions on July 19, referred to as \"Freedom Day,\" according to Sky News and The Guardian."}

This development comes following North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's call for the reopening of North-South communication during a speech at a Workers' Party of Korea meeting. He expressed hope for an \"early recovery of the present inter-Korean relations and the establishment of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.\"\n\nThe state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Kim's remarks, which included a caution directed at the South Korean government. The statement urged South Korean authorities to recognize the significance of reopening the communication lines and to make active efforts to address pressing issues that affect inter-Korean relations.\n\nThese communication lines had been severed in August at North Korea's request as a form of protest against US-South Korea joint military exercises. The KCNA had indicated that communication would resume at 9 AM KST (UTC midnight) on Monday. According to CTV News, officials engaged in dialogue over the phone and discussed fishing activities in their disputed western maritime border.\n\nThis restoration of communication occurs amid heightened tensions, with North Korea having conducted multiple missile tests last week. One of these launches, confirmed by Japanese and South Korean defense ministries, was reported to be an early-stage hypersonic missile, launched shortly before a North Korean representative criticized the US during a speech at the UN General Assembly."}

{"title": "Taylor Swift's Evermore records biggest sales week of the year as it returns to No 1 on album chart", "content": "**Friday, June 11, 2021**\n\nTaylor Swift's album *Evermore* has reclaimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart this week, following an astounding 8307% spike in sales. Originally released in December, *Evermore* saw its vinyl edition debut on May 28, though preorders had been available since the album's release.\n\nIn the week ending June 3, *Evermore* sold 192,000 copies, achieving the highest sales week of the year. Billboard attributed this surge in sales to several factors, including record-breaking modern-era vinyl LP sales—totaling 102,000—along with Swift-signed CDs and significant discounts on its digital album. The Billboard 200 ranks the most popular albums in the U.S. each week, factoring in both album sales and streaming.\n\nThis week, *Evermore* made a remarkable leap from 74 to 1, marking the largest ascent to the number one position since Radiohead’s *In Rainbows* soared from 156 to 1. Since then, only three albums have re-entered the chart at number one, the latest being Bon Jovi's *This House Is Not for Sale* on the March 10, 2018 chart, due to bundled concert tickets with the album. *Evermore* set a new record for the biggest sales week for a vinyl album, selling over 40,000 copies from May 28 to May 31, surpassing the previous record held by Jack White's *Lazaretto*. By the end of the week, total vinyl sales for *Evermore* reached 102,000.\n\nThe delay in *Evermore*'s vinyl release can be attributed to the extensive production time required for vinyl records. Given that the album was announced just a day before its release, it is likely that there was insufficient time to produce physical editions, including vinyl copies, in advance. In other countries where *Evermore* reached number one upon its December release, it also experienced a resurgence. On the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart Top 100, *Evermore* jumped 70 spots to reach the number 4 position. In Australia, the ARIA Top 50 Albums chart saw it rise nine spots to number 38, while in New Zealand, *Evermore* re-entered at number 30 on the Official Top 40 Albums chart as one of the fastest rising titles."}

During exercise, individuals are restricted to a radius of five kilometers from their home and for a duration of no more than two hours. Vaccinations must be administered at the closest possible location.\n\nThis marks the fifth COVID-19 lockdown in Victoria since the pandemic began, with the rules mirroring those from the state's previous lockdown in June. ABC News reported that many of the current cases are linked to a \"group of removalists\" from New South Wales who traveled through Victoria while infected. New South Wales is currently grappling with a COVID-19 outbreak, particularly fueled by the Delta variant, prompting an extension of the lockdown in Sydney by at least two weeks.\n\nIn a press release, Premier Andrews emphasized the importance of swift action, stating, \"If we act now – while we're right on the heels of this outbreak – we can give ourselves every chance of getting ahead of it.

The budget bill, SB 129, alongside the stimulus bill, SB 139, received approval from both houses of the California Legislature for this fiscal year.\n\nThe payments, known as the Golden State Stimulus II, are scheduled to be distributed to eligible California taxpayers starting in September. To qualify, residents must have filed a state tax return for the previous year, cannot be claimed as dependents, and must have earned no more than US$75,000 in wages last year.\n\nEligible Californians will receive a one-time payment of US$600, with households that have dependents qualifying for an additional US$500. It is estimated that around two-thirds of Californians will receive a stimulus payment, according to the governor's office. Newsom first proposed these payments in May as part of his \"California Comeback Plan\" to support the state's economic recovery.\n\nResidents who already received a stimulus payment earlier this year will not qualify for this second payment. However, those who claimed dependents can still receive the additional US$500.\n\nThe budget also allocates US$5.2 billion in rental assistance for low-income residents and landlords, covering unpaid rent accrued during the COVID-19 crisis and several months of future rent. Additionally, US$2 billion is designated to cover overdue water and utility bills.\n\nFurthermore, US$1.5 billion is earmarked for grants aimed at small businesses, along with US$120 million in tax credits for businesses willing to relocate to California.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, California experienced a budget surplus of nearly US$76 billion.\n\nIn signing SB 129, Newsom exercised a line-item veto on Section 19.55, which involved US$2.58 billion in appropriations to various funds \"on a technical basis,\" explaining that the appropriations in this section were already addressed in the budget. In California, the governor can approve a bill while rejecting specific budget-related items. The Legislature can override this line-item veto with a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and the Senate."}

{"title": "Australia: Sunbury railway line slated for five days of 24-hour upgrades", "content": "**Tuesday, August 17, 2021**\n\nLast Thursday, the Victorian state government in Australia announced a series of 24-hour upgrades to the Sunbury railway line in Melbourne, set to take place over five days. Buses will replace trains on the line from 10 PM (1200 UTC) on September 3 until the last service on September 8.\n\nDuring this period, platforms will be upgraded at Middle Footscray, West Footscray, and Sunshine railway stations. Additional improvements will include the installation of \"signalling, communications, and power infrastructure\" across the Sunbury line, upgrades to overhead line structures near the future Metro Tunnel entrance, and enhancements to an electricity substation in Tottenham. \n\nThe level crossing at Gap Road in Sunbury will also be eliminated. A press release from the Premier of Victoria’s office indicated that \"Gap Road/Station Street will be lowered under the existing rail line to preserve the heritage-listed Sunbury Station, improve safety, and ease congestion, particularly as service frequency increases on the Sunbury Line in the future. The project will encompass the construction of new shared paths for pedestrians and cyclists.\"\n\nFrom September 4 to 5, the upgrades will necessitate the temporary replacement of Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong, and Warrnambool V/Line rail services with coach services. This initiative is part of the ongoing Sunbury Line Upgrade, which began in 2019 and is slated for completion in 2023. The Victorian Government heralds the upgrade as a means to deliver \"major improvements in capacity, reliability, and frequency of services on the Sunbury line.\"\n\nAccording to the aforementioned press release, the Sunbury Line Upgrade aims to \"create space for 113,000 additional passengers during peak periods each week once the Metro Tunnel is operational.\" The Metro Tunnel project will establish a continuous railway link between the Sunbury line and the Cranbourne and Pakenham railway lines.\n\nIn discussing these upgrades, Victorian Minister for Transport Infrastructure Jacinta Allan stated, \"We’re not wasting a moment delivering these vital upgrades to the Sunbury line, which will enable larger, more modern trains to operate on the line, resulting in a better public transport experience for passengers. These upgrades will benefit commuters, road users, and local residents, addressing the needs of the growing communities in the West.\"\n\nDaniel Bowen, a spokesperson for the Public Transport Users Association, expressed support for the upgrades in an email to Wikinews, stating, \"It’s good to see these improvements moving forward. They will allow the new Evolution high-capacity trains to operate on the Sunbury line once the Metro Tunnel opens, helping to alleviate crowding. The removal of level crossings will also enhance safety and improve service reliability.\" \n\nBowen added that, despite the positive infrastructure developments, the government must do more to enhance train services, particularly by increasing service frequency throughout the day to reduce waiting times. \"Passengers currently wait up to 20, 30, or even 40 minutes for trains outside peak hours—this is insufficient for Melbourne's rapidly growing north-western suburbs.\"\n\nJack Medcraft, Deputy Mayor of Hume City Council and a local Sunbury councillor, shared his thoughts in an email to Wikinews, stating, \"Regarding the Sunbury line upgrades, these are well overdue, and I believe the ongoing work will significantly enhance future services. Sunbury residents will likely appreciate the underpass from the railway line and the improved services.\"\n\nMedcraft went on to address additional transport infrastructure concerns, noting, \"However, my only question is the duplication of Macedon Street and Sunbury Road, where two lanes each way will ultimately converge into a one-lane bridge in Bulla, creating potential traffic issues, especially with the traffic signals along that route as new housing estates are developed. While I support the road duplication efforts, I am frustrated by the lack of progress on the single Bulla Bridge.\"\n\nHe also mentioned another pressing public transport issue, lamenting the government's failure to establish a smart bus route from Melbourne Airport to Sunbury and Diggers Rest. \"Around 30% of residents work in and around the airport, yet there is no public transport system to facilitate their travel there,\" he said."}

In their joint press release, they referred to this as a \"construction blitz on the line\" aimed at facilitating nine daily return services between Melbourne and Shepparton. Currently, V/Line operates five return services on weekdays to Shepparton as of January 31.\n\nFrom September 4 to September 12, coaches will replace trains to Seymour and Shepparton as stage two works continue on the line. As part of the stage three upgrades, the crossing loop at Murchison East will be extended by 1.1 kilometres, enabling two six-car V/Line VLocity trains to pass each other. \n\nIn addition to these dates, the stage three upgrades will also include the expansion of a new train stabling facility in Shepparton, along with signalling and track improvements on the railway line. The stabling facility and loop extension, along with stage two upgrades, have been contracted to Coleman Rail and KBR. Completion of stage three is expected by 2023.\n\nBarnaby Joyce, Australian Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, and leader of the National Party of Australia, commented on the upgrades, stating: \"The Australian Government provided the funding for stage three to offer the services Shepparton passengers have been waiting for, and now we’re making sure this work gets underway. Our record $110 billion infrastructure investment is designed to deliver projects like this, benefiting both the community and the economy.\"\n\nSeveral local MPs weighed in on the project. Damian Drum, the National Party federal MP for Nicholls, remarked that \"these upgrades will provide Shepparton with the fast and frequent rail service it deserves as a major regional centre.\" Mark Gepp, a Labor state MLC for the Northern Victoria Region, which includes Shepparton, emphasized that \"delivering four extra services to and from Shepparton each day will offer communities along the line more travel options and a train service they can depend on.\"\n\nTim Quilty, a Liberal Democratic MLC for Northern Victoria, expressed his approval via email to Wikinews, stating, \"I am very pleased to see the Victorian Government make investments in rail infrastructure that will benefit Northern Victorian communities. More efficient and reliable freight and passenger transport will enhance the city’s economy and alleviate traffic on our roads.\" \n\nQuilty also acknowledged Shepparton's significance as a regional centre, noting that \"this investment should continue to enhance transport links—nine passenger services a day will make many Northern Victorian towns envious of the service Shepparton is set to receive.\" However, he cautioned about the government announcements, saying, \"You have to wonder, though, just how many times they can announce the same project before the next election. It would be better if they focused on delivering it rather than just talking about it.\""}

According to the AP, the Taliban now controls at least 24 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Hoda Ahmadi, a local lawmaker from Logar Province, reported that the Taliban has captured all of Logar Province and taken the Char Asiab District, located approximately eleven kilometers south of Kabul.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking to ABC News on the condition of anonymity, indicated that U.S. forces have begun flights to Kabul to assist in the evacuation of embassy personnel and other civilians. President Joe Biden has authorized the deployment of an additional thousand troops to ensure an \"orderly and safe drawdown\" of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to the AP, Mazar-i-Sharif was previously a stronghold of the Northern Alliance, which aided the U.S. in toppling the Taliban's 2001 regime. The AP notes that \"makeshift camps\" are emerging outside Mazar-i-Sharif, primarily housing ethnic Hazaras fleeing their homes.\n\nSalima Mazari, a female district governor of a locality near Mazar-i-Sharif with a population of 36,000, stated, \"In the provinces controlled by the Taliban, no women are left, not even in the cities.

Other nations are also working to evacuate their citizens from Afghanistan.\n\nFollowing nearly 20 years of military presence, the U.S. has withdrawn from Afghanistan. President Joe Biden remarked that the \"endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict\" could not be justified. Amid the escalating Taliban control, many Afghan civilians have flocked to Kabul, with significant numbers fleeing to the airport in attempts to escape the country.

This action followed the May 23 diversion of a Ryanair flight, which led to the arrest of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, as well as ongoing \"repressive practices\" by the Belarusian government.\n\nThe coordinated sanctions were designed to pressure Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's regime, addressing \"continued attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law,\" as well as the politically motivated arrests of Protasevich and Sapega. The joint statement emphasized support for the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people and called for cooperation with investigations into the flight incident, the release of all political prisoners, adherence to recommendations from an expert mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and facilitation of dialogue between the government and opposition.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the forced landing of Ryanair flight FR4978, traveling from Lithuania to Greece and diverted to the Belarusian capital of Minsk, remain disputed. State media suggests the diversion was prompted by a bomb threat, a claim that Global Affairs Canada has deemed \"dubious and still unverified.\"\n\nThe scope of sanctions varied across the involved countries and entities. Canada imposed sanctions on 17 new individuals, bringing the total to 72, and five entities, citing their ongoing disregard for human rights. \n\nThe EU, through the Council of the European Union, expanded its measures to include 78 individuals and eight entities connected to human rights violations or the \"forced and unlawful landing,\" totaling 166 individuals and 15 entities. Those targeted, including judges, business leaders, university rectors, and government officials, will face asset freezes and bans on entering or transiting through EU territory. Additionally, EU citizens and companies are prohibited from providing financial resources to those designated. EU policy chief Josep Borrell stated that the sanctions \"are going to hurt [...] the economy of Belarus heavily.\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas added that the decision to target entities, not just individuals, would impact key sectors significant to the Belarusian economy, including the export of potash, tobacco, and petroleum.\n\nThe United Kingdom has implemented further sanctions, building on measures established in September, which initially targeted eight Belarusian officials including Lukashenko and his son. The new restrictions involve eleven individuals and two entities, which will also face asset freezes and travel bans. One targeted entity is BNK (UK) Ltd, a petroleum exporter reported to provide services to oil sector companies in Belarus. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab remarked that \"cutting off oil export revenue streams\" is a key approach to holding the Belarusian regime accountable.\n\nIn the United States, the State Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed visa restrictions on 46 Belarusian individuals in significant positions. The U.S. also added 16 individuals and five entities to its sanctions list, citing concerns related to the country's transnational repression, threats to international efforts, and the \"fraudulent\" 2020 presidential election as reasons for the sanctions.\n\nBelarusian Nikolai Shchekin, speaking on state media network the Belarusian Telegraph Agency, questioned the timing of the sanctions, noting that June 21 falls one day before the anniversary of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, known as the \"Great Patriotic War.\" According to CNN, the U.S. attempted to announce its sanctions before a meeting between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but were delayed due to EU considerations."}

The explosion occurred in South Los Angeles, California, on East 27th Street, injuring 17 people and damaging numerous vehicles and properties.\n\nAs a result of the incident, five members of the LAPD's bomb squad have been reassigned, according to Moore. On June 30, officers discovered over 32,000 pounds (approximately 14,500 kg) of illegal fireworks at a residence in South L.A. Bomb disposal technicians placed roughly 16.5 pounds (7.5 kg) of explosives into a \"total containment vessel\" (TCV) for detonation. However, according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), 42 pounds (19 kg) of explosives were actually detonated. The TCV failed to contain the explosion, resulting in injuries to 17 individuals and damage to 13 nearby businesses, 22 residences, and 37 vehicles.\n\nMoore stated that the TCV's capacity allowed for a maximum of 15 pounds (6.8 kg) for repeated use or 25 pounds (11 kg) for a single use. The containment truck had been in use for ten years, and the June 30 incident marked its 42nd deployment.\n\nThe ATF is also investigating the actions of the LAPD, with findings expected in one to two months. \n\nThe homeowner where the fireworks were found, 26-year-old Arturo Ceja III, has been arrested on suspicion of unlawful possession of destructive devices and child endangerment.

While not all these fatalities were directly caused by COVID-19, excess deaths provide valuable insights into the pandemic's impact. \n\nThe researchers emphasized that the actual death toll is \"likely to be far greater than the official count\" and may extend into the millions. Arvind Subramanian, a co-author of the report, noted that \"after the first wave, which was more widespread, there was a perception that India had avoided the worst due to underreporting of deaths, fostering a sense of complacency. However, the horrific images during the second wave galvanized Indian society to seek a clearer understanding of the numbers.\" Subramanian also pointed out that the reported figures only accounted for deaths up to May and did not include those from June or any of July, suggesting the true death toll may still be underreported.\n\nIndia has officially recorded more than 414,000 COVID-19 deaths, making it the third-highest total globally. There is currently no official data on excess deaths throughout the pandemic in India."}

The report highlights that approximately 50 North Korean defectors and escapees were recently sent back home after being arrested by Chinese authorities.\n\nAn anonymous witness informed Radio Free Asia that \"The Dandong customs office was opened just for today, and they [Chinese border authorities] sent about 50 North Korean escapees back to North Korea on two buses.\" The witness also noted that \"dozens of police officers were positioned in front of the customs office to block public access and prevent anyone from filming.\"\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, North Korea completely closed its borders, which halted the repatriation of defectors. This recent repatriation marks the first since January 2020, when North Korean authorities sealed the Sino-Korean border to safeguard the country from the pandemic. Prior to the outbreak, repatriations of defectors who crossed the Yalu and Tuman rivers into China occurred regularly.\n\nThe United States Department of State took notice of this action, with a spokesperson expressing concern regarding reports of the forced repatriation of nearly 50 North Koreans. They urged China to \"fulfill its international obligations\" under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, as well as the UN Convention Against Torture.\n\nRadio Free Asia reported that some of the 50 repatriated individuals were soldiers and pilots who had served in North Korea's Air Force. Sending such refugees back to North Korea, where they may face imprisonment and torture, contravenes the United Nations' 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol, and the UN Convention Against Torture. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 1,170 North Koreans are currently detained in various prisons in China's Jilin and Liaoning provinces, facing deportation after being charged with criminal offenses.\n\nAlthough China and North Korea maintain a friendly relationship, evidenced by leaders exchanging greetings on July 11, a 1986 bilateral border protocol requires the deportation of any and all defectors and North Koreans residing illegally in China.\n\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Unification reported that only two defectors from North Korea reached South Korea between April and June of this year, marking the lowest number recorded since the Ministry began tracking such inflows. This decline is largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has completely halted people from entering or leaving North Korea, despite the regime's claims of having no virus cases.\n\nNorth Korean defectors typically transit through China to reach South Korea or another safe country, as the Sino-Korean border is more easily crossed than the North-South border. The closest defector-friendly country accessible by land is Vietnam."}

Military personnel are actively involved in rescue operations. The floods have triggered landslides, severely impacting the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, where the metro system and roadways were submerged.\n\nVideos shared by passengers on the Zhengzhou Metro revealed water levels reaching neck height as they clung to handrails. Tragically, at least twelve individuals lost their lives in the metro, while five others sustained injuries; over 500 people have been rescued.\n\nAmong the deceased are four individuals in Gongyi, who died when houses and walls collapsed, forcing more than 20,000 residents to evacuate. The floods have also devastated agriculture, damaging roughly 9,000 hectares of crops, which amounts to an estimated $11.3 million in losses.\n\nHeavy rainfall and storms have impacted Henan province since July 17.

The payment, made to a Citibank account following a 30-day grace period, came after assurances from various Chinese government officials. At a forum in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He characterized the associated risks as manageable, while the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Yi Huiman, emphasized the need to address excessive debt through improved debt financing constraints, assuring that the situation would be properly managed.\n\nOnce the leading real estate developer in China, Evergrande has amassed approximately USD 305 billion in liabilities, equivalent to about 2% of the country's gross national product. Its valuation has plummeted by 80% due to dwindling resources, according to Reuters. Data from September indicated that home sales in China declined by nearly 17% year-on-year, as reported by The Guardian. Concerns over Evergrande's potential default contributed to a slowdown in China’s GDP growth for the third quarter, which fell to a year-low of 4.9%. Two negotiations with rival developers, Hopson Development and Yuexiu, valued at USD 2.6 billion and USD 1.7 billion respectively, were reportedly halted due to a lack of consent from the Guangdong provincial government, which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.\n\nFollowing news of Evergrande's payment, its shares surged by as much as 7.8% this morning after a two-week trading pause associated with the anticipated sale of a 50.1% stake in Evergrande Property Services Group. This development provided some relief to bondholders, according to Reuters. James Wong, a portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management, described the news as “a positive surprise,” adding, “If Evergrande pays this time, I don’t see why it won’t pay the next time.” Jun Rong Yeap from IG Asia pte. remarked to Bloomberg that the report “overturned” the prevailing narrative suggesting that Evergrande would struggle to secure cash in the future.\n\nAdditional payments are due on October 29 and November 11, following similar 30-day grace periods; nearly USD 280 million is owed to bondholders, including the USD 83.5 million remitted yesterday.\n\nStock prices have declined for many major Chinese developers. Reuters reported that as of Wednesday, year-to-date stock prices have dropped 87.8% for Sinic Holdings, which is currently in Fitch Ratings' 'restricted default' status after failing to make an October 18 bond payment of USD 246 million, according to The Guardian. Evergrande itself has seen an 80.2% decline, while E-House fell by 78.3%, Fantasia Holdings by 58.5%, and Kaisa Group—defaulting since 2015—by 54.6%, with its bonds reaching record lows.\n\nEstimates suggest that the Chinese real estate market constitutes between 16% to 25% of the country's GDP, according to The Guardian. Chinese President Xi Jinping aims to shift the economy from debt-driven \"inflated\" growth to a model focused on improved \"quality and returns.\" This objective includes imposing regulations on developers that restrict their borrowing capacity. A commentary by economist George Magnus published on October 15 highlighted China's \"ghost cities\" and the \"rampant credit creation\" that have led to high vacancy rates and the \"financialization of housing.\""}

Additionally, he revealed a planned 6.6% increase to the National Living Wage.\n\nSunak defended the previous \"pause\" in public sector pay, which excluded 2.9 million National Health Service workers and those earning less than £24,000 per year, while applying to 2.6 million teachers, police officers, civil servants, and members of the British Armed Forces. While pay rises are anticipated to begin in spring next year, specific details are awaiting consultation by independent advisers and pay review bodies, according to the i. The Guardian reports that as many as 5.7 million public sector employees may receive a pay rise.\n\nFurthermore, around two million minimum wage workers, some of whom fall under the 5.7 million figure, could benefit from increases in the national minimum and national living wages. According to the i and The Guardian, the National Living Wage for those aged 23 and over will rise by 59p to £9.50 an hour starting next April, equating to about £1,000 annually for a full-time worker, in line with recommendations from the Low Pay Commission. Additionally, the National Minimum Wage for those aged 21 to 22 will increase by 82p to £9.18 an hour, while the Apprenticeship Rate will go up by 51p to £4.81 an hour.\n\nHowever, Tom Waters, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, remarked, \"While this boosts earnings for full-time minimum wage workers by over £1,000 a year, those on universal credit will see their disposable income increase by just £250 due to rising taxes and reduced benefits as their earnings climb.\" Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, criticized the proposal, calling it \"underwhelming\" and noted, \"Much of it will be swallowed up by the government’s tax rises, universal credit cuts, and failure to manage energy bills.\" The Office for National Statistics reported UK inflation at 2.9% for the year ending in September.\n\nPhillipson contrasted Sunak's proposals with those of a Labour government, stating, \"With a new deal for workers, exploitative practices like zero-hour contracts banned, fire and rehire outlawed, a minimum wage of at least £10 an hour, and fair pay agreements, a Labour government will transform work and raise standards,\" according to The Independent.\n\nThe Daily Mirror suggests that Mr. Sunak is considering raising the National Living Wage to £10.50 an hour and lowering the qualifying age from 25 to 21 by the next election in 2024. This would align with Labour's pledge for \"a decent income that you can raise a family on\" by increasing the minimum wage to at least £10 an hour.\n\nDuring the media briefing, Sunak stated that it was \"[t]he economic impact and uncertainty of the virus\" that led to the challenging decision to pause public sector pay. He added, \"Along with our Plan for Jobs, this action helped protect livelihoods at the height of the pandemic. Now, with the economy firmly back on track, it’s right that nurses, teachers, and all public-sector workers who contributed during the pandemic see their wages rise.\"\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had previously announced his intention to foster a \"high-pay, high-skill economy\" following Brexit, though experts suggest it may take years for wage growth to keep pace with rising financial pressures, according to the i.\n\nAnalysis by the Resolution Foundation cited by The Guardian indicates that those affected by the pay freeze earned nearly 8% less than their private sector counterparts, a gap that widened to 0.6% for all public sector employees, including those exempt from the freeze. The Office for National Statistics highlighted that total private sector pay rose by 8.3% from June to August 2021, in contrast to a mere 2.5% growth in public sector pay."}

The United Nations previously issued a warning that North Korea faces potential starvation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussions also included a proposal from South Korea to formally conclude the Korean War, which has remained unresolved since the last Armistice Talks in July 1953.\n\nBefore the meeting, Sung Kim, the U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea, expressed optimism, stating he looked forward to \"productive follow-up discussions\" following their previous meeting in Washington, D.C. last Tuesday. The Sunday agenda encompassed the denuclearization of North Korea, the formal declaration of the end of the Korean War, and the delivery of humanitarian aid as a means to reinvigorate diplomatic engagement.\n\nPost-meeting, Kim emphasized that the U.S. calls on North Korea to \"cease destabilizing activities and instead engage in dialogue.\" He reaffirmed that the U.S. \"remains ready to meet with the DPRK without preconditions\" and clarified that the U.S. does not harbor any hostile intentions toward North Korea.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, U.N. Special Rapporteur on North Korea Tomas Ojea Quintana indicated that the country could be in dire need of humanitarian assistance and advocated for the easing of sanctions against its textile and seafood industries. He cautioned that ongoing border closures and restricted trade could lead to starvation and warned that the region is \"veering towards an arms race.\"\n\nDuring a U.S. Department of State briefing that same day, spokesperson Ned Price reaffirmed that \"[U.N.] Security Council resolutions regarding the DPRK remain in effect\" and stated that efforts are underway to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to those most in need in North Korea.\n\nLast Tuesday, North Korea conducted a test of a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). In response, Envoy Kim urged the North to \"refrain from further provocations and engage in sustained and substantive dialogue.\" North Korea countered, accusing the U.S. of \"overreacting.\" Notably, South Korea launched a new SLBM on September 15, while North Korea had tested a hypersonic missile in the early stages of development on September 28."}

The application garnered support from various organizations, including the United Workers Union, Australian Council of Social Service, the Uniting Church of Australia, and 88 Days and Counting, as well as state governments in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia.\n\nFollowing the ruling, AWU secretary Dan Walton expressed to ABC News, \"Too many farmers have manipulated the piece rate system to establish pay and conditions well below Australian standards. This ruling will make it easier for workers, including those with limited English proficiency or no local connections, to know if they are being underpaid.\" Walton praised the decision as \"one of the great victories in our union's 135-year history.\"\n\nHowever, the decision faced opposition from several groups, including The Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, Australian Industry Group, Fruit Growers Tasmania, Lucaston Park Orchards, Payne’s Farm Contracting, and the National Farmers' Federation (NFF). According to ABC News, the NFF specifically opposed the ruling, arguing that it could jeopardize the viability of farms and that piece work enhances productivity."}

In 1997, Governor-General Sir William Deane issued a proclamation urging all Australians to observe a minute of silence in remembrance.\n\nAccording to the Australian War Memorial website, 61,630 Australians lost their lives during WWI, which lasted from August 4, 1914, to March 31, 1921. This makes WWI the deadliest conflict in Australian history. The RSL website further reports that out of a population of five million, 416,809 Australians enlisted in the armed forces, with 155,000 sustaining injuries and 8,000 dying from post-war injuries.\n\nThe questions were answered by RSL Ambassador Pete Rudland, who served in the Australian Defence Force from 1989 to 2017.

The couple was met with intense media attention and heavy security at Tokyo’s Haneda International Airport.\n\nMako, a former princess and niece of the Japanese emperor, renounced her title to marry Kei, her college sweetheart. While Japan is modern in many aspects, traditional views regarding women's status and family values remain influential, with royal members prohibited from marrying \"commoners.\"\n\nThe couple chose New York as their new home because Kei has secured a position at a law firm there, although he has not yet passed the New York bar exam. The Associated Press reported that this detail was highlighted by Japanese media to undermine his credibility, despite it being common for individuals to not pass the exam on their first attempt.

Coal is responsible for approximately 40% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions and is the highest-emitting fossil fuel in this regard.\n\nDespite this progress, BBC News reported that the commitments made during COP26 fall short of sufficiently limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. A 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C highlights the significant differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius; while 1.5 degrees could mitigate severe climate impacts, reaching 2 degrees Celsius would worsen climate change effects worldwide.\n\nAlthough there were initial plans to phase out coal entirely, India's climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, emphasized that such a move is unrealistic for developing nations that must continue to address developmental goals and poverty eradication. This perspective shifted the focus of discussions toward reducing coal usage rather than complete elimination at this time.\n\nCOP26 President Alok Sharma expressed regret over the softened terms of the pact, stating that it was necessary to ensure the overall agreement remained intact.

{"title": "New Zealand raises interest rates in second straight month to 0.75%", "content": "**Thursday, November 25, 2021**\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) increased interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% in its final policy meeting of the year. This decision followed a report indicating a consumer price inflation rate of 4.9% for the third quarter, the highest level since December 2007.\n\nThe hike in the official cash rate (OCR) was largely anticipated by economists and market participants; 21 of the 23 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll conducted from November 15-19 had predicted this increase, while the remaining two anticipated a rise of 50 basis points, bringing the rate to 1%.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, New Zealand's approach to managing COVID-19 has involved significant fiscal and monetary stimulus, aligning with the strategies of other major economies. This has resulted in the unemployment rate reaching a record low, while inflation has surged to its highest point in over a decade. The combination of stimulus spending, low interest rates, and a housing shortage has contributed to a doubling of home prices over the past seven years, making New Zealand the least affordable country among OECD nations, as stated by Reuters.\n\nThe Reserve Bank issued a statement highlighting that \"near-term inflation is being exacerbated by higher oil prices, rising transport costs, and the effects of supply shortfalls,\" which poses a risk of more generalized price increases, as reported by ABC News. The RBNZ projects that rates could rise to 2.5% by 2023, potentially increasing further by 2024. However, a recent article suggests that the OCR may only reach 2% by the end of 2023, which would be lower than the level observed in 2014.\n\nMore recent forecasts from Capital Economics economist Ben Udy indicate a rise to 2% by mid-2022, while acting chief economist at Westpac, Michael Gordon, projects rates could climb to 3% by the third quarter of 2023, including a possible 0.5% increase at the RBNZ's next meeting in February, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nThis announcement followed a widely anticipated rate hike earlier on October 6, which raised the rate from 0.25% to 0.5%—the first increase in seven years. This step was part of the RBNZ's planned tightening cycle, initially set to launch in August but delayed due to the Delta variant outbreak and lockdowns in Auckland. Senior market strategist at the Bank of New Zealand, Jason Wong, noted that \"we're on a path towards a series of rate hikes, and the market is well priced for that.\"\n\nRBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told reporters that \"steady increments of 25 basis points towards a level slightly above the neutral rate represent the most balanced approach we can take,\" although Reuters reports that the bank considered a variety of options, including a 50 basis point hike. Orr also commented on the housing market, cautioning that homeowners with high leverage must be \"incredibly wary\" of potential interest rate increases, particularly as earlier taxes imposed on property investors failed to mitigate rising house prices, which the RBNZ believes are unsustainable and at risk of correction. He emphasized the need to balance stimulus measures with concerns over growing household debt.\n\nWhile many countries are gradually winding down pandemic-related stimulus efforts, some are facing pressure regarding their interest rate policies. In the United States, the inflation rate recently surged to 6.2%, the highest in 31 years, prompting calls for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to accelerate the tapering of monthly bond purchases, according to the Associated Press. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) have faced criticism for their forecasts amid rising inflationary pressures, as noted by The Guardian and Reuters.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde stated to the European Parliament on November 15 that \"an undue tightening of financing conditions is not desirable, and would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery.\" She added that any tightening measures taken too soon could cause more harm than benefit, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has maintained its stance that interest rates are unlikely to rise until 2024. RBA Governor Philip Lowe mentioned at an Australian Business Economists luncheon last week that current data and forecasts do not support a rate increase in 2022. For a rate hike to be considered, Lowe stated that \"the economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario,\" according to ABC News.\n\nIn the meantime, several central banks, including those in Norway, the Czech Republic, and South Korea, have already increased rates, with South Korea expected to raise rates again in a meeting today.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% as some investors anticipated a higher rate hike, while both 2- and 10-year government bond yields decreased by 10 basis points each."}
