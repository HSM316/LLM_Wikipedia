{"title": "Argentine president Fernández to send bill legalising abortion to National Congress within 10 days", "content": "**Wednesday, March 4, 2020**\n\nOn Sunday, during a session in Argentina's National Congress, President Alberto Fernández announced his plan to introduce a bill within the next ten days aimed at legalizing abortion in the country. He described the initiative as \"a matter of public health.\"\n\n\"Within the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalizes abortion at the initial stages and ensures that women can access the health system when they choose to abort,\" Fernández stated. Thousands gathered outside the National Congress, chanting slogans in support of abortion legalization.\n\nCurrently, abortion is illegal in the predominantly Catholic nation, permitted only in limited cases: if the pregnancy results from rape or poses a risk to the woman’s health. Fernández noted that the existing law \"has condemned many women, often from marginalized backgrounds, to resort to unsafe abortion practices in secrecy, jeopardizing their health and lives.\"\n\nGovernment estimates suggest that approximately 350,000 illegal abortions are performed in Argentina each year, a practice punishable by imprisonment since 1921. Emphasizing that \"there are many abortions despite the criminal threat,\" Fernández added, \"A responsible state must protect its citizens, particularly women. In the 21st century, every society must respect individuals' right to make free choices about their bodies.\"\n\nFollowing the president’s remarks, Mariela Belski, director of Amnesty International Argentina, stated that Fernández had \"listened to the demands of women, adolescents, and girls.\"\n\nThe proposed reforms faced criticism from Archbishop Jorge Eduardo Scheinig, who labeled it a \"culture of death,\" calling for prayers that \"the commitment to life in Argentina be stronger than the call for death.\"\n\nUruguay, Guyana, and Cuba are the only other Latin American countries where abortion is legal during the early weeks of pregnancy. In 2018, the Argentine Congress approved a bill to legalize abortion, but it was ultimately rejected by the Senate."}

The island nation's cabinet voted unanimously to lift the emergency on Saturday afternoon, and the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) announced the decision later that evening. NEOC reported a 95% immunization rate as of December 24, with the last measles-related death occurring on December 26.\n\nRestrictions on public gatherings and travel will be lifted, and schools will reopen. The Health Emergency Operation Center will assume responsibility for ongoing relief efforts, previously managed by the NEOC. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been tasked with developing a recovery plan within two weeks for cabinet review. \n\nAs of Sunday, the Disease Surveillance Team reported a total of 5,667 measles cases during the outbreak. Of these, 1,846 individuals were hospitalized, 1,720 have been discharged, and 81 have died. The National Measles Response and Recovery Appeal on December 6 identified children under 5 years old as having the highest mortality rate, which corresponds with a notable shortfall in vaccinations for that age group.\n\nTupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital returned to normal operations on Sunday, following Faleolo District Hospital and Leulumoega District Hospital, which resumed regular functions on Friday. During the peak of the outbreak, Tupua Tamasese Meaole's Acute Primary Care Clinic and Leulumoega District Hospital were designated as measles wards, while Leulumoega District Hospital was set aside for non-measles patients to help contain the infection. An Australian medical mission's fifth rotation will remain on the islands until January 4 to assist in the transition. On Sunday, teams began dismantling the tents that had been set up to accommodate the surge in patients.\n\nThe state of emergency was initially expected to conclude on December 15, but it was extended on December 14 for an additional two weeks to sustain the immunization campaign. At that time, the Prime Minister urged for a 100% immunization rate, announcing that 92% had been reached. As of Sunday, that number had increased to 95%, according to NEOC data. Aid agencies report that populations with high vaccination rates maintain sufficient herd immunity to prevent further outbreaks, indicating that an infected person is unlikely to encounter enough unvaccinated individuals to trigger a chain reaction.\n\nUNICEF reported delivering over 105,000 doses of vaccine to Samoa by November 22, with the national vaccination campaign commencing on November 20. A government mandate made vaccinations free and compulsory for children aged six months to 19 years and for women aged 20 to 35, deemed within childbearing age. On December 5 and 6, the Samoan government executed a planned shutdown of public services and private businesses to allow for a nationwide door-to-door immunization drive, which involved 128 vaccination teams.\n\nTo help control the outbreak, the government banned inter-island travel for individuals under 19, closed schools, and advised residents to avoid public gatherings and medical facilities unless necessary. Unvaccinated pregnant women were restricted from attending their workplaces.\n\nThe outbreak was first confirmed on October 16, following positive measles tests in 7 out of 20 suspected cases by the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne.\n\nIn 2019, measles outbreaks occurred in several areas of the Pacific region, including the Philippines on February 6, Tonga on October 22, Fiji on November 7, and American Samoa on December 8. The D8 strain, which caused an outbreak in New Zealand, has also been identified in Samoa and Fiji. New Zealand acts as a travel hub for several small Pacific nations.

He was greeted by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), who also perished in the strike. Other casualties included a Kataeb Hezbollah official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer.

The statement noted, \"At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and across the region. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including the December 27 attack, which resulted in casualties among American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the recent assaults on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This strike aimed to deter future Iranian attack plans.

Later that evening, the network officially signed off the air. This marked the first shutdown order for ABS-CBN since the martial law imposed by former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972.\n\nAccording to Republic Act No. 3846, also known as the \"Radio Control Law,\" no entity is permitted to operate a radio broadcasting station for commercial purposes without a franchise from Congress. With ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, Republic Act No. 7966, having expired on May 4, 2020, the network lacked the legal authority to continue broadcasting. In compliance with the National Telecommunications Commission’s (NTC) cease-and-desist order issued the previous day, the network signed off that night.\n\nDespite efforts to renew its franchise since July 2019, eleven legislative bills filed on behalf of ABS-CBN have remained stalled in Congress. The expiration of the franchise coincided with Congress's reconvening after a Lenten Break that began on March 13. Although the NTC has the authority to issue a provisional license while applications are pending, it chose not to grant this to the network. Critics, including several Senators, condemned the NTC’s actions, labeling them a \"grave abuse of governmental power\" and contrary to the law.\n\nABS-CBN Corporation is the Philippines' largest television and radio broadcaster, operating over 42 TV stations, 10 digital channels, and 18 FM and 5 AM radio stations, with a broadcasting history spanning more than 65 years. President Rodrigo Duterte had previously threatened the renewal of the network’s franchise after ABS-CBN declined to air some of his campaign commercials, attributing this to airtime constraints. He also accused the network of \"swindling.\" On February 10, Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition alleging violations of the franchise, but a subsequent Senate hearing on February 24 found no evidence of legal breaches. During the hearing, ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak offered refunds for the unaired political ads, many of which were not accepted by Duterte's campaign. Katigbak apologized to the President at the hearing, a gesture reportedly accepted according to statement from Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.\n\nMeanwhile, the network's news channel, ABS-CBN News Channel, continues to broadcast, as ABS-CBN maintains that the cease-and-desist order does not impact its news channel's franchise."}

The states participating in the elections included Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. Together with American Samoa, these contests represented a total of 1,357 delegates for the Democratic nominating convention. A candidate needs at least 1,991 delegates to secure the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSuper Tuesday marked the fifth phase in the Democratic Party's primary election schedule. Prior rounds included caucuses in Iowa on February 3, a primary in New Hampshire on February 11, caucuses in Nevada on February 22, and a primary in South Carolina the preceding Saturday.\n\nEntering Super Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont held the lead with 60 pledged delegates, while former Vice President Joe Biden trailed closely with 54 delegates.

In contrast, Biden garnered pluralities in ten states, including Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Minnesota, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Texas, and Maine, as reported by CNN and NPR.\n\nBloomberg claimed victory in the caucus in American Samoa, marking his first win of the campaign. He had opted not to compete in the earlier primaries and instead concentrated his efforts on Super Tuesday, securing five of the territory's six delegates, along with three in Colorado and one in Arkansas. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii clinched the remaining delegate from American Samoa.\n\nOn the same day he withdrew from the race, Bloomberg endorsed Biden, stating, \"Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump.

He stressed that this agreement infringes on Greece’s sovereign rights amid conflicting exclusive economic zone claims.\n\nThe previous Thursday, delegations from Cyprus, Greece, and Israel convened for their seventh trilateral summit in Athens, where they signed an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, and their respective energy ministers. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers. The Greek daily Kathimerini reported that Greece and Cyprus must expedite efforts to counter potential Turkish interference with the project.\n\nOn the same day, Greek gas producer Energean signed a letter of intent to supply two billion cubic meters of gas annually to Greek gas supplier DEPA, with a planned pipeline capacity of 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has invested $1.7 billion in the Karish and Tanin fields.\n\nNetanyahu, envisioning this political and economic alliance, urged Italy and Egypt to join the project, stating, \"We call on any other country that wishes to join us to do so.\" In Cyprus, the ruling Democratic Rally welcomed the pipeline as a step forward for national sovereignty, while the opposition Progressive Party of Working People noted that the agreement constitutes merely a legal framework, with actual construction dependent on prospective private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy reiterated Turkey and Turkish Cypriot mining rights in the region and warned against neglecting these rights.\n\nOtranto, Italy, is a proposed endpoint for the pipeline, and Italian Economic Development Minister Stefano Patuanelli expressed support before the signing, although he indicated plans for an additional pipeline to Igoumenitsa, Greece. The United States has demonstrated its backing through various measures, including the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill and a quadrilateral meeting in Washington on July 25. The EU has partially funded feasibility studies for the EastMed pipeline, recognizing it as a Project of Common Interest (PCI), which aims to alleviate the energy isolation of Crete and Cyprus and diversify Europe’s gas supply upon completion.\n\nIn December, a Turkish official remarked that the trans-Anatolian pipeline, already operational, renders the EastMed project unnecessary, according to Cyprus Mail. The November 27 maritime border agreement signed between Turkey and Libya includes a section that would intrude upon the Turkish economic zone near Crete and Cyprus, leading Athens to expel the Libyan ambassador. Turkey asserts that only Northern Cyprus, recognized solely by Turkey, is entitled to declare an exclusive economic zone around the island. Due to its drilling activities in the region, Turkey is already under EU sanctions and was condemned in a tripartite statement issued by Egypt, Greece, and Cyprus on October 8.\n\nIn 2017, Cyprus, Greece, and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding concerning the pipeline. According to Cyprus Mail, the 2,000 km long pipeline will connect the gas fields to Crete, the Greek mainland, and ultimately to Otranto, Italy. A May 2019 map from Gas Infrastructure Europe illustrates the pipeline linking the Aphrodite gas field to Thesprotia, Greece, where it merges with the Poseidon pipeline to Italy.\n\nAlex Lagakos, the deputy director of the Greek Energy Forum, pointed out the geopolitical significance of the project rather than its economic viability. He expressed skepticism about EU financing, given its commitment to green energy. The estimated project cost is six billion euros, but he noted that market saturation and competition from LNG terminals might dissuade private investors. Egypt possesses two functioning terminals in the Nile Delta, at Damietta and Idku. On September 19, 2018, Cyprus and Egypt signed a separate agreement to export Aphrodite gas through these ports via a new pipeline.\n\nAvinoam Idan, a geostrategy expert at Haifa University and former Israeli security official, argued that EastMed's proposed gas supply would not significantly alter Europe's energy landscape or impact the market share of Russian gas. An analysis by the German Institute for Economic Research noted the high costs and technical challenges associated with the project, which may render it unfeasible.\n\nDuring a trilateral meeting on January 28, 2016, the EuroAsia Interconnector was proposed as an alternative to export gas as electricity, with a 1,000 megawatt underwater cable connecting the three countries. This interconnector is slated for completion by December 2023 at an estimated cost of 2.5 billion euros, and it is also designated as a PCI. Another similar initiative, the EuroAfrica Interconnector, which involves Greece, Cyprus, and Egypt, is currently in the planning stage."}

Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were previously convicted of fraud in connection to the incident.\n\nThe case centered on the so-called \"Bridgegate scandal\" in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In September 2013, traffic on the George Washington Bridge, a major artery into Manhattan managed by the Port Authority, was deliberately reduced from three dedicated access lanes to just one for four days. Public officials justified this lane closure as a necessary traffic study, but the Supreme Court's ruling indicated that it was a retaliation against the Fort Lee mayor for withholding support from the Governor’s reelection campaign.\n\nThe Supreme Court examined whether Kelly and Baroni's actions constituted property fraud under federal law. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that their actions did not meet the criteria for such fraud, thereby overturning their convictions and sending the case back to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the majority, emphasized, \"not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime. Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property, Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or wire fraud laws.\""}

{"title": "Cairo summit denounces Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement", "content": "**Revised Version:**\n\nOn Wednesday, several foreign ministers convened in Cairo to criticize the memoranda of understanding between Turkey and Libya, which established maritime borders in the Eastern Mediterranean and permitted Turkish military deployments in Libya. The November agreement on border demarcation has led to overlapping exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims, complicating plans for the EastMed gas pipeline, which would traverse Turkish waters.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, along with his Greek, Cypriot, and French counterparts—Nikos Dendias, Nikos Christodoulides, and Jean-Yves Le Drian—met in Cairo to address relations between Libya and Turkey. Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio attended the discussions as an observer.\n\nThe ministers declared the maritime border agreement, reached on November 27, as \"null and void,\" asserting that it \"infringes upon the sovereign rights of third states, does not comply with the Law of the Sea, and cannot produce any legal consequences.\" They urged Turkey to cease its drilling operations within Cyprus's EEZ and criticized the agreement permitting Turkish troop deployments in Libya, stating it violates UN Security Council Resolution 2259. The foreign ministers agreed to reconvene in Crete.\n\nThe following day, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the summit's conclusions, asserting the agreements were \"legitimate and fully compatible with international law.\" Turkey invited the involved countries to engage in dialogue to resolve differences, except for Cyprus, which it does not recognize.\n\nDuring the inauguration of the TurkStream gas pipeline on Wednesday, Turkish President Erdoğan called for regional cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean, asserting Turkey's right to be involved in regional projects due to its extensive coastline. \"No project excluding our country in the Eastern Mediterranean can be implemented regarding economic, judicial, and diplomatic aspects,\" he stated. Erdoğan emphasized the need for cooperation, expressing readiness to take positive steps towards those willing to engage. He defended Turkish drilling in Cypriot waters as a means to protect Turkish and Turkish Cypriot interests.\n\nOn Tuesday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis referred to the border agreement as \"null and void\" and \"geographically ridiculous\" in a speech at the Atlantic Council think tank. He argued that the agreement disregards the exclusive economic zones of Greek islands, including Crete, violating international law. He noted that the Libyan House of Representatives had not ratified the demarcation and introduced the possibility of seeking arbitration from the International Court of Justice. The border issue, he asserted, is the \"main difference\" between Greece and Turkey.\n\nIn the November 27 deal, Turkey and Libya demarcated a maritime boundary that would designate the waters between Crete and Cyprus as part of the Turkish EEZ. Turkey justified its claims based on its lengthy coastline, citing instances where islands played a limited role in border determinations. Following the agreement, Greece expelled the Libyan ambassador.\n\nThe EastMed pipeline represents a collaborative effort by Israel, Cyprus, and Greece to connect offshore gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean to the European mainland via a pipeline that traverses areas Turkey claims as its own. Italy, proposed as a potential endpoint, and Egypt, which has its own gas fields, were openly invited to participate."}

Since the United States Postal Service does not service most Native American reservations, many residents fill out their ballots and rely on voting organizations to deliver them to election offices. The lawsuit notes that many individuals living on Montana's reservations lack reliable transportation to reach voting sites.\n\nPreviously, the law limited each ballot carrier to submitting 80 ballots from individuals outside their family. Under BIPA, this limit has been reduced to just six ballots, with violations resulting in a $500 fine.\n\nJacqueline De León from the Native American Rights Fund stated, \"BIPA disregards the everyday challenges faced by Native American communities. Expecting voters to drive an hour to drop off their ballots is unreasonable; collecting them within reservation communities is a practical solution. Criminalizing this process is unjust for Native American voters and fails to address the real issue of mail delivery to homes.\"\n\nSupporters of the law, including state legislators, argue that it was designed to prevent voter fraud, particularly the risk of ballot collectors discarding ballots that do not align with their preferences. Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton asserted that BIPA enjoys overwhelming support among Montanans, including in Indian Country, stating, \"It's always precarious when plaintiffs attempt to overturn the will of the people.\"\n\nAs of 2020, Montana was home to seven Native American reservations with a collective population of about 70,000.

Reuters reported that approximately 200 people attended the event in New Delhi.\n\nAttendee Om Prakash expressed his commitment, stating, \"We have been drinking cow urine for 21 years; we also bathe in cow dung. We have never felt the need to use Western medicine.\" \n\nThe event began with a yajña (a ritual of offering), during which a poster depicted the coronavirus as an avatar of the Hindu god Narsimha. Chakrapani spoke at the gathering, claiming, \"The coronavirus has emerged due to people killing and consuming animals. The act of killing creates negative energy that leads to destruction.\"\n\nPreviously, Chakrapani has asserted that \"Corona is not a virus, but an avatar sent to protect innocent creatures, delivering a message of death and punishment to those who harm them.\" \n\nOn March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. Their situation report indicated that the virus had resulted in 6,606 deaths and 167,515 reported cases globally. The WHO stated, \"While some traditional remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms, there is no evidence that any medicine can prevent or cure COVID-19. The WHO discourages self-medication with any drugs, including antibiotics.\"\n\nChakrapani also appealed to world leaders, requesting, \"I urge all presidents and prime ministers to consume cow urine daily. These scientists lack solutions, but we have the remedies given to us by the gods.\"\n\nHe further remarked, \"Corona was calm in India because of yajña rituals. However, these ignorant Telangana ministers have provoked it by killing animals and consuming chicken publicly, leading to fears of a more severe outbreak. They must seek forgiveness from Corona immediately, or face a disaster that cannot be halted.\" In Hindi, he stated: \"Corona was calm in India due to yajña rituals. But these ignorant Telangana ministers, by killing animals and publicly eating chicken, have challenged Corona, leading to the speculation of seeing its most formidable form. They must seek forgiveness from Corona promptly, or else a disaster will ensue that no one can stop.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Chakrapani explained to ThePrint, \"Just as we organize tea parties, we have decided to host a gaumutra party to educate people about coronavirus and how cow-related products can help protect them.\"\n\nIn India, cows are considered sacred, and members of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janta Party have previously highlighted the medicinal properties of cow urine. This sentiment was echoed by Assam Legislative Assembly Minister Suman Haripriya, who claimed, \"Coronavirus is an airborne disease that can be cured using gaumutra and cow dung.\"\n\nAccording to reports from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, India has confirmed at least 142 COVID-19 cases, three of which have resulted in fatalities, while 14 patients have recovered. As a precautionary measure to curb the virus's spread, multiple educational institutions across the country are closed, and airport passengers are undergoing health screenings."}

This declaration grants the federal government access to approximately $50 billion in additional funding to combat the crisis, according to NBC News.\n\nThe proclamation stated that \"the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency,\" which officially began on March 1, nearly two weeks prior to the announcement. The Department of Health and Human Services first declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency\" on January 31.\n\nNotably, Trump did not place the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the government's response to COVID-19, a decision that left some disaster management experts disappointed. Tim Manning, a former deputy administrator at FEMA, expressed concern, stating, \"FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis,\" and emphasized, “[i]f there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved.”\n\nThe decision was made under the National Emergencies Act and other governing authorities. In addition to this declaration, the Trump administration announced further measures, including the suspension of interest on federal student loans and an increase in oil purchases for the U.S. strategic oil reserve."}

These primaries serve as a means for both parties to select their nominees for the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Notably, both candidates also claimed victory in New Hampshire's primaries in 2016.\n\nSanders, the Senator from Vermont, garnered 25.7% of the Democratic vote, while former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg closely followed with 24.4%. Both candidates were awarded 9 delegates, with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota securing 6. No other candidates earned delegates, with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts placing fourth at 9.2% of the vote.\n\nTrump, the incumbent President, dominated the Republican primary with over 85% of the votes cast. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld received 9% of the vote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic primary, three candidates announced their withdrawal from the race. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado suspended their campaigns on the same day, while Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, ended his campaign on Wednesday morning.\n\nNew Hampshire's primary marked the first round of voting in the campaign season, following the Iowa caucuses held on February 3. According to NBC News, the Iowa Democratic Party has finalized the allocation of its 41 pledged delegates: Buttigieg secured the most with 14 delegates, followed by Sanders with 12. Elizabeth Warren obtained 8 delegates, Joe Biden collected 6, and Amy Klobuchar earned the remaining 1.\n\nIn the Republican Iowa caucuses, ABC News indicated that President Trump is favored to win the eventual nomination, having claimed 39 out of the state's 40 delegates, with Weld taking the last one.\n\nLooking ahead, the Democratic party's primary season will continue with the Nevada caucuses scheduled for February 22, followed by the South Carolina primary on February 29. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the next Republican primary election or caucus will occur on March 3, when both parties are set to hold over a dozen primaries."}
{"title": "World Health Organization names new coronavirus COVID-19", "content": "**Friday, February 14, 2020**\n\nOn Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by the coronavirus first identified approximately two months ago in Wuhan, China: \"COVID-19,\" replacing the temporary designation \"2019-nCoV.\" It is important to note that \"COVID-19\" refers to the disease, while the virus responsible for it has been named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.\n\nThe name \"COVID-19\" is derived from \"COVI,\" which represents the coronavirus, \"D\" for \"disease,\" and \"19,\" which signifies the year it was first detected, 2019. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized that the name should be easy to pronounce and should avoid any specific references to individuals, animals, professions, or locations in order to prevent stigma, in line with WHO guidelines established in 2015.\n\nThese guidelines were informed by previous outbreaks, such as the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, which was commonly referred to as \"swine flu,\" leading to the unjust culling of over 300,000 pigs in Egypt, as noted by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization's chief veterinary officer, who deemed this action unnecessary. Similarly, the name for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome from 2013 was identified as undesirable.\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine, public health expert Wendy Parmet from Northwestern University cautioned that naming the virus after Wuhan could lead to \"tremendous stigmatization\" of the city's residents, who are victims of the outbreak. She remarked that such naming practices can cause people to associate the disease with specific groups, fostering harmful stereotypes and discouraging necessary reporting and cooperation during health crises. She stressed the need for a name that is easily utilized, to avoid the rise of more damaging slang terms.\n\nMonica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, echoed these concerns, highlighting historical patterns in which individuals from different national, ethnic, or religious backgrounds have been unfairly blamed for spreading diseases. Reports have emerged of individuals, particularly those perceived to be Chinese, facing avoidance and harassment in multiple countries, including Italy, the United States, Thailand, and Canada, amid the ongoing outbreak.\n\nAs of Tuesday, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 1,000 lives and infected tens of thousands globally."}

Ohio, originally scheduled to conduct its primary election, postponed voting due to the national emergency surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. On the same day, incumbent President Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party in the 2020 presidential election after winning the party's primaries in Florida and Illinois.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections alongside caucuses to select their nominees for the upcoming presidential election. A total of at least 1,991 delegates is required for a candidate to secure the Democratic Party's nomination. The three primaries held by the Democratic Party represented a combined total of 441 delegates. Biden's victories in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois brought his total to a reported 1,124 pledged delegates, while Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont trailed with 815 delegates. In the 2016 presidential election, Sanders also lost in these three states to Hillary Clinton. The Democratic Party allocates delegates proportionally based on candidates' vote shares, requiring candidates to receive at least 15% of the vote to qualify for delegate allocation.\n\nOn the Republican side, a total of 1,276 delegates is needed to clinch the nomination. Following his wins in Florida and Illinois, Trump reportedly secured 1,330 delegates, exceeding the threshold required for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine announced the postponement of its primary election, citing public health concerns. In a two-part statement on Twitter, he expressed, “During this time of an unprecedented public health crisis, conducting an election tomorrow would put poll workers and voters at an unacceptable risk of contracting the coronavirus.” He added that Ohio's Health Director, Dr. Amy Acton, would proclaim a health emergency to close the polls, and Secretary of State Frank LaRose would seek court approval to extend voting options, ensuring every voter who wishes to participate can do so.\n\nDeWine's decision followed President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency in response to the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization has classified as a pandemic. As of Tuesday, Ohio was one of six states to have postponed its elections. Maryland rescheduled most of its primary races to June 2, moving them from their original date of April 28, while maintaining the date of its special election for the U.S. House seat once held by Elijah Cummings, which will now be conducted solely via mail-in voting. Cummings passed away in October at the age of 68.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has urged states to avoid rescheduling elections and instead opt for mail-in voting. Support for this transition was echoed by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who, together with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, introduced legislation to mandate mail-in voting across all states as an emergency measure. Klobuchar had previously been a candidate in the 2020 presidential race before suspending her campaign."}

Since late December, the region has experienced numerous earthquakes registering above magnitude 4.5, including a significant 6.4 tremor on January 7 that resulted in an island-wide blackout.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) identified the epicenter of the quake as approximately eight kilometers (five miles) southwest of the town of Guenica. One resident remarked to Paul Rivera of WESH 2 news, \"We're used to it.\" In response to the unusual seismic activity over the past month, seismologists have installed sensors in the ground for further investigation.\n\nJohn Geiger of USGS explained to reporters last week, \"In recent weeks, we've recorded hundreds of small earthquakes in the same area [...] It all began on Dec. 28, with a 4.7-magnitude quake there. Since then, we have observed over 400 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater.\"\n\nAftershocks from last week's events hindered repair efforts, with roughly two-thirds of the island still lacking power two days after the January 7 quake. This quake led to the destruction of at least 300 homes, damaged roads, resulted in one fatality and eight injuries, and compromised the island's largest power plant. Puerto Rico's Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced subsequently declared a state of emergency.\n\nThis incident followed a 5.8 magnitude earthquake the day before, which caused the collapse of the iconic Punta Ventana rock formation.\n\nJosé Ortiz from the island's power authority noted that repairs on the damaged Costa Sur power plant in Guayanilla could take up to a year. The plant was situated near the epicenter of the January 7 quake and previously supplied power to about a quarter of Puerto Rico's homes and businesses. Without Costa Sur, other plants on the island would need to operate at near full capacity to meet residents' power demands.\n\nPuerto Rico was still working to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017, which inflicted an estimated $90 billion in property damage and resulted in approximately 3,000 fatalities.\n\nIn forecasts following the January 7 quake, the U.S. Geological Survey indicated that seismic activity may persist into early February."}

The research team posted their findings online prior to official publication.\n\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has led to many more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" the report states.\n\nChinese authorities have suggested that the virus may have jumped to humans from animals at a seafood market in Wuhan, where many of the infected individuals were found. However, the study does not rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission.\n\nIn response, Singapore and Hong Kong have stepped up screening for passengers arriving from Wuhan. As of Friday, U.S. authorities announced similar measures at major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York."}

Blagojevich was sentenced to fourteen years in prison and had served eight before being granted clemency. According to CNN, several officials, including Republican House members Darin LaHood and Mike Bost, urged Trump not to commute Blagojevich's sentence.\n\nJudith Negron was convicted of health care fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, and related offenses. She served eight years of a thirty-five year sentence before receiving clemency. \n\nCrystal Munoz was convicted of conspiracy to distribute over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in 2008 and sentenced to 188 months (15 years, 8 months) in prison.

{"title": "Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far", "content": "A study published last month in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics reported that astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and other institutions have discovered a black hole in the Telescopium constellation. This black hole is approximately 1,010 ± 195 light-years (310 ± 60 parsecs) away from the Solar System, making it the nearest known black hole to Earth. The previously closest known black hole, V616 Mon, was estimated to be over 3,000 light-years away.\n\nThe newly identified black hole is situated in the HR 6819 stellar system within the Telescopium constellation, marking it as the first system visible to the naked eye that contains a black hole. HR 6819 consists of two stars, both observable from the Southern Hemisphere. Astronomers began monitoring this system in 1999, initially assuming it was a simple binary system of two stars. However, further examination revealed the presence of a third, unseen object in the system. One of the stars in the HR 6819 system orbits the black hole every 40.333 ± 0.004 days.\n\nNotably, this recently discovered black hole lacks an accretion disk, which typically forms when a substantial amount of matter orbits the black hole, often emitting electromagnetic radiation. As there is no accretion disk in this case, researchers relied on the gravitational effects of the black hole on the nearby star for its discovery.\n\nUsing the binary mass function, researchers estimated the black hole's mass to be at least 4.2 solar masses (M☉; where 1 solar mass equals the mass of the Sun). The companion star, which orbits the black hole in about 40 days, is classified as a B3 III star, while the outer star is a Be star, known for spinning rapidly on its axis. This rapid rotation causes the outer star to take on an oblate shape, bulging at the equator and forming a gas disk.\n\nThe research indicated that the HR 6819 system bears similarities to another system, LB-1. It is estimated that HR 6819 is between 15 to 75 million years old. The mass of the inner star is estimated to be at least 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉, leading the researchers to conclude that the black hole has an estimated mass of 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉. According to Thomas Rivinius, a researcher and co-author of the study, the inner star and the black hole are situated closer to each other than the Sun is to Earth (1 astronomical unit; 150 million km; 93 million miles).\n\nThe researchers dedicated their paper to Stanislav Štefl, a fellow researcher who tragically passed away in a car accident in Santiago, Chile, in 2014. Wikinews spoke with Thomas Rivinius to discuss this significant discovery."}

{"title": "COVID-19 may spread like flu, say scientists", "content": "**Saturday, February 22, 2020**\n\nA report published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday revealed that researchers studying patients in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, found that the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, may spread similarly to influenza. Experts suggest that this could necessitate containment measures akin to those used for influenza, given that the outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019.\n\nThe study involved polyester swab samples collected from the noses and throats of eighteen infected individuals, including one without symptoms. The findings indicated that the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of influenza rather than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to the SARS virus than to typical influenza viruses.\n\nUnlike SARS, which primarily affects the lower respiratory tract and can lead to pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 can inhabit both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Researchers detected significant viral loads in samples from the noses and throats of volunteers. This, along with the presence of one asymptomatic individual and mild symptoms in others, raises concerns that, similar to the flu, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted from person to person by those unaware they are contagious.\n\nImmunologist Kristian Andersen from Scripps Research commented on the study, stating, \"This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we've ever seen. This is more akin to the spread of flu.\"\n\nContainment efforts during the 2003 SARS outbreak focused largely on preventing virus transmission within hospitals. If the recent findings hold true, scientists argue that a different approach may be necessary to manage COVID-19.\n\nThe basic reproduction number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2—representing the average number of individuals each infected person transmits the virus to—has not yet been estimated. R0 values can fluctuate over time due to increased immunity, vaccination, or heightened caution among populations. For perspective, the R0 value for SARS-CoV is estimated to range between 2 and 4, while influenza's R0 is between 2 and 3. Measles has an R0 of approximately 12 to 18, whereas Ebola and HIV both have R0 values around 2. Generally, outbreaks with R0 values below 1 tend to cease on their own, while those above 1 are likely to continue spreading."}
{"title": "Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists", "content": "**Thursday, March 26, 2020**\n\nA recent study from the Florida Museum of Natural History reveals that spiky skulls in frogs have evolved independently at least 25 times across various species. The findings were announced on Monday and are set to be published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.\n\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida, noted, \"Superficially, frogs may appear similar, but their skulls reveal significant differences [...] Some of the most unusual skulls belong to frogs that consume birds and mammals, use their heads for defense, or, in rare instances, possess venom.\" He emphasized the extraordinary diversity among frogs as illustrated by their skull structures.\n\nContrary to earlier hypotheses suggesting that smaller frogs were more likely to develop spiky skulls, this study found otherwise. The researchers conducted CT scans on 158 different frog species and discovered that those occupying similar ecological niches—either through their methods of obtaining food or defending against predators—tend to exhibit similar skull features such as grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints, regardless of their evolutionary relationships.\n\nThe study notes that skull features like spikes, grooves, or ridges—collectively termed hyperossification—are often linked to frogs that prey on unusually large animals relative to their size. These robust skulls facilitate the capture of prey such as birds, rodents, reptiles, and other frogs. Additionally, spikes may be associated with venomous species, hypothesizing that they deter predators by potentially breaking venom sacs located beneath the frog's skin when struck.\n\nOther notable bone formations include fang-like projections and lower teeth, which some frog species utilize for hunting and combat, even though few frogs possess true lower teeth.\n\nHerpetologist David Blackburn, one of the study’s authors, explained to *Discover Magazine* that the recurrent evolution of spiky skulls in genetically unrelated frogs suggests an underlying evolutionary pattern: \"Somehow, these frogs are activating ancient developmental mechanisms encoded in their DNA.\"\n\nSince a comprehensive survey of frog skulls in 1973, the number of documented frog species has doubled due to the discovery of numerous new species. Modern imaging techniques, particularly CT scans, played a critical role in this research. This study was part of the oVert project, funded by the National Science Foundation, which aims to perform extensive CT scans of over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from museums across the United States."}

The study identified a specific region of the brain that plays a crucial role in this behavior. Wikinews interviewed Dr. Christian Keysers and Dr. Valeria Gazzola, two of the study's authors.\n\nIn their experiment, the rats were placed in a container equipped with two levers. The rats were trained to prefer one lever, with both levers delivering one sucrose pellet, although one lever was more difficult to press. Once a preference was established, pressing the preferred lever resulted in a shock to a rat in a neighboring compartment, alongside delivering a single pellet of sucrose. Results indicated that the \"actor\" rats tended to switch levers to avoid shocking the \"victim\" rats.\n\nThe study found that the aversion to harming fellow rats was consistent across both male and female subjects. Additionally, rats that had previously experienced shocks themselves showed an increased sense of harm aversion toward other rats.\n\nInterestingly, the rats demonstrated a preference for the no-harm lever even when the preferred lever could deliver two sucrose pellets instead of one. However, this aversion did not apply when the shock lever delivered three pellets; most actor rats continued to press the shock lever despite inflicting harm. Dr. Gazzola referred to this phenomenon as a \"tipping point,\" highlighting a \"cost-benefit\" analysis in their decision-making.\n\nThe study further underscored the significance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in harm aversion. The researchers conducted tests by deactivating the ACC with muscimol injections in the experimental group, while the control group received saline. Observations revealed that the rats in the test group, lacking an active ACC due to muscimol, no longer exhibited aversion to harming victim rats, while the control group maintained their harm aversion."}

This marked the first launch of a crewed spacecraft from the United States since NASA's final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011, which Hurley also piloted.\n\nBacked by entrepreneur Elon Musk, SpaceX has become the first private company to send astronauts into space. The company’s development of reusable rockets aims to significantly lower the costs of future space missions. Shortly after liftoff, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage successfully disengaged and returned to an autonomous spaceport drone ship off the coast, where it will be refurbished for future missions. Behnken and Hurley are set to rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) for a stay of one to four months, with docking scheduled for today at 1429 UTC.\n\nThe launch was initially planned for Wednesday afternoon but was postponed less than 20 minutes before the scheduled time due to inclement weather. In contrast, yesterday's launch proceeded smoothly. Following their ascent into low Earth orbit, Hurley remarked over the radio, \"It was incredible.\"\n\nThis launch represents a key milestone in a program that began in earnest when NASA selected SpaceX, along with Boeing, as a commercial contractor in 2014 to transport astronauts to the ISS. Boeing is expected to conduct its first crewed mission next year. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttles in 2011, NASA has been reliant on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the orbiting space station.\n\nHurley, along with his fellow crew members from the last Shuttle mission, left a small U.S. flag aboard the ISS, intended for retrieval once the U.S. was able to resume crewed spaceflight. When they return to Earth, Hurley and Behnken plan to bring back this flag after nearly nine years, marking a significant milestone. However, the exact timing of their return is uncertain and will depend on the performance of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, as well as when the next Crew Dragon mission is scheduled. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has indicated that this next launch may occur by late August.\n\nBridenstine expressed cautious optimism regarding the ongoing test flight, stating, \"I'm breathing a sigh of relief, but I will also tell you I'm not gonna celebrate until Bob and Doug are home safely.\" Hurley echoed the sentiments of Alan Shepard, the first U.S. citizen in space, remarking before the launch to commemorate America's return to human spaceflight: \"SpaceX, we're go for launch.

Boccaletti noted that the irregularities observed in the protoplanetary disk of gas and dust could indicate the formation of a massive planet, potentially larger than Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, or—though less likely—a star or brown dwarf. This disturbance is situated around 30 astronomical units from the host star—equivalent to the distance from the Sun to Neptune. However, AB Aurigae is more massive than the Sun, possessing about 2.4 times its mass. It is classified as a Herbig Ae star, known for their notable brightness.\n\nBoccaletti and his team began their observations of the AB Aurigae system in 2019. He expressed a desire for further studies to confirm whether the observed irregularities signify the birth of an exoplanet, stating, \"If we confirm that it's a planet in formation, then it becomes very important to follow up.\"\n\nWhile there are various theories regarding exoplanet formation, direct observation of an exoplanet forming has not yet occurred. K2-33b, discovered in 2016, is one of the youngest known exoplanets, estimated to be about 9.3 million years old.\n\nBoccaletti, affiliated with the Observatoire de Paris, shared insights about his findings with Wikinews last month."}

His death was confirmed by his son, Wolfgang Van Halen.\n\nOriginally from the Netherlands, Van Halen later moved to Pasadena, California. Following the announcement of his passing, numerous renowned rock musicians, including Billy Idol and Yusuf/Cat Stevens, paid tribute to the legendary guitarist.\n\nEddie Van Halen was celebrated for his innovative use of two-handed tapping and intricate harmonics in his guitar playing, earning him recognition as one of the most influential electric guitarists in music history. He co-founded Van Halen with his brother Alex in 1972, and the band's 1978 self-titled debut album soared to #19 on the Billboard charts, eventually earning a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding 10 million copies. Van Halen went on to become one of the best-selling musical acts of all time and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nAmong his most famous works is the guitar solo \"Eruption,\" featured as the second track on the debut album. Mike McCready of Pearl Jam remarked that hearing the solo for the first time was akin to discovering the compositions of classical composer Mozart. In a Rolling Stone interview, McCready noted, \"He gets sounds that aren't necessarily guitar sounds — a lot of harmonics, textures that happen just because of how he picks.\"\n\nVan Halen had previously been diagnosed with tongue cancer as early as 2000 and was known for his reclusive persona."}

According to the Kamloops Police, the incident occurred at the McDonald Park playground. The mother quickly secured the small bag, ensuring her child's safety.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) confirmed the seizure of the substance, noting, \"In B.C., this has been considered a public health emergency since April 2016. Unfortunately, this means that issues such as found needles and drugs are realities that all parents must be aware of in public spaces.\"\n\nKamloops RCMP Constable Gary Gray highlighted that fentanyl has become prevalent in Kamloops due to its potency, with traffickers using colors like purple as identifiers.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis had claimed 15,393 lives in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to statistics from the Canadian Public Health Infobase. \n\nIn Ontario, provincial police Detective Constable Daniel Dubé mentioned to CBC in late June that the border closure with New York State had led to increased prices for illicit drugs, prompting traffickers to dilute their products. He noted that heroin, previously mixed with fentanyl, is now being mixed with the sedative etizolam, or benzodiazepines, which are also classified as nervous system depressants.\n\nBob Hughes, executive director of the Ask Wellness Society, remarked to Kamloops This Week that Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) payments related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to a surge in overdose deaths this year. The B.C. Coroners Service reported 170 suspected drug-related deaths in May alone, shortly after CERB payments commenced, marking a 93% increase from 88 deaths in May 2019.

His tenure was marked by the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, which tragically resulted in the deaths of 29 miners. In 2016, a jury convicted Blankenship of misdemeanor conspiracy for willfully violating safety standards, leading to a one-year prison sentence. He has consistently maintained his innocence, attributing the disaster to federal regulators. Following his release, Blankenship unsuccessfully sought the Republican Party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in West Virginia before turning his attention to the Constitution Party. \n\nAt the virtual 2020 Constitution Party National Convention in May, Blankenship secured the party's nomination on the second ballot. He chose William Mohr, chairman of the Michigan Taxpayers Party, as his running mate. Mohr characterized Blankenship in a June Wikinews interview as \"a good man with vast knowledge in the political field [who] stands firm on his positions, aligns well with the party platform, and possesses exceptional leadership qualities.\" He praised Blankenship’s \"ability to influence leaders\" and asserted that he has \"a backbone superior to most men\" and will be the strongest president in decades.\n\nFounded in 1991 as the U.S. Taxpayers Party and rebranded in 1999, the Constitution Party promotes states' rights, gun rights, limited government, protectionism, and non-interventionism.

Tesco intends to exit the Polish market entirely, while Salling aims to strengthen its Netto chain in Poland.\n\nThe deal includes 301 stores, two distribution centers, and the head office. With this acquisition, Salling plans to enhance its coverage in Southern Poland and intends to integrate these stores into its existing Netto chain, which currently comprises 386 locations, over an 18-month period at a cost of one billion złotys. Additionally, Salling will take on approximately 7,000 employees from Tesco, as Netto Poland currently employs about 5,000 people. Tesco will continue to operate 19 stores that are not included in this transaction.\n\nThe sale price, to be paid in cash, amounts to 900 million złotys (approximately £181 million). In the 2019/20 fiscal year, Tesco reported a £24 million operating loss for its Polish branch, which had a turnover of £1.368 billion, with the sold units contributing £947 million in turnover and incurring a £107 million loss. At the end of the fiscal year, the sold units were valued at £681 million on the books.\n\nThe deal requires approval from UOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly agency. The parties expect a decision later this year.\n\nTesco has experienced losses from its Polish operations for several years, largely due to customer preferences shifting away from hypermarkets—Tesco's preferred store format—to smaller discount stores like Biedronka and LIDL. The Sunday trade ban, introduced in 2018, further impacted sales. According to Notes from Poland (NFP), some discount stores have begun offering postal services to exploit a loophole that allows Sunday openings.\n\nIn 2015, Tesco centralized its management for the Central European region, which includes Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, but later reversed this decision. At that time, the company invested in e-commerce and initiated home deliveries; however, Gazeta Prawna reports that only 0.5% of Polish grocery turnover derives from this segment, compared to 7% in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the past few years, Tesco Polska has reduced expenditures by streamlining its product range, cutting its workforce in half, shutting down home deliveries in certain areas, and closing stores, including the Poznan distribution center last year. In mid-2019, Deutsche Welle (DW) reported that 62 Tesco outlets had closed within a year. Staff layoffs have led to departments for meat, fish, and delicatessen lacking dedicated shop assistants, resulting in the closure of staff canteens and simplifying administration.\n\nEarlier this year, Tesco sold its approximately 2,000 stores in Thailand and 74 in Malaysia to Charoen Pokphand, announced the termination of its joint venture with China Resources Holdings in February, and sold its South Korean chain HomePlus in 2015. In an interview with Portfolio.hu, Matt Simister, Tesco’s CEO for Central Europe, noted that the company holds a 4% share of the Polish retail market, compared to 16% in Hungary, where they plan to maintain their presence. In a DW report from last March, then-CEO Dave Lewis stated that Tesco had no plans to exit Thailand or Poland.\n\nAccording to Gazeta Wyborcza, the scale of Tesco's Polish operation makes it unsuitable for a single monolithic sale. Tesco's press release indicated that 22 units were sold in the past year and a half, totaling around £200 million. NFP mentioned the Kaufland chain and property developer Echo Investment as potential buyers.\n\nBoth Tesco and Salling entered the Polish market in 1995."}

Saturn about his 2020 campaign.\n\nCollins currently serves as the chairman of the Prohibition Party. He previously held the position of trustee for Libertyville Township in Illinois and led the Prohibition Party of Illinois. After relocating to Nevada, he ran for Mayor of Las Vegas in 2019, finishing second overall. Collins was not the party's initial choice for the 2020 presidential nomination; in November 2018, the party selected Bill Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. After Bayes's withdrawal in March 2019, Gammon assumed the presidential nomination, with Collins nominated as Vice President the following month. Gammon later withdrew due to health issues around August 2019, leading to Collins becoming the presidential nominee, with anti-alcohol activist Billy Joe Parker as his running mate. Parker engaged with Wikinews in July.\n\nUpon securing the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination, Collins pursued nominations from the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party to gain ballot access in California and Florida, respectively. Although he won the AIP California Presidential Primary in March, he lost the nomination to businessman Rocky De La Fuente in August. He also narrowly missed the Reform Party presidential nomination to De La Fuente in June. Nonetheless, the Prohibition Party has achieved ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont. The last presidential election where the party appeared on at least four state ballots was in 1984 with nominee Earl Dodge.\n\nFounded in 1869, the Prohibition Party is the third oldest political party in the United States. It peaked in popularity during the late nineteenth century, advocating for the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited alcohol sales and marked the Prohibition era (1919–1933). Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the party has experienced a decline but remains operational, partly due to the George L. Pennock Trust established in 1939, which covers its expenses. The party continues to nominate presidential candidates, and Collins is the latest in this line, following previous nominees like Gene Amondson in 2004 and 2008, and James (Jim) Hedges in 2016.\n\nIn his conversation with Wikinews, Collins covered topics such as his background, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on his campaign, presidential nominations, political gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations."}
{"title": "Neanderthals 'knew what they were doing': Archæologist Dr Naomi Martisius discusses her findings about Neanderthals' behaviour with Wikinews", "content": "**Sunday, June 28, 2020**\n\nA study published on May 8 in Nature's Scientific Reports has revealed that Neanderthals in Europe tens of thousands of years ago exhibited a level of sophistication that surpasses previous beliefs. Conducted by archaeologist Dr. Naomi Martisius and her research team, the study highlights that Neanderthals meticulously selected bones from specific animal species to create their bone tools.\n\nThe researchers examined five bone tools found at Neanderthal sites in southwest France. Four of these tools were discovered at a site known as Abri Peyrony, while the fifth was sourced from Pech-de-l’Azé I. These small tools, approximately 50,000 years old, were analyzed using microscopy techniques. Dr. Martisius explained to Wikinews that these tools, termed lissoirs (smoothers), were likely used by Neanderthals for processing animal skins into leather.\n\nThe study found that the fauna at the excavation sites primarily consisted of medium-sized ungulates, such as reindeer, which made up nearly 90% of one layer. However, the Neanderthals opted to use the ribs of large bovids for crafting lissoirs. Dr. Martisius suggested this preference was due to the physical attributes of bovid ribs, which are \"thicker\" and \"stronger\" compared to the \"thin and flimsy ribs\" of reindeer. To trace the origins of the bone tools, the researchers employed a non-destructive technique known as Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).\n\nInstead of damaging the bone artifacts, the team extracted collagen from the plastic containers that housed these tools. Over time, collagen, a type of protein, had adhered to the container walls. By utilizing a chemical enzyme called trypsin, the collagen samples collected were broken down into smaller molecules called peptides.\n\nThese peptides were then analyzed using Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (ToF MS). This process involved combining the peptides with a colored matrix compound, vaporizing the mixture, and allowing peptides to be released. Positively charged particles traveled through a vacuum tube in an electric field, reaching the end at different times based on their weight, thus forming a unique spectral fingerprint for each species. By comparing these spectra to an existing database, the researchers could identify the taxonomic origins of the collagen proteins.\n\nThe analysis confirmed that all four bone tools from Abri Peyrony originated from large bovids, despite the higher prevalence of reindeer at the time. Dr. Martisius noted that using bovid ribs was beneficial because they were less prone to breakage during flexion compared to reindeer ribs. She added that while non-destructive ZooMS analyses have been performed on more recent tools, this study represents the first application of the technique on such ancient artifacts.\n\nWikinews engaged Dr. Martisius in an in-depth discussion about her groundbreaking research."}

{"title": "GitHub blocks public access to youtube-dl after RIAA issues DMCA notice", "content": "**Monday, October 26, 2020**\n\nOn Friday, GitHub, the code hosting and sharing platform, restricted public access to youtube-dl, a command-line tool that allows users to download videos from various websites, including YouTube. This action followed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice issued by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After redacting the notice's metadata, GitHub made the takedown notice available on its platform.\n\nFounded in July 2008 by Ricardo Garcia, youtube-dl is a Python script that supports video downloads from multiple platforms such as YouTube, LiveLeak, and Vimeo. The software is licensed as Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and is in the public domain. Currently, the GitHub repository is accessible only to the project maintainers.\n\nThe RIAA's DMCA notice claimed that youtube-dl is designed to \"circumvent the technological protection measures\" employed by authorized streaming services like YouTube and to \"reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization.\" The script includes various unit tests to check its functionality under different scenarios, such as downloading Creative Commons-licensed videos and those that may be flagged as \"offensive\" or age-restricted. Among the tests referenced in the takedown notice were URLs of copyrighted songs, leading the RIAA to assert that the code's comments indicated an intent to bypass YouTube's measures.\n\nThe RIAA's notice contended that the repository violated 17 U.S. Code § 1201, which prohibits circumventing technological measures that protect copyrighted works. The RIAA requested that all known forks of youtube-dl be made inaccessible on GitHub.\n\nNotably, the notice did not provide any evidence of actual misuse of youtube-dl for downloading or sharing copyrighted material, nor did it mention any tangible damages. Furthermore, YouTube permits users to license videos under a Creative Commons Attribution license, which allows others to share or modify the work as long as proper attribution is given. YouTube also hosts many works in the public domain that can be freely used.\n\nyoutube-dl has a significant user base, including individuals who utilize it to download Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos from Wikimedia Commons through a tool called video2commons. It is also employed for downloading citizen journalism footage from LiveLeak. Users may rely on youtube-dl for fair use purposes or as evidence in various contexts.\n\nThe program functions with a small JavaScript interpreter, mimicking a web browser as it retrieves video data from servers. It contains \"extractors\" for handling video from various websites. While web browsers download data temporarily, they do not retain most of it on the device. However, it is technically possible to download copyrighted materials using a web browser. The internet inherently lacks prevention measures that the RIAA describes, allowing for screenshots or screen recordings to capture content.\n\nIn response to GitHub's decision, many users expressed their frustration on platforms like Twitter and Internet Relay Chat. One user remarked, \"This is yet another example of why we should use git as it was intended, as a distributed network rather than relying on a single proprietary server.\" Git is a decentralized version-control system that does not necessitate a GitHub account for software development.\n\nFollowing the access blockage, numerous users began sharing the source code through self-hosted servers, Tor sites, and Torrent protocol, highlighting a phenomenon known as the Streisand effect, wherein attempts to censor information only increase its dissemination. The binary files of the software remain available on its official website, and some users creatively shared the code by converting it into images and providing shell commands for extraction.\n\nMeanwhile, GitHub's DMCA repository experienced significant vandalism from various users. One individual submitted a pull request that merged the youtube-dl source code with the DMCA repository, allowing users to access the code through the DMCA repository if they knew the commit ID.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation tweeted, \"Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of lawful uses. Demanding its removal from Github is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.\" Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, has long criticized DRM (Digital Rights Management), the central issue addressed by the DMCA.\n\nWikinews reached out to Sergey M., one of the maintainers of youtube-dl, but he declined to comment at that time. He later provided an update on IRC, stating, \"They require the complete removal of what they call YouTube's rolling cipher implementation [...] GitHub requires this for the repo's reinstatement [...] I could reinstate it by Saturday or Sunday under this condition, but it's an unsatisfactory outcome.\" He added, \"I can't guarantee whether we will comply given the situation with @phihag [Philipp Hagemeister], but we'll determine how to protect what we have while mitigating potential legal issues.\"\n\nThe EFF has not yet responded to Wikinews' inquiries. Additionally, Wikinews contacted Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer and contributor to the youtube-dl project, for his insights on the situation.\n\n**Wikinews (WN):** When did you learn about the takedown notice, and what were your initial thoughts?  \n**Philipp Hagemeister (PH):** I saw the takedown notice alongside everyone else on Reddit. Since I'm no longer involved with the youtube-dl project (aside from occasional contributions; my maintainership ended in 2016), I don't have any details.\n\n**WN:** Does YouTube implement DRM for videos not under a Creative Commons license, and how does youtube-dl bypass it? Can you explain the process?  \n**PH:** YouTube applies DRM to YouTube Movies, which youtube-dl does not support. YouTube employs multiple non-DRM delivery protocols. I'm not up to date on specifics; my last involvement was back in 2015. One of these protocols entails using JavaScript to compute parts of the URLs, which youtube-dl executes, similar to a web browser.\n\n**WN:** Can you briefly explain how youtube-dl works and the intended use cases?  \n**PH:** youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, much like any other web browser, from over 1,000 different services. Its applications are varied: it enables playback on devices (like Raspberry Pi) where video services may not function correctly, facilitates high-quality video access for users with limited internet connectivity, assists disabled individuals in accessing video content, and serves archival and research purposes.\n\n**WN:** What are your thoughts on the DMCA notice?  \n**PH:** I believe it is unwarranted, as youtube-dl operates within legal boundaries. The DMCA notice does not affect me personally, so I may not be the best person to address it.\n\n**WN:** Why were the copyrighted tests included in the source code? Could they be removed?  \n**PH:** I’m uncertain about the rationale, but my guess is that users requested support for those videos, prompting their addition as test cases. They can be easily removed without affecting youtube-dl’s functionality.\n\n**WN:** Are you aware that the Electronic Frontier Foundation referred to the situation as a \"disappointing and counterproductive move\"? What do you believe should be the next steps?  \n**PH:** Yes, and I agree. Since I’m no longer involved in the project, I would likely just remove the test cases, block the pertinent music videos (as the RIAA isn't worth the trouble, especially given the availability of alternatives), and restore the project online. I understand that others may hold differing opinions."}

Saturn. \n\nJorgensen is a psychology professor at Clemson University. Her political career began in 1992 when she ran for South Carolina's 4th congressional seat with the support of the Libertarian Party, finishing third with nearly 2.16 percent of the vote. In 1996, she was selected as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee, running alongside the late Harry Browne. The Browne-Jorgensen ticket appeared on ballots in all 50 states, garnering a total of 485,798 votes, or approximately 0.5 percent—the party's best performance since 1980. This record was surpassed in 2012 by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, who achieved 0.99 percent of the vote, and further improved by Johnson in 2016, who secured 3.27 percent as the party's nominee, the highest since the party's formation in 1971.\n\nIn seeking the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen faced a competitive primary that included the brief campaigns of former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, the first sitting Congressman to join the Libertarian Party. At the virtual 2020 Libertarian National Convention, Jorgensen won the nomination on the fourth ballot, narrowly defeating candidates such as attorney Jacob Hornberger, performance artist Vermin Supreme, and activist Adam Kokesh. Podcaster Spike Cohen, who was originally the running mate of Supreme, was chosen as the party's vice presidential nominee. The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket has since secured ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nAs a libertarian, Jorgensen advocates for reduced government intervention in both social and economic spheres. Her positions blend traditionally liberal and conservative views, supporting LGBTQ+ rights and gun rights while opposing both a police state and heavy taxation. She also promotes an open immigration policy while rejecting the welfare state.\n\nIn her conversation with Wikinews, Jorgensen addresses her background, the impact of COVID-19, her potential cabinet, political gridlock, and a wide range of issues including climate change, foreign affairs, free speech, and race relations."}

CentOS was officially merged into Red Hat in 2014, granting Red Hat the trademark rights for \"CentOS.\"\n\nRed Hat also sponsors the Fedora operating system, providing Fedora laptops to its software engineering interns. Historically, software development has occurred on Fedora before being adopted in RHEL, which Red Hat maintains and supports for RHEL subscription customers. CentOS followed RHEL's lead, offering similar features at no cost but without support.\n\nCentOS Stream was launched in September 2019, shortly after Red Hat's acquisition by IBM. Unlike CentOS, which followed RHEL's release cycle, CentOS Stream introduces new features before they are integrated into RHEL, resulting in more frequent updates but no guarantees of stability.\n\nWith CentOS Stream, community-led developments and Red Hat employees will contribute to both Fedora and Stream as rolling releases before the features are incorporated into RHEL. While CentOS's stable distribution benefited from extensive testing in Fedora and RHEL, Stream will have features that are still under development and may not maintain binary compatibility with RHEL.\n\nWright emphasized in the announcement, \"The future of CentOS Linux is CentOS Stream.\" He described it as a platform for rapid innovation within the community that maintains a stable foundation for understanding production dynamics. He added, \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\"\n\nThe announcement provoked significant backlash online, with users voicing their frustrations on platforms such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Reddit, and the CentOS project's mailing list. Furthermore, the End of Life (EOL) for CentOS 8 has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is set to receive maintenance updates until June 2024, thereby outlasting CentOS 8.\n\nIn response to the changes, Gregory Kurtzer, who founded the CentOS project, announced the launch of a new operating system called Rocky Linux. Describing itself as \"a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux,\" the project aims to emulate CentOS's downstream build model, releasing updates after the upstream vendor.\n\nKurtzer explained the inspiration behind the name Rocky Linux: \"Thinking back to early CentOS days...

Former Trump adviser and retired General Michael Flynn spoke at the rally, making his first public appearance since being pardoned by Trump. He remarked, \"That's pretty cool. Imagine just being able to jump in a helicopter and just go for a joy ride around Washington.\" Another former adviser, Sebastian Gorka, also addressed the crowd, urging supporters to remain hopeful following the recent court decision.\n\nThe rally occurred just two days before the formal Electoral College vote to choose the president-elect. Trump and his supporters have claimed that Joe Biden's victory resulted from voter fraud and sought to overturn the election results. Rally organizers stated their mission was to combat corruption and dishonesty. Flynn voiced concerns about a lack of transparency in the electoral process, urging the crowd to consider what election counters might be hiding and why they weren't allowed to inspect signatures and voting machines.\n\nAmong the attendees were Richard and Lisa Parry, who drove 14 hours from Florida to be part of the event.

Notably, the end-of-life (EOL) for CentOS 8 has been accelerated from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates until June 2024.\n\nIn response to Red Hat's decision, Kurtzer announced his plans to develop Rocky Linux to serve the role formerly filled by CentOS. Rocky Linux is named after Kurtzer's late co-founder, Rocky McGaugh, and Kurtzer expressed, \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [hat tip] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you... Rocky Linux.\" \n\nWhile a specific release date for Rocky Linux has not been established, Kurtzer stated they aim to launch the CentOS replacement before the end of life for CentOS 8. Furthermore, Rocky Linux will be compatible with both x86-64 and ARM-based processors, allowing CentOS users to transition to Rocky Linux by executing a single command.\n\nEmphasizing that Rocky Linux is driven by community needs, Kurtzer affirmed, \"I take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control,\" including decisions made by his own company. Reflecting on the community support for Rocky Linux, Kurtzer remarked, \"I have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.\""}

The demonstrations began peacefully but escalated into clashes with counter-protesters by the evening.\n\nVideos showed members of both factions pushing, punching, and throwing objects, with reports indicating the use of fireworks and flashbangs. \n\nIn response to the unrest, the mayor's office reported that twenty people were arrested and two police officers sustained injuries. President Trump criticized D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Twitter, claiming she was \"not doing her job.\" He has frequently blamed Democratic leadership for violence and unrest in various U.S. cities throughout 2020.\n\nAs of now, President Trump has not conceded the election and continues to assert baseless claims of widespread voter fraud involving mail-in ballots while pursuing multiple legal challenges. However, state and federal election officials have confirmed that there is no evidence to support these allegations."}

This news comes just a week after Matovič attended a summit with French President Emmanuel Macron, who later tested positive for the virus, prompting widespread contact tracing across Europe and voluntary self-isolation for multiple leaders.\n\nAmong those self-isolating due to the incident are the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal, as well as European Council chief Charles Michel. Matovič's government office reported that the 47-year-old Prime Minister has canceled all upcoming events, although no symptoms were mentioned. Additionally, government ministers who attended an official meeting with him two days prior have also announced their self-quarantine.\n\nDuring that meeting, a partial lockdown was agreed upon in response to rising infection rates in the nation of 5.5 million people. Barend Leyts, a spokesperson for the Council, stated that safety protocols were implemented and confirmed that only Macron and Matovič are known to have tested positive after inquiries by Brussels-based media network EURACTIV.\n\nIn a separate issue, Prime Minister Matovič expressed his frustration after Deputy Prime Minister for Finance and Minister of Economy Richard Sulík was unable to obtain enough rapid testing kits, apologizing to the citizens of Slovakia for \"having an idiot as economy minister.\""}
{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "**Friday, December 25, 2020**\n\nIn May, a study published in *Nature Astronomy*, conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Dr. Sara Seager and her team, revealed that single-celled organisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast can thrive in 100% hydrogen and helium atmospheres. Wikinews spoke with Dr. Seager to gain deeper insights into her research.\n\nLife has only been observed on Earth, which has an oxygen-rich environment. Although Earth's atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen, oxygen is vital for more complex organisms. However, certain microorganisms, known as anaerobic organisms—including methanogens—can survive without oxygen by utilizing carbon dioxide while producing methane.\n\nFor their experiment, researchers used the E. coli strain K-12 and the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C, placing them in four different environments: one with 100% air and three anaerobic conditions consisting of 100% H2, 100% He, and an 80%-20% N2-CO2 mix. All environments were maintained at 28° Celsius, with oxygen sensors installed to ensure they remained anoxic. The growth of E. coli was monitored using optical density measurements, while a hemocytometer was used for yeast.\n\nThe study found that both organisms reproduced normally in 100% H2 and 100% He environments, although their growth curves did not match those observed in the 100% air condition. They switched from aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen, to anaerobic respiration and fermentation—both of which are less efficient and yield less energy than aerobic processes.\n\nE. coli exhibited a slower growth rate in the 80%-20% N2-CO2 environment, as the dissolving CO2 made the liquid medium acidic. Conversely, yeast cultures showed no reduction in growth rate under the same conditions, thriving in acidic environments. However, the growth rate of yeast in 100% air was significantly higher than in the other three conditions, likely due to a lack of oxygen necessary for synthesizing essential biochemicals like heme and sterols, which are crucial for yeast development. In oxygen-deprived atmospheres, the growth of yeast fungi was stunted.\n\nDr. Seager emphasized that these findings could prompt scientists to explore more planets for potential habitability. \"There's a diversity of habitable worlds out there, and we have confirmed that Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. We should definitely consider these types of planets when searching for life beyond Earth,\" she stated.\n\nShe pointed out that rocky planets with expansive hydrogen-rich atmospheres should be easier to detect using emerging technologies, as hydrogen and helium gases have low density. “It’s hard to wrap your head around, but that light gas just makes the atmosphere more expansive [...] And for telescopes, the larger the atmosphere is compared to the backdrop of a planet's star, the easier it is to detect,” Dr. Seager explained.\n\nThe research paper indicated that rocky planets with a radius less than 1.7 times that of Earth (approximately 6,360 km) can maintain a hydrogen-rich atmosphere if water interacts with iron. Moreover, it noted that E. coli releases several gases in hydrogen-based atmospheres, including ammonia, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, carbonyl sulfide, carbonyl disulfide, and nitrous oxide. These gases could serve as biosignatures, aiding astronomers in the search for life on exoplanets.\n\nWith this confirmation that life can exist in oxygen-deficient atmospheres, Seager remarked, \"Astronomers should keep an open mind about which planets are worth exploring for life.\"\n\nAs NASA's James Webb Telescope is set for deployment next year, the paper suggests that researchers might be able to investigate smaller exoplanets orbiting red-dwarf stars."}

Murphy, the administrator of the United States General Services Administration, sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden and his team, granting them access to post-election resources for the presidential transition process following the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election held on November 3. Multiple national news outlets have projected that former Vice President Joe Biden won against incumbent President Donald Trump.\n\nMurphy asserted that her decision was made independently and without any influence from the White House, stating she was \"never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official.\" However, she mentioned that she and her family had received violent threats due to her role in facilitating the transition process.\n\nPresident Trump, who appointed Murphy in 2017, responded to her letter on Twitter, calling for the initiation of the presidential transition process \"in the best interests of the country.\" This marks a significant shift in tone from his previous stance, where he claimed victory despite key swing states certifying results in favor of Biden.\n\nWhile the president’s statement did not include a concession or acknowledgment of defeat, he pledged to continue \"the good fight\" through court challenges to the election results in contested states. So far, Trump's allegations of widespread voter fraud have not gained traction in the courts; just two days before Michigan’s final certification, a federal judge dismissed a Trump lawsuit attempting to halt Pennsylvania's certification process.\n\nTrump and his legal team have faced criticism from both sides of the political aisle regarding their fraud claims. Biden and other Democrats warned that the delayed transition could pose a national security risk by withholding critical resources from the incoming administration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested that Trump's recent tweets might be as close as the public will get to an official concession from the president.\n\nSeveral Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump, urging him to proceed with the transition. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie described the Trump legal team's actions as a \"national embarrassment.\" Businessman and Trump ally Stephen Schwarzman also encouraged the president to accept the election outcome and \"move on.\" Additionally, over 100 Republican national security experts signed an open letter urging party officials to encourage Trump to concede.\n\nTraditionally, the General Services Administration acts once national media outlets have declared the presidential race for a candidate. Joe Biden is projected to win the Electoral College and has also won the popular vote by over six million votes. He was declared the winner on November 7 and is scheduled to be sworn into office on January 20."}

Shortly after Rittenhouse's release, one of his lawyers shared a photo on Twitter featuring Rittenhouse and actor Ricky Schroder, both smiling together.\n\nRittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois, faces accusations of crossing state lines to shoot and kill two individuals during protests against the shooting of Jacob Blake. One other person sustained injuries in the incident. His charges include intentional homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm, and if convicted, he could face a life sentence.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Rittenhouse was not legally old enough to own or possess a firearm in Illinois. He claimed he obtained the weapon through an older friend who purchased it on his behalf with stimulus money he received during the COVID-19 lockdown. Additionally, a suspect in Wisconsin has been charged with allegedly supplying the firearm to Rittenhouse.\n\nRittenhouse surrendered to authorities the day after the shooting, and his lawyers assert that he acted in self-defense. Court Commissioner Loren Keating deemed Rittenhouse a flight risk before setting the $2 million bond.\n\nIn comments to The Washington Post, Rittenhouse stated that he would have died that night if he had not been armed.
