Called \"Don’t Say Gay\" by its opponents, the law forbade schools from teaching kindergarten to third grade students about gender identity and sexuality.\nFlorida created the special district in 1967, effectively giving control of local services, such as sewage, zoning, and fire prevention, to the Walt Disney Company.\nDisney World has the most employees of any central Florida entity, with 75,000 workers. The Themed Entertainment Association stated 36.2 million people visited it in 2021.\nAccording to the BBC, DeSantis is likely to seek the US presidency in the 2024 election."}
{"title": "European Commission, five EU members agree to permit members to ban domestic sale of some Ukrainian agricultural products", "content": "Thursday, May 4, 2023 \n\nOn Friday, the European Commission (EC) reached a deal with European Union (EU) member states Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia on imports of wheat, maize, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds from Ukraine.\nThe agreement provided for 100 million euros to compensate farmers and allowed the five nations to prevent the Ukrainian products from entering their domestic markets. The five, in turn, agreed to allow free transit of the goods through their countries. Additionally, the EU extended June's one-year removal of duties on Ukrainian products for another year on Friday, pending approval by the European Parliament and members.\nValdis Dombrovskis, the bloc's top trade official, announced the deal: \"I'm glad to announce that we have reached a political agreement concerning Ukrainian agrifood imports in the EU. We've agreed with the five neighboring EU member states and Ukraine on how we'll tackle the situation.\"\nEC President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal \"preserves both Ukraine's exports capacity so it continues feeding the world, and our farmers' livelihoods.\"\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: \"We have just now finalized agreements with the European Union regarding the ban on the import of these agricultural products, which above all led to destabilization in the Polish market.\"\nCheaper products caused an excess of supply in these countries' domestic markets after the EU lifted those tariffs amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stating it would enable the products to reach their target markets in the Middle East and Africa while Black Sea ports remained contested.\nLogistical costs hindered re-exports of Ukrainian goods, driving down local prices and prompting farmer protests. On April 4, the EC adopted an \"emergency support measure\" providing over 56 million euros to Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria to help farmers but acknowledged this only partially covered losses.\n\nThis did not assuage the farmers, and Poland announced a ban on imports from Ukraine on April 15, followed by Hungary the same day, then Slovakia on April 17 and Bulgaria on April 19, with an exception for products en route to other nations through Bulgaria. Romania did not enact restrictions, but appealed to the EU for \"preventative measures\" on products from Ukraine.\n\"Bulgaria is in solidarity with Ukraine, but a local glut is being created on the agricultural market, because instead of export corridors our countries are becoming warehouses,\" Bulgaria's Minister of Agriculture, Yavor Gechev, said before his nation imposed its ban.\nCiting its single market nature, members — and the EU itself — condemned the bans. Arianna Podestà of the EC declared to CNN: \"It is important to underline that trade policy is of EU exclusive competence and, therefore, unilateral actions are not acceptable.\"\n\"The flow of Ukrainian agro-export is a matter of survival for the Ukrainian economy, heavily impacted by the full-scale Russian war of aggression,\" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said prior to the deal. \"So, our common priority should be an extension of the suspension of import duties, quotas, and trade defense measures on Ukrainian exports to the European Union.\"\n\n"}

The US announced it had launched air strikes on Syrian groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps the same day.\nA US official told CNN on March 25 two aerial attacks the previous day on Coalition forces at the bases of Mission Support Site Conoco and Green Village injured one US soldier, who was in stable condition then, and damaged a structure, respectively.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK organization, reported on March 25 the US strikes killed three Syrian government soldiers and 11 Syrian and five non-Syrian government-aligned fighters.\nUS President Joe Biden said the same day: \"Make no mistake: the United States does not – does not – seek conflict with Iran. But be prepared for us to forcefully protect our people [...] That's exactly what happened last night [...] We're going to continue to keep up our efforts to counter terrorist threats in the region.\"\nOn Sunday, the Syrian foreign ministry disputed the US assessment of the targets of the latter's March 23 airstrikes and stated Syria would \"end the American occupation\" of the nation. The Iranian foreign ministry released a statement alleging the US targeted \"civilian sites\" and denouncing the strikes.\nThe US' Operation Inherent Resolve in Syria, which operates in tandem with the international Coalition, began in 2015, and has spanned multiple presidencies. In October of that year, the US helped establish the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it continues to support with training and arms.\nAl Jazeera reported the US, after its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, assured SDF leaders it would not also withdraw from Syria. Kino Gabriel, previously a spokesperson for the SDF, told Al Jazeera: \"They [the Americans] were very strong [sic] to make it clear that this is not the same as Afghanistan.\"\nIn August, the Syrian government demanded the US withdraw its troops; its foreign ministry said: \"The American side must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its military forces that are present on the territory of Syria illegally, refrain from stealing and smuggling Syrian oil and wheat, and lift the cover and protection for armed separatist groups and armed terrorist groups that are present in the illegal American military base 'Al-Tanf.'\"\nOn March 8, the US House of Representatives voted 321–103 against a resolution to order the withdrawal of the approximately 900 US troops deployed to Syria, mostly to the south and east of the country.\nThe resolution was sponsored by Representative Matt Gaetz, who said: \"Congress has never authorized kinetic participation of U.S. Armed Forces in Syria.\" \nRepresentative Gregory Meeks argued: \"This measure forces a premature end to our mission at a critical time for our efforts.\""}

Foreign minister Pekka Haavisto handed over the official documents in Brussels to United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nThe accession was marked by raising the Finnish flag at NATO's main office in Brussels, Belgium, while the NATO flag was raised in Helsinki.\nFinland shares a 1,340 kilometers (833 mi)-long border with Russia. By joining NATO, it roughly doubled the length of NATO borders with Russia.\n\"Until now, we have defended our country alone,\" said Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen. \"From now on, we can rely on getting outside help should things get tough. And of course, we are ready to help should someone be in trouble.\"\nKremlin representative Dmitry Peskov said it was an \"encroachment on our security and on Russia's national interests\". He said Russia would closely monitor NATO activity in Finland and take \"counter-measures\".\n\"Finland's membership is not targeted against anyone. Nor does it change the foundations or objectives of Finland's foreign and security policy,\" read a statement by Finnish President Sauli Niinistö after the accession documents were transferred.\n\"President Putin had as a declared goal of the invasion of Ukraine to get less NATO. He is getting exactly the opposite,\" said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. \"Finland today, and soon also Sweden will become a full-fledged member of the alliance\".\nIn the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, public sentiment in Finland and Sweden, which were both non-aligned countries, shifted drastically, to 80% support in the former's case. On May 18, both nations submitted applications to join NATO. New members must have the support of all existing members before they can join.\nThe applications were held up by Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, because Finland and Sweden have granted political asylum to members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization. Last week, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey voted to approve Finland.\nSweden still has to obtain the approval of both Hungary and Turkey before it can join. Hungary objects to Sweden based on its criticism of Viktor Orbán's government. A far-right group in Sweden held a Quran-burning in front of the Turkish embassy in January, which was condemned by the Turkish government.\nAfter Russia won the Finnish War over Sweden in 1809, Finland became a Grand Duchy of the tsarist Russian Empire. This lasted until the Russian Civil War started in 1917 and Finland declared its independence. \nIn 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in a conflict called the Winter War. It ended with a treaty in 1940, under which Finland ceded territory to the Soviets. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 during World War II, Finland entered the war on the side of Germany. It ended with an armistice in 1944, and Finland relinquished another province. \nUnder President Urho Kekkonen, Finland formally adopted a policy of neutrality in 1956."}

Pelé, whose country's government declared him a \"national treasure\" in 1961, was 82.\n\nA post by Pelé's official Instagram account announced the death of \"The King\": \"Inspiration and love marked the journey of King Pele, who peacefully passed away today...[he] enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love.\"\nPelé was born on October 23, 1940, in Três Corações, a town in the state of Minas Gerais, into an impoverished family. Pelé himself worked as a shoeshiner, playing informally; he acquired the nickname \"Pelé\" from his incorrect pronunciation of \"Bilé\", the name of a local association football player.\nWhen he was 15, Santos, a local association football club, recruited Pelé for its juvenile team, and eventually promoted him to the adult team. In 1956, at the age of 16, he joined the Brazilian national team. \nThe national team brought Pelé, 17, as a reserve during the 1958 World Cup in Sweden; while the Brazilian team was playing in the final, they moved him onto the field. Pelé punted the ball over one of the opposing team's defenders, then wheeled around the other man and propelled it into the opponents' goal, scoring. This was voted among the best plays in the history of association football, and Pelé was proclaimed the winner of the Cup.\nPelé suffered an injury and was largely unable to play in the 1962 World Cup in Chile, although he still won.\n\nBrazil also advanced to the 1966 Cup in England. Although the Associated Press later said that he was \"already considered the world’s top player\" by 1966, Brazil was ejected in the group stage; Pelé swore never to return to the World Cup. England won the tournament.\nPelé nevertheless played in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, his last Cup. Brazil advanced to the final, facing Italy, with Pelé making the first goal for his team in that game and winning once again.\nIn 1972, Pelé retired from Santos FC. European clubs invited him to play for them, but he declined. In 1975, Pelé made a comeback playing for the New York Cosmos in the new North American Soccer League. After a 1976 game between the Cosmos and Santos, his old club, of which he played half with each team, Pelé announced he was again retiring from professional association football.\nPelé wrote an autobiography in 1977, My Life and the Beautiful Game, which the Associated Press credited with the popularization of that nickname for the sport.\nPelé had been hospitalized more than a month ago in Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo while undergoing treatment for colon cancer, which he developed in 2021; the hospital attributed the multiple organ failure that killed him Thursday afternoon to this cancer.\nAfter the announcement, current Brazilian footballer Neymar posted to Instagram, \"Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment...Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”\nFrench footballer Kylian Mbappé tweeted, \"The king of football has left us but his legacy will never be forgotten...RIP KING.\"\nJair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil, who will depart that office on Sunday, called Pelé, \"a great citizen and patriot, raising the name of Brazil wherever he went\" in a statement and ordered three days of national mourning.\nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the President-elect, tweeted, \"few Brazilians carried the name of our country as far as he did.\"\nEmmanuel Macron, the President of France, tweeted, \"The game.

Sources told CNN the charges concern hush money payments his campaign made to two pornographic actresses during the 2016 United States presidential election.\nTrump's arraignment was scheduled for Tuesday.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office announced Thursday it had contacted Trump's legal team, including Joe Tacopina, \"to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.'s office for arraignment on a [New York State] Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal.\"\nTrump, a Republican, said: \"The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to 'Get Trump,' but now they've done the unthinkable — indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference.\"\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz declared the indictment \"completely unprecedented [...] [and] a catastrophic escalation in the weaponization of the justice system.\"\nUnlike an impeachment, a conviction unrelated to insurrection would not have legal effects on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.\nIn 2016, Michael Cohen, then Trump's lawyer, arranged for American Media Inc., owner of National Enquirer, to pay pornographic actress Karen McDougal US$150,000 for rights to a story about her allegations of an affair with Trump in Beverly Hills, California in 2006 and 2007. \nThe Enquirer then declined to publish it until the election was over; American Media Inc. said publicly it made the payments specifically to help Trump's campaign.\nCohen paid Stormy Daniels, US$130,000 days before the 2016 election for her to remain silent about her own alleged sexual encounter with Trump in Lake Tahoe, in 2006. The Trump Organization over months reimbursed Cohen US$420,000, while providing him with payments and bonuses it recorded as legal payments.\nNews outlets found out through leaks of the payments and alleged sexual encounters.\nCohen pleaded guilty to and was federally convicted of campaign finance improprieties in 2018; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Cohen testified for the prosecution during grand jury hearings, providing emails, recordings, and other evidence.\nTrump maintains neither affair occurred.\nTrump is under investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, for allegedly attempting to tamper with the state's results during the 2020 presidential election, which he lost, and by federal authorities for allegedly undermining the transfer of the presidency from himself to Joe Biden."}

A statement from WSJ said the newspaper \"vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich. We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\"\n\nThe FSB acknowledged Gershkovich had valid accreditation, but was \"trying to obtain secret information [about] the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.\" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said he was involved with \"activities that have nothing to do with journalism.\" Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov added, \"It is not about a suspicion, it is about the fact that he was caught red-handed.\"\nGershkovich, who speaks fluent Russian, has reported on the former Soviet Union his entire career, which included for The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and The New York Times.\nUS Representatives Adam Schiff and Jared Moskowitz called his detainment a 'kidnapping', the latter telling CNN, \"we are in very dangerous territory with [Russian President Vladimir Putin]. This is all about leverage and so now we have a human life in the balance.\"\nIn a tweet, the top foreign affairs representative of the European Union Josep Borrell said: \"Journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection. The Russian authorities demonstrate yet again their systematic disregard for media freedom.\"\nA joint statement by Eileen O’Reilly and Gil Klein of the US National Press Club said: \"Evan Gershkovich is a journalist. He should be released immediately and unharmed and allowed to return to his important work.\""}

Drake, the library's chief administrator, and Taiwan's representative to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, were banned from entering China and any assets they may have held in the nation would be frozen.\nHudson Institute President John P. Walters, who was personally sanctioned along with the Insitute's board chair, Sarah May Stern, said in a statement: \"The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of attempting to silence voices, domestically and abroad, that oppose its international aggression and its oppression of the Chinese people. It has not worked before and it will not work now. We stand firmly with Taiwan and against the CCP and its ruthless, genocidal policies.\"\nHsiao tweeted: \"Wow, the PRC just sanctioned me again, for the second time.\" Hsiao was sanctioned in August following a visit by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nTaiwan's foreign ministry called the sanctions \"irrational and absurd\" and asserted a \"fundamental right\" to pursue diplomatic aims abroad. China, which claims the island, said it has no authority to engage in diplomacy.\nMcCarthy became the highest-ranking American to meet a Taiwanese President on US soil since the US switched its recognition of \"the sole legal government of China\" from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China."}

The previous day, Islamabad Police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest the former cricketer at his house in Lahore, clashing with PTI supporters outside the building.\nIn October, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) found Khan issued \"false statements and incorrect declarations\" on the Toshakhana transactions, advising authorities to file a criminal complaint."}
{"title": "Netherlands set to further restrict semiconductor technology exports", "content": "Thursday, March 9, 2023 \n\nDutch trade minister Liesje Schreinemacher wrote lawmakers yesterday announcing the government will detail additional curbs on exporting semiconductor chip technology \"on national security grounds\".\nHer letter to the States General of the Netherlands read in part: \"In view of technological developments and geopolitical context, the government has come to the conclusion that it is necessary for (inter)national security to extend the existing export control of specific semiconductor production equipment […]\n\"Because the Netherlands considers it necessary on national security grounds to get this technology into oversight with the greatest of speed, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list\", to be published \"before the summer.\"\nThe exact list of products affected were decided with \"surgical\" precision, \"in order to avoid unnecessary disruption of the value chains and to take into account the international level playing field.\"\nIt comes after at least three months of negotiations with the United States, which unilaterally introduced expansive export restrictions in October to limit Chinese firms' access to foreign chips and tools to make their own, due to fears of military application.\nUS officials conceded, however, the measures' efficacy would be reduced without international co-operation. The Associated Press reported in January similar restrictions were agreed to by Dutch and Japanese functionaries when they visited Washington, D.C. for talks, with separate tête-à-tête discussions that month between US President Joe Biden and the nations' prime ministers.\nSchreinemacher told reporters in Brussels, Belgium last November the Dutch government was \"having talks with the US\", saying: \"We do share the concerns [the US government has] when it comes to China, when it comes to security\" and Dutch \"national security interest is of the utmost importance.\"\nWithout commenting on the prospect of similar restrictions being introduced, the minister said the US export controls' observed negative impact on Dutch companies were \"for the right reasons […] national security interests.\"\nVeldhoven, North Brabant-based ASML Holding, Europe's largest technology company, dominates the production of the laser lithography systems necessary for computer chips; it has offices in Beijing and Shenzhen and a Hong Kong regional headquarters.\nThe firm has reported about 16% of its 2021 sales, or over €2 billion, were to China.\nAmong products sold are advanced deep ultra violet (DUV) systems, which were mentioned as affected by the new controls in Schreinemacher's letter as \"very specific technologies in the semiconductor production cycle on which the Netherlands has a unique and leading position\".\nA statement on the company's website confirms \"ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipment of the most advanced immersion DUV systems.\"\nHowever, it clarifies not all immersion lithography tools are affected, and states based on \"our expectation of the Dutch government’s licensing policy, and the current market situation, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on\" either its 2023 or long-term financial outlooks.\nThis follows a November 11 assurance by CEO Peter Wennink that a scenario where Chinese chipmakers couldn't expand their capacity could mean a \"temporary hiccough\" but wouldn't \"change the 2030 picture that much\" because \"ultimately those chips need to be made.\"\nIts 2023 sales projection for China estimates near-zero growth to €2.2 billion even as ASML expects overall sales to expand by 25%.\nKey questions remain, including whether ASML will be allowed to service the DUV machines already sold, and what precisely is affected—while Schreinemacher's letter mentions \"the most advanced [DUV] immersion lithography and deposition\", it does not name ASML, who has interpreted \"most advanced\" to mean its 'critical immersion' systems.\nExisting controls have prohibited ASML from supplying China chipmaking technology with their most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography systems since 2019, of which they are the world's sole producers. These curbs were introduced following US fears they could be 'dual use' with military potential.\nChina has criticised restrictions as disrupting ordinary trade relations, its Ministry of Commerce stating after Washington's initial announcement the US \"should stop the wrongdoings immediately and give fair treatment to companies from all over the world, including Chinese companies.\"\nDespite trading barbs, a US State Department spokesperson told CNBC that where \"China is pursuing asymmetric decoupling\", Secretary of State Antony Blinken has \"said we do not want to sever China’s economy from ours\".\nSources quoted by Reuters expect Japan to update its own export policies as soon as this week."}

Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 charges of felony first-degree falsification of business records in a Manhattan, New York State court. Prosecutors alleged he distorted records to conceal hush money payments his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, made to three individuals during his 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump surrendered and was fingerprinted, but authorities did not handcuff him or take a mug shot. Trump spent about one hour in the courthouse while he was arraigned. No cameras were permitted.\nAlvin Bragg, the district attorney of Manhattan, told press: \"These are felony crimes in New York state, no matter who you are. We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct.\"\nMitt Romney, a US Senator and, like Trump, a Republican, said Trump was \"unfit for office\" but argued, \"the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda [...] No one is above the law, not even former presidents, but everyone is entitled to equal treatment under the law. The prosecutor's overreach sets a dangerous precedent for criminalizing political opponents and damages the public's faith in our justice system.\" \nRomney twice voted to convict Trump during the latter's impeachment trials.\nTrump is running in the 2024 United States presidential election. However, he would not be the first convicted presidential candidate: in 1920, union leader Eugene V. Debs ran for president while imprisoned and won nearly a million votes.\nTrump's campaign created their own mug shot of him, offering it as a reward for US$47 donations.\nTrump was indicted by a grand jury on March 30, and the next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 4.\nProsecutors have also opened an investigation of the former president in Georgia and two at the federal level, while New York State has filed suit against him."}

Notably, the Fitzroy River broke a 2002 record of 13.95 meters (45.8 ft), reaching a water level of 15.81 meters (51.9 ft) on Wednesday, according to a Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson.\nThe Bureau today released a statement warning while the storm has moved eastward toward the Northern Territory, \"record-breaking major flooding\" continues in the Kimberley.\nAuthorities estimate it could take months to recover from what Dawson called \"the worst flooding Western Australia has had in its history.\" While the extent of the damage is not yet known, parts of the Great Northern Highway have been shut, the bridge at Fitzroy Crossing closed and the airstrip inundated.\nAccording to Reuters, among the hardest-hit is the town of Fitzroy Crossing, on the Fitzroy River after flooding created a 50 kilometers (31 mi) wide \"inland sea\", making roads there impassable. \nBy Saturday, 233 people had been evacuated from settlements across the Kimberley, which has a 50% aboriginal population, and Australian Defence Force helicopters airlifted approximately 3,000 kilograms (6,600 lbs) of food and supplies as weather has improved and the airstrip reopened. Five new helicopters will begin operations by Thursday, Reuters heard.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese described the flood as \"devastating\" and pledged federal assistance for the region. The Western Australian government has also announced a AU$3 million distress fund organized by Perth's Lord Mayor Basil Zempilas."}

They will never be personal\" and said: \"Now the hard work begins\".\nOn Tuesday, the first day of the 118th session, the House adjourned for the first time since 1923 without electing a speaker. Despite leading the Republicans, who won a slim majority in the midterm elections, about twenty conservatives steadfastly opposed McCarthy's leadership.\nTo clear the impasse, McCarthy steadily caved on major fronts, including reducing the number of representatives needed to force a 'motion to vacate', or vote of no confidence, down to one.\nUltimately, fourteen holdout Republicans either switched their votes for McCarthy or voted 'present' to abstain on the twelfth ballot, and another, Andy Harris, on the thirteenth.\nA chaotic scene took place after McCarthy lost on the fourteenth ballot on one vote, despite initially predicting victory, during which his ally Mike Rogers of Alabama had to be pulled away from confronting Florida's Matt Gaetz. The near-altercation, on January 6, was exactly two years after the attack on the US Capitol.\nFinally, on the fifteenth ballot, Gaetz changed his vote to 'present': ultimately, 216 Republicans voted for McCarthy, six 'present', and all 212 Democrats for their House leader Hakeem Jeffries.\nUpon the vote, Republicans promptly burst into shouts of \"USA! USA,\" while McCarthy took the oath of office. \nJeffries spoke briefly before handing the gavel to McCarthy: \"Freedom over fascism. Governing over gaslighting. Hopefulness over hatred. Inclusion over isolation. Justice over judicial overreach. Knowledge over kangaroo courts. Liberty over limitation, maturity over Mar-a-Lago.\"\nFinally, McCarthy ascended to the dais, and the House could begin swearing in new lawmakers."}

The PTA warned it might block Wikipedia if \"[the] Foundation failed to comply with the takedown orders\".\nA Wikimedia Foundation press release on Friday announced the block; PTA released a statement confirming it: \"An opportunity of hearing was also provided, however, the platform neither complied by removing the blasphemous content nor appeared before the Authority\".\nThe Foundation tweeted on Monday, \"Wikipedia is no longer blocked in Pakistan. We are happy to say we have confirmed that traffic on @Wikipedia and other Wikimedia websites from Pakistan has resumed as before.\"\nThe Pakistani government has repeatedly blocked access to certain websites for its citizens, drawing fire from free speech activists, according to The Independent.\nIn 2010, Pakistan blocked Facebook amid the backlash to Internet users' advocacy for the creation of depictions of Muhammad; it eventually repealed the block. The government also blocked YouTube from 2012 to 2016 for hosting a movie about Muhammad, and asked the site in 2020 to prevent Pakistanis from accessing \"objectionable\" videos.\nAdditionally, the PTA earlier banned dating applications such as Tinder and Grindr, citing \"immoral\" components, and has repeatedly blocked TikTok, a Chinese social media application people in Pakistan alone have acquired millions of times."}

This collapse is exactly the result of systematic profiteering politics\". He continued: \"If there is anyone responsible for this process, it is Erdoğan. It is this ruling party that has not prepared the country for an earthquake for 20 years.\"\nThe ongoing Syrian Civil War has worsened the situation there and made the country less accessible to aid workers.

The soldiers were detained since July on charges of 'undermining state security' in the Malian capital Bamako, sparking a row between the neighbouring countries. The Ivory Coast has argued the troops were there as part of a UN mission to fight militant Islamists.\nTheir pardon by Mali's military leader Assimi Goïta followed an Ivorian delegation travelling to Mali and mediation by Togo's President Faure Gnassingbe. The Malian government thanked Gnassingbe for his involvement.\nMali's relations with other West African countries were strained after a military coup d'état toppled elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta in August 2020. Abidjan has been a vocal critic of the coup.\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), of which the Ivory Coast is a member, had proposed new sanctions to begin January 1 if the troops were not freed.\nECOWAS previously levied punitive sanctions against Mali after Goïta delayed elections promised in February 2021 by four years. They were lifted in July 2022 after Malian leaders proposed a two-year transition to democracy.\nRelations with Western powers have also become strained as Mali has strengthened ties with Russia to fight militant Islamists active across the region. France formally ended its operation to fight insurgents in the Sahel in November 2022. The UK has also announced the withdrawal of troops from Mali."}

Griffiths said the World Food Programme (WFP) informed him six of its trucks were looted while en route to Darfur, in the nation's west, although, he claimed, forces had assured the WFP its operations would not be compromised.\n\nGriffiths was in Sudan with the stated aim of investigating how to provide aid to millions trapped amid the clashes between the Sudanese Army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary. He said to media via video: \"We will still require agreements and arrangements to allow for movement of staff and supplies\".\n\"We will need to have agreement at the highest level and very publicly and we will need to deliver those commitments into local arrangements that can be depended on\", Griffiths continued.\nGriffiths told Reuters he spoke to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in command of the Army, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leading the RSF, by phone to urge them to create humanitarian corridors for aid. \"It's important to me that we meet physically, face-to-face to discuss this, because we need it to be a public, accountable moment\", Griffiths stated.\n\"It's a volatile environment, so we need those commitments\", he continued.\nGriffiths argued: \"It's not as if we're asking for the moon. We're asking for the movement of humanitarian supplies, of people. We do this in every other country, even without ceasefires. It's a traditional humanitarian enterprise to go where others don't\".\nOn Twitter, Griffiths urged: \"Ensure safe passage for civilians fleeing areas of hostilities. Respect humanitarian workers and assets\".\nThe UN special representative for Sudan, Volker Perthes, in an interview with Sky News, said, \"all the warehouses, WFP, UNHCR [UN Refugee Agency] and others in Darfur were looted. Vehicles from the humanitarian agencies were looted. The offices of my own mission as well as offices, agencies in most of the towns of Darfur were looted. Food trucks were looted\".\nPerthes blamed this looting for his agency's delay in distributing aid in Sudan: \"WFP lost like 4,000 metric tons of humanitarian goods. So if all this is looted - you cannot distribute it\".\nPerthes said: \"Staff members were held at gunpoint. Staff members were thrown out of their houses by armed fighters who took positions, and houses were broken into. We had at least one case of attempted sexual assault [...] on a female staff member. Many of the houses and apartments were hit by stray shells and bullets\".\nThe International Organization for Migration stated 70% of the 330,000 internally displaced Sudanese were from West and South Darfur.\nOn Tuesday, the South Sudanese foreign ministry said the army and the RSF \"have agreed in principle for a seven-day truce from May 4th to 11th\". In a statement, the army expressed support for extending an ongoing truce by a week and meeting leaders from South Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti, as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional organization, suggested.\n\nForces have agreed to several ceasefires, but none held. IGAD official Ismail Wais stated: \"The two generals, even though they accept the ceasefire, at the same time they continue fighting and shelling\".\nHe declared the continued fighting \"compounds and complicates the political, security and humanitarian situation on the ground making it harder to resolve\".\nPerthes told Sky of the talks: \"The idea is to actually bring them physically together to agree face-to-face on some of the modalities of a ceasefire — which is more than just a declaration of 'we're going to stop the fighting'\".\nIn 2019, the Sudanese Army overthrew President Omar al-Bashir after protests, ending his 30 years in power, and forming a joint government with civilians. After a 2021 coup, with Dagalo as his deputy, al-Burhan led the council of generals ruling Sudan.\nThe two generals disagreed over the process of the transition to democracy and who would command an army integrated with the RSF. The RSF shifted fighters around Sudan, which, according to the BBC, the army interpreted as a threat, prompting fighting to begin on April 15.\nThe 100,000-fighter RSF is a successor to the Janjaweed militia, whom al-Bashir deployed against rebels from Darfur's ethnic minority."}

Despite his retirement, Khan has nonetheless been served with the suspension from the sport. It came as a result of testing positive for ostarine — a banned anabolic agent promoting muscle growth — in a urine sample following his sixth-round technical knock-out loss to Brook in Manchester in February. The ban will expire in April 2024.\nKhan accepted he was in violation of the anti-doping rules and was not planning on appealing the decision, however, he called the ban \"strange and funny\" given the fact, he has retired and has \"no comeback plans at all\". While accepting that he was in violation of the rules, Khan maintained his innocence saying he had not intentionally ingested the substance.

Songs in Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh were also part of the proceedings.\nWelby placed St Edward's Crown upon Charles' head while he sat in the Coronation Chair, with the Stone of Scone placed underneath it.\nPrince William who is heir to the throne, kissed his father's cheek and pledged loyalty. Charles' second son, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, was also in attendance, though without his spouse, Meghan.\nAfter the crowning, attendees shouted: \"God save the King!\" Gun salutes rang out across the kingdom.\nAfterwards, Charles and Camilla traveled to Buckingham Palace in the horse-drawn Diamond Jubilee State Coach, escorted by soldiers, along streets lined by thousands of onlookers.\nAnti-monarchy groups were also present, including Republic, advocating for an end to monarchy. According to the Metropolitan Police, it arrested 52 when they arrived to protest. The Met had advised they would take a 'low tolerance' approach to disruptions of the ceremony.\nHuman Rights Watch said, \"the reports of people being arrested for peacefully protesting the coronation are incredibly alarming,\" and added it was \"something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.\"\nThe police actions were justified, said Commander Karen Findlay: \"Our duty is to do so in a proportionate manner in line with relevant legislation.\""}

The intention to inflict serious harm existed for only a matter of seconds. One cannot be satisfied of an intention to kill.\n\"On the other hand, the life of a fellow human being was violently extinguished in a place where he was entitled to feel safe. His final ordeal was short, but terrifying, and he surely died in enormous pain. What occurred was a deeply self-centred imposition of violence on a fellow human being.\"\nButton called Musa's early life and childhood \"grossly deprived and traumatic\".\nHe said: \"[Musa] was born in Sudan in north-eastern Africa […] She grew up in a village that, for example, had no running water. Her family was often short of food. Her father died when she was very young, and her mother, a deeply religious woman, devoted herself to the care of her large family in poverty-stricken circumstances.\n\"I accept that she suffered many traumatic, indeed horrific experiences over the years. By way of example, whilst she was part of a convoy fleeing the fighting, the vehicle in front of hers was blown up, and other persons were injured and killed before her eyes.\"\nIn 2004, Musa arrived in Australia as a refugee, with many of her family members dead from poverty and war. She was, by that time, afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder and fluctuating levels of anxiety and depression.\nThe justice also noted the former aged care worker had \"been employed consistently\", \"cared for her four children and her aged mother\" and \"completely abstained from drugs and alcohol\".\nConcluding his sentencing remarks, Justice Button said: \"This case is a tragedy from many perspectives: primarily, from that of the deceased, of course, and those who loved him and honour his memory; but also from the perspective of a previously law-abiding offender, her family, and Australian society generally.\n\"In short, a life was taken simply because a fellow human being was exercising autonomy in romantic matters […] Deplorable violence was inflicted upon him, whereby he was crushed to death. There is no remorse on the part of the offender, even now. To be weighed against those matters is that, after an early life of great deprivation and disruption, the offender made a successful fresh start in this country, something especially to her credit in light of the psychological problems that had been inflicted upon on her. They played their part in this fatal explosion of emotion.\"\n\nButton said: \"I believe that, many years from now, the offender has a good chance of becoming a valued member of the community again. By way of my sentence, I seek to balance and reflect that multitude of countervailing factors.\"\nThe killing occurred on June 27, 2020 in the suburb of Wentworth Point, at a garage along Hill Road and near Half Street.\nAccording to Button, that morning Musa thought her boyfriend, 31-year-old Payman \"Paul\" Thagipur, was economically abusing her, feeling \"cut off\" from him.\nAn acquaintance told her to send Thagipur a text message; the then 44-year-old Musa texted him: \"Hi, how are you? Am concerned and worried. I just wanted to know that you're not hurt or sick. If there's something I did wrong, I would like to apologise. Please get in touch\".\nThagipur did not respond.\nIn the early evening, Musa unsuccessfully searched for Thagipur in several cafés and restaurants in Granville. She then drove to his apartment in Wentworth Point. After several failed attempts to enter the secured garage, she tailgated another vehicle through the roller door, which struck the roof of her Toyota Kluger SUV.\nAfter parking in her usual space, next to Thagipur's allocated one, she told a resident inspecting the damaged roller door she lived in \"apartment 201\", Thagipur’s unit and her key fob was \"not working\". Musa asked to be let into the building and the resident obliged.\nThagipur answered the door for her in his underwear and Musa entered to see another woman sitting inside.\nMusa asked the other woman, \"is it your turn today\" and spat in her boyfriend's face, before returning to her car, with Thagipur entering the garage behind her.\nButton argued that, over \"several seconds\", Musa \"spontaneously formed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury\" on the victim.\nMusa sped forward and crashed into the 31-year-old Thagipur, continuing through a bollard, before colliding with and pinning him against a brick wall. Musa approached Thagipur as he was \"gasping for air\".\nAfter about one minute, she called emergency services, telling the operator: \"I kill someone here. It was a terrible accident. I didn't mean it […] I just hit him and he's dead.\"\nPolice treated Thagipur at the scene until paramedics arrived.\nIn footage released by 7NEWS, one officer says: \"Mate, keep breathing, keep breathing. Don't stop breathing.\" Another says: \"You're doing well mate, you're doing well. Stay with us.\"\nLeading Senior Constable Steve Nevill told the Supreme Court he saw Thagipur lying on the ground, and \"there was a lot of blood on the ground underneath him.\" Nevill said Thagipur was making gasping-like noises, but these were postmortem sounds, not breathing.\n\nMusa claimed, \"I was driving out and he came in front of me […] This person is my boyfriend. The whole week I am trying to get hold of him, he never reply […] He stopped talking to me […] I was hurt inside as a woman.\"\nMusa was arrested and taken to Concord Hospital under police guard for mandatory testing. \nAt her murder trial last year, defence counsel Madeleine Avenell SC did not dispute that Musa had driven at Thagipur, but insisted that she did not drive towards him with murderous intent or in an unlawful manner amounting to manslaughter.\nAvenell said: \"What is in dispute is that Ms Musa saw Mr Thagipur before colliding with him, that she deliberately drove at him as he walked through the car park and that she intended to cause him grievous bodily harm or intended to kill him.\n\"She denies the allegation of murder […] She denies that the circumstances were such as to amount to an unlawful and dangerous act of manslaughter.\"\nProsecutors argued that the homicide was committed in a \"state of anger\".\n\"The crown case is the accused, seated in the driver’s seat of her car, [was] very angry about what had just happened – seeing the deceased in his underpants and seeing another woman in the apartment,\" Crown prosecutor Emma Blizard told the court.\nBlizard continued: \"In this state of anger, she drove her car out of the parking spot very quickly, she drove her car at the deceased deliberately as he walked towards her through the carpark.\"\nOn December 12, Musa was found guilty of murder by a jury. As the decision was read, she began sobbing and collapsed; paramedics examined her, but she was not hospitalised."}

Some women don't. It keeps women silent.\"\nTacopina questioned why she did not file a police report at the time, in spring 1996; she said she was too \"ashamed\". She continued: \"I was born in 1943. I'm a member of the silent generation. Women like me were taught to keep our chins up and to not complain. I would never call the police about something I am ashamed of.\"\nTwo friends testified Carroll told them of the alleged assault immediately.\nCarroll said she could not have sex or smile at men she found attractive after the alleged attack.\nCarroll said: \"I was never going to talk about what Donald Trump did.\" In 2019, she published a memoir accusing him, citing the #MeToo movement as encouragement.\nTrump began denying ever meeting her and saying she was not \"my type\", which she has said \"shattered my reputation\", with Elle firing her months after.\nThe statute of limitations has ended, preventing criminal charges against Trump. Carroll sued Trump under the 2022 Adult Survivors Act, which has allowed New Yorkers a year to file suit against those they have accused of sex crimes."}

Researchers measured levels of COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies to the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\nOne month after receiving their vaccinations the volunteers who received the Pfizer vaccine had an antibody response 21 times higher than the volunteers who received Johnson & Johnson and those in the Moderna group showed a vaccine response 51 times higher than those in the Johnson & Johnson group. However, six months later the Johnson & Johnson group was producing antibodies greater than the group who took Pfizer and were equal to the volunteers in the Moderna group.\nDr. Aric Prather of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences highlighted this effect and noted that \"While the mechanism for this increase is unknown, other smaller studies have suggested this trend, leading us to believe there are robust phenomena not specific to our sample.\"\nWhile all three vaccines were shown to be effective the study evaluated other factors that would reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines. Men showed a 30% lower vaccine response than for women. Smokers showed the strongest reduction with measured antibodies being -240% those of nonsmokers. \"Almost all of [the smokers] were unable to mount a strong antibody response,\" said senior author Dr. Elissa Epel, vice chair of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.\nThe study was funded by the National Institute on Aging."}

The opposition party outside parliament, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was unable to nominate any candidate after all of its members resigned in December 2022.\nThe 2023 presidential election was scheduled for February 19 and the nomination process for the presidential election ended on Sunday. \nA soldier during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Chuppu was born in 1949 and hails from the northern Pabna District. In the 1960s and 1970s, Chuppu was a student leader in the AL during the Liberation War. He is an retired district judge and has served as a member of the AL's Advisory Council. \nChuppu's inauguration is scheduled for April 24, 2023."}

{"title": "Study: floods, droughts more intense in past 20 years due to higher global temperatures", "content": "Sunday, March 19, 2023 \n\nOn Monday, Nature Water published a study by two NASA Goddard Space Flight Center scientists concluding the \"strong\" link between the global mean surface temperature and water-related extreme weather led the increase in the severity of events like floods and droughts in the past two decades.\nAuthors Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li wrote results suggest \"rising temperatures may be driving an increase in the total intensity and related metrics of hydroclimatic extreme events that cannot be attributed to the sporadic occurrence of\" regular climactic variations, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.\nThey identified 1,066 regions that experienced periods of too much, or not enough rainfall from 2002 to 2021 with a new algorithm using observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellites.\nThis classified 505 'wet' clusters and 561 'dry' clusters, with an increasing severity of events in the seven years since 2015, which were recognized as among the warmest in history. From 2015 to 2021, the number of 'most extreme' events, among the 30 wettest or driest, increased to four from three per year.\nMonday's study noted an increase in the wet-to-dry event ratio from 15° S to 20° N, and a decrease in three areas between 15° N and 50° N, supporting the hypothesis that wet and dry areas are inversely affected by extreme events.\nThe most intense dry event observed was a record-breaking South American drought from 2015-2016, while the greatest pluvial had been ongoing since 2002 through 2021, affecting most of sub-Saharan Africa above 10° S and leading to flooding and Lake Victoria to rise to its highest levels ever in 2020, inundating homes and infrastructure. \nRodell, the lead author, told the Associated Press (AP): \"I was surprised to see how well correlated the global intensity was with global mean temperatures.\"\nSpeaking to CNN, he explained: \"We thought, well, maybe this is related to global warming, because we do know the past seven or so years have been the hottest on record [...] Sure enough, there was a significant correlation between this total worldwide intensity of these events and the temperature record.\" \nAbout the study's reliability, he said: \"What I feel more confident about is that as the world warms, we’re going to see the greater global intensity of all the wet and dry events increase, meaning they’re going to be more frequent, larger and more severe in total [...] What happens in a regional sense is a little bit more difficult to say with certainty.\n\"The study is another way for people to recognize that climate change affects everyone [...] It’s not just about the temperature rising on average around the world, it’s the actual weather events that have severe impacts on people that may be increasing in intensity and frequency.\"\nRichard Seager, a climate specialist of Columbia University's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, told the AP: \"Looking forward into the future, in terms of managing water resources and flood control, we should be anticipating that the wetter extremes will be wetter and the dry extremes will get drier [...] everything’s going to get amplified on both ends of the dry-wet spectrum.\"\nOn Rodell and Li's use of metrics from GRACE, he said: \"This study uses novel [satellite] data to confirm that human-driven warming is driving the climate system to more extremes of extended both wet and dry episodes.\"\nPark Williams, a University of California, Los Angeles bioclimatologist, told the AP: \"It’s incredible that we can now monitor the pulse of continental water from outer space [...] I have a feeling when future generations look back and try to determine when humanity really began understanding the planet as a whole, this will be one of the studies highlighted.\"\n\nMeanwhile, CNN cited climatologist and Brown University Institute for Environment and Society Director Kim Cobb, who called the study \"a new lens on our rapidly changing water cycle, linking many of the headlines about droughts, floods and wildfires to this global analysis.\n\"This finding really reinforces the trends that we see from analysis of rainfall data and climate model output, and in that sense adds significant evidence to inform emergency planning and response, infrastructure planning, agricultural practices, and water resource management under continued warming.\"\nRodell has been the Acting Deputy Director of Earth Sciences for Hydrosphere, Biosphere, and Geophysics at Goddard since 2021.\nLi has been an assistant research scientist at the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard, and at the University of Maryland, College Park since 2017.\nIn its 2021 report, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported a 70% increase in the frequency of droughts that would typically occur every ten years and a 30% increase in the frequency of comparable flooding.\nMoreover, scientists have said global warming could amplify the occurrence of 'weather whiplash', rapid swings between extreme conditions like in the US state of California, which recently experienced heavy rain and snowstorms after a megadrought.\nThe National Integrated Drought Information System estimates 20% of annual extreme weather-induced losses in the US economy stem from droughts and floods."}

What a huge and needed victory for all Alaska.\"\nAccording to a January Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) published by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a Department of the Interior agency, the project would: destroy approximately 532 acres (2 km²) of wetlands; use approximately 1.5 billion gallons (5.7 billion liters) of freshwater; and emit approximately 613 trillion pounds (278,036 metric megatons) of gross carbon dioxide equivalent over its 30-year planned duration.\n\nDevelopment of the master plan for the project began in 2018. \nThe BLM released its EIS on August 15, 2020; Audubon Alaska and several other indigenous and conservation organizations stated in a joint press release the same day: \"Rather than listening to local communities and taking the necessary time to produce an adequate analysis, the [then-president Donald] Trump Administration is rushing ahead to meet ConocoPhillips' timeline—driven by their desire to have rubber-stamped permits in hand before a potential administration change.\"\nThe Department of the Interior released a Record of Decision on October 26, 2020 authorizing up to three drill sites as well as supporting infrastructure such as processing and support facilities, gravel access roads, and pipelines. \nSecretary of the Interior David Bernhardt said then: \"This decision will make a significant contribution to keeping oil flowing down the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline decades into the future while delivering federal and state revenue as well as important impact assistance to the affected native communities.\"\nOn February 13, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a temporary injunction preventing ConocoPhillips from blasting, building roads, and gravel mining for the Willow project. \nOn August 18, 2021, the US District Court in Anchorage reversed the August 2020 EIS, finding it did not analyze foreign greenhouse gas emissions, include alternative proposals not subscribing to the conclusion that leases afforded the right to extract \"all possible\" oil and gas from each lease tract, and failed to properly consider the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA)'s requirement to give \"maximum protection\" to 'surface values' in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA).\n\nIn January 2021, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order that paused \"new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters\", a campaign promise of his. In June 2021, US District Judge Terry A. Doughty granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's pause; last August, Doughty made the injunction permanent, stating the administration lacked \"the authority to implement a Stop of lease sales.\"\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) required the US Department of Interior to lease the lesser of 60 million acres (240,000 km²) offshore and 2 million acres (8,100 km²) of federal lands each year for oil and gas development and the amount requisitioned by industry.\nThe Willow project was supported by a group of Alaska Native organizations and all three members of Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, who argued it is economically critical for their communities. US Senator Dan Sullivan, also an Alaska Republican, said the project would be \"one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state's history.\"\nOn February 20, the Alaska House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 6 by 36–0, expressing support for the project.\nHowever, Sierra Club Senior Campaign Representative Mike Scott said: \"The Willow project would have a devastating effect on public lands and our climate, and approving it after passing the largest climate bill in history would be a giant step in reverse.\""}

She reaffirmed the corporations' civil liability, under which Air France had paid reparations to families, setting a hearing on further civil damages for September 4.\nAirbus and Air France could have been fined up to €225,000 each if convicted. Air France-KLM reported €7.1 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, while Airbus said its revenue was €20.64 billion in the same period.\nReuters quoted sources as reporting the parties had also settled to transfer undisclosed amounts.\n\nClaire Durousseau's niece was one of the 216 passengers of 33 nations aboard AF447, the deadliest French aviation accident ever. After the verdict she said, \"Our lost ones have died a second time. I feel sick.\"\nThe president of victims' families' association Entraide et Solidarité AF447, Danièle Lamy, told media, after \"chaotic\" legal disputes for over ten years, including this nine-week trial last year, the families were \"mortified and overwhelmed.\"\n\"The loser first and foremost is French justice,\" she said.\nAn attorney for the families, Alain Jakubowicz, commented: \"We're told Air France, Airbus are responsible, but not guilty. We were waiting for the word 'guilty'.\"\nThe defendants independently expressed compassion to the families and affirmed support for safety.\n\nThe plaintiffs were victims' family members, as the prosecution argued for acquittal between the trial and the verdict, citing insufficient evidence to place liability with the corporations instead of the pilots.\nAir France declared the causes of the accident will remain unknown.\nDaunis found Airbus negligent on Monday for not replacing the model of pitot tubes, airspeed sensors on the outside of a plane, responsible for previous incidents and not correlating incident reports from airlines to identify an issue with the pitots. The judge said the Airbus' cockpit display did not inform pilots of issues to the same extent it did air traffic controllers. Investigators relied on the encoded alerts to probe the causes of the accident before the main wreckage was discovered in 2011. \nDaunis also found Monday Air France acted negligently by not reminding pilots of prior issues with the pitots.\nAF447, flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Paris, plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on May 31, 2009 local time (UTC−03:00). On April 3, 2011, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution-operated robotic submarines found the main wreckage from the A330-200 about 4,000 meters (13,123.4 ft) down; the BEA retrieved the aircraft's cockpit voice recorders with a similar craft in May.\nBureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) investigators concluded ice accumulated on the pitots, disabling autopilot and autothrottle. They said the aircraft stalled and produced warnings, which the pilots disregarded; Airbus agreed with this explanation.\nAir France, the National Airline Pilots Union and Entraide et Solidarité AF447 criticized the BEA for allegedly concentrating its investigation on the airline instead of probing Airbus as well.\nAccording to Euronews, the AF447 crash prompted new regulations on sensor testing and training for pilots.\n\n"}

However, Florida governor Ron DeSantis; US Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina; Mike Pence, Trump's vice president; and Mike Pompeo, Trump's secretary of state, are expected to announce runs, according to Politico. Haley has lagged behind Trump and DeSantis in hypothetical opinion polls for the presidential election.\nIn her Twitter announcement video, \"Strong & Proud\", Haley says: \"Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections. That has to change.\"\nShe added, \"[US President] Joe Biden's record is abysmal, but that shouldn't come as a surprise. The Washington, [D.C.] establishment has failed us over and over and over again. [...] It's time for a new generation of leadership [...] I'm Nikki Haley, and I'm running for president.\"\nOn Wednesday, Haley held her opening rally in Charleston, South Carolina. According to Politico, the event was subdued, in contrast to Trump's populist, energetic speeches.\n\nTaylor Budowich, spokesperson for Trump's super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., declared Haley \"just another career politician\", stating that she \"started out as a Never Trumper before resigning to serve in the Trump admin[istration]\".\n\"Now, she's telling us she represents a 'new generation'. Sure just looks like more of the same, a career politician whose only fulfilled commitment is to herself,\" said Budowich.\nThe 51-year-old Haley contrasted her age with Biden, 80, and Trump, 76, calling for \"mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years\" and the rejection of \"the stale ideas and faded names of the past.\" She continued: \"America is not past our prime [...] It’s just that our politicians are past theirs.\"\nNikki Haley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in Bamberg, South Carolina, to Sikh immigrants from India.

I was different.\"\nIf nominated, Haley would be the first female and first non-white Republican presidential nominee and, if elected, the first female president and first of Indian descent in the US.\nHaley, who has never lost a race, first ran for office in 2004, defeating the most senior South Carolina state representative. In 2010, a 38-year-old Haley became the first non-white female governor of a US state.\nHaley addressed the 2012 Republican National Convention, and won reelection as governor in 2014. She delivered the Republican rebuttal to then-President Barack Obama's 2016 State of the Union address.\nIn 2015, after a self-proclaimed white supremacist shot and killed black churchgoers in Charleston, Haley went to the victims' funerals and successfully lobbied the state legislature to remove a Confederate States of America flag from above the state capitol. Haley denounced Trump's refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan during his 2016 presidential campaign. In 2017, however, she expressed support for Trump, by then the president.\nTrump appointed Haley to be the US ambassador to the United Nations in 2017. During her tenure, the US withdrew from UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council, claiming the organizations were advocating anti-Israel policies. In late 2018, Haley resigned; neither she nor the administration provided a reason. Trump said her departure was planned six months before, coinciding with a public disagreement over sanctions on Russia."}

{"title": "Ukrainian President Zelenskyy denies Russian claim of capture of Bakhmut", "content": "Tuesday, May 23, 2023 \n\nOn Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told press at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut at the epicenter of the ongoing war there remained contested, despite Russian claims to occupy it: \"We are keeping on, we are fighting.\"\nThrough an interpreter, Zelenskyy declared in Ukrainian: \"We are not throwing people [away] to die [...] People are the treasure. I clearly understand what is happening in Bakhmut. I cannot share with you the technical details of what is happening with our warriors.\"\nIt comes after Yevgeny Prigozhin alleged Saturday in a Telegram video his pro-Russian mercenary Wagner Group had captured Bakhmut around noon. Prigozhin, with several troops surrounding him and destroyed buildings behind, spoke over fire: \"We fought not only with the Ukrainian armed forces in Bakhmut. We fought the Russian bureaucracy, which threw sand in the wheels.\"\nIn response, Ukraine's deputy defense minister Hanna Malyar said while \"the situation is critical\", fighting continued: \"our defenders control certain industrial and infrastructure facilities in the [Bakhmut] area and the private sector\" and Kyiv's troops had \"took the city in a semi-encirclement.\"\nShe said: \"The enemy failed to surround Bakhmut, and they lost part of the dominant heights around the city [...] the advance of our troops in the suburbs along the flanks, which is still ongoing, greatly complicates the enemy's presence in Bakhmut.\"\nEarlier, in statements in English Zelenskyy's press secretary later retracted, Ukraine's president said on whether Bakhmut had fallen: \"I think no, but you have [to] understand that there is nothing, they've destroyed everything. There are no buildings. It's a pity. It's tragedy.\n\"But, for today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing on this place [...] just ground [and] a lot of dead Russians.\"\nA representative for the Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces, Serhii Cherevatyi, commented: \"The president correctly said that the city has, in fact, been razed to the ground\"; however, the \"enemy is being destroyed every day by massive artillery and aviation strikes, and our units report that the situation is extremely difficult. Our military keep fortifications and several premises in the southwestern part of the city. Heavy fighting is underway.\"\nHours before Zelenskyy's counterclaim Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement praising \"Wagner assault detachments, as well as all servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces units, who provided them with the necessary support and flank protection, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artyomovsk [​Soviet-era name for Bakhmut, after a communist militant],\" according to state media outlet TASS.\nThe Washington, D.C., US-based Institute for the Study of War assessed Russia's declared capture of Bakhmut was \"not tactically or operationally significant\" as it \"does not grant Russian forces operationally significant terrain to continue conducting offensive operations\" or \"to defend against possible Ukrainian counterattacks.\"\nOther analysts the Associated Press (AP) mentioned said Bakhmut's fall may grant Moscow certain a tactical edge, it wouldn't be the watershed moment for the end of the war.\nNevertheless, Zelenskyy told the AP in March if Russia captured Bakhmut, they could convince the international community to back a compromise settlement to the war which Ukraine couldn't accept.\nRussian troops started attacking Bakhmut in August but were initially repulsed. In January, Russia took Soledar, another salt-mining town to its north.\nEarlier this year, a NATO official estimated for CNN Russia's fatality rate in Bakhmut was five times Ukraine's. The eight-month long battle for \"fortress Bakhmut\", 34 miles (55 km) north of regional capital Donetsk, saw forces expending thousands of rounds of ammunition a day and the civilian population fall from a pre-war 70,000 to under 4,000 in March.\nUkrainian sources said Wagner \"marched on the bodies of their own soldiers\", while Prigozhin called it a \"meat grinder\". In April, videos circulated on social media allegedly depicting Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers in Bakhmut, prompting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to call for \"Russian terrorists\"' expulsion from the UN.\nDuring his speech Sunday, Zelenskyy said historical images of destruction in Hiroshima \"really remind\" him of Bakhmut.

Moreover, after his release, he will be barred from future employment with the Canadian government.\nFrom August 2015 to March 2017, McGregor was posted to the Canadian Defence Liaison Staff at Canada's US embassy, which automatically gave him diplomatic immunity.\nIn January 2017, another member of the Canadian Armed Forces, also in Washington, D.C., found two audio recording devices in her home. Believing McGregor was responsible, she reported him to her senior officer, and to investigate, the Embassy waived McGregor's diplomatic immunity at the request of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS).\nOn February 16, 2017, CFNIS agents and local Virginia police executed a search warrant at the then-corporal's staff quarters in Alexandria, seizing computers, CDs, storage devices and five hidden cameras.\nForensic analysis showed a 2011 video of McGregor groping an unconscious woman in Victoria and recordings from inside McGregor's home of a woman using the restroom and a video of cartoon characters appearing aged under eighteen engaging in sex acts; a child pornography charge for the latter was later dropped.\nThe woman videoed later told the Esquimalt court she believed it was taken on a night when she invited McGregor over for drinks and video games. She reported blacking out and awakening to find him sexually touching her.\nMcGregor had sought to have the videos and images excluded from evidence, arguing the search violated Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that protects Canadians from \"unreasonable search or seizure.\"\nThe move and a subsequent appeal were rejected, with the Court Martial Appeal Court holding the Charter did not apply outside Canada and, notwithstanding, the search was permissible.\n\nHis latest appeal to Canada's top court argued the search violated the Charter by inviting a re-evaluation of the controversial 2007 ruling R v Hape, that presently governs extraterritoriality. His counsel Diana Mansour told the court on May 19, 2022 military personnel \"ought to have their Charter rights guaranteed when investigated by Canadian military police for Canadian criminal offences.\n\"The portability of the military justice system allows Canadian criminal law to apply to our military members when they are serving anywhere in the world and with it, so should the Charter apply.\"\nPatrice Germain, counsel for the Crown respondent, argued that Section 8 \"did not apply to the search of the appellant [McGregor's] residence in the United States, because Virginia state law, under which it was conducted, is not within the authority of Parliament or a provincial legislature.\"\nJustice Suzanne Côté, writing for the majority, said the warrant the CFNIS obtained and executed under Virginia law authorized the search, seizure and analysis of McGregor's electronic devices: \"A search is reasonable within the meaning of [Section 8] of the Charter if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable.\"\nAs well as \"authorized by law\", the court also found the search was not \"more intrusive than necessary\", Côté writing: \"It is difficult to see how the CFNIS investigators could have acted differently to attain their legitimate investigative objectives.\n\"Simply put, I would dismiss the appeal even if I were to accept Cpl. McGregor's argument that the Charter applies extraterritorially in the present context.\"\nIn fact, the Court left the Charter's scope ambiguous, explaining: \"I [Côté, representing four judges' opinions and her own] find it unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality to dispose of this appeal [because] the CFNIS did not violate the Charter\" to begin with.\nAfter the ruling, Mansour said: \"We accept the court’s decision which leaves open the opportunity for another matter to address the legal issue of the extraterritorial application of the Charter in the Canadian military context.\"\nIn an email to Law360 Canada, co-counsels for the Crown Chavi Walsh, Natasha Thiessen and Patrice Germain said the CFNIS investigation was \"a textbook case of successful international law enforcement cooperation, which respected the rights of the accused and complied with Canada’s international legal obligations.\n\"This case demonstrates that the Canadian Armed Forces can maintain crucial military discipline by effectively investigating and prosecuting crimes, including those of sexual violence, anywhere the CAF operates.\""}

He continued, \"Cutting Social Security that you've paid for your entire life while cutting taxes for the very wealthy. Dictating what healthcare decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.\"\n\nAmid a montage of himself, Vice President Kamala Harris, his first term, civilians, and his Republican opponents, among them former President Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, a US Representative from Georgia, Biden said: \"When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are. The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.\"\n\"This is not a time to be complacent. That's why I'm running for reelection,\" he said. \"This is our moment [to] defend democracy. Stand up for our personal freedoms. Stand up for the right to vote and our civil rights [...] Let's finish this job. I know we can.\"\nIn his first event during his 2024 campaign, Biden Tuesday cited job increases of tens of thousands in the construction industry before North America's Building Trades Unions members cheering \"Let's Go Joe\": \"We — you and I — together we're turning things around and we're doing it in a big way [...] It's time to finish the job. Finish the job.\" Biden previously proclaimed his would be \"the most pro-union administration in American history.\"\n\nIn the Democratic primary, among those already running were Marianne Williamson, an author of self-help books and spiritual advisor who sought the nomination in 2020 but did not contest any state primaries, and Kennedy family member Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump already began his campaign to retake the presidency after Biden defeated him in 2020.\nFormer US President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, retweeted the launch video and, linking Biden's campaign website, said: \"Proud of all that @JoeBiden and his administration have accomplished these last few years. He's delivered for the American people — and he'll continue to do so once he's re-elected. Let's get to work!\"\nA statement from Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel argued: \"Biden is so out-of-touch that after creating crisis after crisis, he thinks he deserves another four years.\n\"If voters let Biden 'finish the job,' inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off [...] Republicans are united to beat Biden and Americans are counting down the days until they can send Biden packing.\"\n\nAn RNC ad used artificial intelligence to create clips of what NBC News described as an \"apocalyptic future\" during a second Biden term.\nPro-Trump super PAC Make America Great Again, Inc.'s CEO, Taylor Budowich, released a statement claiming, \"America is on the brink of a deadly nuclear war\" and calling Biden's presidency a \"failure\".\n\"Americans are struggling to afford groceries and gas. The border has been opened to millions of unknown illegal immigrants and tons of deadly drugs. Joe Biden does not deserve four more years to further destroy America,\" it continued. \"The choice will be clear for voters in 2024 [...] President Trump made America great once and he will do it again.\"\nHarris emphasized abortion rights in a Tuesday rally at her alma mater, Washington, D.C.'s Howard University: \"These extremist so-called leaders would dare to tell us what is in our own best interest. Well I say, I trust the women of America. I trust the people of America [...] So don't get in our way because if you do, we're going to stand up, we're going to organize and we're going to speak up and we're going to say we're not having that, we're not playing that!\"\nThe vice president called herself \"proud to run for reelection [...] so we can finish the job.\"\nIowa-based Democratic presidential campaign strategist Jeff Link predicted to NBC News: \"The big attack against Biden will be his age and his capability [...] He needs to show that he is engaged and focused and working for working families. And you've got to do that continuously.\"\n\"Folks are still concerned about the threat that Trump poses,\" Link continued. \"Having a second Biden term is critical for making sure that Trump doesn't get back in the White House. Biden uses that line 'Don't compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative,' and I think that's going to be very relevant,\" with anti-Trump voters.\nBiden's February State of the Union speech employed the phrase \"let's finish the job\" over a dozen times and said Republicans \"want to take the economy hostage\" and wish to see \"huge cuts\" to \"programs that millions of hard-working and middle-class Americans count on.\"\nGallup, Inc. polling places Biden's approval rating at 40%, with 56% disapproval. When he began his 2020 campaign, the same pollster found he was approved of 53%–35%. Unemployment in the US stood at 3.5%, its lowest in about 50 years. US inflation during Biden's first term reached the highest levels in decades. Inflation later receded to around 5% amid the Federal Reserve's boosts to the interest rate.\nAn NBC News poll released on Sunday showed 70% of Americans and 51% of Democrats saying they did not think Biden should seek reelection, compared to 60% of Americans and about 33% of Republicans saying the same of Trump. Close to half of Democratic respondents to a recent Reuters-Ipsos poll said they did not think he should launch a reelection campaign, and over 60% of all polled said his age prevented fitness for the office.\nBiden, at age 80, is the oldest president in US history. He has declared those objections \"totally legitimate\", but also said: \"Watch me.\" He has been in federal politics for a half-century and said on the campaign trail in March 2020: \"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else.\" \nPresidential physician Kevin O'Connor concluded from a physical examination in February Biden was \"healthy, vigorous\", and \"fit\" for the presidency. \nHis press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, declined Tuesday to say if he would serve out his entire second term if he won it. She later said on Twitter: \"I wanted to be sure that I didn't go into 2024 more than is appropriate under the law. But I can confirm that if re-elected, @POTUS would serve all 8 years.\"\nFirst Lady Jill Biden said in December she was \"all in\" for her husband's potential reelection campaign. Joe Biden said his April trip to Ireland \"reinforced\" his commitment to seek reelection.\nBiden selected Julie Chávez Rodriguez, an Executive Office advisor, as his campaign manager, and Quentin Fulks as deputy campaign manager. Fulks managed Georgia US Senator Raphael Warnock's successful reelection bid in 2022. \nBiden's 2024 campaign announced its co-chairs as: Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, and Veronica Escobar — all US Representatives — as well as two US Senators, Chris Coons and Tammy Duckworth. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Jeffrey Katzenberg, an entertainment executive and donor to the Democratic Party, were also appointed co-chairs."}

Recognising that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy\".\nA footnote acknowledged the description of the war was \"agreed to by all member countries except Russia and China\".\nAjay Seth, a senior Indian official, stated during a press conference the representatives from Russia and China felt \"their mandate is to deal with economic and financial issues\" and opposed including the situation in Ukraine in any statement.

The conference was attended by the World Bank, China, India, Saudi Arabia and members of the G7. \nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described it as an organisational meeting, with no \"deliverables\" produced. Georgieva told reporters: \"We just finished a session in which it was clear that there is a commitment to bridge differences for the benefit of countries\".\nGeorgieva argued policymakers \"should not take off the table\" the option of outright bans if regulation proved ineffective, while Yellen expressed support for a strong regulatory framework instead.\nSitharaman said of difficulties faced by Ethiopia, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Zambia: \"Strengthening multilateral coordination by official bilateral and private creditors is needed to address the deteriorating debt situation and facilitate coordinated debt treatment for debt-distressed countries.\"\nAt the G20's November meeting in Bali, host Indonesia issued a Leaders' Declaration in place of a communiqué after similar disagreement over the invasion of  Ukraine."}

Thank you to the Queen and those who make up her birthday honours list for bringing attention to the inaction of the US government on this issue.

He is expected to lead the party into the October elections amidst economic challenges and two years of declining Labour popularity against a stronger conservative opposition.\nIn his first speech as prime minister, Hipkins, who under Ardern led New Zealand's response to COVID-19, said: \"This is the biggest privilege and responsibility of my life [...] I’m energized and excited by the challenges that lie ahead.\"\nHipkins said the cost of living was an \"absolute priority\" for the new ministry but ruled out announcing specifics \"only a couple of hours into the job\". Quarterly consumer spending figures published that morning showed New Zealand's inflation rate remained high at 7.2%, led by increases in housing and food costs.\n\"New Zealanders will absolutely see in the coming weeks and months the cost of living is right at the heart of our work program [...] It is the number one priority that we are facing as a government and they will see tangible evidence of this\", he told reporters, but said \"I’m not going to be so hasty as to make things up on the fly\".\nSepuloni expressed her gratitude for the position and saluted Hipkins' victory. On Sunday, Sepuloni, of Samoan, Tongan, and New Zealand European descent, said she \"want[s] to acknowledge the significance of this for our Pacific community\".\nOn Sunday, Hipkins pledged to fight what he described as a \"pandemic of inflation\": \"COVID-19 and the global pandemic created a health crisis. Now it’s created an economic one and that’s where my government’s focus will be\".

Nevertheless, according to the Associated Press, he and other party members were obscure compared to Ardern, a \"global icon for the left\".\nArdern said she resigned after serving almost fifteen years as a member of parliament because she didn't \"have it in the tank [to continue].\" She is expected to remain an MP before resigning in April, to prevent a by-election before the October vote.\nArdern was elected prime minister in a coalition government in 2017 and won a landslide re-election three years later. She has governed during the nation's deadliest terrorist attack, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn her last event as prime minister on Tuesday, Ardern said people were \"the joy of the job\". On Wednesday morning, staffers and supporters gathered to say goodbye and hug her as she walked out of the Parliament building.\nWilliam and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, tweeted Ardern and her family their gratitude \"for your friendship, leadership and support over the years, not least at the time of my grandmother’s death.\""}

Horizon Arctic-based remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) returned debris to land earlier the same day.\nAfter approximately an hour and 45 minutes' descent, the Titan lost contact with its support ship, the Polar Prince. A search effort involving ships and ROVs began, and an ROV found debris about 1,600 feet (488 m) from the bow of the Titanic on June 22. US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger stated the debris was \"consistent with a catastrophic implosion of the vehicle.\"\nA United States Navy acoustic system identified an \"an anomaly consistent with an implosion or explosion\" on June 18 in the area where the Titan was last detected. An official told NPR the Navy decided to continue the mission \"as a search and rescue and make every effort to save the lives on board.\" Search crews reported sounds at 30-minute intervals the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Carl Hartsfield noted others claimed to be \"banging noises\", but Mauger said \"[t]here doesn't appear to be any connection between the noises\" and the missing submersible.\nWith extreme pressure at that depth, an implosion would have instantly killed the five on board: OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, Pakistani-born British executive Shahzada Dawood and his British 19-year-old son Suleman, British businessman Hamish Harding and French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet."}

Reuters additionally reported investors believed rates would climb to about 6.25% sometime December before falling.\nThe effect of higher interest rates is that the same gilts with a maturity of October 2025 sold for an average yield of 4.874% last month and for 3.634% in January. However, NatWest bond specialists told Reuters last week the gilts were \"one of the cheapest bonds on the UK fitted curve\".\nUK inflation held at 8.7% in May, contrary to forecasts, while core inflation, which excludes certain consumables like food and energy, increased to 7.1% from 6.8% in April, a high not seen since 1992. The BoE consequently revised its projection that by the end of 2023 inflation will come down to about 5%, not 4%.\nIn June 2007, the UK offloaded £2.5 billion worth of five-year gilts with an average yield of 5.790%.\nAt 08:17 BST (0717 UTC) Thursday, the yield on two-year gilts was 5.429%, while the ten-year gilt at 08:19 was 4.548%."}

He said their allegations cost him speaking contracts he would have earned hundreds of thousands of Australian dollars from.\nThe judge found some claims Roberts-Smith killed, or allowed or encouraged the killing of, unarmed people substantially true, so they met the civil principle of the balance of probabilities.\n\nNick McKenzie, an investigative journalist who helped write the articles alleging Roberts-Smith's misconduct, declared: \"It's a day of justice for the brave men of the SAS who stood up and told the truth about who Ben Roberts-Smith is: a war criminal, a bully and a liar.\"\n\"[And] today is a day of some small justice for the Afghan victims of Ben Roberts-Smith,\" he continued.\nRoberts-Smith was on the Indonesian island of Bali during the hearing, his attendance being optional.\nThe Guardian predicted he would have to pay the defendants millions of Australian dollars, with the parties having spent about AU$35 million on the trial; the paper estimated his employer, Seven Network head Kerry Stokes loaned Roberts-Smith AU$2 million to pursue the case, for which he put up his Victoria Cross as security.\nThe defendants reported Roberts-Smith: kicked a captured civilian off a cliff in Darwan in 2012 and ordered a soldier of lesser rank to fatally shoot him; machine-gunned a Taliban prisoner's back at least ten times in 2009 before he took the prosthetic leg to drink from; and ordered troops to kill two civilians as \"blooding\" — a ritual first killing.\nA man testified Roberts-Smith claimed in \"the most beautiful thing [Roberts-Smith had] ever seen\" to have shot in the head an Afghan teenager the witness described as \"shaking like a leaf\" with fear.\nProsecution of Roberts-Smith would require \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\".\nABC News reported many Australians saw Roberts-Smith as a national hero before the allegations; he received the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest honour for soldiers, in 2011 and met Queen Elizabeth II shortly after, announcing to press: \"It is very humbling\".

Upadhyaya said Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is assigned to preside over the case, planned to schedule a trial at an August 28 hearing; both prosecutors and Trump's attorneys were instructed to present a favored trial timeline by that date, but Upadhyaya described Chutkan as open to allowing Trump to not attend that hearing.\nThomas Windom, the head prosecutor assigned to the trial, argued: \"This case will benefit from normal order, including a speedy trial.\" \nDefense lawyer John Lauro said his side would need to analyze evidence the government must provide it through discovery and the idea a trial could soon begin was \"somewhat absurd\": \"These are weighty issues. Obviously, the US has had three and a half years to investigate this matter\". \nHe added: \"And all I'm going to ask, Your Honor, is the opportunity to fairly defend our client. But in order to do that, we're going to need a little time.\"\nUpadhyaya said: \"I can guarantee everybody that there will be a fair process and a fair trial in this case.\"\nUpadhyaya warned the defendant of the conditions of his freedom, one of which being he and witnesses could not discuss the case without lawyers present: \"If you fail to comply with any conditions of your release, a warrant may be issued for your arrest.\"\nThree law enforcement personnel who resisted the Capitol attack arrived to witness the 27-minute arraignment, including Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell. The clashes injured Gonell, who retired; he noted to the Associated Press this was \"the same court in which hundreds of rioters have been sentenced. It's the same court former President Trump is being arraigned in today for his alleged involvement before, during, and after the siege.\"\nOther attendees included the court's chief judge, James Boasberg, who presided over the grand jury's secret proceedings. Also attending were Judge Randy Moss and Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who has criticized Trump when sentencing participants in the attack.\nProviding counsel for the defense were Lauro and Todd Blanche, also working for Trump in other court cases, while Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran attended in the audience. The lawyers have claimed Special Counsel Jack Smith infringed on Trump's freedom of speech by criminally charging him.\nTrump, standing in the rain at Reagan National Airport ahead of his flight returning him to New Jersey, declared it a \"very sad day for America\". He said: \"This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican [Party] primary and leading Biden by a lot [...] So if you can't beat 'em, you persecute 'em or you prosecute 'em. We can't let this happen in America.\" He has maintained his innocence.\nAsked at a campaign stop press conference in Iowa on Friday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican contender in the 2024 election, if he believed the 2024 presidential election to be \"stolen\", he said: \"I've said many times the election is what it is [...] All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true. But what I've also said is the way you conduct a good election that people have confidence in, you don't change the rules in the middle of the game.\"\nProsecutors asked Chutkan to issue a protective order under which Trump could not release sensitive evidence from discovery, after he wrote on his social media website Truth Social earlier in the day: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" They said that could be interpreted as meaning he could attempt to chill witnesses.\nTrump's lawyers submitted a response Monday, conceding some documents should remain private, but \"the need to protect that information does not require a blanket gag order over all documents produced by the government.\" Basing their argument upon the US Constitution's provision safeguarding free speech, they continued: \"In a trial about First Amendment rights, the government seeks to restrict First Amendment rights.\"\nThe government responded, noting the other side's counsels had been spoken about the case on broadcast media. Chutkan later scheduled a hearing on the matter for Friday.\nOn Sunday, Trump declared on Truth Social: \"There is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge 'assigned' to the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case [...] Everybody knows this and so does she! We will be immediately asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for venue change, out [of] D.C.\" He had claimed West Virginia was \"politically unbiased\" in contrast to D.C.\nA federal grand jury on August 1 indicted Trump, accusing him of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. It charged he committed such to undermine the US Congress' evaluation and certification of the validity of the results.\nThis indictment followed one in New York City, on state-level charges of falsification of business records to conceal hush money payments, the first indictment of a US president, and another federal indictment in Miami, Florida, over alleged purposeful retention of classified documents.\n\nFulton County, Georgia has been investigating Trump and supporters for alleged attempts to influence the 2020 election results there.\nUnlike an impeachment, a conviction unrelated to insurrection would not have legal effects on Trump's campaign.\nThe indictment said Trump exhausted his legal avenues to affect the election results, including seeking relief from courts and requesting authorities perform recounts and audits of votes, yet participated in a conspiracy to perpetuate the claim he won the election. He called the election \"crooked\" before flying to D.C. for the arraignment on social media.\nAware his statements were false as Vice President Mike Pence and other advisors and appointees informed him, the indictment charged, \"the defendant repeated and widely disseminated them anyway — to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, to create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and to erode public faith in the administration of the election.\"\nThe indictment described Trump trying to persuade state administrators to alter election results, unsuccessfully attempting to convince Pence he could prevent Congress from counting the votes of electors, who states appointed consistent with the local popular vote, and, with unnamed and unindicted accomplices, assembling groups of \"fraudulent electors\" to vote for him and send their votes for Congress to count.\nTrump and accomplices, the grand jury continued, disseminated these statements in a rally on January 6, after which some attendees and others stormed the Capitol, clashing with resisting law enforcement. Congress reconvened within hours, and Pence presided over the certification of the results.\nProsecutor Jack Smith on August 1 called it \"an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy [...] It was fueled by lies, lies by the defendant\".\nA bipartisan US House of Representatives select committee reported on the prelude to the Capitol attack after a months-long investigation, determining authorities should charge Trump with aiding an insurrection, obstructing an official proceeding, and other crimes. In 2021, Chutkan ordered Trump's presidential records be available to the committee, against his wishes; the grand jury mentioned those records in August 1's indictment. Hours before the arraignment hearing, he denounced Chutkan as \"unfair\" on social media."}

It also mandated sellers perform background checks on prospective purchasers of \"kits that contain the parts necessary for someone to readily make a gun.\" Kits were previously available without either requirement. The ATF's stated goal with the Frame or Receiver rule was to ensure the \"proper marking, recordkeeping, and traceability\" of firearms.\nIn a statement from Everytown for Gun Safety, John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, remarked: \"Americans across the country will be safer thanks to the Supreme Court’s decision today to keep ATF's [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] life-saving ghost guns rule in effect while the appeals process plays out.\"\nCody J. Wisniewski, who represented one of the plaintiffs, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in the case, said: \"We're deeply disappointed that the Court pressed pause on our defeat of ATF's rule effectively redefining 'firearm' and 'frame or receiver' under federal law.\"\nRegulations in the Gun Control Act of 1968 did not cover privately-made firearms for \"personal, lawful\" use, so their creation was legal as long as the creator could legally own a firearm and, for certain weapons the National Firearms Act regulated, like machine guns, the ATF approved and registered it — the latter being the same process as when one purchased a firearm from a business that held a Federal Firearms License (FFL).\nAdvancements in technology and the availability of instructions for firearm manufacture have led to an increase in privately-made firearms, according to the ATF. The ATF has reported an uptick in unserialized firearms the government found connected to criminal investigations. The ATF said this rise prompted it to compose the \"Frame or Receiver\" rule."}

In a post on the platform, Zuckerberg expressed his optimism about the future of Threads: \"It'll take some time, but I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it. Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn't nailed it. Hopefully we will.\"\nWithin two days of Threads' release in over 100 countries, over 70 million users had signed up, according to head of Instagram Adam Mosseri. However, it has yet to be released in the European Union, reportedly due to Meta's uncertainty about restrictions imposed by the Digital Markets Act the bloc passed last year."}

The measure banned the possession, use, production, or transfer of large capacity magazines (LCMs) holding more than ten rounds of ammunition, with exceptions, and required prospective gun owners to get a permit.\nAmong the plaintiffs were special interest groups, gun sellers and owners, county sheriffs, and a security professional.\nImmergut's ruling did not affect Harney County Circuit Court Judge Robert Raschio's order on December 6 preventing Measure 114 from coming into force, a trial for which was scheduled for September.\nImmergut determined the \"permit-to-purchase framework\", with a background check, safety training, and evaluation of the applicant's mental health as prerequisites, \"is consistent with the type of regulations that the United States Supreme Court has deemed constitutional under the Second Amendment [to the Constitution of the United States].\"\nShe also determined the regulation of LCMs, as they had \"uniquely dangerous propensities\", was \"consistent with this Nation's history and tradition of regulating uniquely dangerous features of weapons and firearms to protect public safety.\" \nThe judge noted Mark Hanish, former Vice President of Marketing and Sales for manufacturer Surefire, told the court it sells the same LCMs to the US Department of Defense and the nation's civilians; she concluded LCMs \"even in civilian hands, are closely related to weapons used in warfare.\"\nDuring the seven-day trial, lawyers for the plaintiffs argued magazines were necessary to firearms' operation and were therefore arms under the Second Amendment's protection.

Referencing the Republican's election loss to President Joe Biden in 2020 in Georgia and nationally, it alleged they \"refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump.\"\nThe grand jury's indictment continued: \"That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the State of Georgia, and in other states.\"\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis told press later the accused had eleven days to surrender.\nTrump faced a charge of violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) along with his co-defendants; three counts of soliciting a public officer to violate their oath; conspiracy to commit impersonation of a public officer; two each of conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, and false statements and writings; conspiracy to commit filing false documents; and filing false documents.\nTrump said the day of the indictment: \"I didn't tamper with the election!\" Ahead of the announcement of the charges, his 2024 presidential campaign claimed the prosecution the Democratic Willis was leading was \"election interference\". In a statement the campaign said: \"The timing of this latest coordinated strike by a biased prosecutor in an overwhelmingly Democrat jurisdiction not only betrays the trust of the American people, but also exposes true motivation driving their fabricated accusations.\" He previously repeatedly asked for her disqualification based on her public remarks on the case.\nOn Tuesday, he wrote on his social media website, Truth Social: \"A Large, Complex, Detailed but Irrefutable REPORT on the Presidential Election Fraud which took place in Georgia is almost complete & will be presented by me at a major News Conference at 11:00 A.M. on Monday of next week in Bedminster, New Jersey\".\nOn Thursday, he announced he would not stage the press conference, posting to Truth Social: \"Rather than releasing the Report on the Rigged & Stolen Georgia 2020 Presidential Election on Monday, my lawyers would prefer putting this, I believe, Irrefutable & Overwhelming evidence of Election Fraud & Irregularities in formal Legal Filings as we fight to dismiss this disgraceful Indictment\".\nThis fourth case followed indictments of the former president in New York City, on state-level charges of falsification of business records to conceal hush money payments, the first indictment of a US president Miami, Florida, on federal charges of purposeful retention of classified documents; and Washington, D.C., on federal charges of \"[pursuit] of unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting\" the 2020 election.\nUnlike impeachment and conviction by the US Congress, a criminal conviction unrelated to insurrection would not have legal effects on Trump's campaign, but, as the charges were state-level, a US president could not pardon those, if any, found guilty or remove state prosecutors.\nIn its 98 pages, the indictment mentioned 30 more involved in the conspiracy, but did not charge or name them. It said Trump and associates, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, both indicted alongside him Monday, unsuccessfully attempted to persuade state officials involved in the certification of the results.\nIt described Trump asking Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, to interfere with the results — calling Raffensperger on January 2, 2021 to ask him to \"find\" votes so Trump could overcome Biden's victory and US Department of Justice employees to pronounce the results \"corrupt\".\nIt said Trump made false claims of election fraud in, without success, petitioning courts to undo the results in lawsuits against Georgia.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Trump organized individuals to present themselves as legitimate electors, including state Republican Party chairman David Shafer and Cathleen Latham; some said the Trump campaign told them they would cast their presidential votes only if Trump's legal efforts to overturn Biden's victory were successful. The grand jury indicted Shafer and Mike Roman, another alleged participant in the scheme, who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign.\nThe indictment continued Trump attorneys three times attempted to convince members of the Republican-majority Georgia legislature to present their election fraud allegations. It said the US Department of Justice's civil division's top official, Jeffrey Clark, prepared a never-sent letter asking legislators to \"convene a special session\" on the results and the electors it would certify to vote for president, charging Clark.\nThe grand jury described how \"several of the Defendants [...] falsely accused Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman of committing election crimes\", then used these claims as basis for their argument the Georgia legislature and others in its government should alter the results.\nMark Meadows was another facing charges. The grand jury accused the one-time Trump Executive Office Chief of Staff of trying to gain unauthorized entry to a Cobb County, Georgia civic center where state law enforcement was conducting audits of election-related signatures in December 2020. \"Is there a way to speed up Fulton county signature verification in order to have results before Jan 6 if the trump campaign assist financially\", he texted Raffensperger's Chief Investigator Frances Watson. The grand jury indicted him on violating RICO and soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, the latter stemming from scheduling the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.\nLatham, the grand jury charged, also participated in a pro-Trump scheme to compromise ballots and election machines in Coffee County, Georgia.\nIn Georgia, prosecutors have had the option of convening special grand juries for investigations before a regular grand jury hears its findings and considers indictment, and Willis did so about a year into her investigation in 2022. Among those who testified to the special grand jury before it dissolved in January were Eastman, Giuliani, Meadows, and Ken Chesebro, all of whom the regular grand jury charged. Others who testified were Mike Flynn, a national security advisor to Trump, and legislators Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Representative Jody Hice of Georgia, both Republicans.\nBoth Willis and Judge Robert McBurney, who oversaw the special grand jury's work, said Shafer was at the greatest risk of prosecution of the pro-Trump electors."}

After approximately half an hour's flight, Flightradar24 data indicated the plane plummeting at almost 8,000 feet per minute by 6:19 PM (15:19 UTC) and ceasing to report its altitude, after rapidly alternating between gaining and losing altitude from a cruise at about 28,000 feet.\nThe Federal Air Transport Agency said \"[a]n investigation has been launched\", reporting others recorded aboard were Sergey Propustin, Evgeniy Makaryan, Aleksandr Totmin, Valeriy Chekalov, Dmitry Utkin — an agent of military intelligence who became a Wagner field commander, Nikolay Matuseev, and on the crew Commander Aleksei Levshin, Rustam Karimov, as copilot, and Kristina Raspopova, as a flight attendant.\nToday, Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declared Moscow had nothing to do with the crash: \"There has been a lot of speculation around this crash [and] the tragic deaths of the plane's passengers, among them Yevgeny Prigozhin. Of course, the West presents all this speculation from a particular angle. All of that is sheer lies [...] One should rely on facts. For now, there are not many facts, they have yet to be established in the ongoing investigative procedures.\"\nPutin, on television yesterday, offered \"sincere condolences to the families of all the victims\", including Prigozhin, a \"talented businessman\" he explained he first met in the early 1990s: \"He [Prigozhin] was a man of difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life [...] He achieved the results needed both for himself and when I asked him about it - for a common cause, as in these last months.\"\nAccording to a US official who spoke to ABC News United States today, the working theory is an explosion, perhaps from a bomb, occurred on the Embraer and prompted its crash, while another expressed strong leanings toward a bomb being responsible.\nBrigadier General Patrick Ryder of the US yesterday said the \"initial assessment, based on a variety of factors\" of that nation's intelligence concluded the Wagner head was \"likely killed\" in the crash, but added the military \"doesn't have any information to indicate right now\" a surface-to-air missile was responsible. CNN sources in the US government earlier told of officials assessing an explosion as one possibility for why the plane crashed.\nUS President Joe Biden was vacationing in the Lake Tahoe area, where he told the press he did not \"know for a fact what happened, but I'm not surprised.\n\"There's not much that happens in Russia that Putin's not behind, but I don't know enough to know the answer.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said: \"The demonstrative elimination of Prigozhin and the Wagner command two months after the coup attempt is a signal from Putin to Russia's elites ahead of the 2024 elections.\"\nYevgeny Prigozhin, nicknamed \"Putin's chef\", was born in 1961 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, then Leningrad. He began a twelve-year sentence for robbery and fraud in 1981; authorities freed him in 1990.\nIn a comment to Sky News, the Royal Institute of International Affairs' Samantha de Bendern described: \"He very quickly got onto the private property/private enterprise bandwagon and ended up being a hot dog seller [...] And this is where things become very mysterious because he transformed himself from hot dog seller to restaurateur to the grand and great of the new post-Soviet Russian elite.\"\nHe, his mother, and his stepfather started a hot dog business out of a flea market in the city. Governments awarded him contracts for food provision to schools and the army, and other government enterprises.\nThe US brought an indictment against him in 2018 over alleged financial aid to the Internet Research Agency, which the US Department of Justice accused of perpetrating a conspiracy to \"defraud the United States...for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016,\" including impersonating US citizens.\nAccording to Prigozhin — who previously denied connection to the organization and sought court relief from journalists suggesting such — he started Wagner in 2014. Wagner participated in the War in Donbas alongside pro-Russian rebels against the Ukrainian government, and has fought in Mali, Mozambique, and Sudan, among other African nations.\nBy UK and US sources' estimates, in late March 2022 Wagner had 1,000 fighters in Ukraine after the Russian invasion, and 50,000 in December, the US estimating prisoners composed all but 10,000 of the 50,000.\nPrigozhin said in November \"[a] dog receives a dog's death\" of the sledgehammer killing of a Wagner deserter, and the Institute for the Study of War has accused Wagner of war crimes.\nAs Wagner fighters engaged in combat in Bakhmut, Prigozhin demanded on social media: \"[Defense Minister Sergei] Shoigu! [Chief of General Staff Valery] Gerasimov! Where's the fucking ammunition?\"\nAfter capturing the city, earning Putin's congratulations, Prigozhin said the Russian military did not provide Wagner sufficient ammunition or help on the battlefield, declaring he might withdraw his forces from Bakhmut. In a video, near the corpses of Wagner fighters, he said: \"These are someone's fathers and someone's sons [...] The scum that doesn't give us ammunition will eat their guts in hell.\"\nOn June 23, Prigozhin demanded military leadership resign, ordering his forces to advance on Moscow and \"destroy anyone who stands in our way\", prompting clashes that killed perhaps fifteen government soldiers. He had Wagner turn around from 120 miles from Moscow days later; he mentioned a desire for peace. The Russian government announced Belarus secured a deal under which Prigozhin would stand down and he and Wagner forces would depart for Belarus, in exchange for freedom from legal repercussions over the rebellion.\nOn July 3, Prigozhin said on social media his intent had been \"fighting traitors and mobilizing our society\": \"I think we have achieved a lot of it. In the near future, I am sure that you will see our next victories at the front. Thanks guys.\"\nHis first video since the rebellion was labeled as from Monday."}

Staff are to later take apart the container, catalog its contents, and eventually provide samples to scientists in other institutions.\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated the OSIRIS-REx team \"on a picture-perfect mission — the first American asteroid sample return in history — which will deepen our understanding of the origin of our solar system and its formation.\" Nelson also said the samples will lead to better understanding of asteroids that could head for Earth.\nOSIRIS-REx launched in September 2016 and arrived at Bennu in December 2018. For almost two years, NASA scientists worked to select the best sample collection site. The spacecraft collected samples in October 2020 as it used a robotic arm to make contact with the surface and then inject nitrogen gas to kick up material into its receptacle. About 8.8 ounces of the approximately six metric tons of debris entered the receptacle. OSIRIS-REx began its return trip to Earth in May 2021.\nThe sample capsule was dropped at an altitude of 63,000 miles as the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flew by Earth. It entered the atmosphere at 10:42 EDT (1442 UTC) and touched down about ten minutes later. Recovery teams used radar and other instruments to track the capsule. Personnel secured the capsule to ready its transport to JSC.\nSince its launch in 2016, OSIRIS-REx has traveled 3.86 billion miles. With the sample-return phase complete, the spacecraft will continue on to the asteroid Apophis. To reflect the change in purpose, the mission has been renamed to Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-APophis EXplorer (OSIRIS-APEX)."}

The government said that discouraged asylees from seeking jobs there.\nThe government said SpaceX did not \"fairly\" consider these applications in relation to jobs including those for which advanced degrees were necessary, as well as welders and cooks."}
