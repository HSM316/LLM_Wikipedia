{"title": "Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan resigns over Brexit border checks", "content": "Friday, February 4, 2022 \n\nFile:Paul Givan MLA.jpg\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) First Minister of Northern Ireland Paul Givan resigned effective midnight Friday as part of his party's protests against checks on goods coming from Great Britain.\nThe checking provision was introduced as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was decided during Brexit negotiations that saw the UK leave the European Union. However, prominent Unionists in Northern Ireland have strongly opposed its terms.\nGivan's resignation will also force Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill from office in the devolved Executive (Stormont). This cripples the body's legislative power, meaning it can no longer meet to pass vital policies like the three-year budget, an energy bills grant and relaxing Covid-19 restrictions. However, other Stormont ministers remain in portfolio until the next elections scheduled for May.\nGivan's emotional press statement indicated Northern Ireland's institutions are \"being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew’s agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union [Brexit]\". He specifically mentioned the \"cornerstone\" principle of consent provided as part of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement that introduced the power-sharing Executive.\nHowever, he emphasised his \"earnest desire that all sections of the community will soon be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully functioning executive, through a resolution to the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point\".\nHe called his resignation after almost eight months in the post \"the end of what has been the privilege of my lifetime - to serve as the First Minister of Northern Ireland\". He succeeded Arlene Foster after she resigned in June 2021. It was something \"I never expected to have the opportunity to [do]\" when first elected as Lagan Valley MLA in 2011, he added.\nThe decision was criticised by opposition parties, including \"reckless and self-serving\" by Sinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy, in addition to officials in the British and Irish governments. Leader of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald urged an early election to be called \"in the absence of a functioning Executive\" to show \"the DUP actions have consequences, real consequences for people struggling\". Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party Doug Beattie framed it as destabilising, generating \"more hardship for the people of Northern Ireland\" and ultimately fruitless: \"At the end of it all, the Protocol will still be there\".\nWhile McDonald criticised coming inaction on the budget and healthcare investment for \"the DUPs own narrow and self-serving political interests\", others expressed concern over the crippling of government services. UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis called the move \"extremely disappointing\" and urged a reinstatement to \"ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland\". Prime Minister Boris Johnson emphasised the UK government's priority \"for a resilient Northern Ireland Executive\".\nTaoiseach of Ireland Michéal Martin called Givan's decision \"a highly damaging move\". Through a spokesperson he warned \"[i]t is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic\". He urged \"the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement\" that the Protocol protects \"in all its dimensions\".\nHe added talks between the UK and EU, of which Ireland is a member, are ongoing and \"must be given every chance to succeed\". He further said: \"The [European] Commission has put forward serious proposals which directly address the concerns about outstanding issues on implementation of the Protocol\". Givan had told reporters he was resigning as Unionists were being required \"to be seen and not heard\" regarding the Protocol.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Commission vice president Maroš Šefčovič met via video conference on Thursday to discuss the Protocol, \"the only solution we have found with the UK government to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement\". In a statement, Šefčovič called yesterday's instruction by Stormont Agriculture Minister and former DUP leader Edwin Poots to suspend certain checks for goods entering Northern Ireland \"very unhelpful\". Truss and Šefčovič will meet again on February 11.\n\nUnionist politicians have made their position on the Protocol clear. Following Givan's resignation, DUP party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it \"represents an existential threat to the future of Northern Ireland's place within the Union\". He added the UK government has not held up the New Decade, New Approach agreement that was the basis for the DUP re-entering the Executive in January 2020. The deal ended a three-year impasse in power-sharing between Sinn Féin and the DUP following the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.\nThe Irish Independent understands the statement and time of Givan's resignation was confirmed in a meeting between high-ranking DUP members earlier on Thursday.\nPoots's decision to suspend sanitary and phytosanitary checks not imposed by December 31, 2020 allegedly followed legal advice which \"concluded that I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval\". Although the UK government has said it will not intervene in a \"matter for the Northern Ireland Executive\", it faced criticism as \"a breach of international law\" by Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Šefčovič called it as \"essential\" that checks are still being conducted, while a spokesperson on Johnson's behalf expressed support for \"a swift resolution.\""}

The Washington team drew more criticism than most, because unlike \"Indians\" or \"braves,\" the word \"redskin\" is specifically, as Ray Halbritter of Oneida Nation Enterprises called it, \"a dictionary-defined slur.\"\nOn Wednesday, team president Jason Wright told viewers the new name \"embodies the values of service and leadership that characterizes the DMV [D.C., Maryland, Virginia region].\"\nCurrent and former players Jonathan Allen and Gary Clark praised the new uniforms, which feature a prominent letter \"W.\"  Allen said that although the name did not have meaning or history, the experience and atmosphere of seeing players in their new uniforms would soon bring enthusiasm from fans.\nFor a long time, team owner Daniel Snyder resisted changing the name, once threatening to \"put it in all caps.\" However, in June 2020, 87 sponsors that pay hundreds of millions of dollars to affiliate with the team, including FedEx, Nike, and Pepsi, wrote a letter to the team management asking the name be changed.  The team had also faced increasing complaints the old name was insulting to Native Americans.  The team hired John Wright, who consulted with fans, a former player, and Native Americans to find a new name.  Fans liked variations of \"Red Wolves,\" but too many other teams had already trademarked and copyrighted similar names and imagery.\nReactions from Native American voices were mixed.\nCrystal Echo Hawk of IllumiNative said the team had an opportunity to \"put a horrible chapter to rest,\" adding: \"There's still a lot of healing that needs to happen, so I don't think the team's work in regards to reconciliation and healing is over.\"\nFawn Sharp of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) said team management had not done enough to acknowledge the harm done by the former name: \"Without an apology, without any measure of accountability, and without fulfilling the honored commitments they made to tribal nations in 2020 to right this wrong, the NFL and Snyder are simply 'Commanding' a continued course of open, intentional and profit-driven racism and erasure.\"\nAbout one thousand sports teams in the United States are named after Native Americans in some way, down from about three thousand in the 1990s. The American Indian Movement and NCAI, among other organizations, have advocated for these teams to adopt non-Native American names and mascots."}

Plans for a battery energy storage system were put on hold due to fire risks. The wind farm, scheduled to be built by OSMI Australia Pty in 2023, would be the first wind farm built in a plantation in the state of Victoria.\nA planning panel heard from local residents, community groups, and OSMI representatives in late 2021, ultimately recommending in a 224-page report that approval for the wind farm be granted, but stated that \"the information provided about the siting and fire-safety measures for [the battery energy storage system] was inadequate for it to recommend in favour of it at this stage\".\nOSMI executive director Peter Marriott insisted that the battery energy storage system was \"certainly not a key part of the project\", but added \"it's something we'll always remain open to — we're obviously really keen to digest the findings of the recommendations of the CFA and WorkSafe investigation into the Moorabool battery fire.\"\n\nNationals member for Gippsland South Danny O'Brien noted a recent court ruling last Thursday ordering a Tarwin Lower wind farm to stop emitting noise at night, remarking \"it seems incredible the Minister could have approved Delburn just a few days later, despite strong opposition from the local community\".\nO'Brien added \"given Gippsland's relatively densely populated landscape, the right location for wind farms is offshore, where I strongly support proposed facilities such as the Star of the South\".\nVoices of the Valley, a local community group established in the wake of the 2014 Hazelwood mine fire, celebrated the approval, with the group's president Wendy Farmer saying \"power stations have dominated the landscape over the past century in the valley, but now we are watching the transformation of energy across the region\", and noting that the news \"comes on the week of the fifth anniversary of the Hazelwood power station closure\"."}
{"title": "Federal judge rejects hate crime plea in Arbery killing", "content": "Thursday, February 3, 2022 \n\nOn Monday, Judge Lisa Godbey Wood of the U.S. District Court in Brunswick, Georgia rejected a guilty plea from Travis McMichael after McMichael offered in court to plead guilty to federal hate crimes in the death of Ahmaud Arbery.\nIt is highly unusual for a U.S. judge to reject a plea agreement, which would waive McMichael's right to appeal.\nMcMichael said he was willing to plead guilty to attacking Arbery out of racial animosity, which would make Arbery's murder a hate crime.  In the proposed plea deal, he would have spent the first 30 years of his sentence in a federal prison.  After that, he would move to a Georgia state prison for the rest of his life.  Per this deal, even if his state charges were overturned, McMichael would still spend many years in prison.\nIn court, federal prosecutors urged Judge Wood to accept the plea deal, but Arbery's family asked her not to.  The dead man's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said that the men who killed her son did not deserve to choose their living conditions: \"Granting these men their preferred choice of confinement would defeat me. It gives them one last chance to spit in my face.\"\nProsecutors claimed they had talked with the victim's family about the plea deal in advance, but lawyers for Cooper-Jones disagreed.\nJudge Wood explained that Cooper-Jones' statement was part of her decision, but her main reason was that she did not want to be held to the strict 30-year sentence agreed upon by prosecutors and McMichael's lawyers.\nWood's decision casts doubt on whether McMichael's father, Gregory McMichael will also plead guilty as planned.  Gregory McMichael also helped kill Arbery.\nIn February 2020, the McMichaels and a third man, William Bryan, chased Arbery, 25, in trucks as he jogged through their suburban Georgia neighborhood. Travis McMichael then fought with Arbery on foot and shot him to death.  Bryan took cell phone video of the event, which later appeared on the Internet.\nIn November 2021, all three men were convicted of murder in Georgia's Glynn County Superior Court.  They were sentenced to life in prison, though only Bryan was granted the possibility of parole.  The state of Georgia did not at that time have its own hate crime law, and prosecutors decided to charge the men on the federal level.\nJury selection for Travis McMichael's federal hate crimes trial is scheduled to begin on Monday, February 7."}

It stands about 4.3 inches (11 cm) tall.  Like many prehistoric statuettes, it shows a female figure with a large stomach and breasts.  However, while most of these other examples were carved from ivory or bone, the Venus is made of a stone called oolite, a type of limestone.  Scientists believe it was carved by people of the Gravettian culture, probably with flint tools.  Scientists named it after Venus, the Roman goddess of love.\nScientists compared rock samples from as west as France and as east as Ukraine to microscopic views of the Venus.  Because oolite is a sedimentary rock formed by layers of silt and other materials building up over time, it is possible to discern individual grains and bits of shell that make up the stone.  One of the tiny shell fragments in the statue came from a creature that lived during the Jurassic period, though the stone itself would have been harvested and carved much later.\nUnlike previous examinations of the Venus, which evaluated only the exterior of the work, scientists used computed tomography to look inside the statue without damaging it.  The scan showed the Venus had little resemblance with oolites near Willendorf, but that it was almost identical to those from Lake Garda in Italy, on the other side of the Alps and the Danube river, over 350 miles (563 km) away.  A less possible site of origin is in Ukraine, over 1,600 kilometers (994 mi) east of where the statue was found in 1908, in Wachau, Austria.\nLead author Gerhard Weber speculated the stone may have moved during a migration: \"When the climate or the prey situation changed, [people] moved on, preferably along rivers,\" he said.\nThe scientists say these findings have implications for the way prehistoric humans in and around the Alps traveled from place to place.\nThe study was funded by the state of Lower Austria."}

The ship's timbers seem intact, and the name Endurance is clearly visible below the stern and above the five-pointed star Polaris — both unchanged after so much time.\n\nSubmersible craft launched by Endurance22, formed and funded by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust, laid cameras on the Endurance at a depth of about 3,008 meters (9,868.8 ft). The probing vehicles were launched from the main hub of the expedition, the South African icebreaker S.A.

Sir Ernest, a pioneer in British Antarctic exploration in the early twentieth century, and his expedition were stranded when the Endurance became trapped by sea ice and was slowly crushed.\nThey camped on the ice until able to launch lifeboats to eventually reach safety. All survived, but the Endurance sank.\nFor years, it had been nearly impossible for explorers to locate the ship's remains, as the Weddell Sea is covered by thick sea ice year-round. However, the past month has seen the lowest recorded level of Antarctic sea ice since satellite records began. This allowed the multinational team of experts assembled by the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust to make its uncovering.\nExpedition leader Dr. John Shears said of the successful expedition: \"We have made polar history... and successfully completed the world's most challenging shipwreck search\" and that it was \"what human beings can achieve and the obstacles they can overcome when they work together.\"\nDirector of exploration Menson Bound said: \"It is not all about the past; we are bringing the story of Shackleton and Endurance to new audiences, and to the next generation, who will be entrusted with the essential safeguarding of our polar regions and our planet. We hope our discovery will engage young people and inspire them with the pioneering spirit, courage and fortitude of those who sailed Endurance to Antarctica.\""}
{"title": "Ballarat candidates debate climate at election forum", "content": "Sunday, May 8, 2022 \n\nBallarat, Australia — In the lead-up to the upcoming Australian federal election, four candidates for the Division of Ballarat met last Sunday at the Ballarat Tech School in a climate-centred forum organised by local group Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions (BREAZE).\nIn attendance were sitting Labor member Catherine King, Greens candidate and former mayor John Barnes, Australian Federation Party candidate Kerryn Sedgman, and independent candidate Alex Graham. Local Liberal and Liberal Democrats candidates gave apologies in place of attendance.\nThe event was preceded by a climate action rally outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and the Ballarat Town Hall, which featured speeches from both representatives of BREAZE, the Ballarat branch of Extinction Rebellion, Environment Victoria, the Public Transport Users Association, and the Ballarat Trades Hall.\nThe forum began with each candidate being given three minutes to summarise their policies on climate before questions were taken from members of the public. John Barnes, the Greens candidate, began by claiming \"the Greens have the most ambitious program of any of the parties on addressing climate change\", and said if the Greens were in the balance of power in the coming election, they would work to push Labor towards the \"reforming zeal of past generations\", invoking former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Barnes stated the Greens have a target of 75% emissions reduction by 2030, by which time they would also end the mining, burning, and export of coal in Australia. \nIndependent candidate Alex Graham began his speech by saying he was \"passionate about our environment\" and claimed to have \"absolutely, without question, the best policy\", explaining the focus of his candidacy was to introduce a referendum that would allow the Australian government to \"write its own money supply into existence\". Graham said this policy would deliver \"money beyond the pale to totally restore our environment\".\nIncumbent MP Catherine King said that in her twenty years as an MP, the Australian Parliament had been unable to deal with the climate issue. She referenced previous attempts by the last Labor government to legislate policies to tackle climate change, such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), but stated these efforts were \"completely and utterly dismantled\" after the 2013 election. \nKing referred to the Powering Australia policy announced in December 2021 by Labor energy and climate spokesperson Chris Bowen, stating the policy had been supported by the Business Council of Australia (BCA), National Farmers' Federation (NFF) and \"some\" environmental groups. King stated the policy included a commitment to 43% emissions reduction by 2030, net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and it would overall \"grow jobs, increase renewable energy, and bring emissions down\". \nKerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party promised to centre the opinions of views of the community, and read from the Federation policy on climate directly, saying \"carbon is not the enemy. Toxic pesticides are the true enemy.\" Sedgman claimed pesticides were the primary source of nitrous oxide (N₂O) released, and that N₂O was \"300 times worse than carbon\".\nAfter the candidates concluded with their opening summaries, members of the public were open to ask questions. The first question asked candidates what their first two priorities were for climate action. Barnes said the Greens' top priority was \"prompt action\", and they would also focus on transforming the nation's economy to \"a new way — a new sustainable way — of making our living in the world\". Graham stated if Australia had a limitless supply of money, there would not be a climate change issue and Australia would become a model for the world. He said his two priorities would be creating more money and introducing newer technologies.\n\nKing said her first priority would be getting more renewables into the grid and generally increasing the amount of renewables, and also added a third priority, saying that as Minister for Transport and Infrastructure in a Labor government, she would add a climate section to the department and work to create a network of electric vehicle charging stations. Sedgman stated \"there's more than two top priorities\", but remarked that soil regeneration was a key part of carbon sequestration, and called for a more immediate approach to deal with climate through education and community hubs.\nThe event was then disturbed slightly by a person asking about a supposed \"ninety-year suppression order suppressing the names of twenty-eight VIP alleged paedophiles\", who was asked to leave by organisers for disrupting the event. King labeled the belief a \"QAnon conspiracy theory\".\nAfter this, the topic shifted to the proposed Western Victorian Transmission Network, a proposed overhead transmission line from Bulgana to Sydenham. Graham said his proposed referendum, if successful, could lead to the federal government subsidising a plan to put the transmission line underground beneath the Western Highway, emphasising we shouldn't \"let money interfere with saving this planet\". King noted the location of a proposed transfer station was \"really problematic\", but stated the issue lay more with the regulatory process, and Labor would work with state and territory governments to reform this process.\nSedgman admitted she was not fully aware of some of the background King had bought up, and she would like to speak to those affected personally. Barnes said the consultation of AusNet, who propose building the transmission line, had not been good, and hopes an extended time granted for the environmental impact statement will allow all people affected to be properly heard. Barnes also stated AusNet had claimed diverting the line underground would cost thirteen times more than the overhead alternative, while a Shire of Moorabool study showed it would only cost five times more.\nOne questioner asked about what the candidates would do to investigate the possibility of direct air capture. Barnes remarked \"the best way to sequester carbon is not to release it in the first place\", and said the mechanical removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was \"probably a pipe dream\". Graham quipped he was \"prepared to ask my friend if he could do it, and I'm sure he could.\" King argued the technology was \"a fair way off yet\", but noted A$3 billion was reserved in Labor's Powering Australia plan for new technologies to reduce emissions. Sedgman stressed the importance of reducing the \"extraordinary rate\" at which deforestation occurs.\n\nCandidates were then asked if they would commit to no new coal and gas infrastructure. King confirmed a moratorium on new coal and gas was not part of Labor policy, but they were not interested in investing taxpayer funds towards them, contrasting it with what she said was the current government's approach to projects such as the Collinsville Power Station. Graham said, as someone who had previously worked in the industry, he would \"close down every coal-fired power station as soon as it was possible\" and disallow the construction of new coal-fired power stations. Graham also pledged to close down coal mines and ban fracking.\nBarnes stated the Greens take the advice of the International Energy Agency seriously, and would not allow any new coal, gas, or oil projects, as well as closing down coal-fired power stations by 2030, to be replaced by renewable energy. Barnes emphasised the need to lower emissions before 1.5 °C of global warming was reached.\nOne questioner asked candidates what they would do in the event of two scenarios after the coming election — one being that Labor had a clear majority, the other that the Greens held the balance of power. King stated the \"beauty of power in Australia\" was it didn't require any legislation. However, she said Labor would still attempt to legislate targets of 43% emissions reduction and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Barnes reiterated the Greens in the balance of power would push Labor to be more ambitious, and that while compromise would be needed in a hung parliament, the Greens would \"play hardball\" on addressing the climate.\nCandidates were then asked about a proposal from Beyond Zero Emissions to turn northern Australia into the \"battery of Asia\". Barnes stated Australia could become a \"energy superpower\", and good government policy could have the market \"with us\" on this issue. King declared over 600,000 jobs could be realised under Labor's Powering Australia plan, and concurred in saying Australia should be a renewable energy superpower and exporting technology to the world. She highlighted the need for a government that \"believes in climate change, believes that we have to do something about it\", and restated that Labor's plan was endorsed by the BCA and NFF.\n\nThe final question asked how those in coal communities such as the Hunter Valley could be helped to deal with the potential loss of jobs with a transition to renewable energy. Graham responded by calling for a \"basic, living universal wage to all people\", while Sedgman asked who was eligible to have these jobs in the first place \"due to the current mandate conditions\". King said the demand for fossil fuels was running out, with trading partners setting targets of net zero emissions by 2050. She underlined the \"really good jobs in renewables\", and emphasised the need to start now in training people for new, good-paying renewable jobs, as otherwise these workers wouldn't get jobs again. \nBarnes stated the Greens had announced A$19 billion over ten years with the aim of transitioning communities affected by a move away from fossil fuels, they would aim for renewables running the power system by 2030, and they would run retraining programs and maintain existing incomes for \"up to a decade\" if workers cannot find \"equally lucrative\" jobs. Barnes emphasised the need to not vilify those working in mining communities, and a plan must be in place for these communities to maintain their dignity.\nThe forum concluded with representatives from Environment Victoria in the local area invited to present copies of an open letter calling for \"faster and fairer climate action\", and which was signed by 125 people. Among other things, the letter called for a replacement of \"coal, oil and gas with clean energy\", \"a national plan to slash climate pollution this decade with strong targets that, at a minimum, match our trading partners\", and an accelerated rollout of renewable energy projects with the aim of creating \"a healthy, prosperous economy while ceasing new energy generating projects from fossil fuel sources\"."}

Victims were transported to three different hospitals. Two men were immediately pronounced dead, and another died of his injuries. Three people are listed in serious condition and another four suffered minor injuries.\nThe shootings started at a pub on Dizengoff Street where five victims were reported. Others were shot on J. L. Gordon Street and in the nearby area. Shin Bet security forces killed the alleged gunman after a shootout near a mosque in the southern Tel Aviv neighborhood of Jaffa. The suspect was identified as a 29-year-old Palestinian man from Jenin, a city in the north of the West Bank.\n\nSpeaking at HaKirya on Friday, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett offered his condolences to the families of those killed on behalf of the nation and wished for the full recovery of the wounded. He said the perpetrator was not a member any organization but had received help and weapons. \"Those who aid and abet terrorists need to know that the price they will pay is too high to bear\", he said.\nBennett claimed there were celebrations in Jenin after the news of the attack. \"I saw the father of the terrorist inciting to more violence and being proud of his son the murderer,\" he said. \"We, as a people and a state, will all need patience and strong nerves, and to be alert. But above all we need great faith in the justice of our cause in this land.\"\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement: \"We are closely following developments and will continue to be in regular contact with our Israeli partners, with whom we stand resolutely in the face of senseless terrorism and violence.\" \nThere were several attacks in Israel in the month of March, including a shooting in Bnei Brak, just east of Tel Aviv, which claimed the lives of five people."}

Susan Collins (Maine), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) broke ranks with their fellow Republicans to cast votes for Jackson. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the vote. Had there been a deadlock, she would have cast a tiebreaking vote.\nJackson and President Joe Biden watched the proceedings from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. Biden nominated Jackson on February 25 to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. In 2020, Biden promised while running for President to nominate a African American woman to the Supreme Court, the country's highest. Presidential nominations are required to be confirmed by the Senate.\nOn March 21, Jackson was introduced to the Senate by Thomas B. Griffith, a former judge on the Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C.  During her opening remarks, Jackson said: \"My parents taught me that unlike the many barriers that they had to face growing up, my path was clearer, so that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in [the US] I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.\"\nShe closed with: \"Members of this committee, if I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and this grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years. During this hearing I hope that you will see how much I love our country and the Constitution and the rights that make us free.\"\n\nOn the second day of confirmation hearings, Senator Josh Hawley (Republican; Missouri) challenged Jackson on child pornography cases over which she had presided. He questioned a three-month prison sentence handed out by Jackson in United States v. Hawkins where the prosecution had sought two years imprisonment. Federal Sentencing Guidelines recommended eight years in the case, based on the number of images. Jackson responded that she disagrees with the current guidelines, arguing they fail to differentiate defendants, and are contentious by the Sentencing Commission.\nJackson explained: \"Congress has given the judges not only the discretion to make the decision but required judges to do so on an individualized basis taking into account not only the guidelines but also various factors including the age of the defendant, the circumstances of the defendant.\" The defendant in the case was eighteen years old.\nOn the third day of the hearings, Jackson was pressed on how to apply Constitutional provisions written over two hundred years ago, to current issues. Jackson responded: \"It’s a process of understanding what the core foundational principles are in the Constitution, as captured by the text, as originally intended, and then applying those principles to modern day.\"\nSenators Lindsey Graham (Republican; South Carolina) and Ted Cruz (Republican; Texas) continued a line of questioning from Tuesday on light sentences which led head of the Judiciary Committee Senator Dick Durbin (Democrat; Illinois) to intervene numerous times on Jackson's behalf. While Durbin said Jackson was being interrupted, he was accused of filibustering in the nominee's favor.\nOn the fourth and final day of the hearing on March 24, Durbin announced the Judiciary Committee would meet on March 28, potentially setting up a vote on Jackson for April 4. That day, Jackson herself was not present on March 24 as the Senate heard testimony from other parties, such as Wade Henderson, president of nonprofit group the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Henderson said of Jackson: \"Her background is absolutely extraordinary and her demonstration and mastery of the law is second to none.\"\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (Republican; Tennessee) requested access to confidential pre-sentencing reports in Jackson's past child pornography cases. Reports of this nature are confidential to protect the victims. Durbin refused, saying: \"I would not want that on my conscience, that we did this for some political exercise here, which I think is totally unnecessary, and someone was harmed as a result of it. I'm going to resist it every step of the way.\"\nOn April 4, the Judiciary Committee voted 11-11 on Jackson, a deadlock broken by a vote called by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) which sent it to the Senate floor.\nPrior to her nomination, Jackson served as a clerk for Breyer, a federal public defender, a federal district court judge and a member of the sentencing commission, as well as an attorney in private practice.\nThe Supreme Court has eight associate justices and one chief justice."}

It carries a very painful history, and it is offensive.\" The Romani, or Roma, have faced considerable prejudice in Europe and North America.\nThe 57 people from the Project assigned to this species took comments from the general public and examined more than 200 suggested names. \"Spongy moth,\" from the French spongieuse, was proposed in January. The \"spongy\" refers to the sponge-like appearance of the egg masses that harbor the animal's eggs through winter.\nIt also matches the common names given to this animal in other languages: \"sponge-spinner\" in German and \"sponge-knitter\" in Turkish.  According to CNN, the animal is most likely to spread to new areas during its egg stage, as they travel from being laid on firewood or vehicles.\n\nThe spongy moth is native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, but is a highly destructive invasive species in North America.  It first reached the continent in 1869.\nThe caterpillars are brown in color and covered in spines and blue and red spots.  They can eat the leaves off a tree until bare of foliage.  Altogether, spongy moth caterpillars have defoliated 1 million acres of North American trees per year since 1980.\n\"They basically, like The Very Hungry Caterpillar, are just chewing their way through deciduous forests,\" Jessica Ware of the Entomological Society of America reports, citing a children's picture book. \"'Spongy moth' is already beginning to appear in media stories and other online resources, which we're excited to see. But we know this name change won't happen overnight,\" she said.\n\"Particularly in books or print products, or regulations related to L. dispar, phasing in use of the new name may take some time. ESA will continue to provide supporting resources for organizations adopting this change.\"\nThe Entomological Society of America is the world's largest professional organization for insect scientists."}

While less severe than a 'black' listing, which includes Iran and North Korea, it could damage the UAE's business-friendly reputation.\nIt may also subject the regime to unfavourable rate adjustments, higher costs for transactions and increased competition with fellow Gulf state Saudi Arabia. An International Monetary Fund report published May 2021 found grey-listing resulted in an average negative impact of 7.6% of a country's GDP, which would be USD27.3 billion of the UAE's 2020 GDP.\nParis-based watchdog the FATF says grey-listing means \"the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies\". A November 2021 follow-up to a 2020 evaluation concluded progress had been made in four areas; the UAE is considered \"compliant\" or \"highly compliant\" in 36 of forty recommendations.\nIn 2018, the country passed a federal decree on money laundering to ensure compliance with international organisations, and has since dedicated four specialised courts toward prosecution. The UAE also formed an Executive Office to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in December 2020. However, the FATF urges improving risk management in certain industries and facilitating domestic and international investigations and prosecutions against money laundering.\nThey also recommend proactive investigation to identify suspicious transactions and sanctions evasion in its economy.\n\nThe Executive Office said: \"The UAE will continue its ongoing efforts to identify, disrupt and punish criminals and illicit financial networks in line with FATF’s findings and the UAE’s National Action Plan\". It also pledged \"close coordination with our international partners\". Former UAE Foreign Affairs Minister Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter the UAE remains \"resolute in strengthening strategic cooperation with our partners to address this global challenge\".\nKatherine Bauer, senior Fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, criticised the UAE's \"inherent vulnerabilities to illicit finance due to its role as a regional commercial and financial hub\". The former United States Treasury official added the changes needed are not those \"that can happen overnight\".\nIn 2016 the UAE was named in the Panama Papers leak as \"home to a thriving trade in financial secrecy\" by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The leak implicated numerous Emirati officials in suspicious dealings, including Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is connected with a cybersecurity firm accused of espionage.\nThe ICIJ called the sheikhdoms \"a center for financial crime\". It cited: \"Mass surveillance and the monarchy's firm grip on the courts and media make it difficult to challenge the system or expose suspect business dealings\". Jodi Vittori, a Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was quoted as saying: \"the U.S. seems to have turned a blind eye to [the UAE's] role in the facilitation of illicit finance, conflict minerals and organized crime.\"\nThe decision to grey-list the UAE was made at the sixth plenary session of the FATF under a German presidency from March 2nd to 4th. Zimbabwe was removed from increased monitoring, and the organisation concluded France had a \"robust and sophisticated\" framework with room to improve."}

However, in her stepping-down speech she concluded Khan \"no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue\", adding the mayor had left her \"no choice but to step aside\".\nKhan placed Dick \"on notice\" from February 2 to reform the police service, the day after a report on police conduct was released. The February 1 report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concluded \"disgraceful\" incidents of bullying, discrimination, misogyny and sexual harassment. She survived a number of scandals from 2019, after she was accused, and cleared of \"deliberately [misleading] the public\" over the inconclusive Operation Midland investigation.\nHowever, recent criticism centred around \"institutional corruption\" in the force, which Dick denies. It also involves racist, sexist, homophobic and Islamophobic remarks by some of its constables at Charing Cross railway station between 2016 and 2018. The February 1 report found that of the fourteen officers investigated for disparaging and sexist messages in two WhatsApp and one Facebook groups, nine remain serving. Additionally, two were promoted from constable to sergeant.\nThe force was also criticised for its belated investigation into Partygate, a number of gatherings held at Downing Street despite Covid-19 restrictions. Sources told The Guardian there was despondency in the Greater London Authority and Home Office over the Met's scandals, which some view as partially resultant from Dick's \"defensiveness\".\nIn a statement, Khan said he was \"not satisfied with the commissioner's response\" to his demands for \"change I believe is urgently required to rebuild the trust and confidence of Londoners in the Met\". He added reform was necessary \"to root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exists.\" Khan found an initial meeting with Dick after the report surfaced was inadequate; she resigned ahead of another meeting.\n\nThere is also discontent over the Met's handling of Sarah Everard's murder by Met officer Wayne Couzens. Four people attending a vigil in her honour last year were arrested for breaching Covid-19 restrictions. Furthermore, the force faced ridicule in October after informing women fearing an approaching officer to call 999. Otherwise, \"shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down\" were advised. This was accompanied by a new strategy against sexual violence and the formation of a dedicated unit against predatory offenders.\nBoth the Met and the government launched separate inquiries into the force's handling of Everard's murder. The independent government review is headed by Baroness Louise Casey.\nIn December, two constables were jailed for 33 months after taking and sharing photos on WhatsApp of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman. Their mother Mina Smallman rejected an apology by the force, accusing it of racism and \"dehumanising our children\".\nIn the earlier Radio London interview, Dick, then adamant she would not resign, said \"enough is enough\", adding she was \"seething angry\" about the February 1 report. She encouraged she be held to account, saying \"it's a big job\", but she was \"doing her best\". She maintained the Met was \"hugely capable in so many ways. However, she acknowledged its reputation has been tarnished by the \"awful [findings in the report] and also some other awful things that have happened and come to light in the last several months\".\nWhile she led a \"real transformation\" as commissioner to tackle bad behaviour in the Met, \"I'm not complacent\". She maintained \"there could be and probably will be, over the coming months, some more examples which will be embarrassing or disgusting because we will be rooting them out\". BBC correspondent Lauren Moss said while the Met had issued many apologies in the past, this was the first to come from Dick herself.\nReactions to Dick's resignation were mixed. Former IOPC superintendent and Met officer Nursit Mehtab told the i Dick stepping down was part of the radical action needed to combat a \"sub-culture\" of sexism and racism. Mehtab added: \"The level of violence against women being expressed in [the Facebook and WhatsApp] messages damages the trust women and girls have in the police.\"\nAlastair Morgan, brother of the murdered PI Daniel Morgan, told The Guardian \"since [first interacting with Dick in 2012] all she has done in relation to my family is just delay, obstruct and disappoint on a huge level\". While \"it is a shame that we are seeing another commissioner disappear under a cloud of smoke, it is necessary.\" The sentiment was shared by activist organisations Reclaim These Streets and Sisters Uncut. Ricky Waumsley, whose partner Daniel Whitworth was one of the four targets of serial killer Stephen Port, was \"glad\". He said: \"I held Cressida accountable for [Met] failures and made a statement that she should ‘resign with immediate effect’.\nCalls remain to institute long-lasting change. Ruth Davidson of charity Refuge said \"one resignation at the top doesn’t mean the police have solved their misogyny problem\" and called for \"root and branch reform\" across the UK. Mehtab said \"This is not just a few ‘bad apples’ which is a term that the Met keeps using to deflect criticism\" for its behaviour. Journalist Robert Verkaik alluded the present scandals facing the force to the 1970s police corruption investigation Operation Countryman, which resulted in hundreds of Met officers resigning or retiring, and eight prosecutions.\n\nHowever, Dick found support in the chair of the Met Foundation Ken Marsh, who said she \"should have been given the opportunity and the necessary time to build back trust in the Metropolitan police service.\" Khan, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Dick for her service. Johnson, former London mayor currently under investigation for his involvement in Partygate, said Dick \"served her country with great dedication and distinction\".\nKhan promised to work closely with Patel to appoint a new commissioner \"so that we can move quickly to restore trust in the capital’s police service while keeping London safe.\" Dick will continue serving in a caretaker capacity before a successor is decided.\nDick joined the force as a constable in 1983, and headed the anti-gang Operation Trident in 2003. As head of Operation Kratos following the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Dick was investigated but cleared of \"personal culpability\". She became the first female commissioner on February 22, 2017 after working in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office from 2011, earning a salary of GBP230 thousand.\nThe i understands Khan is proud of Dick's record against violent crime, although the number of teenagers killed in London last year reached its highest level since 2008."}

Paramedics performed CPR on the teenager before loading him into an ambulance. He died while being transported to Westmead Hospital. The 16-year-old suffered stab wounds to his leg and is undergoing treatment.\nA 15-year-old boy was arrested at the show and was taken to Auburn Police Station for playing a small role in the stabbing, according to police. He appeared in a juvenile court and was granted bail on charges of affray, carrying a knife in public and being armed with intent.\nStrike force detectives are still trying to track down others involved in the stabbing. They believe the stabbing was not a random attack, and instead was a planned confrontation between two groups.\nThe carnival's adult section was closed to allow forensics teams to inspect the area.\nThe show's manager Murray Wilton denied claims that event security failed. He said it was impossible to check the bags of all attendees, and they had decided to carry out random bag checks instead.\nEvent organisers have promised full refunds will be offered for people who no longer wish to attend the show.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison gave his condolences and said: \"All our kids will be going to the Royal Easter Show.

{"title": "Court finds UK allowed undervalued Chinese imports into EU", "content": "Friday, March 11, 2022 \n\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Tuesday the United Kingdom neglected its obligations as a former European Union member by allowing \"undervalued imports of textiles and footwear from China\" to enter EU markets.\nThe European Commission argued HM Revenue and Customs \"failed to fulfil its obligations\" under EU law by collecting insufficient customs duty and value-added tax payments for Chinese clothes and shoes imports from 2011-17. In 2017, over half of such products were found by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to be imported below \"the lowest acceptable prices\".\nThe lowest acceptable prices are a risk assessment tool introduced by OLAF to detect \"imports presenting a significant risk of undervaluation\". OLAF informed member states of the chance for \"extreme undervaluation\" by shell companies, including during bilateral meetings with the UK over 2015 and 2016. Despite this, the ECJ found British authorities did not utilise the metric for its monitoring operations in 2011 and 2014.\nAs a result, it did not conduct \"appropriate customs controls\", allowing the products \"free circulation in the internal market\". As an example, fraud investigators in 2017 found women's trousers from China were declared at €0.91 per kilogram, €0.53 below the market price for cotton. The Commission estimates this cost the EU budget €2.68 billion (~$2.9 billion) from 2011-17, as 80% of customs duties go toward funding the EU's budget.\nHowever, the ECJ denied the Commission's request the UK provide such a sum as repayment, citing inconsistencies with its full amount calculations which meant it had not met the \"requisite legal standard\". The UK remains under ECJ jurisdiction for infractions made during its EU membership even after leaving the EU in January 2020. The UK was ordered to pay four-fifths of legal costs Brussels incurred since OLAF first alleged misconduct in 2017.\nThe UK can challenge the fine, but not the result from the judgment. The fine amount €2.68 billion is up from the original €1.99 billion in lost duties uncovered from a sophisticated fraud ring. However, while today's sum was taken from 2011-17, the investigation initially focused on evidence from 2013-16 in the ports of Felixstowe and Dover, England.\nAt the time, a representative for then-Prime Minister Theresa May said the sum was \"not a bill. It's an estimate\" and \"we don't recognise the figures.\"\nThe Luxembourg-based court concluded the British government failed \"to apply effective customs control measures or to enter in the accounts the correct amounts of customs duties\". It added the \"inadequate nature of the checks carried out by the United Kingdom customs authorities\" allowed fraudulent shell companies to move their operations to the UK. \nThe ECJ concluded the UK had also failed \"to provide the Commission with all the information necessary\" to make its own calculations.\nThe UK remained opposed to the EU's methods against calculating undervalued goods, and was supported in doing so by Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia. Of them, Portugal, Slovakia and the UK, as well as Malta and Spain, were found to have \"major undervaluation hubs\" in the first month of OLAF's 2014 Operation Snake.\nBritish ports, specifically Dover, were found to be the main entry points for Chinese goods before clearing European customs and being trafficked across the continent. Bruno Collin, head of a French anti-fraud operation in 2016, lamented to Politico Europe the unhelpfulness of British authorities. He said only \"extremely vague answers\" were given to French requests, if they responded at all.\nWhen OLAF first reported on the UK's \"continuous negligence\" to combat fraud, HM Revenue told Politico Europe it boasted an \"excellent record in tackling fraud and rule breaking of all kinds\". Collin, however, concluded: \"They don't make an effort.\""}

Katter also referred to the coming federal election, saying \"in the context of the election, there are social issues on which we need to put a stake in the ground.\"\n\nQueensland Sporting Minister Stirling Hinchliffe opposed the motion, calling it a \"blatant dog whistle\", and saying: \"This is not a debate about sport or women's rights. It is an attempt to cause fear and division and is unnecessarily dragging an extreme right-wing trope into this parliament.\" Hinchliffe expressed that \"making blanket decisions purely based on gender identity is not only draconian and bigoted, but unwarranted\". \nRepresentatives from all parties but the LNP spoke in the debate, which lasted for approximately 30 minutes. Sparking interjections from other MPs, KAP Hinchinbrook MP Nick Dametto speculated that \"we may see an opportunity for guys who now identify as women to put on a wig and jump into women's sport because maybe they are washed up at the NRL\", and stated that transgender people having \"full access\" to female sports was neither fair nor safe. One Nation MP Stephen Andrew spoke in favour of the motion, asserting \"if someone does not stand up for the rights of these people — either way — the outcome is that there will eventually be no women's sport at all.\"\nThe two Greens representatives spoke against the motion. Amy MacMahon, who represents South Brisbane, claimed \"this motion today is not about women; it is about stoking up transmisogyny for cheap political tricks\", and said \"if we are really serious about supporting women’s sports, let's pay women's sportspeople the same as men, show women's sports on free-to-air TV and news coverage and start programs to encourage women and girls to take up sports.\" Greens leader Michael Berkman called the motion \"repugnant\" and \"unnecessary\", and stated: \"I think it is telling that we are hearing not a single word from the opposition to speak against it.\""}
{"title": "Ten-year Tennessee study shows preschool associated with poorer student performance", "content": "Friday, February 11, 2022 \n\nA team led by Dale Ferran disputed the idea that prekindergarten benefits children in the long term in a paper recently given advanced publication in Developmental Psychology.\nThe team followed 2990 low-income children from Tennessee, United States, who applied to attend the state's free public preschools. The study was a natural experiment, as entry is decided through a lottery, rather than merit-based system. Scientists then recorded the students' academic and personal achievements as they left preschool for kindergarten through sixth grade nearly ten years later.\nResults showed while pre-K graduates initially appeared better prepared for school, their peers who had not caught up with them. By the time students finished second grade, those who hadn't attended preschool were outperforming the ones who had. The gap widened: sixth graders who had not attended preschool had fewer disciplinary issues, a lower rate of absenteeism, and were less likely to require special education services. There was no disparity for dropping out between the groups.\nIn 2015, Bill Haslam, then Governor of Tennessee, asked if quality of the preschool classes was the issue. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University's National Institute for Early Education Research agreed, identifying several mistakes the state had made in establishing new preschools, notably the lack of quality control, meant there was no way to tell what the teachers were doing in class.\nAll preschool classes in the study were taught by licensed teachers in the same buildings as public schools for older children.\nA similar study on Boston, Massachusetts schoolchildren published in 2021 showed that preschool was associated with better academic and disciplinary outcomes, contradicting Farran's conclusion.\nFarran speculated the abnormal results in her study were due to the level of control and discipline among teachers. Most of the Tennessee preschool teachers had been certified for pre-K through fifth or eighth grade, meaning only a fraction of their training had been specifically for students aged under five. Because the preschools were part of greater public school buildings, students spent much of the day being escorted or herded from their own classrooms to bathrooms or cafeterias, where their movement and sound levels were controlled.\nIn 2022, World Population Review ranked Tennessee at 38 out of the 50 US states for quality of K-12 education.\nPresident Joe Biden's Build Back Better Plan includes greater funding for early child education."}
{"title": "UK clarifies foreign, domestic response to cost of living crisis", "content": "Monday, March 14, 2022 \n\nWikinews received clarification earlier this month from the United Kingdom Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) regarding the government's response to the cost of living crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe UK anticipated Russian action against Ukraine for several months, and has coordinated a response with NATO and the European Union. Many \"swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions\" promised in January were imposed after the Russian invasion began in February.\nThey now include \"financial, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions\" to urge Russia \"to cease actions which destabilise Ukraine, or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\" Most recently, it includes a commitment made by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng Tuesday to phase out Russian oil and natural gas in the UK by the end of the year.\nThe announcement came the same day United States President Joe Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian oil, coal and gas.\nHowever, a UK government spokesperson told Wikinews: \"We cannot have a cliff-edge where oil and gas are abandoned overnight. Turning off the taps would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and we would be even more dependent on foreign imports.\"\nThe European Commission was more cautious, planning to cut Union dependence on Russian imports by two-thirds this year, before ceasing altogether \"well before 2030\". But whereas Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas, much of the UK's energy is produced domestically.\nThe spokesperson contrasted the British situation with that of the EU: \"Our single largest source of gas is from the UK Continental Shelf and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway.\n\"There are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK with Russia. Imports from Russia made up less than 4% of total UK gas supply in 2021.\n\"Ministers and officials continue to engage constructively and regularly with energy intensive industries and our priority is to ensure costs are managed and supplies of energy are maintained.\" \nA government FAQ published February 25 adds the UK has three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, while Germany has none. The fact sheet urged \"European countries on the continent reduce their reliance on Russian gas both through alternative supplies, including the global [LNG] market\".\n\nA press release from Tuesday specifically named Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, and called the invasion \"illegal\". The spokesperson said: \"We continue to monitor the impacts that Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is having on the cost of living in the UK, so we keep our approach under review.\"\nThe release asserted Russian oil \"is already being ostracised by the market\". And in any case: \"In a competitive global market for oil and petroleum products, demand can be met by alternative suppliers. We will work closely with international partners to ensure alternative supplies of fuel products.\"\nBut high inflation, already associated with the rising cost of petrol, has seen prices rise in all key areas. Before the Russian invasion, the Bank of England forecast inflation to rise to about 7% in spring, from 5.4% last year. And economists cited by The Guardian reportedly project inflation to rise to almost 8% next month.\nConsultancy firm The Centre for Economics and Business Research more than halved its growth expectations for 2022 from 4.2% to 1.9% Tuesday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said the £9 billion package by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak \"would now offset only about one fifth of the rise in household energy bills.\"\nThe government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the concerns people have about the cost of living, which is why we have set out a generous package of support worth around £21bn including a £150 council tax rebate from April and a further £200 energy bill discount in October - cutting energy bills quickly for the majority of households.\"\nThey added: \"We are already providing support to families worth around £20 [billion] this financial year and next, including cutting the Universal Credit taper to make sure work pays, freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down, and providing £9.1bn to support 27 million households with their energy bills.\"\nAs hinted, all measures were introduced prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24.\n\nOn February 3, it was announced those in England in Council Tax bands A-D would get £150 off their council tax payments. It was also announced there would be a £200 discount on all Britons' energy bills in autumn. The £200 would be repaid automatically over the next five years, which Leader of the Opposition Sir Keir Starmer likened to a loan.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) Wednesday, he derided Sunak for proposing \"a forced £200 loan for every household paid back in mandatory instalments\".\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson defended the government for their £20 billion support package, calling the measures \"unprecedented\". He added he plans to set \"out an energy independence plan for this country in the course of the next few days to ensure that we undo some of the damage of previous decisions taken\".\nSunak announced changes to Universal Credit and the continued freeze of fuel levies during his autumn budget statement on October 27. The amount withheld workers making above the worker allowance threshold per pound was reduced from 63 pence to 55 pence. It follows the UK government's cancellation of a Covid-19 uplift of £20 per week to Universal Credit in early October, which cut the income of six million claimants by £1040 per annum.\nThe fuel duty was frozen twelve years ago and has not been lifted since. It is estimated to save motorists £1900.\nThe statement also included a \"radical simplification\" of alcohol duties, reducing the taxable bands from fifteen to six and suspending a planned hike at a £3 billion loss to HM Treasury. This was encouraged by many organisations, including the British Beer and Pub Association.\nEven so, the measures have been criticised as too meagre to address the reality of the situation.  Ahead of Sunak's spring statement slated for March 23, Conservative MPs have pressured the Chancellor to consider new measures. A source reportedly told The Guardian officials in HM Treasury are weighing options; publicly, they state \"There’s only so much that can be done, and we’ve never seen oil prices where they are now.\"\nAnalysts warned Britons from February 24 household gas and electricity bills could reach £3000 per year. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced it would lift a cap on default energy tariffs by 54% to £1971 from April.\nThough oil prices stabilised to below USD120 per barrel Wednesday, Brent Crude briefly reached a 2008 high of $147.50 per barrel and remain substantially higher from before the Russian invasion. To minimise the effect this will have on British consumers, Sir Keir pushed for nuclear power, renewable energy and home insulation at PMQs.\nJohnson defended his record on renewables, calling the UK \"the Saudi Arabia of wind power\". The UK spokesperson told Wikinews \"It’s the right thing to do to move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas across Europe and this means looking at more nuclear and much more use of renewable energy.\"\n\nHowever: \"Companies and skilled employees right across the UK’s gas sector are working to maximise production through this winter, helped by several small new wells and fields that have come online in recent months and edged production up.\" The example Wikinews raised over the Abigail oil field in the North Sea, which was greenlit for development by an Israeli firm on February 2, was not addressed. At the time, the director of the Oil and Gas Authority told Sky News oil and gas will remain a source of British energy for decades.\nThe government spokesperson continued: \"The issues we are facing are a result of high international gas prices rather than supply, and further UK oil and gas licensing is unlikely to have a major impact in the short term.\"\nThe Labour Party has urged a windfall profits tax to be imposed on excess profits made by major fossil fuel companies, including BP and Shell plc. Both companies reported historic profits for 2021 in February. BP saw profits of $12.8 billion from -$5.7 billion in 2020, and Shell $19.3 billion from $4.85 billion in 2020.\n\nAfter BP's announcement, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves tweeted \"The chancellor’s energy plans last week left families more worried than ever. It’s time for Labour’s plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut bills.\" However, when pressed at PMQs, Johnson urged a \"a sober, responsible approach.\". He said: \"The net result of [a windfall tax] would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to [divest] from dependence on Russian oil and gas.\"\nThe UK government spokesperson told Wikinews: \"A windfall tax could deter £14 billion worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry.\n\"Oil and gas companies in the North Sea are already subject to a tax rate on their profits that is more than double those paid by other businesses. To date, the sector has contributed more than £375 billion in production taxes.\n\"We keep all taxes under review but we do not comment on speculation about tax changes.\n\"The UK Government places additional taxes on the extraction of oil and gas, with companies engaged in the production of oil and gas on the UK Continental Shelf subject to headline tax rates on their profits that are currently more than double those paid by other businesses. To date, the sector has paid more than £375 billion in production taxes.\"\nThe government is also criticised for its plan to retrofit homes with poor insulation. In March last year, the government's flagship green homes grant was scrapped, having only installed 5800 energy efficiency measures.\nThe government spokesperson responded: \"We are investing almost £6.6 billion to support the installation of energy efficiency measures in low energy performance homes including older properties with low income home owners and tenants.\n\"The Heat and Buildings Strategy set out a comprehensive package of measures we are taking to kickstart the transition to low-carbon heat and build the market for heat pumps. This includes investment in a new £450 [million] Boiler Upgrade Scheme, the £950 [million] Home Upgrade Grant and the £60 [million] Heat Pump Ready research programme.\""}

However, public opinion changed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine: in a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson last month, Marin said the nation would decide on whether to apply for NATO membership \"within weeks\". A Yle poll from this week showed 76% support among Finns for joining the military alliance.\nThe joint statement from Niinistö and Marin read in part: \"now that the moment of decision-making is near, we state our equal views, also for information to the parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland's security.\" The two leaders added their hope that \"the national steps still needed to make this decision\" would be made \"rapidly within the next few days\".\nA reply from Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs read: \"Helsinki must be aware of the responsibility and consequences of such a move\", and Russia would have to take \"retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop threats to its national security arising\".\nThe announcement from Niinistö and Marin was made a day after a co-operation agreement was signed that pledged the United Kingdom to defend Finland and Sweden in case either was attacked. In a press conference to announce the deal Wednesday, Niinistö said that Russia was \"ready to attack a neighboring country\", and that if Russia were to be concerned about Finland joining NATO, he would respond \"you caused this, look in the mirror.\"\nThe Social Democratic Party of Finland, led by Marin, is likely to announce their position on NATO membership tomorrow. Politico reported the party was \"almost certain to favor membership\". It would then be possible for Finland to join the alliance as soon as Monday. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary-General of NATO, has previously stated the military alliance would welcome both Finland and Sweden, and that he expected an accession to be fast and without complications. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said on Thursday that a Finnish entry into NATO would have Estonia's \"full support\", adding \"we support a rapid accession process.\""}

The koala was previously considered a vulnerable species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) still lists it as one in the rest of the world.\nSome link the decline in koala population with previous natural disasters in the country, especially the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season. The bushfires had \"killed, injured or affected\" 60 thousand of the animals, according to WWF-Australia. This, along with droughts, urbanization and habitat destruction, had contributed to the drop in population. Efforts to prevent the koala's extinction have also been announced by the government.\nA report in April 2020 indicated the decline of koala populations in eastern Australian states since 2001 reached 50% in Queensland and 62% in New South Wales. In that month, WWF-Australia, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and Humane Society International (HSI) proposed the IUCN change the species' category. It has been designated 'vulnerable' for a decade.\nA New South Wales inquiry in June 2020 predicted the extinction of the koala could occur by 2050 without appropriate prevention measures.\n\nIn her announcement, Ley said these events \"have led to the advice\". Ley has also stated actions to protect the species are being planned: \"There is still time to save this globally iconic species if the uplisting serves as a turning point in koala conservation. We need stronger laws and landholder incentives to protect their forest homes.\"\nAccording to Ley, AUD 74 million (USD 52.9 million) have been funded to back these decisions.\nSome conservation groups have expressed their disapproval. President of the Australian Koala Foundation Deborah Tabart argued the species is also endangered in Victoria and South Australia, and blamed the federal government for continuing to \"approve\" the animal's habitat loss.\nHSI campaign director Alexia Wellbelove advised the government to adequately address the country's environmental problems. Wellbelove defended the decision should be reviewed by former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, who concluded a year ago that the government didn't take the appropriate steps for conservation and proposed a change in environmental standards."}

{"title": "GSK rejects three Unilever bids to buy consumer healthcare arm, says unit was \"fundamentally undervalued\"", "content": "Sunday, January 16, 2022 \n\nUnited Kingdom-based pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) confirmed January 15 it had rejected three \"unsolicited, conditional and non-binding proposals\" by Unilever to acquire its Consumer Healthcare division, including one bid of GBP50 billion in value made on December 20, believing Unilever \"fundamentally undervalued\" the business and its potential.\nNews that Unilever attempted to buy GSK Consumer Healthcare for 50 billion pounds, split between GBP41.7 billion in cash and 8.3 billion in Unilever shares, was first reported by The Sunday Times, and subsequently confirmed by both companies. Had the latest acquisition offer gone through, it would have been the largest deal since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and one of the biggest ever among companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nA deal would likely mean integrating the GSK division into Unilever's own beauty and personal care business, which has seen profit margins struggle under Covid-19 lockdowns and higher costs for plastics and petrochemicals.\nA brief response on the Unilever website confirmed it \"had approached GSK and Pfizer about a potential acquisition\", and adds GSK Consumer Healthcare \"would be a strong strategic fit\" as the company looks to rework its portfolio. GSK indicated the proposals were \"carefully evaluated\" by its board of directors, but unanimously rejected under the conclusion they \"were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders\" and \"failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential\".\nThe Sunday Times have indicated the latest deal did not include an acquisition premium or recognition of corporate synergies; the joint venture between GSK and healthcare firm Pfizer, which holds a minority stake in the company, was initially projected to generate GBP500 million in cost savings by this year and realise \"substantial cost synergies\". The BBC's business editor Simon Jack wrote that a standard takeover premium would be about 30%, but could be reduced over the GBP10 billion in debt GSK was predicted to \"leave on the books\", of the GBP22 billion net debt GSK reported for Q3 2021.\n\nThe deals were assessed by the Board respective of a proposed demerger of GSK Consumer Health into a separate PLC in the middle of this year. Jack wrote GSK \"always\" had \"an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.\" Unilever did not take into account the standard takeover premium, the value of cost savings and Board confidence Consumer Health could deliver \"superior organic sales growth\" of between four and six per cent in the medium term. This was despite valuations of about GBP50 billion by Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts, and a lower GBP45 billion valuation by Jeffries Group.\nThere are no current talks between Unilever and either Pfizer or GSK, and the Unilever statement reads: \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\" Under CEO Alan Jope, Unilever has focused its investments and marketing on brands which \"communicate a strong environmental or social purpose\" by streamlining its holdings in items like beauty products and tea. Jope previously said Unilever would concentrate on smaller takeovers in industries like luxury beauty and wellness.\nHowever, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told the BBC this would be a \"high risk deal\" at a time investors are cautious about GSK's performance, but also a time of rising inflation he says encourages \"consumer goods with loyal customers\". Mould added despite strong cashflow, Unilever had recently missed targets on sales and profit margins, putting pressure on the CEO.\nPressure by activist shareholders Elliott Management Corporation and Bluebell Capital Partners have also mounted against GSK CEO Emma Walmsley over the unit's failure to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and Walmsley's own lack of scientific experience. GSK has been involved in the ongoing development of a Covid-19 vaccine with French biopharmaceutical company Sanofi, and announced preliminary results from Phase 3 trials last month.\nIn 2018, Unilever bought several consumer nutritional products from GSK, including its flagship product Horlicks, and merged its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever, with GSK Consumer Healthcare India."}

Protesters demanded that the government keep abortion legal and accessible.  Earlier this month, Politico published a leaked draft of a US Supreme Court decision showing that a majority of justices on the nine-judge panel were planning to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that rendered the procedure legal throughout the US.  Protests took place in Atlanta, Chicago, New York and other cities.  There were an estimated 20,000 marchers in Washington D.C. alone.\n\"It's only the most important issue there is right now because if the leaked opinion becomes the final opinion,\" said Ann Hoffman, who attended the protest in Washington D.C., \"it could affect all kinds of rights — not just the right of choice but the right to health care.\" Hoffman, 79, claimed to have been advocating for women's rights since the 1970s.\nA few dozen anti-abortion-rights counter-protesters also came to Washington D.C. that day.  One, 24-year-old Anna Lulis of Virginia, held a sign reading \"women's rights begin in the womb.\" Police kept the two groups from approaching each other, but there were some clashes.\nIf Roe v. Wade is overturned, the legality of abortion will revert to individual states.  The Guttmacher Institute predicts that 26 of the nation's 50 states are \"certain or likely\" to ban abortion.  Many states have already passed \"trigger laws\": abortion bans that will go into effect automatically if Roe v Wade is overturned.\nThe leaked draft opinion covers Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which appeared before the Court last December.  The state of Mississippi had passed a law forbidding almost all abortions after 15 weeks.  This was based on the idea that a 15-week old fetus may be capable of surviving outside the woman's uterus, such as in an incubator. The common understanding is that a fetus cannot do this until 24 weeks.  Through its agent Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion.  Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only abortion clinic remaining in the state, argues that there is no reason for the Court to do this.\nEarlier this week, members of the US Senate attempted to pass a federal law declaring abortion legal throughout the country, which would have overruled any state laws, but it failed to get enough votes to pass.  The efforts stalled on Wednesday.\n\nDespite Roe, many states within the US had passed laws limiting abortions or making them more difficult to get, for example by mandating waiting periods that necessitate that the patient take an extra day away from work.  More recently, the state of Texas had passed a law limiting abortion to the first six weeks after the last menstrual period.  At that time, many women do not yet know they are pregnant.\nUnited States President Joe Biden has advised the American people to vote for pro-abortion-rights candidates in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections."}

It said: \"Economies across the world have been affected by higher than expected global energy and goods prices, leading to increased costs across supply chains which are affecting both businesses and consumers.\"\nThe delay of the ban on multibuy deals would last until October 2023. Due to delays in implementing the Health and Care Bill 2021, the advertising ban is postponed until January 2024. Restrictions on the placement of such products in stores, at checkouts and on supermarket websites and apps will enter into force from October 2022, as planned.\nCampaigner and chef Jamie Oliver called it \"a wasted opportunity\" that \"starts to erode the whole obesity strategy\". He urged \"real leadership\" from Prime Minister Boris Johnson \"to give young people a healthier and fairer future\".\nOliver was joined by Barbara Crowther of the Children's Food Campaign and Graham MacGregor, cardiologist and campaigner at Queen Mary University of London.\nWhilst Public Health Minister Maggie Throup said \"we're committed to doing everything we can to help people live healthier lives\", her Labour counterpart Andrew Gwynne called it a reversal.\n\nThe press release read: \"Addressing obesity remains a priority for government, and will reduce the strain put on the NHS as it works to tackle the COVID-19 backlogs.\" Media, Data and Digital Minister Julia Lopez cited spending £550 million \"to level up access to sport and physical activity right across the country\" as evidence of determination \"to tackle childhood obesity\".\nGwynne argued: \"Johnson’s desperation to cling onto his job means the ideology of Conservative MPs is being placed above children’s health [...] Instead of cutting childhood obesity, preventing ill-health and easing pressure on the NHS, this chaotic government is performing another U-turn.\" \nThe Independent wrote of backbench Conservative MPs having reportedly criticised the deal as evidence of a \"nanny state\".\nJohnson is reported to have made the decision after leading a ministerial meeting on the cost of living Wednesday. The Times reported ministers told him of the cost the bans would have on the food and advertisement agencies. Further, The Guardian and The Independent wrote of rumours the government could simply axe the restrictions, some of the toughest in the world. MacGregor said \"Johnson could have left a legacy of being the first prime minister to address obesity in a meaningful way\", but \"he has given in to his own MPs, and an aggressive food industry, who, ironically, were starting to comply\".\nWhen first announced in November 2020, 800 food and drink manufacturers, including Britvic and Kellogg's, called the ban on junk food advertising \"disproportionate\", adding \"the evidence base underpinning these proposals is lacking in both detail and efficacy\". Kellogg's last month sued the government over the restrictions on product placement in prime locations in stores.\nThe Food and Drink Federation said the delay \"makes sense\" in response to \"high inflation\", though the Children's Food Campaign argues multibuy deals do not save consumers money, but instead increase junk food purchases. Figures published on Friday indicate two in five Britons are buying less food as the Bank of England warns inflation could top 10% this year.\nThe press release promised a public consultation on TV and paid-for online adverts in the next weeks.\nBroadcasters could lose over £200 million in annual revenue if the ban on junk food advertising past watershed hours goes ahead.\nThe government touted its calorie labeling laws passed last month, and measures taken to help alleviate the cost of living. The Department also promised the publication of a Health Disparities white paper and launch of a Better Health: Rewards scheme to address obesity."}
{"title": "Hungary extends fuel price cap", "content": "Wednesday, February 16, 2022 \n\nOn Saturday, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced a three-month extension of a price cap on standard motor fuels in Hungary. The cap came in to effect on November 15 and would have ended on Sunday. The government hopes to undercut inflation and help the economy with this move, but does not indemnify petrol stations for their losses. A general election is scheduled for April 3, for which all opposition parties currently in Parliament but one have united to beat the ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance, which is now in its twelfth year in tenure.\n\nOrbán announced the extension in his annual speech, claiming \"the 'price-stop' proved to be effective in this case too, so we will extend it for an additional three months.\" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍Az árstop itt is bevált, ezért három, további három hónappal meghosszabbítjuk. The official gazette, Magyar Közlöny, published the corresponding government resolution No. 39/2022 a day later. A week earlier, deputy finance minister András Tállai said to news agency MTI that tax authority checks on over 2000 fuel stations had found no recurring price cap violations but 12 violators were fined a total of HUF3.2 million (USD10140). \"The stations are operating in line with the rules set, which is reflected by the fact no recurring violations have occurred in the past three months.\" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍A kutak azonban betartják a szabályokat, ezt igazolja többek között az is, hogy ismételt jogsértés az elmúlt csaknem három hónapban nem történt., Tállai added.\nOrbán said \"we have the fifth lowest fuel price [in the European Union]. We pay 480 [Hungarian] forints [per liter, but] without the 'price-stop' we would pay well over 500 forints.\" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍Az üzemanyag ára nálunk az ötödik legalacsonyabb. Ma 480 forintot fizetünk, árstop nélkül jóval 500 forint felett járnánk. Price-aggregator site holtankoljak.hu put uncapped prices to HUF512 for gasoline, and HUF530 for diesel, and reported that wholesale prices have exceeded consumer prices since February 4. Based on the price aggregator's data, Napi.hu reported three stations had closed permanently in the first week of February because of the price cap. By law, the government can appoint new operators for closed stations.\nOn November 10 the government had decided to introduce the HUF480 (USD1.52) price cap, and then briefed the press about it the next day. The official gazette published the related act, government resolution No. 624/2021, on the day of the announcement. The follow-up resolution No. 626/2021, published on November 13, detailed the procedure. The cap applies to unleaded 95 and standard diesel, and does not cover liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or premium fuels, but stations have to sell premium fuels at this price, if they do not sell standard ones.\n\nIn effect, the losses are incurred by petrol stations as they cannot negotiate wholesale prices. During the November 11 press briefing, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Gergely Gulyás said they do not plan to compensate for these losses, but added \"vendors cannot be forced to vend\" ((hu))Hungarian language: ‍kereskedőt kereskedelemre kötelezni nem lehet. The following day, the Hungarian Petroleum Association's secretary general Ottó Grád told ATV that owners of small, independent stations may think about closing. In contrast to the press briefing, the detailed resolution dictates that petrol stations cannot close temporarily or shorten their opening hours.\nThe government does not plan to reduce tax rates on fuel. The oil bulletin of the European Commission showed last week that out of the total consumer price in Hungary, 47% is tax for unleaded 95, and 45% is tax for standard diesel.\nCumulative data for 2021 by the Hungarian Petroleum Association shows that volume-wise unleaded 95 makes up for 79% of all gasoline, and standard diesel makes up for 88% of all diesel sales in the country. Between 2020 and 2021, year-on-year consumer prices for November 8 went up from HUF332 to 506 for unleaded 95, and from HUF341 to 517 for standard diesel, according to price-comparison site holtankoljak.hu. 444.hu reported that the worsening HUF-USD exchange rates caused prices to climb even in July, when crude oil prices were dropping.\nThe Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported inflation hit 7.9% in January. In his speech announcing the extension, Prime Minister Orbán claimed the fuel price cap lowered inflation by 0.5%."}

{"title": "Scientists announce decoy-proof Ebola antibodies", "content": "Saturday, March 19, 2022 \n\nFindings published Thursday in Cell reveal the development of a new antibody treatment for the deadly disease caused by the Ebola virus and its relatives. \nScientists from the United States-based La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) and National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified two antibodies, 1C3 and 1C11, that can attack Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus.\nThere are currently no vaccines or antibody cocktails available to treat ebolaviruses other than Zaire ebolavirus. LJI President and CEO Erica Ollmann Saphire said: \"Finding antibodies with this breadth is important because we don't know which virus in the genus of ebolaviruses is going to break out next.\"\nOf the six ebolaviruses known to science, the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses are the two most deadly: the 2010s outbreak that killed eleven thousand was caused by the Zaire virus.\nThe new contribution made in this paper is that scientists used the imaging technique cryogenic electron microscopy to observe how and where the antibodies interact with the viruses.\nThe team saw that 1C3, instead of binding to the target site on the viral glycoprotein in the typical molecular lock-and-key fashion, stuck itself sideways across the glycoprotein, blocking three binding sites at once. Antibodies work by binding to pathogens and neutralizing their antigens.\n1C11 works by interfering with the molecules that the virus would use to enter a cell.  Because the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses use very similar mechanisms, 1C11 is effective against both.\nAccording to the research team, the primary advantage that these two antibodies have over others is that they are resistant to cross-reactivity.  When some viruses enter the body, including the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, they produce excess glycoprotein and release it into the area like a smokescreen. This causes many of the body's antibodies bind to this glycoprotein instead, as many as 90 percent of them.  1C3 and 1C11 do not; they bind only to the real virus.\nThis means that antibody treatments based on 1C3 and 1C11 are likely to be effective at much lower doses than other treatments, as early experiments have already shown:  One treatment has already been tested in non-human primates, and even the lowest doses used were 100 percent effective.  This also means the human treatment might be much cheaper to produce than expected.\nAccording to LJI, treatment based on these two antibodies would offer two advantages over existing treatments.  First, patients with undiagnosed species of Ebolavirus can be treated with an antibody cocktail that is effective against more than one virus.  Because doctors don't always have time to figure out which virus a patient has, this could save many lives.  Second, these antibodies would be effective in patients with later stages of the disease.\nThe experiments were conducted using samples donated to Emory University by two Ebola survivors."}

The ruling against the Russian invasion of Ukraine was opposed by Russia and China.\nUkraine filed the case on February 26, two days after the Russian invasion began. Russia justified the incursion as a special military operation to protect Russian groups in Eastern Ukraine from genocide, which Ukraine says is unfounded. During the hearing, Russia insisted \"it was acting in self-defense\".\nUkrainian representative to the ICJ Anton Korynevych demanded \"Russia must be stopped\". Ukraine said the United Nations Genocide Convention doesn't permit invasion as defense against genocide, and denied committing or planning any such acts.\nThe court ruled in Ukraine's favor.

The scientists found that teeth from the closely related elephants, or even two tusks from the same individual, often surfaced in different shipments that transited through the same ports. The data also showed when criminal networks shifted their operations from between port cities. They inferred poachers were making kills, then separating the tusks at some point along the smuggling route.\nThe team had been studying DNA analysis on poached tusks for years: in 2018, they found two tusks from different shipments had come from the same animal, which indicated both shipments were from the same kill and transited by the same criminal network. This is the first report of DNA identification tusks that came from elephants in the same families.\nLead author Dr Samuel Wasser said: \"Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly — year after year — and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network.\" He added: \"This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports.\"\nWasser said similar studies will provide law enforcement groups access to a greater range of evidence with which to prosecute poachers and their criminal partners by providing verifiable links between different caches of captured ivory. The researchers concluded in their paper that law enforcement could use their information to discern the ways in which poachers are collaborating.\nHumans have used the ivory from elephant tusks to make art, decorations, and tools since prehistory. Many countries have since outlawed the sale of ivory, but poachers continue to kill tens of thousands of elephants each year.\nThe paper's authors were from the University of Washington, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Kenyan-based organisation SeeJ-Africa, the Kenya Wildlife Service, and Singapore's National Parks Board."}

The statue, officially the \"Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt,\" depicts Roosevelt riding a horse flanked by a Native American and an African American at either side on foot.\nThe statue had stood at the steps of the museum since 1940 as a tribute to the former president who the museum notes \"as a devoted naturalist and author of works on natural history\".\nThe museum requested the statue be removed in June 2020 following global protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The museum said: \"the statue itself communicates a racial hierarchy that the Museum and members of the public have long found disturbing.\"\nThe request for removal was supported by former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Roosevelt's great-grandson Theodore Roosevelt IV and the New York City Public Design Commission (NYCPDC). The NYCPDC resolved to remove and temporarily store the statue.\nThe New York Young Republican Club has defended the statue. Club leader Gavin Wax told Fox News in 2020: \"this was about a cultural revolution engulfing our nation.

The AFP warned that price gouging could attract a five year term of imprisonment and a AUD66,000 fine.\nUnder Australian law, price gouging occurs where an individual or business purchases a rapid antigen test kit from a retailer and then sells it for more than 20% of the purchase price. It does not apply to businesses who purchase kits from wholesalers. The AFP has power where it suspects price gouging is occurring to seize test kits and send them to the national medical stockpile.\nThe AFP said in a statement that it has commenced two investigations in New South Wales and Queensland, and expects more to follow. Investigations will be coordinated by Taskforce LOTUS, which was formed by the AFP in 2021 in response to threats surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The taskforce will refer allegations of price gouging to strike teams which are deployed Australia-wide.\nAFP Assistant Commissioner Crime Command Nigel Ryan warned that the AFP would have zero tolerance for profiteering from rapid antigen tests.\n\"The AFP will use its full powers to crack down on RAT price gouging. Not only is price gouging of RATs unethical but it is illegal, and the AFP will use its significant resources to ensure it protects the public from the unlawful greed of others,\" Assistant Commissioner Ryan said.\n\"Commonwealth and state agencies are working together on this issue, and under Taskforce LOTUS, the AFP makes no apologies for upholding the law to help keep Australians safe.\"\n\"Those who breach the law face penalties of up to 5 years’ jail or a AUD66,000 fine. My message is clear. Do not risk jail time or a significant fine for a few extra dollars.\"\nOn Monday, the ACCC said it had received 1800 reports from consumers since 25 December, with claims tests were sold as high as AUD500 for two on online marketplaces and AUD70 per test at convenience stores. \"At the extreme end, we have received reports or seen media coverage of tests costing up to $500 for two tests through online marketplaces, and over $70 per test through convenience stores, service stations and independent supermarkets, which is clearly outrageous,\" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.\n\"There are several businesses that have repeatedly come to our notice thanks to the information provided by the public.

Griffin was acquitted on a charge of disorderly conduct in the same ruling.\nGriffin is one of hundreds of Americans charged with crimes associated with the storming of the Capitol building on January 6, 2021 while Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence were counting the electoral ballots from the November 2020 United States presidential election. This is the second trial associated with these events, and it is the first bench trial.\nGriffin, a founding member of Cowboys for Trump, had been charged with entering a restricted area and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. Prosecutors led by Senior Assistant U.S. Attorney Janani Iyengar argued that Griffin had climbed over a wall and temporary staircase to get into the Capitol building.  McFadden said, \"All of this would suggest to a normal person that perhaps you should not be entering the area.\" The case against Griffin also included video and testimony from another participant in the attacks.\nThe judge went on to note, \"The defendant is never seen engaging in the kind of property destruction or physical violence seen in the government's montage\" of the crowd that entered the Capitol. He also said that, because none of the statements Griffon made that day specifically asked others to perform acts of violence, they counted as free speech and not as disorderly conduct.\nGriffin's lawyers argued that the Capitol did not have any signage reading \"do not enter.\"\n\nMcFadden's decision sets a precedent, the Capitol was a restricted area on January 6, 2021 because it was protected by the United States Secret Service, who were there guarding Vice President Pence.  Griffin's lawyers argued that, because Pence had been evacuated to a secure underground area below the Capitol, the building itself did not count as restricted when Griffin was there.  This is the first time that Pence's location during the attacks was made public.\nGriffin is the first of the January 6 defendants to go through a bench trial. In U.S. courts, defendants have the right to trial by jury but may choose to be tried by only a judge if they wish.  The only other January 6 accusee to stand trial so far, Guy Reffitt, was tried by a jury earlier this month and found guilty on five counts.\nOutside the courthouse, Griffin told the media \"I wear January 6 like a badge of honor\" and claimed that the United States government had set up the people who stormed the Capitol. Griffin is scheduled for sentencing on June 17, 2022.  \nJudge McFadden was appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump.\nOn January 6, 2021, a large group of protesters met in Washington D.C. for a rally in support of then-President Donald Trump. Trump had repeatedly claimed that he, not Joe Biden, had really won the 2020 election.

It was adopted as a national flag in 1995, however copyright remained with Thomas. The flag could not be used without his approval or compensation.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised the flag would be treated in a comparable way to the national flag, which can be used by anyone so long as it is displayed in a \"respectful and dignified way.\"\nMorrison promised: \"All Australians can now put the Aboriginal Flag on apparel such as sports jerseys and shirts, it can be painted on sports grounds, included on websites, in paintings and other artworks, used digitally and in any other medium without having to ask for permission or pay a fee,\"\n\"We’ve freed the Aboriginal Flag for Australians.\"\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt said: \"Over the last 50 years we made Harold Thomas’ artwork our own — we marched under the Aboriginal Flag, stood behind it, and flew it high as a point of pride,\"\n\"Now that the Commonwealth holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and no-one can take it away.\"\nThe commercial arrangements surrounding the flag were highlighted in 2019 after one of the clothing companies holding a licence for the flag, WAM Clothing, gave notices to the National Rugby League and Australian Football League, alleging jerseys worn at their Indigenous round infringed upon their copyright. At the time, Wyatt urged football fans to show their objections to the claim by clothing themselves in the flag. It is understood several other organisations were given similar notices.\nUnder the agreed deal, the government paid A$20.05 million to Thomas and licence holders to secure copyright and buy back the rights of licence holders.

We're going to be celebrating that we can fly our flag, and wear it on our shirts.\"\nWhile Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe welcomed the news, she was wary about the deal, saying: \"I’m concerned that the Commonwealth owns the copyright over our flag and what that means for the unceded sovereignty and the self-determination of our people [...] We need to have genuine conversations about what it means for the Commonwealth to own the copyright of our flag and if any other models of community ownership were seriously considered. For the moment, this is a win.\"\nLabor Party Senator Malarndirri McCarthy said she would be scrutinising the deal during the Senate's forthcoming budget estimates: \"I look forward to scrutinising this deal and examining the details through Senate Estimates next month, in particular the copyright and custodianship of the flag\".

The scare stopped Coveney mid-speech as he addressed guests at the John and Pat Hume Foundation, and forced over twenty-five homes to evacuate.\nPolice say between nine and ten in the morning, a white Vauxhall van was hijacked near to Shankill Road. Its driver, allegedly while having his family threatened by two gunmen, was forced to transport what was believed to be explosives. He first drove to a nearby street, where the device was placed inside the vehicle. He then drove to the Holy Cross Chapel beside the Houben Centre where Coveney was speaking.\nCoveney was reportedly minutes into his speech at the \"Building Common Ground\" peace-building event before being pulled away, according to priest Gary Donegan, who spoke before him. Security informed Coveney of the bomb threat and he was evacuated to a \"secure location\" by the PSNI and Gardaí.\nThe driver was described by attendee Sarah McKinley from Downtown Radio and Cool FM as a \"workman, clutching a toolbag standing outside\". He was in tears, apologising to guests at the venue after he told security. McKinley said the victim was \"completely shellshocked\" and \"said he had been hijacked and told to drive to the Centre.\"\nMcEwan said the victim was being treated in hospital but said nothing of his condition. He told of the circumstance the driver was placed in: \"Just think about this: the victim believed at this point he was driving a van containing a live bomb — and that his family were being threatened.\"\nAccording to McEwan, a security threat remained in Northern Ireland and \"an attack is likely\". However, he did not comment on whether the weapons used to threaten the driver were real, only that at the time, the danger felt real. Nor did he say whether Coveney was the target or in need of additional security. Coveney had previously, along with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, been depicted in loyalist graffiti.\nA source told The Irish Times loyalists blame Irish ministers, including Coveney and Varadkar for feeling undermined by the contentious post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. The Irish Independent says the hoax was related to the Protocol, and planned in advance.\nIt comes after the United Kingdom counter-intelligence agency MI5 lowered its terrorist threat assessment for Northern Ireland from 'severe' to 'substantial' Tuesday. At the time, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis said it reflected \"the significant progress that Northern Ireland has made, and continues to make, towards a more peaceful, more prosperous and safer society.\" But he added vigilance is still needed against the \"minority\" who threaten the peace.\nPoliticians in Ireland and the UK condemned the attacks. Coveney himself said he was \"saddened and frustrated that someone has been attacked and victimised in this way\", referring to the driver.

They plan to hold virtual discussions with Native American groups before recommending replacement names to the Board on Geographic Names later this year.\nThe 13 members of the Derogatory Names Task force includes individuals from the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, and Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Civil Rights.\nThe word in question, \"squaw,\" comes from the Algonquian word for \"woman,\" but over the centuries it has become an insulting term for Native American or First Nations women. United States Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland had the term officially declared derogatory last November.\n\"Consideration of these replacements is a big step forward in our efforts to remove derogatory terms whose expiration dates are long overdue,\" said Haaland. \"Throughout this process, broad engagement with tribes, stakeholders and the general public will help us advance our goals of equity and inclusion.\" Haaland is the first Native American to serve in the U.S. Cabinet.\nThe geographic sites are located in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, California, and seven other states. This is not the first step in the movement to remove this term from place-names.  Some time ago, a ski resort near the California-Nevada border renamed itself \"Palisades Tahoe\" in a move commended by the Washoe people: \"The word itself is a constant reminder of the unjust treatment of the Native people, of the Washoe people,\" Darrel Cruz of the Washoe Tribe Historic Preservation Office said last summer. \"It's a constant reminder of those time periods when it was not good for us. It's a term that was inflicted upon us by somebody else and we don't agree with it.\" \nThe task force plans to accept comments from the public both by mail and through the site Regulations.gov."}

{"title": "Italian President Sergio Mattarella re-elected for second term, ending successor row", "content": "Saturday, January 29, 2022 \n\nThe incumbent President of Italy Sergio Mattarella was re-elected for a second seven-year term yesterday in the eighth round of voting for a potential successor.\nAged 80, Mattarella repeatedly expressed his desire to leave the position, including renting an apartment in Rome in anticipation of a move from the presidential Quirinal Palace (Quirinale). However, he relented after key figures, including Prime Minister Mario Draghi, urged him to stay on for the \"stability\" of the Republic. His first term was set to expire on February 3.\nParliamentarians who went to Quirinale to ask him to remain quoted Mattarella as saying \"I had other plans, but if needed, I am at your disposition\". Seven rounds of fruitless voting to determine a successor involved an electoral college of 1009 \"grand electors\". They comprise 321 Senators, 630 Members of the Chamber of Deputies (MPs) and 58 regional delegates.\n\nReuters characterised the Parliament's failure to rally around a compromise candidate as leaving \"deep scars, with potentially dangerous repercussions for political stability\" in the Draghi-led party coalition. Reuters added there was \"loud and prolonged applause\" in the Chamber of Deputies when Mattarella did break the two-thirds majority needed to secure re-election. He won with a total of 759 votes.\nParty leaders' statements issued yesterday were generally in favour of Mattarella staying in power. Matteo Salvini, leader of anti-migrant party Lega per Salvini Premier, said \"Italians don't deserve more days of confusion\". He confirmed \"President Mattarella at the Quirinale and Draghi at the government\". Draghi was himself a candidate who was \"tipped for the job\" according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). He said after the election it was \"splendid news for Italians\" and he was \"grateful to the President for his decision to go along with the extremely strong will of Parliament\".\nSalvini, who Euronews says is eyeing the role of Prime Minister, expressed his desire for Mattarella to continue serving yesterday evening. \"We think that it isn't serious any more to continue with 'no's' and cross vetoes\", he said. He thus believed the time was right to \"tell the president to reconsider\". None of the candidates he endorsed received the requisite majority of votes after being \"rejected by the left\". Mattarella also gained post-election support in messages by Enrico Letta, who heads the centre-left Democratic Party and Minister of Health Roberto Speranza, who leads social democracy party Article One.\nFormer Prime Minister, president of centre-right party Forza Italia and presidential candidate Silvio Berlusconi also endorsed Mattarella, around whom he said \"[u]nity today can only be found\".\nHowever, the decision was sharply criticised by Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right opposition party Brothers of Italy. Meloni said in a statement \"Parliament has shown it is not fit for Italians\". Accusing allies of \"bartering away\" the role of the presidency, she called for the bloc to be \"re-founded\". Meloni tweeted last evening \"I would be surprised if #Mattarella agreed to be re-elected after having repeatedly rejected this hypothesis.\" She instead favoured Draghi to take the office. This course would leave the Prime Minister's seat vacant and potentially invoke early elections.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, leader of Parliament's largest party the populist Five Star Movement told reporters \"Mattarella is the guarantor of everybody, impartial, authoritative\". Conte resigned as Prime Minister in 2021 over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThough mostly ceremonial, the President is charged with appointing the Prime Minister and dissolving Parliament, which the BBC says means the office \"takes on great power during times of political crisis\". This comes in the context of intense fragmentation in Italian politics that means governments typically survive about a year.\nMattarella was praised for his role in ending the brief 2021 Italian government crisis by appointing the broad coalition of parties headed by Draghi. Draghi, an independent who was president of the European Central Bank during the European debt crisis, was tasked to remedy the worst economic disaster Italy has faced in decades. Wolfango Piccoli of advisory firm Teneo told Reuters: \"The overall political backdrop has become less supportive for Draghi's government, which is facing a daunting task in the year or so left before the next general election.\"\nBBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen wrote parliamentarians' choice to re-elect a hesitant incumbent would \"be seen by critics as an embarrassing show of Italy's political divisions\". There were calls for Italy to elect its first female president or someone younger (although candidates must be over 50). Their failure to do so was thus symbolic of \"the lack of imagination of [Italian] MPs to think beyond the status quo.\" Support for Mattarella was reportedly the only thing most MPs agreed on, Forza Italia national co-ordinator Antonio Tajani said in a BBC interview.\n\nMattarella, seen as a traditional but quiet and unassuming President according to Reuters, was first elected in 2015. He had previously served as Minister of Public Education, Minister of Defence, Deputy Prime Minister and judge of the Constitutional Court. He additionally served as MP for two decades. His father helped found the Christian Democracy party, while his brother Piersanti Mattarella served as President of Sicily before being assassinated in 1980.\nOther candidates for the post indicated by the AFP last week included former Prime Ministers Giuliano Amato and Paolo Gentiloni and former Chamber of Deputies President Pier Ferdinando Casini. Female candidates included current and former Ministers of Justice Marta Cartabia and Paola Severino and Senate President Elisabetta Casellati."}

For its expected five- to ten-year service life, it is to study the most distant, and therefore the earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang.\nDuring its journey, dubbed \"30 days of terror\" by Sky & Telescope, the telescope successfully unfurled its 21-foot (6.4 meter) wide mirror, deployed its sunshield and cooled down to below 50 degrees Kelvin as it traveled to the L2 Lagrange point.\n\nL2 is a secure location for spacecraft where the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth is balanced. Full scientific operations are slated to begin later this year and will involve 13 teams of scientists. The primary mission is to find the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang to help study the origins of the Universe. The nominal mission time is five years, with a goal of ten. The location of its orbit is very different to its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits much closer to Earth. James Webb's instruments will face away from the Sun, giving a greater clarity to the images it will obtain compared to Hubble.\nAn Ariane 5 launch vehicle carried the telescope up on December 25 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, after arriving in October. The launch date was delayed by a week due to unfavorable weather.\nThe United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began project development in 1996, planning for a launch in 2007 at a cost of USD550 million. After NASA contracted Northrop Grumman to build the telescope, mission managers estimated a 2010 launch would cost between one and 3.5 billion USD. Redesigns to reduce technical requirements pushed launch plans to 2013 for an estimated cost of USD4.5 billion. The US Congress ordered a project review in 2010 which delayed the launch again to 2015.\nFor an estimated cost of USD6.5 billion, the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies proposed canceling the telescope altogether in 2011. After a plan was made for a 2018 launch at a cost of USD8.8 billion, technical errors found in the telescope and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the launch date to 2021."}

Evans said that unless the adviser, currently Lord Geidt, is allowed to scrutinise ministerial conduct independently, \"suspicion about the way in which the ministerial code is administered will linger.\"\nEvans wrote in a blog article published on gov.uk that the Committee proposed code infractions be tied to a series of graduated sanctions, rather than the \"all-or-nothing approach\" that gave past prime ministers unease.\nHowever, he continued, the government's reforms include the variable penalties whilst retaining the requirement investigations into the code are contingent on the Prime Minister's approval. Evans wrote the graduated sanctions, specified to be either a public apology, fine or request for resignation, was \"part of a mutually dependent package of reforms, designed to be taken\" alongside greater autonomy for the ethics adviser.\n\nFile:Boris Johnson birthday toast.jpg\n\nJohnson dismissed Geidt's remarks there was a \"legitimate question\" over whether Johnson's receiving a fixed penalty notice for breaching Covid-19 restrictions in June 2020 constituted an infraction. In a letter Tuesday, the Prime Minister wrote: \"taking account of all the circumstances, I did not breach the code\", and in clearing the parliamentary record \"followed the principles of leadership and accountability\".\nGeidt criticised the \"circular process\" that \"could only risk placing the ministerial code in a place of ridicule\", and reportedly considered resigning Tuesday. He said he told Johnson's advisers the PM \"should be ready to offer public comment on his obligations under the ministerial code\" to no avail.\nEvans agreed, elaborating \"an adviser who believes their advice will be rejected will simply not put forward advice at all, with the precedent already established that this will lead to the adviser’s resignation.\"\nConservative Party MPs have continued to submit letters of no-confidence to the 1922 Committee headed by Sir Graham Brady. A compilation by the BBC on Wednesday counted 28 MPs of the 54 MP threshold who have publicly urged Johnson to resign, though some may not have submitted letters. Those listed are diverse: they include past ministers, committee chairs and backbenchers on either side of the Brexit debate. The Independent said at least thirty wanted the PM out.\nOne of the most recent rebel MPs, Simon Fell for Barrow and Furness, Scotland wrote to constituents: \"It beggars belief that when the government was doing so much to help people during the pandemic, a rotten core with an unacceptable culture carried on regardless of the restrictions placed on the rest of us\".\nAnother, Caroline Dinenage for Gosport expressed no-confidence with the remark that Johnson \"has stated that measures have been put in place to achieve [systemic change], but until I see real evidence of leadership that is listening and changing, I’m afraid I am not prepared to defend it\".\nFrontbench ministers accused breakaway Tories of doing \"the opposition's work\", according to culture minister Nadine Dorries. Home Secretary Priti Patel said focussing on dissenters is \"a sideshow, quite frankly, rather than focusing on the real challenges\", telling fellow MPs to \"forget it\".\nJohnson overruled the judgment of Geidt's predecessor Sir Alex Allan when he concluded Patel had \"not consistently met the high standards expected of her\" in 2020. In response, Sir Alex stepped down, acknowledging \"it is for the Prime Minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code\" but adding \"I feel that it is right that I should now resign\".\nAssociate director for the Institute for Government Tim Durrant told The Guardian: \"The fact that behaviour and propriety have been such an issue for this government has really exposed the limits of the code, and of Lord Geidt’s role.\""}
{"title": "Scientists discover seagrass off Australia is world's largest plant", "content": "Friday, June 3, 2022 \n\nScientists at the University of Western Australia published a study Wednesday suggesting that a seagrass off the coast of Western Australia is the world's largest plant. The Posidonia australis is thought to have begun to clone itself 4,500 years ago, and covers about 200 square kilometres (77 square miles). It is located in Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Western Australia. Shark Bay was submerged relatively recently, within the past 8,500 years.\nThe scientists discovered the plant was a single organism after taking 18,000 separate genetic markers to examine the seagrass to find samples to use in restoration projects. However, they discovered the same plant had cloned itself many times instead. Dr Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, said “We thought 'what the hell is going on here?'... We were completely stumped.\" Jane Edgeloe, one of the co-authors of the research, said the DNA of the samples was compared and it was discovered from this that the seagrass meadow was a single plant.\nThe plant is around three times the size of Manhattan, and measures at least 180 kilometres (112 miles) in length. As well as being the world's largest known plant, it is the world's largest known clone. The seagrass greatly surpasses the 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States, previously thought to be the world's largest plant. The seagrass grows a maximum of 35 centimetres per year, with its large size helping scientists calculate its age.\nDr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, said the plant's survival was helped by it holding onto all the chromosomes from both its parents. This gave it genetic diversity, which is unusual among plants that produce asexually. The plant does not sexually reproduce; however, subtle variations in its DNA may help explain its longevity.\nAssociate Professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the study but is an expert on seagrass. She said seagrass tends to live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, meaning the plant's age of about 4,500 years fits into the normal age range of seagrass. McMahon also said she was confident in the method used by the researchers, and that the finding it was a single plant was \"amazing\".\nDespite the plant's vast size, in the past ten years, almost a tenth of it has been destroyed by cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which NBC News noted had been attributed to climate change. The bay has relatively high salinity and its temperatures vary from as cold as 15 °C (59 °F) to as hot as 30 °C (86 °F)."}

She will serve the remainder of Young's term until the November midterm elections, which Palin and Begich intend to challenge.\nPeltola became the first Democrat to hold the seat since Begich Sr. was presumed to have died when his plane disappeared in 1972. Analyzing the results, CNN reporter Eric Bradner wrote Palin's defeat \"sure to add to Republicans' growing concerns\" in attempting to regain control of the House. However, FiveThirtyEight analyst Nathaniel Rakich identified Palin as a \"very flawed\", controversial candidate less likely than Begich to win against Peltola in a head-to-head matchup.\nAfter Peltola's win, Palin claimed that the outcome was a result of the ranked-choice voting system, calling it \"crazy, convoluted, and confusing\". Meanwhile, Begich congratulated Peltola but claimed that \"a vote for Sarah Palin is in reality a vote for Mary Peltola\" since \"Palin simply doesn't have enough support from Alaskans to win an election.\""}

He was elected pontiff on Pope Paul VI's passing on August 26, 1978, and was succeeded by Pope John Paul II after he was found dead on September 29. On John Paul I's legacy, Francis said: \"How beautiful is a church with a happy, serene and smiling face, that never closes doors, never hardens hearts, never complains or harbours resentment, does not grow angry or impatient, does not look dour or suffer nostalgia for the past.\"\nIn Catholicism, beatification is the final step before sainthood for the brief-serving pontiff and requires two approved miracles. Last year, a 2011 intercession by two parents of a critically ill Argentine girl was attributed by Pope Francis for her 'miraculous' recovery. Another miracle needs to be approved before he can be made a saint, however.\nThough widely dismissed, the circumstances surrounding John Paul I's death have nonetheless been subject to conspiracy theories after the Vatican initially reported a priest had discovered his body, then corrected it as two nuns. The Church has announced his death was by heart attack, although no autopsy was done.\nStefania Falasca, the deputy postulator behind the push for John Paul I's sainthood and author of several books on the deceased pontiff, called conspiracies \"publicity-driven garbage\". Cardinal and the Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin told Italian television Friday: \"It was a natural death. There is no mystery about it\"."}

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said his team were conscious of \"increased military activity in the area\", but would proceed undeterred. The team's arrival was reportedly delayed by several hours due to shelling in and around the nearby city of Enerhodar.\nEnergoatom, Ukraine's state nuclear power company, said shelling caused the plant's fifth reactor to shut down, leaving one operating. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused the other of sabotaging operations: Kyiv have accused Moscow of shelling the route taken by IAEA inspectors.\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defence accused Ukraine of a failed amphibious assault to wrestle control of the facility early yesterday.\nAccording to Grossi, the team's mission is to \"start immediately an assessment of the security and the safety situation\", to eventually establish a permanent presence at Zaporizhzhia \"to stabilize the situation, and to get regular, reliable, impartial, neutral updates of what the situation is there.\" In Vienna on Wednesday, Russia's IAEA representative said Moscow would welcome such a presence.\nSeveral inspectors, including Grossi, have since left after seeing \"key things\", according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti; Energoatom reports five team members are to remain until tomorrow.

This came after similar announcements by competitors Electric Ireland, SSE Airtricity and Prepay Power.\nThe energy supplier will lift the rate for electricity by an average of 34% and gas by 39% effective October 2, citing an increase in wholesale energy costs that \"leaves us with no choice.\" Standing charges will be unaffected. This means the average customer will pay an extra €579 and €526 per year in electricity and gas, based on an average consumption of 4,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) and 11,000 kWh for electricity and gas, respectively.\nOn the same day, Russian energy giant Gazprom said it would halt supplies of natural gas to Europe indefinitely through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline until a leak is repaired.\nIn March, Bord Gáis raised costs on its 513,000 commercial and residential customers nationwide by 27% on electricity and 39% on gas, while last year it three times hiked rates for electricity and twice for gas. Daragh Cassidy of comparison site Bonkers.ie estimates from this time last year, bills have gone up an extra €1,300 for electricity and €1,000 for gas in total.\nCassidy told RTÉ News \"[the] average gas and electricity bill is now around €4,000. That’s close to the UK price cap of £3,549\", from where over 70% of Ireland's gas is supplied.\nIn a statement, managing director for Bord Gáis Energy Dave Kirwan said the company \"deeply regret[s] having to raise our prices but the scale of increases in wholesale energy costs leaves us with no choice.\" Promising to \"continue to do everything we can to reduce the impact on our customers and keep our rates as competitive as possible\", Kirwan pledged one tenth of operating profits toward an energy support fund in partnership with organisations for those unable to afford the increase.\nA financial report from July 28 for parent company Centrica, based in the United Kingdom, revealed Bord Gáis' operating profits increased 74% from last year in the first half of 2022 to £33 million (€38 million). This was in part due to the resumption of activity from Whitegate power station near Cork.\n\nMounting utility costs put pressure on the government, strengthened by a €6.3 billion surplus collected in the eight months to August, to increase support for families struggling with the cost of living. Speaking after Electric Ireland Thursday lifted residential rates on electricity and gas by 26.7% and 37.5%, respectively effective October 1, the Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the European Commission will \"bring forward emergency provisions to try and deal with the market\".\nMartin attributed the latest to the \"broader exponential rise in energy prices\", and promised a \"demand reduction approach\" to lowering consumers' overall energy use. Concerning financial supports Martin promised \"we will use the Budget and also, in tandem with the Budget, the cost of living package to alleviate pressures on households.\"\nYesterday's record accrual for the Exchequer was bolstered by an unexpectedly high corporate tax intake for August, and double-digit increases on last year for income tax and VAT. Speaking on the figures, finance minister Paschal Donohoe said government \"must strike a balance between protecting the most vulnerable households and firms from a once-in-a-generation energy price shock, while at the same time ensuring that policy doesn’t worsen the inflationary cycle\". \nHe contrasted the stronger economy after the end of Covid-19 restrictions with \"inflationary pressures, resulting from the surge in energy prices from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war\" with Ukraine that \"are eroding real incomes and undermining growth prospects both domestically and in our main trading partners\".\nBut Labour leader Ivana Bacik urged \"an unprecedented, urgent and short term response by government\" in response to what \"is unsustainable for people, families and small businesses\". It includes instating a windfall tax on excess profits by energy companies, which Donohoe said the state is considering, and immediate price caps and expanding eligibility for fuel allowance.\nEuropean Union ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels next week, which Martin said would include immediate action to temper the price of gas and \"a more structured reform of the market over the next twelve months\".\nThe G7 countries, which include EU members France, Germany and Italy yesterday agreed to introduce a price ceiling on Russian oil, likely effective December. Since its invasion of Ukraine began, the Russian government has cut energy supplies to Europe, forcing prices higher and threatening continental blackouts. At the time of Nord Stream 1's suspension of operations the pipeline was supplying one-fifth its daily capacity, according to senior associate Jacob Mandel for energy consultancy firm Aurora."}

On that day, a large crowd of Donald Trump supporters stormed into the United States Capitol to prevent the US Congress from certifying the votes from the 2020 United States presidential election. The charges state the riot was not a spontaneous or impromptu act but rather deliberately planned.\nTarrio has faced other charges related to January 6 before, but today's are the most serious: the charges state Tarrio and fellow Proud Boys Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola criminally conspired to prevent then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking power by helping to organize the riots. All five have pleaded not guilty.\nThe specifics of the indictment say the accused met and planned the attack on the Capitol, sometimes communicating via encrypted messages. Prosecutors claim they obtained Baofeng radios that rioters could use to coordinate without others eavesdropping. They also say, on January 6, members of the Proud Boys broke down metal barricades and led the rest of the rioters inside. Prosecutors claim Tarrio helped plan the siege but did not physically enter the Capitol himself. He had been arrested two days earlier for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner, for which he served five months in prison.\nThe crime of \"seditious conspiracy\" dates to the American Civil War era. If convicted, the accused could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\"Seditious conspiracy requires the use of force, and [Rehl] never used any force nor thought about using any force,\" said Carmen Hernandez, lawyer for Zachary Rehl.\nFederal authorities have accused more than three dozen members of the Proud Boys of leadership roles in the attack on the Capitol. Some have already pleaded guilty or agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\nThe Proud Boys are self-proclaimed \"western chauvinists\" whom the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies as a hate group."}

Prior to this, Johnson also met with the Queen and tendered his official resignation.\nTruss, who was Foreign Secretary until today, defeated former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak yesterday in a vote among party members by a margin of 81,326 to 60,399 and became the leader of the party. Johnson's successor had been in question since he announced his resignation in July amid pressure from high-profile scandals.\nThe United Kingdom is facing surging food and energy costs contributing to an inflation rate forecast to hit 13% in October, the highest in 42 years. Besides the economy, the war in Ukraine and tensions with the European Union are seen as challenges for Truss when she takes office, according to Reuters and Associated Press.\nAfter the party vote, Truss said, \"I will deliver a bold plan to cut taxes and grow our economy. I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills, but also dealing with the long term issues we have on energy supply.\" In further comments, she also told the party: \"I know that our beliefs resonate with the British people: Our beliefs in freedom, in the ability to control your own life, in low taxes, in personal responsibility. I know that’s why people voted for us in such numbers in 2019 and as your party leader I intend to deliver what we promised those voters right across our great country.\"\nIn a brief message on Twitter, Sunak wrote: \"It’s right we now unite behind the new PM, Liz Truss, as she steers the country through difficult times.\"\nJohnson also expressed support for Truss on Twitter, writing: \"I know she has the right plan to tackle the cost of living crisis, unite our party and continue the great work of uniting and levelling up our country. Now is the time for all Conservatives to get behind her 100 percent.\"\nThe opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer was critical of Truss' proposed tax cuts and reductions in levies. \"We've heard far more from the latest prime minister about cuts to corporation taxes over the summer, than we have about the cost-of-living crisis,\" she said."}

It is mainly a symbolic agreement, and serves as a show of unity and cooperation between the two NATO countries. It follows the 2018 establishment of a working group between the two countries with the aim of resolving the dispute, termed the 'Whisky War'.\nThe dispute arose as Hans Island is of a roughly equal distance between Canada's Ellesmere Island and Greenland, a territory of Denmark. It dates to 1971, but the name arose after Canadian troops left the Canadian flag and a bottle of Canadian whisky on the island in 1984. Denmark's Greenland affairs minister Tom Høyem responded by visiting the island, replacing the Canadian flag with Denmark's, and leaving a bottle of Danish schnapps. \nThis developed into a tradition where officials, scientists and soldiers from both Canada and Denmark visited the island to remove the other side's flag, raise their own and leave either Canadian whisky or Danish schnapps for the other side to find.\n\nIn a press release, Canadian foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly called the Arctic region a \"beacon for international cooperation, where the rule of law prevails\".

However, the area shown by the image is only a small portion of the Southern Hemisphere sky. The blended image (at left) resulted from the stitching together of numerous smaller images obtained at multiple wavelengths with far greater depth than achieved by the Hubble Space Telescope, the predecessor to James Webb.\nThe telescope entered its current orbit around the L2 Lagrange point from January 24, about 1,500,000 kilometers (932,057 mi) from Earth, on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun. This followed a month-long journey that began in late December 2021, following years of delays and several cost overruns. For its expected five- to ten-year service life, it is intended to study the most distant, and therefore the earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang.\nDuring its journey, dubbed \"30 days of terror\" by Sky & Telescope, the telescope successfully unfurled its 21 feet (6 m) wide mirror, deployed its sunshield and cooled down to below 50 degrees Kelvin as it traveled to the L2 Lagrange point.\nL2 is a secure location for spacecraft where the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth is balanced. Full scientific operations will involve thirteen teams of scientists. The primary mission is to find the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang to help study the origins of the Universe. The nominal mission time is five years, with a goal of ten. The location of its orbit is very different to the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits much closer to Earth. James Webb's instruments face away from the Sun, giving a greater clarity to the images it will obtain compared to Hubble.\nAn Ariane 5 launch vehicle carried the telescope to space on December 25 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, after arriving at the launch site in October. The launch date was delayed by a week due to unfavorable weather.\nThe United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began project development in 1996, planning for a launch in 2007 at a cost of USD550 million. After NASA contracted Northrop Grumman to build the telescope, mission managers estimated a 2010 launch would cost between one and 3.5 billion USD. Redesigns to reduce technical requirements pushed launch plans to 2013 for an estimated cost of USD4.5 billion. The US Congress ordered a project review in 2010 which delayed the launch again to 2015.\nDue to an estimated cost of USD6.5 billion, the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies proposed canceling the telescope altogether in 2011. After a plan was made for a 2018 launch at a cost of USD8.8 billion, technical errors found in the telescope and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic pushed the launch date to 2021."}

Roske then texted his sister, who advised him to turn himself in.\nIn the affidavit supporting the charge, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said Roske phoned an emergency call center and informed them he had traveled from California to Maryland with the intention of killing Kavanaugh. After waiving his rights, Roske told the detaining officers he was upset about the recent leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion regarding abortion rights, and the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.\nJustice Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by former US President Donald Trump in 2018. He submitted 17,000 pages of material for his confirmation hearing, at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the most comprehensive ever."}

He went on to say that in the worst case, Europe would need to ration its energy.\nSome countries, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Poland have already had their gas deliveries from Russia suspended for their refusal to pay in roubles, and there are concerns the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany may not reopen following maintenance work that started this week.\nLast month, Germany moved to the 'alarm' stage of an emergency plan to deal with gas shortages. Italy has also reported shortages: local energy giant Eni received only half of the gas it requested from its Russian supplier Gazprom last month. Moody’s have warned that both countries would be forced to ration gas supplies if the Nord Stream 1 pipeline does not reopen as scheduled on July 21.\nEurope's natural gas stocks are currently 62.6% full; the European Commission have mandated they should reach at least 80% capacity by November 1. There are warnings achieving this target will be difficult if disruption to the flow of Russian gas continues, including from European Union sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine."}

Opposition members abstained from the vote, leaving the chamber in protest.\nAnnounced by French President Emmanuel Macron last month, the proposed agreement would see North Macedonia agree to modify its constitution to recognise a Bulgarian minority, protect minority rights and banish hate speech, meeting Bulgarian demands. Amending the constitution may prove difficult as this would require a two-thirds majority or 80 votes within parliament and opposition parties with 46 votes between them have said they will not agree to this change, denouncing the proposal as a concession to Bulgaria’s questioning of North Macedonia’s culture, language, and identity. Macron has stressed the deal does not question the existence of a Macedonian language and both he and North Macedonia's ruling coalition have called the proposal a compromise.\nThe proposal has also proved controversial in Bulgaria, where it has been accepted by Prime Minister Kiril Petkov. Petkov's agreement to lift the veto on North Macedonian membership of the EU has been called a \"national betrayal\" by some of his allies, with the Bulgarian government collapsed by a no-confidence vote on June 22.\nNorth Macedonia has been an EU candidate country for 17 years, with approval for membership talks being blocked by Greece and then by Bulgaria. North Macedonia's Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski announced after the deal had been agreed to on Saturday that accession talks would begin on July 19.\nThe deal also clears the way for Albania to begin accession talks, as the EU has linked its progress to North Macedonia's. Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama stated a delegation would travel to Brussels on Monday to start membership talks."}

This came after months of unrest and protests over a devastating economic crisis which saw soaring inflation, blackouts and shortages of many essential supplies.\nWickremesinghe initially offered to resign alongside Rajapaksa; however following the president's exodus he assumed the role of acting president. Wickremesinghe served as prime minister under Rajapaksa, and the BBC reports many view his administration as complicit in mismanaging the economy.\nNevertheless, the transition of power drew relatively few protests. \"He is here — and we will see what his actions are. If we don't get any food, any medicine, we'll be on the streets,\" a former protestor told the BBC.\n\nAnbarasan Ethirajan, writing for the BBC, reported other protesters' disappointment, worrying Wickremesinghe would gradually crack down and forcibly end the protests.

{"title": "Conservationists capture most massive Burmese python in Florida history", "content": "Saturday, June 25, 2022 \n\nMedia reported Wednesday that biologists from the Conservancy of Southwest Florida reported having captured a Burmese python (Python bivittatus) measuring nearly 18 feet (5 m) in length and 215 pounds (97 kg) in weight in the state's Everglades wetlands.\nIt may be the largest member of its species ever found outside its natural range in Southeast Asia.  Another Burmese python measuring 18 feet and 9 inches (5.7 m) was found in 2020, but it only weighed 104 pounds (47.2 kilograms).\nIn a search documented by National Geographic, the team captured the current snake in December 2021 by tagging a male \"scout snake\" named Dionysius with a GPS tracking device and releasing it into the western Everglades.\n\"How do you find the needle in the haystack? You could use a magnet, and in a similar way our male scout snakes are attracted to the biggest females around,\" said wildlife expert Ian Bartoszek, the team's project manager.\nPythons are an invasive species in Florida.  Removing female snakes from the environment before they lay their eggs is the Conservancy's preferred strategy for limiting python breeding.  When the team saw that Dionysius was spending several weeks in one area, they concluded he'd found a sexually mature female and set off to retrieve him.\nIt took twenty minutes of wrestling and three adult humans to carry the snake to a vehicle, in which it was taken to a laboratory in Naples, Florida and euthanized.  Upon necropsy, it was found to contain over 122 healthy but unfertilized egg follicles. \n\nPythons were introduced to Florida in the 1970s, probably by being sold as pets.  While there is a history of individual pet owners illegally releasing exotic animals into the wild after they grow larger than expected, the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also allowed animals from a serpent center to escape to the Everglades and other habitats, where they reproduced in great numbers.\nSince then, they have disrupted the food chain by eating local animals, including endangered animals: the stomach of this snake contained the remains of a white-tailed deer.\nThe state of Florida considers Burmese pythons a threat to native wildlife and sponsors an annual python hunt with USD2,500 as first prize."}

Outside hundreds of thousands of people had gathered in the streets of London to pay their respects to Elizabeth and witness the procession.\nAfter the funeral service, Elizabeth was transported to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle where she was lowered into the Royal Vault, the final resting place of many former British monarchs. Here, the Royal Regalia was removed from the coffin.\nIn the evening, Elizabeth was moved to King George VI Memorial Chapel which is a separate part of St George's. A private family service was held and she was buried next to her husband, father, mother and sister. \n\nElizabeth died Thursday, September 8 at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle, Scotland after a reign of 70 years. The news was announced at 18:30 BST (UTC+1) by a formal notice outside Buckingham Palace. Earlier that day various members of the British royal family had traveled to Balmoral to be by the side of the Queen as doctors said they became concerned for the 96-year-old monarch's health. Elizabeth's husband and Prince Consort, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, died in 2021 at the age of 99.\nElizabeth's eldest son, Charles the former Prince of Wales, automatically became King on her death and will be known as King Charles III. His eldest son, William, inherited the Duchy of Cornwall from his father, whilst retaining his title of Duke of Cambridge. Charles was officially proclaimed as King last Saturday by the Accession Council in a televised ceremony at St James's Palace in London. All living former prime ministers were in attendance.\n\"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother,\" said Charles in a statement. \"I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\"\nJust two days prior, Elizabeth II was still performing her duties as head-of-state as she approved Liz Truss as the new prime minister, succeeding Boris Johnson who tendered his resignation in person to the Queen on the same day.\nTruss called Elizabeth \"the rock on which modern Britain was built\" and \"provided us with the stability and strength that we needed\". She declared Britain to be \"devastated\" by her death. About the new monarch, Charles, Truss said, \"We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'.\"\n\nBorn in London on April 21, 1926 as Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, she was not in the immediate line of succession to the throne. King Edward VIII, however, abdicated in 1936 to Elizabeth's father, King George VI and Elizabeth became heir apparent.\nDuring World War II, Elizabeth began making public statements at the age of 14 with the first being a message to children who had been evacuated. After reaching the age of 18, she served with the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a truck driver.\nIn 1947, she married Philip with whom she had four children:  Charles (1948), Anne (1950), Andrew (1960) and Edward (1964).\nElizabeth's reign was the longest in the history of Britain and the second-longest sovereign monarch of all recorded history.

This polyurethane is already used as a substitute for plastic in foams and shoes.\nThe research team performed their experiments at the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier and Experimental Aquarium.  They cut the polyurethane into cubes similar in size and shape to those naturally formed by EVA plastics.  They wrote that several types of marine bacteria and fungi stick to the polyurethane and break it down to its component chemicals, which they then consume for food.  The polyurethane microbes had already made detectable progress when the scientists checked the samples after four weeks in the water.\n\"Improper disposal of plastic in the ocean breaks down into microplastics and has become an enormous environmental problem,\" said study co-author Stephen Mayfield, director of the California Center for Algae Biotechnology. \"We've shown that it's absolutely possible to make high performance plastic products that also can degrade in the ocean.\"\nHumans deposit roughly 8 billion kg of plastic in the ocean each year, where it can be mistaken for food by marine organisms.  Natural forces break the plastic into the small pieces that we call microplastic, while larger chunks form near-islands, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  By mass, about half the patch is commercial fishing waste, such as discarded nets, but reducing the amount of post-consumer plastic in the ocean would still make a considerable dent in the planet's plastic problem.\nThis type of polyurethane can be used to make flip-flops and parts of other shoes, which make up a large portion of the world's plastic waste."}

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claims Ukrainian forces have taken back 6,000 square kilometers (2,400 square miles) of Ukrainian territory. The U.S. said many Russian soldiers have left Ukraine, as Russia admitted that the front had been broken. While it has been confirmed that over 1,000 people have died, the true figure could be much higher. The Kremlin has refused peace negotiations and stated that Russia will continue to achieve their goals in the special military operation. \nUkrainian forces continued advancing, and, on 13 September, took back Vovchansk, according to Ukraine's border guard services. While not verified, the pre-occupation mayor of Melitopol has said Russian troops had begun to withdraw. Reportedly, if Melitopol is captured, the Ukrainians could disrupt the supply line in the east Donbas region. In the recently recaptured village of Chkalovske, a citizen, Svitlana Honchar, talked about the Russians fleeing: \"They left like the wind. They were fleeing by any means they could.\" However, some were left behind, as she adds, \"They were trying to catch up.\" President Zelenskyy also promised a \"return to normalcy\" for the recent areas that were re-captured. Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar said, Ukraine was trying to get Russian troops to surrender. Ahead of their advance, they threw flyers saying, \"Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t mean anything for them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\nUkrainian officials were also investigating the liberated areas to discover any atrocities and assess alleged war crimes committed by the Russians. In the city of Balakliya, local officials reported that the Russians set up a \"torture chamber\" at the local police station. Allegedly, Russian forces \"always kept at least 40 people captive\" in the area.\n\nNationalism in Ukraine remained strong, as the government released videos of burning Russian flags and the charred tanks left behind. They shot a video of Ukrainians ripping a sign that said, \"We are one people with Russia.\" Other things which were found left behind in liberated territories include purposely damaged weapons and vehicles, especially abandoned tanks.\nOn 25 September, President Zelenskyy released a statement saying the Kharkiv fighting had been fierce, but Ukrainian forces continue to succeed. \"This is the Donetsk region, this is our Kharkiv region. This is the Kherson region, and also the Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions,\" Zelenskyy said. Ukraine also secured many bridges around the Oskil river, located in Kharkiv. The southern area of Ukraine also has heavy fighting, as the Ukrainians hope to re-capture a Russian controlled town.\nIn Russia, the war began to be criticized. Vladimir Putin certified an act which calls for 300,000 Russian reservists, which was met with many huge protests and criticism from top lawmakers in the country. In response, Zelenskyy called the Russo-Ukrainian war \"a war that one man wants\".\nRussia has also released a new referendum saying they will annex four Ukrainian territories they have invaded, causing fear in Ukraine.\nUkrainian allies, including the United States, remained hesitant to declare victory, as Russia still had considerable forces in the area including many missiles and dangerous weapons. The Russians continued to inflict heavy damage, shelling Lozova, which killed three and injured nine. Shelling has also continued in Kharkiv. Biggest of all, the act that calls for 300,000 Russian reserves. For now, however, the Ukrainians seemed to be continuing their push into Russian-occupied Ukraine."}

It also means the other SCRU clubs — Caboolture, Caloundra, Maroochydore, Noosa, University of the Sunshine Coast, and Wynnum, as well as Gympie and Nambour, who do not play at the top level — approved the decision.\nSaid Haines: \"Essentially, we just had to put together a case to demonstrate that there was a larger playing group out there, that's of a higher quality player, that we could essentially tap into.\n\"We put out some expressions of interest. We spoke to a large number of players out there on the Sunshine Coast and the broader community and we've actually had a great response from a large number of players who are looking to play at Brothers next year.\"\nIn 2022, Brothers played in the newly established Sunshine Coast Cup competition. This was the clubs first season playing senior age rugby.\n\"[So, we] had a really strong Friday night [competition.] Obviously, the Friday night Cricks, Sunshine Coast Cricks Cup that went really well for us this year,\" Haines summarised. \"A large number of our boys will be looking to sort of advance [or] go into the reserve grade in the A grade on the back of their efforts this year.\"\nThe club introduced team coaches on November 19, and started recruiting players in early December.\n\"We're all very excited about the A grade and the reserve grade for 2023. So now I expect the club to get around it in a very strong way or stronger than they have been already.\" said Haines. \nOther Australian clubs carry the Brothers branding as well, and play in most competitions in Queensland, including at Cairns and Townsville, and Mackay, and Queensland Premier Rugby in Brisbane.\n\"Brothers here on the Sunshine Coast, we're fortunate enough to be part of a larger fraternity, with the Brothers fraternity stretching up the east coast and further,\" Haines said. \n\"At this point in time, they're all being very supportive of us. We've been lucky enough or fortunate enough to have a large number of players on the Coast and the regional area that all looking to just play with us.\""}
