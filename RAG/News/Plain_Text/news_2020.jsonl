{"title": "Argentine president Fernández to send bill legalising abortion to National Congress within 10 days", "content": "Wednesday, March 4, 2020 \nOn Sunday in Argentina's National Congress, President of Argentina Alberto Fernández announced he is to send a bill to the congress in the next ten days which aims to legalise abortion of human pregnancy.  The president had previously called it \"a matter of public health\".\n\n\"[W]ithin the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalises abortion at the initial time of pregnancy and allows women to access the health system when they make the decision to abort\", Fernández said.  Thousands of people had gathered outside the National Congress with slogans supporting the legalisation of abortion of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion of pregnancy is currently illegal in the Catholic-majority country, and is permitted only in two cases: if the pregnancy was a product of rape, or if it poses a risk to the woman.  Fernández said the law has \"condemned many women, generally of limited resources, to resort to abortive practices in absolute secrecy, putting their health and sometimes their lives at risk\".\nEstimates by the Argentinian government state about 350 thousand illegal abortions are carried out in the country each year.  Illegal abortion is a crime punishable with a prison term in the Latin American country since 1921.  Saying \"there are many abortions despite the criminal threat\" ((es))Spanish language: ‍hay muchos abortos pese a la amenaza penal, President Fernández elaborated, \"A state that is present must protect citizens in general and obviously women in particular.  And in the 21st Century, every society needs to respect the individual choice of its members to decide freely about their bodies ((es))Spanish language: ‍En el siglo XXI, toda sociedad necesita respetar la decisión individual de sus miembros para disponer libremente de sus cuerpos\".\nFollowing the president's announcements, the director of Argentina's Amnesty International, Mariela Belski, said the president had \"heard the demands of women, adolescents and girls\".\nThe proceedings of the abortion rights was criticised by archbishop Monsenor Jorge Eduardo Scheinig.  Calling it a \"culture of death\" the archbishop said \"We need to pray so that in Argentina, the yes to life is stronger than death.\"\nUruguay, Guyana and Cuba are the other Latin American countries where abortion during the early weeks of pregnancy is legal.  Back in 2018, the Argentine congress approved a bill legalising abortion, but it was dismissed by the senate."}

The island nation's cabinet unanimously voted to lift it on Saturday afternoon, and the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) announced the decision that night. NEOC reported a 95% immunization rate on December 24, and the last measles-related death during the state of emergency on December 26. \n\nRestrictions on public gathering and travel were to be lifted, and schools to reopen.  The Health Emergency Operation Center were to take over the relief efforts centralized under the National Emergency Operation Centre. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were tasked to produce a recovery plan within two weeks for consideration by the cabinet. \nAs of Sunday, the Disease Surveillance Team reported a total of 5667 cases during the outbreak. Out these, 1846 persons were hospitalized and 1720 had already been discharged, while 81 had lost their lives.  The December 6 National Measles Response and Recovery Appeal identified children under 5 years of age as having the highest mortality, corresponding with the relative shortfall of vaccination in the age group. \nTupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital returned to normal operation on Sunday, joining Faleolo District Hospital and Leulumoega District Hospital, which returned to normal on Friday. During the peak of the outbreak, Tupua Tamasese Meaole's Acute Primary Care Clinic and Leulumoega District hospital were made measles wards, and Leulumoega District Hospital was designated to deal with patients without measles, in an effort to quarantine infected individuals. The Australian medical mission's fifth rotation is to remain on the islands until January 4 to help facilitate the transition. On Sunday teams had already begun to disassemble the tents erected to deal with the large number of admissions. \nThe state of emergency was expected to end on December 15, but on December 14 it was extended by two weeks to allow the immunization campaign to continue. At the time, the prime minister called for a 100% immunization rate, and stated 92% had been reached.  As of Sunday, the rate had reached 95% according to NEOC data. Aid agencies say populations with sufficiently high vaccination rates have enough herd immunity to prevent any further infections from spreading out of control, meaning an infected person is not likely to come into contact with enough unvaccinated people to cause a chain reaction.\nUNICEF reported they had delivered over 105 thousand doses of vaccine to Samoa by November 22. The national vaccination campaign started on November 20.  A government order made vaccination mandatory and free of charge for children between six months and 19 years of age and for women between 20 and 35, considered childbearing age. On December 5 and 6, the government of Samoa executed a planned shutdown of public services and the private sector to leave room for a nationwide door-to-door immunization drive. The government said 128 vaccination teams participated. \nTo curb the spread of disease, the government prohibited inter-island travel for those under 19, schools were closed, and authorities recommended residents avoid public gatherings and medical facilities unless they were in need of medical attention. Unvaccinated pregnant women were prohibited from going to their workplaces. \nThe outbreak was first confirmed by the government on October 16, after the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne tested 7 out of 20 suspected cases positive for measles. \nIn 2019 in the Pacific region, outbreaks of measles were declared in parts of the Philippines first on February 6, Tonga on October 22, Fiji on November 7, and American Samoa on December 8.  The D8 strain, which caused a New Zealand outbreak, has been identified in Samoa and Fiji.  New Zealand serves as a travel hub for small Pacific nations.  According to data from the World Health Organisation, in 2018 there were approximately 10 million cases of measles and 140 thousand related deaths worldwide."}

{"title": "United States military kills Qasem Soleimani", "content": "Sunday, January 5, 2020 \n\nThursday, United States military forces killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran's Quds Force, in an airstrike. The United States called its actions defensive in nature, pointing to the December 31 attack on the United States Embassy in Baghdad as an example of the attacks on U.S. citizens that Soleimani took part in.\n\nThe United States carried out the airstrike at Baghdad International Airport, where Soleimani was arriving by plane. He was being met by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in the airstrike. al-Muhandis was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an Iranian-backed militia. Other victims included a Kataeb Hezbollah official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer. The Daily Telegraph, citing local paramilitary groups, reported that the attack consisted of three rockets launched from helicopters.\nIn a statement released after the attack, the United States Department of Defense justified the strike, which was approved by President Donald Trump, as \"defensive\" in nature: \"At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months – including the attack on December 27th – culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.\"\nThe military strike follows rocket attacks on the United States Embassy in Iraq; Business Insider reported that the rocket strikes were carried out by sympathizers of the PMF. In a statement following the attack, Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for the PMF, blamed both Israel and the United States for the attack. As of January 3, no evidence of Israeli involvement has been reported.\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which includes the Quds Force, declared that Soleimani was \"martyred\" by the airstrike. Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, ordered three days of public mourning after the strike. In his message, he appreciated Soleimani's lifepath: \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam and the school of Imam Khomeini (ra). He spent his entire life engaging in jihad in the path of God. Martyrdom was his reward for years of implacable efforts [...] Shahid Soleymani is the international face of the resistance and all who have a heart-felt connection to the resistance seek his blood revenge.\"\nIn his statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found the air strike justified and called Trump's order swift, forceful and decisive.\nThe United States Embassy in Iraq had suspended operations, and advised U.S. citizens to leave the country immediately in its January 3 security alert. The office asked U.S. citizens not approach the Embassy, and if in need for travel documents, to use the consulate in Erbil.\nAdil Abdul-Mahdi, the acting Prime Minister of Iraq, spoke out against the attack, calling it \"an aggression on Iraq as a state, government and people\" as well as a violation of the rules relating to the presence of United States troops in Iraq.\nIn 2007, the United States government labeled Soleimani as a terrorist and levied sanctions against him. He was further sanctioned in 2011 in relation to a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. Last April, the United States Department of State also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. The United States had also levied individual sanctions against al-Muhandis."}

Later in the evening, the network signed off and went off-air. The last time the Philippine government ordered the network to shut down was during the martial law imposed by former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos back in 1972.\n\nRepublic Act No. 3846, also known as the \"Radio Control Law\", states \"no person, firm, company, association, or corporation shall construct, install, establish, or operate a radio transmitting station, or radio receiving station used for commercial purposes, or a radio broadcasting station, without having first obtained a franchise therefor from the Congress of the Philippines.\" Since ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, Republic Act No. 7966, expired on Monday, the network no longer had a valid franchise to continue airing their programs. The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order to the network yesterday, and in compliance, the network signed off that night.\nThe network tried to renew their franchise as early as July 2019, but all eleven of the legislative bills filed have been stuck in Congress. The franchise of ABS-CBN expired on Monday, the same day Congress reconvened after their Lenten Break, which began on March 13. Though the NTC is allowed to provide the network a provisional license while its application to the Congress is still being decided upon, the commission refused to provide the network with said license. A number of Senators condemned the act of the NTC, citing the move as a \"grave abuse of governmental power\" and \"contrary to law\".\nABS-CBN Corporation is the largest television and radio broadcasting company in the Philippines with over 42 television stations, 10 digital channels, and 18 FM and five AM radio stations, and has been broadcasting for over 65 years. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened the network's franchise renewal before, after the network didn't carry some of his campaign commercials, which they've said was due to a lack of airtime, and he accused the network of \"swindling\". Solicitor General Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition on February 10, accusing the network of violating its franchise. After a Senate hearing was conducted on February 24, the Senate did not find the network had breached laws, nor its franchise terms. ABS-CBN CEO Carlo Katigbak said refunds for Duterte's unaired political ads were offered, of which some were not accepted by his campaign. Katigbak apologized to Duterte during the hearing, which the President accepted according to a statement by the Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.\nThe network's news channel, ABS-CBN News Channel, is still on air, as the network claims the cease and desist order did not cover their news channel's franchise."}

For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed.\nSanders said in his live stream, \"I do not make this decision lightly\", calling it a \"difficult and painful decision\". He wrote in a tweet, \"while the campaign ends, the struggle for justice continues on\". He spoke about affordable higher education, healthcare, and raising the federal minimum wage to USD15 an hour in his announcement.\nSanders' exit from the race left Biden as the party's expected nominee. During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday, Sanders called Biden a \"decent man\" but did not immediately offer a full endorsement. On the Republican side, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee in March.\nSanders was also a contender for the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election.

{"title": "Greek prime minister reaffirms EastMed pipeline project is open for other countries to join", "content": "Friday, January 10, 2020 \nOn Tuesday, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis reasserted the openness of the EastMed project, which is aimed at connecting the Eastern Mediterranean gas fields with the European mainland via a pipeline through contested waters.\n\nIn his Tuesday live-streamed talk at the United States think tank Atlantic Council's Washington headquarters, Mitsotakis reaffirmed that the EastMed project, which currently involves Greece, Cyprus and Israel, is open for other countries to join. \"We don't seek to exclude anyone from energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean provided they respect international law\", he said, repeating his January 2 remarks made on the EastMed signing ceremony.\nHe also commented on the Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement, calling it \"null and void\" and \"geographically ridiculous\". \"The agreement assumes that our islands, including our biggest island Crete, does not have an exclusive economic zone, which goes against everything we know in international law\", he added. He also noted that the Libyan House of Representatives rejected the demarcation, and that Greece and Turkey might end up before International Court of Justice in the Hague if talks would fail. Mitsotakis underlined they keep channels to Turkey open for dialog and that he would be \"very-very happy if Turkey were to reconsider its overall approach\".\nLater on Tuesday Mitsotakis met with the International Monetary Fund, then with President Trump, where he denounced the border agreement again. In regard of clashing exclusive economic zone claims, he noted \"it is important to point out that the agreement signed between Turkey and Libya infringe upon Greece’s sovereign rights\". \nOn last Thursday, the delegations of Cyprus, Greece and Israel had met for their seventh trilateral summit, that time in Athens at the Zappeion Hall, to sign an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting was attended by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and energy minister Yuval Steinitz, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and energy minister Konstantinos Hatzidakis, and Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades and energy minister Georgios Lakkotrypis. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers.  Greek daily Kathimerini said Greece and Cyprus had to speed up to counter possible Turkish interference with the project.\nEarlier that day, the Greek gas producer Energean signed a letter of intent on selling two billion cubic meters of gas per year to the Greek gas supplier DEPA. The planned pipeline capacity is 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has committed 1.7 billion dollars in the Karish and Tanin fields.\n\nWith this forming of political and economic alliance with Hellenic countries, Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline to end their \"fringe country\" status. Netanyahu called on Italy and Egypt to join the project, adding \"We call on any other country that wishes to join us to do so\". In Cyprus, the ruling Democratic Rally in Cyprus hailed the pipeline as an advancement in the nation's sovereignty. Progressive Party of Working People, the main opposition force, underlined that the agreement is only a legal framework, and actual construction is in the hands of still undecided private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy underlined Turkish and Turkish Cypriot mining rights in the region, and projected a failure if these would be overlooked. \nOtranto, Italy is a proposed end point for the pipeline, and Italian economic development minister Stefano Patuanelli sent a letter of support prior to the signing, but the minister said they are to build another pipeline to Igoumenitsa, Greece. The United States expressed its support via the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill, a July 25 quadrilateral meeting in Washington, and sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the trilateral meeting of EastMed countries on March 20 last year. The EU partially funded the feasibility studies, as it considers the EastMed pipeline to be a Project of Common Interest (PCI), ending the energy isolation of Crete and Cyprus, and diversifying the gas supply of Europe, when completed.\nIn December, a Turkish official said that the trans-Anatolian pipeline, which is already up and running, renders the EastMed building effort unnecessary, Cyprus Mail reported. On November 27, Turkey and Libya signed a maritime border agreement, according to which a section between Crete and Cyprus would cross the Turkish economic zone. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over this issue. Turkey maintains a position that only Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey, has the right to the exclusive economic zone around the island. Because of its drilling operations there, Turkey is already under EU sanctions, and was condemned in a joint statement by Egypt, Greece and Cyprus on October 8.\nIn 2017, a memorandum of understanding about the pipeline was signed between Cyprus, Greece and Israel.\nAccording to the Cyprus Mail, the 2000 km long pipeline is to connect the fields with Crete, the Greek mainland, and would end in Otranto, Italy. The May 2019 map of gas routes by Gas Infrastructure Europe draws the pipeline between the Aphrodite gas field and Thesprotia, Greece, where it merges with the Poseidon line en route to Italy.\nAlex Lagakos, deputy director of the Greek Energy Forum, said the project has a geopolitical significance rather than an economic one. He called it unlikely that the EU would finance the project, as it has committed itself to green energy. The estimated cost is six billion euros, but the saturation of the gas markets and competition from liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals are likely to keep private investors away, he noted. Egypt has two usable terminals in the Nile-Delta, in Damietta and Idku. On September 19, 2018, Cyprus and Egypt had signed an alternative deal to export Aphrodite gas through these ports via a new pipeline.\nHaifa University geostrategy expert and former Israeli security official, Avinoam Idan, said the new EastMed supply can't be considered a significant geopolitical change to Europe's energy market, as it would not affect the market share of Russian gas. In the analysis of the German Institute for Economic Research, the high costs and technical challenges render the project unrealistic.\nDuring the trilateral meeting of Cyprus, Greece and Israel on January 28, 2016, the then-envisioned EuroAsia Interconnector was considered as an alternative route to export the gas as electricity. The 1000 megawatt underwater cable connecting the three power grids is to be completed by December 2023. The estimated cost is 2.5 billion euros, and the EU considers it a PCI. EuroAfrica Interconnector, a similar project between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt, is also in its planning stage."}

United States", "content": "Friday, May 8, 2020 \n\nYesterday, the United States Supreme Court overturned the criminal convictions of Bridget Anne Kelly and William Baroni for crimes relating to a 2013 incident involving allegedly politically motivated traffic chaos at a major bridge access from New Jersey to Manhattan. Kelly, then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, then the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were both previously convicted of fraud for their actions.\n\nThe case revolved around Kelly and Baroni's convictions following the 2013 \"Bridgegate scandal\" in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In September 2013, for four days, traffic \"ground to a halt\" — as the Supreme Court decision put it — at part of the George Washington Bridge, an entryway into Manhattan, administered by the Port Authority. For decades, three of the twelve access lanes to the bridge had been reserved during morning rush hour for commuters coming from the streets of Fort Lee. But on these four days only a single lane was set aside. The public officials who ordered that change claimed they were reducing the number of dedicated lanes to conduct a traffic study. The Supreme Court decision stated they did so for a political reason: to punish the mayor of Fort Lee for refusing to support the New Jersey Governor’s reelection bid.\nThe Supreme Court sought to determine whether Kelly and Baroni's actions qualified as property fraud under federal statutes. The unanimous court decided their actions did not qualify, reversing the convictions and remanding the case back to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\nWriting for the Court, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan declared in the majority opinion, \"not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime. Because the scheme here did not aim to obtain money or property, Baroni and Kelly could not have violated the federal-program fraud or wire fraud laws.\""}

The November border demarcation resulted in overlapping exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims and would make the planned EastMed gas pipeline cross Turkish waters.\n\nEgyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry and his Greek, Cypriot and French counterparts, Nikos Dendias, Nikos Christodoulides and Jean-Yves Le Drian, respectively, gathered in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Libya–Turkey relations. The Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, joined the talks as an observer.\nThey concluded that the November 27 maritime border agreement between Turkey and Libya is \"null and void\" and \"infringes upon the sovereign rights of third states, does not comply with the Law of the Sea and cannot produce any legal consequences\". They called on Turkey to halt their drilling operations within the EEZ of Cyprus, and deemed that the agreement on sending Turkish soldiers to Libya, where a civil war is underway, goes against the United Nations Security Council resolution 2259.\nThe foreign ministers agreed to a future meet on Crete.\nIn a related press release issued the following day, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the conclusions of the summit, calling the agreements \"legitimate and fully compatible with international law\". To resolve differences, they invited the countries to open dialogue, with the exception of Cyprus, which Turkey does not recognize.\nOn Wednesday during the opening ceremony of the TurkStream gas pipeline, Turkish president Erdoğan called for a regional cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean, claiming a right to Turkey to have a say in projects there, based on the country's long shoreline. \"No project excluding our country in the Eastern Mediterranean can be implemented with regard to economic, judicial and diplomatic aspects\", he said. He underlined the call for cooperation by saying \"we are ready to take more [positive] steps towards those taking a single step towards us.\" He claimed the Turkish drilling on Cypriot waters is only to protect Turkish and Turkish Cypriot interests.\nOn Tuesday, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis speaking to the Atlantic Council think tank called the border agreement \"null and void\" and \"geographically ridiculous\". \"The agreement assumes that our islands, including our biggest island Crete, does not have an exclusive economic zone, which goes against everything we know in international law\", he added. He also noted that the Libyan House of Representatives did not ratify the demarcation, and mentioned a possible arbitration route at the International Court of Justice. The border issue is the \"main difference\" between Greece and Turkey, he added.\nIn the November 27 deal, Turkey and Libya agreed on a line as their shared maritime border that would make the sea between Crete and Cyprus a part of the Turkish EEZ. Turkey justified the claim based on their long shoreline and presented cases where islands played only a limited role when borders were drawn. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over the agreement.\nThe EastMed pipeline is a Israeli-Cypriot-Greek effort intended to connect East Mediterranean offshore gas fields with the European mainland via a pipeline, on a route which passes through Turkish-claimed maritime territories.

{"title": "Native American groups sue US state of Montana over ballot law", "content": "Sunday, March 15, 2020 \nOn Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana and Native American Rights Fund filed a lawsuit against the state of Montana over its 2018 Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), saying it would prevent many Native Americans from voting.\nReportedly, most Montana residents vote through the mail, including 73% of votes in the 2018 midterm elections.  Since the United States Postal Service does not cover most Native American reservations, many of the people who live there fill out their ballots and give them to voting organizations to deliver to election offices on their behalf. The complaint notes many residents of Montana's reservations do not have access to reliable transportation to drive to voting sites.\nUnder the previous law, each carrier was limited to 80 of other people's ballots, unless they were part of the voter's family. Under BIPA, that number drops to six. The fine for breaking this law was set at US$500.\nThe Native American Rights Fund's Jacqueline De León said, \"BIPA ignores the everyday realities that face Native American communities. It is not reasonable to expect voters to drive an hour to drop off their ballot, so collecting ballots in reservation communities just makes sense. Criminalizing this behavior is unfair to Native American voters and does nothing to solve the real problem of mail not being picked up and delivered to Native homes.\"\nState legislators supporting the law argued it was to prevent voter fraud, specifically to prevent people from collecting ballots and then throwing them away if they did not like voters' decisions. Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton said BIPA \"is supported overwhelmingly by Montanans, including the counties in Indian Country [...] It's always dicey when plaintiffs try to overturn the will of the people.\"\nAs of 2020, Montana had seven Native American reservations with about 70,000 people living on them.  The World Population Review estimated the total 2020 population of the state at just over one million.\nThe plaintiffs were listed as Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote, Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck, Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Crow Tribe, and the Fort Belknap Indian Community. The suit was filed in Yellowstone County.\nAn issue raised by the complaint was BIPA's definition of the term \"family.\" Many of the Native American cultures in Montana, the complaint pointed out, have a concept of family that does not match the nuclear family idea widespread in Western culture."}

ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday. These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' Facebook pages. Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate. On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.\n\nThese changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively. Coles, in its March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, \"many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery\", and called the demand \"unprecedented\", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it \"unexpected\". Sales went up in a \"sharp increase\" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.  Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week. \nTo further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early. Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard.

On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the Wednesday special.\nIn a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill the stock every night. He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage. \"Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic\" said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News.\nRecycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday they'd run out of stock. Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, emphasized they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au report.\nDomain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day.

The trial was held in Manhattan, and was one of three facing Avenatti. He was also accused of defrauding clients in California, and of keeping for himself money that his client Stormy Daniels had earned from her book.\n\nThe United States government accused Avenatti of trying of pressure Nike for about 15–25 million dollars, threatening to give a news conference that would damage the company's stock price, as well as its reputation. Avenatti pled not guilty to the charges. His legal team argued he simply represented his client, Gary Franklin, in a negotiation. The government suggested Avenatti's debt was a factor in his decision making; according to prosecutors, he owed over $850,000 to the Internal Revenue Service, as well as penalties and interest, and in total was at least $11 million in debt at the time.\nAvenatti was charged with three distinct crimes: transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort, attempted extortion, and honest services wire fraud. He was found guilty on all counts.  Together, the crimes carry a prison term of up to 42 years. NBC News reported Avenatti is to be sentenced in June.\nScott Srebnick, a member of Avenatti's legal team, announced Avenatti intended to appeal the conviction."}

He had recently had health problems, reportedly colon cancer. Tributes were paid by world leaders including the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nThe government of Oman announced three days of mourning. Before Qaboos's burial at a family cemetery, his successor, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, attended funeral prayers at the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat.\nQaboos became Sultan in 1970 after overthrowing his father, Sultan Said bin Taimur. By the time of his death, Qaboos's reign was the longest in the Arab world. He was known for pursuing a neutral foreign policy and mediating in several Middle Eastern disputes as a \"friend to all and enemy to none\". Most notably, he helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal that was signed in 2015.\nRecently there had been growing concerns over his health. Following a week-long stay in a Belgian hospital, he returned to Oman in the middle of December, although there was no official information on what treatment he had received.\nQaboos was born 1940 and received his education in India and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, followed by a cultural tour of the world. Arriving back home in 1964, he turned to the study of Islamic law and Omani history.\nQaboos's 1970 overthrew of his father was a bloodless British-backed coup. He began a programme of reform which changed his poorly-developed country into a relatively prosperous nation.\nQaboos did not have children, so Omani law allowed three days for a royal council to select a successor. If they could not do so, the council and other leaders would open a sealed letter from Qaboos naming his preferred successor.\nWhen the royal council met, they chose to open the letter and acknowledged Qaboos's cousin, Haitham, as the new Sultan. After the funeral, Haitham said he would continue Qaboos's policies including a neutral approach to foreign affairs."}

The party was organised by Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (All India Hindu Union) president Swami Chakrapani where the attendees consumed cow urine to prevent themselves from being infected by the coronavirus.  Reuters estimated around 200 people attended the event held at the Indian capital city of New Delhi.\nSpeaking to Reuters, an attendee Om Prakash said, \"We have been drinking cow urine for 21 years, we also take bath in cow dung. We have never felt the need to consume English medicine\".\nA yajña (literally means sacrifice, devotion, worship, or offering) was conducted at the start of the meeting and a poster of coronavirus, personified as an avatar of the Hindu god Narsimha, was displayed.  At the event, ABHM president Chakrapani said \"Coronavirus has come because of the people who kill and eat animals. When you kill an animal, it creates a sort of energy that causes destruction in that place\".\nIn February, Chakrapani said, \"Corona is not a virus, but avatar for the protection of poor creatures. They have come to give the message of death and punishment to the one who eats them\".\nCOVID-19 was previously announced to be a \"pandemic\" by the World Health Organization (WHO).  According to the WHO's situation report dated March 16, the virus claimed 6606 lives, and 167,515 cases were reported of this disease. The WHO's website said: \"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. The WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\"\nHowever, addressing the global leaders, Chakrapani proposed: \"I request all the presidents and prime ministers of the world to take cow urine on a daily basis. You have all these scientists who don't know the cure, we have the cure given to us by the gods\".\nChakrapani had said, \"Corona was quiet in India because of yajña rituals.  But these ignorant, arrogant Telangana ministers have challenged corona by killing animals and eating chicken in public, that there is a speculation of seeing the most formidable form of corona.  Thus, these ministers should promptly seek forgiveness from corona, else it would be a disaster that no one can stop.\" ((hi))Hindi language: ‍कोरोना भारत में यग्न अनुष्ठान के कारण शांत था।  लेकिन तेलंगाना के इन नादान, अहंकारी मंत्रियों ने जीव हत्या कर जिस प्रकार से सार्वजनिक चिकन खा कर कोरोना को ललकारा है, इससे भारत में भी अब कोरोना के विकराल रूप देखने की आशंका बन गई है।  अतः इन मंत्रियों को समय रहते कोरोना से तत्काल माफ़ी मांग लेनी चाहिए, अन्यतः अनर्थ हो जायेगा, जिसे कोई नहीं रोक सकता।  Earlier this month, Chakrapani told ThePrint, \"Just like we organise tea parties, we have decided to organise a gaumutra party, wherein we will inform people about what is coronavirus and how, by consuming cow-related products, people can be saved from it\".\nCows are considered sacred by Hindus and politicians of the Hindu-nationalist party Bharatiya Janta Party had previously cited the medicinal benefits of cow urine.  Similar sentiment was shared by a Minister of Legislative Assembly from Assam earlier this month.  Suman Haripriya of the Hajo assembly said \"Coronavirus is an airborne disease and it can be cured by using gaumutra and cow dung.\"\nAccording to the reports by Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, there are at least 142 cases in India, of which three patients have died.  14 have recovered so far in the country.

By reports, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden won all three elections. Ohio, which was also scheduled to hold a primary election, delayed its voting in the face of the national emergency around the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The same day, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election after winning the party's primaries in Florida and Illinois.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections, along with caucuses, to select their nominees for the 2020 presidential election. For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed. The three primary elections the Democratic party held represented a total of 441 delegates.\nBiden's victories in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois left him with a reported total of 1,124 pledged delegates; United States Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders trailed him with a total of 815. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Sanders also lost in all three of these states to Hillary Clinton. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory.\nOn the Republican side, 1,276 delegates are required to secure the nomination. After winning the Republican Party's primaries in Florida and Illinois on Tuesday, Trump reportedly amassed 1,330 delegates, more than the number needed, making him the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.\n\nIn Ohio, which was planning to hold its primary election on Tuesday, Governor Mike DeWine postponed it, citing the health crisis.

{"title": "Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far", "content": "Friday, May 22, 2020 \n\nA study published in journal Astronomy & Astrophysics last month reported astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and elsewhere discovered a black hole in the Telescopium constellation.  The study stated the black hole is about 1010 ± 195 light years (310 ± 60 parsec) away from the Solar System, meaning it is the nearest known black hole from the Earth.  The nearest previously known black hole — V616 Mon — the study noted was usually estimated at more than 3000 light years away.\nThe black hole described in the study is located in the HR 6819 stellar system of Telescopium constellation, making it the first system visible to the naked eye to contain a black hole.  HR 6819 contains two stars, and they are visible from the Southern Hemisphere.  The astronomers started observing the system in 1999.  Initially, they thought it was just a binary system, consisting of two stars.  However, upon examination, the researchers concluded there was a third unseen object in the system.  One of the two stars in the HR 6819 system is close to the black hole and orbits the black hole in just 40.333 ± 0.004 days.\n\nThis newly discovered black hole does not have an accretion disk.  A black hole forms an accretion disk when a significant amount of matter orbits the black hole, as depicted in the image.  Accretion disks often emit electromagnetic radiation.  Since this black hole does not have an accretion disk, researchers had to rely on the gravitational effect of the black hole on the nearby star in order to discover it.\n\nResearchers used the binary mass function to conclude the black hole had a mass of at least 4.2 M☉ (Solar masses; 1 Solar mass = mass of the Sun).  Its companion star, which orbits the black hole in about 40 days, is classified as a B3 III star.  The outer star is classified as a Be star.  Be stars rotate very quickly around their axes.  Since the outer star rotates so rapidly, the star is not exactly spherical, but instead oblate, bulged at its equator, forming a gas disk around the equator.\nThe research suggested HR 6819 was very similar to another system LB-1.  The HR 6819 system is estimated to be between 15–75 million years old (myr).  The inner star has estimated mass of at least 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉.  Using the mass and the speed at which the inner star rotates, the researchers concluded the black hole had an estimated mass of 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉.  Researcher and co-author of the study Thomas Rivinius told Wikinews the inner star and the black hole are closer than the Sun and the Earth (1au; 150 million km; 93 million miles).\nThe researchers dedicated the paper to Stanislav Štefl, one of the fellow researchers who died in a car accident in 2014 in Santiago, Chile.\nWikinews caught up with Thomas Rivinius to discuss about this discovery."}

They found the virus's behavior resembled that of influenza rather than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even though SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to the viruses that cause SARS — hence its name — than to a typical influenza virus.\nIn humans, SARS viruses tend to live in the lower respiratory tract, where they can cause pneumonia. The COVID-19 virus, however, can live in both the lower and upper respiratory tract: the researchers found significant quantities of virus in samples taken from the volunteers' noses and throats. This and the fact that one of the volunteers had no symptoms while others had only mild ones raises the concern that, like a flu virus, SARS-CoV-2 could be spread directly from person to person by people who do not realize that they are putting others in danger.\nImmunologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research said, in response to the study, \"This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we've ever seen. This is more akin to the spread of flu[.]\"\nEfforts to contain the SARS outbreak, which took place in 2003, mainly involved preventing the spread of the virus within hospitals. If these findings are accurate, scientists say, containing COVID-19 may require a different approach.\nThe R0 number for SARS-CoV-2 — the number of other people to whom each infected person transmits the virus before either dying or becoming noncontagious — has yet to be calculated.

{"title": "Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists", "content": "Thursday, March 26, 2020 \nIn a new study released by the Florida Museum of Natural History on Monday, scientists report spiky skulls evolved at least 25 separate times in different kinds of frogs. The survey was reportedly to be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida, said, \"Superficially, frogs may look similar, but when you look at their skulls, you see drastic differences [...] Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as a shield, or in a few rare cases, are venomous. Their skulls show how strange and diverse frogs can be.\"\nSome scientists had previously suggested smaller frogs would tend to develop spiky skulls, but that is not what this study reports.  Here, researchers evaluated CT scans on 158 different species. They found frogs that had similar ecological niches — meaning they either acquired food in the same way or defended themselves from predators in the same way — tended to develop skulls with similar grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints regardless of whether they were ancestrally related to each other.\nAccording to the study, skulls with spikes, grooves or ridges — called hyperossification — often accompanied frogs eating very large prey relative to their own body size.  The strong, spacious skulls would allow the frogs to have very big mouths with which to catch birds, rodents, reptiles and other frogs.  Spikes sometimes coincided with venomous frogs. The researchers speculated the spikes make it dangerous for predators to hit the frog's head, as the spikes would break venom sacs under the frog's skin.\nOther bone formations included projections resembling fangs or lower teeth  that different species of frogs use for catching prey and fighting. Very few frogs have true lower teeth.\nOne of the study's authors, herpetologist David Blackburn, told Discover Magazine the frequency of spiky skulls evolving in otherwise unrelated frogs suggested some deep pattern frogs fell into as circumstances arose: \"Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their DNA.\"\nSince 1973, when frogs skulls were last comprehensively surveyed, scientists have documented enough new species to double the number known to humans.  Also, modern techniques exploit CT scans, of which Paluh and his team made liberal use.  The research was part of the oVert project, funded by the National Science Foundation, meant to comprehensively CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from United States museums."}

{"title": "Neuroscientists tell Wikinews about empathy and harm aversion observed in lab rats", "content": "Thursday, April 30, 2020 \nIn findings published last month in the journal Current Biology, neuroscientists from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience examined harm aversion in laboratory rats for conspecifics — rats not wanting to hurt other members of the same species — and reported which region of the brain was crucial for it.  Wikinews caught up with Dr Christian Keysers and Dr Valeria Gazzola, two of the authors who contributed to the paper.\n\nFor the experiment, the rats were put in a container with two levers.  The rats were trained to develop a preference for one of the two levers: each delivering one pellet of sucrose.  One of the two levers was harder to press.\nAfter developing a preference, the preferred lever was wired to deliver a shock to another rat in a neighbouring compartment, while delivering a single pellet of sucrose.  The study showed the actor rat, which pressed the lever, tended to switch the lever to avoid shocking the other rat.  The rat receiving the shock was called a victim rat.\nAversion of harm to fellow rats was reported to be equal in both male and female rats.  If the actor rats were previously exposed to the shocks, their degree of harm aversion for others was heightened, the study revealed.\nThe investigation reported the rats avoided pressing the preferred lever to shock another rat, even if that lever delivered two sucrose pellets and the no-harm lever delivered only one.  However, this was not the case when the rats were given three pellets by the shock lever.  Most of the actor rats did not switch when they received three pellets pressing the lever, which also delivered an electric shock.  Dr Gazzola called it a \"tipping point\" and said it was a \"cost-benefit\" function.\nThe study also revealed the importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region of the rat's brain for harm aversion.  The scientists tested harm aversion for conspecifics in the rodents after deactivating the ACC using muscimol.  Muscimol was injected in the rats belonging to the test group, while saline water was injected to rats in the control group.  The observations showed without the active ACC due to muscimol, the active rats in the test group were no longer averse to harming the victim rats, but degree of harm aversion did not drop in the control group rats."}

This was the first launch of a crewed spacecraft from the United States since NASA's final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011 — a mission Hurley piloted.\n\nSpaceX, backed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, is the first private company to send astronauts into space. The company has engineered and operated reusable rockets, potentially reducing the overall cost of future space missions. Shortly after the launch, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage disengaged and returned to an autonomous spaceport drone ship off the coast, to be refurbished and reused on a future mission. Behnken and Hurley are slated to catch up to the International Space Station (ISS) for a stay of one to four months, docking today at 1429 UTC.\nThe originally planned launch on Wednesday afternoon, local time, was scrubbed due to inclement weather conditions less than 20 minutes before scheduled launch time, with the schedule pushed back to yesterday. Unlike Wednesday's scrub, however, yesterday's launch proceeded without issue.  Hurley, on radio following the minutes-long ride to low Earth orbit, said, \"It was incredible\".\nSpaceX's launch is the latest development in a program initiated in earnest by NASA's 2014 selection of SpaceX, along with Boeing, to be an initial commercial contractor providing transportation for NASA astronauts to the ISS. Boeing's first crewed mission is reportedly expected to launch next year. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttles in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the orbiting space station.\nHurley, along with his fellow crew members aboard the final Shuttle mission, had left a small U.S. flag aboard the ISS, to be retrieved when the U.S. space program was once again able to launch astronauts to the outpost. Hurley and Behnken, when they depart, plan to return this flag to Earth after a nearly nine-year hiatus to commemorate the milestone. The exact timing of their return is not set, however, as it depends on the continued performance of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, and on when the next Crew Dragon mission occurs, which NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has said may be ready to launch by late August.\nBridenstine remarked of the remainder of the test flight, \"I'm breathing a sigh of relief, but I will also tell you I'm not gonna celebrate until Bob and Doug are home safely.\" Hurley, for his part, paraphrased the first U.S. citizen in space, Alan Shepard, commenting before launch on the occasion of the United States' return to human spaceflight capability: \"SpaceX we're go for launch.

Last month, Alexei Navalny was airlifted from Omsk to Berlin because of falling ill, and transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Charité.\nThe German government announced the tests by a military laboratory found Novichok in Navalny's blood, and said there was \"unequivocal\" proof he had been poisoned. The spokesperson for the German government strongly condemned the attack. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, demanded an explanation from Russia. The Russian government dismissed the claim from Berlin as groundless.\nNavalny was airlifted from Omsk to Berlin in August when he was suffering from a serious medical condition.  Navalny is an outspoken critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, and his associates had alleged Navalny was poisoned.  Initial reports from Omsk hospital reported no traces of poison were found in his blood or urine before he was airlifted by Berlin non-profit Cinema for Peace Foundation."}

Exoplanets are those planets which are outside the Solar System.\n\nThe host star AB Aurigae is a young star, roughly five million years old, Boccaletti told Wikinews.  In contrast, the Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old.  Located in the Auriga constellation, AB Aurigae is about 520 light years away from the Earth.  The astronomers observed the protoplanetary disk around the star.\n\nThe astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescopes in Chile to study this system.  Boccaletti told Wikinews the twists they saw in the protoplanetary disk of gas and dust could be the formation of either a humongous planet, bigger than Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System; or it could less likely be a star, or a brown dwarf.\nThe disturbance in the twist is located around 30 astronomical units — one astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth — from the host star.  That is almost the distance from the Sun to Neptune.  However, the host star AB Aurigae is more massive than the Sun: about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun.  AB Aurigae is classified as a Herbig Ae star, which are known for their brightness.\nBoccaletti and his team started observing the system in 2019.  Boccaletti said the researchers would like to follow up the study to confirm the observed twists are indeed the birth of an exoplanet.  \"[I]f we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up\", he said.\nThere exists multiple theories of exoplanet formation, however, the formation of an exoplanet has never been observed till date.  Discovered in 2016, K2-33b is one of the youngest exoplanets known so far, and it is about 9.3 million years old.\nBoccaletti, who works at the Observatoire de Paris, discussed his findings with Wikinews last month."}

His death was confirmed by his son, Wolfgang Van Halen.\n\nVan Halen was a native of the Netherlands, eventually relocating to Pasadena, California.\nNumerous iconic rock musicians such as Billy Idol and Yusuf/Cat Stevens paid tribute to the guitarist following the announcement of his death.\nEddie Van Halen was known for his heavy use of two-handed tapping and complex harmonics in his guitar playing, and has been widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists. The guitarist formed Van Halen with his brother Alex Van Halen in 1972. The band's 1978 self-titled debut album peaked at #19 on the Billboard charts and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold over 10 million copies. The band eventually rose to become one of the best-selling musical artists to date.  In 2007 they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\nThe guitarist is perhaps best-known for his guitar solo Eruption, the second track on the group's debut album. Mike McCready of Pearl Jam likened his first time hearing the solo to first hearing classical composer Mozart. In an interview with Rolling Stone, McCready commented, \"he gets sounds that aren't necessarily guitar sounds — a lot of harmonics, textures that happen just because of how he picks.\"\nVan Halen had been previously diagnosed with tongue cancer as early as 2000.

She managed to get a hold of the small bag and kept her child safe.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) confirmed they seized the substance, stating \"In B.C., this has been considered a public health emergency since April 2016. Unfortunately this means issues like found needles and drugs are something that all parents must be mindful of while in public settings.\"\nKamloops RCMP Constable Gary Gray said fentanyl had become a popular drug in Kamloops because it was potent, and colors such as purple were used as a signature by traffickers.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis claimed 15,393 lives in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Canadian Public Health Infobase.\nIn Ontario, provincial police Detective Constable Daniel Dubé stated to the CBC in late June that the border closure between New York State and Quebec drove up the prices of illicit drugs, and traffickers had been stretching their products further. He explained that heroin, which had normally been laced with fentanyl, had been mixed with the sedative etizolam, or benzos, another drug of the nervous system depressant class.\nThe Executive director of the Ask Wellness Society, Bob Hughes, told Kamloops This Week that CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) payments, a program related to the COVID-19 pandemic, presented an additional factor in a spike in overdose deaths this year. According to the B.C. Coroners Service, there were 170 suspected deaths in May alone, shortly after the CERB payments started, resulting from the abuse of illicit drugs. That showed a 93% increase from 88 deaths in May 2019.

During his tenure, the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster occurred, which resulted in the deaths of 29 miners.  A jury convicted Blankenship of misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, and he received a one year prison sentence in 2016.

After his release from prison, Blankenship ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia.  He subsequently sought the Constitution Party's nomination for President.  At the virtual 2020 Constitution Party National Convention this past May, Blankenship won the party's nomination on the second ballot.  He selected Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman William Mohr as his running mate.  Mohr spoke about Blankenship with Wikinews in June, describing him as \"a good man with vast knowledge in the political field [who] stands firm on his positions, aligns well with the party platform and has an abundance of ability to lead this nation in the direction it needs to go.\"  Mohr lauded Blankenship's \"ability to influence leaders around him\" and claimed the nominee \"has a backbone superior to most men and will be the strongest President we have seen in decades.\" \nThe Constitution Party was founded in 1991 as the U.S. Taxpayers Party.

Tesco stated its intention to leave the Polish market altogether, Salling its intention to strengthen its Netto chain in Poland.\n\nThe deal covers 301 stores, two distribution centers and the head office. With the acquisition Salling said it seeks to improve its coverage in Southern Poland and, over 18 months at a cost of one billion złotys, intends to merge these stores into its currently 386 strong Netto chain. Salling also takes over about 7000 employees from Tesco — Netto Poland currently has about 5000 employees. Tesco continues to run 19 stores, which were not included in this package. \nThe sale price, to be payed in cash, is 900 million złotys (181 million pounds). In the 2019/20 fiscal year, Tesco said its Polish branch had a 24 million pounds operating loss with a 1368 million pounds turnover; to which the sold units contributed with a 947 million pounds turnover for a 107 million loss. At fiscal year-end, the sold units held a value of 681 million pounds in the books.\nUOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly agency, has to approve the deal. The parties said they expect a decision this year.\nTesco has suffered losses from its Polish operation for several years, as customer preference has shifted away from hypermarkets, Tesco's preferred store size, to smaller discount stores like Biedronka and LIDL. The Sunday trade ban, introduced in 2018, also hurt sales. According to Notes from Poland (NFP), some discount stores resorted to offer postal services, a loophole which allows Sunday opening hours.\nIn 2015, Tesco centralized its management in the Central European region, comprising Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, but reverted the decision later on. At the time, the company invested in e-commerce and started home deliveries, but Gazeta Prawna reports only 0.5% of Polish grocery turnover comes from this segment, compared to 7% in the United Kingdom.\nIn the past few years, Tesco Polska has cut expenditures by streamlining its product range, halving its staff, shutting off home deliveries in parts of the country, and closing off stores, reportedly including last year its Poznan distribution center. Deutsche Welle (DW) reported in mid-2019, 62 Tesco outlets had closed within a year. Staff layoffs left meat, fish and delicatessen departments without designated shop assistants, and forced staff canteen closures and administration simplifications.\nTesco sold its roughly 2000 Thai and 74 Malaysian stores to Charoen Pokphand in March; announced leaving its joint venture with China Resources Holdings in February; and in 2015 sold its South Korean chain HomePlus. Speaking to Portfolio.hu, Matt Simister, Tesco’s CEO for Central Europe, explained that the company held a 4% share of the Polish retail market, compared to its 16% share in Hungary, and stated they want to stay in Hungary. In a DW report in March of last year, Dave Lewis, CEO of Tesco, stated they did not have intentions of leaving Thailand or Poland.\nTesco's Polish operation, according to Gazeta Wyborcza in March, is too big for a single monolithic sale. The chain's press release reported 22 sold units in the past year and a half, for around 200 million pounds.

A 25-year-old man was arrested by Thames Valley Police on suspicion of murder. Reports named him on Sunday as Reading resident and Libyan national Khairi Saadallah. Police also announced on Sunday morning they were treating it as a terrorist incident.\nThe Daily Telegraph cited a security source that mental health may be a factor in the attack. Witnesses, according to The Telegraph, said a man approached and attacked a group of middle-aged men, using a knife. Thames Valley Police soon arrived and detained the man, later identified as Khairi Saadallah. Saadallah came to the UK a number of years ago, after the Libyan Civil War. A counter terror police raid removed various items from Saadallah's flat, amongst them reportedly a circular saw.\nThe head of the UK's counter terror police, Neil Basu, on Sunday said the police found nothing inconsistent with the attacker acting alone. He also said there is no suggestion of specific increased threat towards people in crowded places from terrorists. A Black Lives Matter protest had taken place in Forbury Gardens a few hours before the attack, but Basu also stated this was not connected to the crime."}

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Phil Collins, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee", "content": "Thursday, October 22, 2020 \nU.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins took some time to answer a few questions about his 2020 presidential campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.\n\nCollins is currently chairman of the Prohibition Party.  Previously, he served as a trustee of Libertyville Township (Illinois) and as chairman of the Prohibition Party of Illinois. After moving to Nevada, he ran for Mayor of Las Vegas in 2019, and finished in second place overall.  He was not the Prohibition Party's first choice for the 2020 presidential nomination.  In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bill Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. Gammon assumed the presidential nomination and the party nominated Collins for Vice President the next month.  Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around August 2019 and Collins took over as the presidential nominee.  The party picked anti-alcohol activist Billy Joe Parker as Collins's new running mate.  Parker spoke to Wikinews back in July.\nAfter securing the Prohibition Party presidential nomination, Collins sought the nominations of the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party for ballot access in California and Florida, respectively. Despite winning the AIP California Presidential Primary in March, Collins lost the nomination to businessman Rocky De La Fuente in August. He also fell short of De La Fuente for the Reform Party presidential nomination in June. Nevertheless, the Prohibition Party has attained ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont.  The last presidential election in which the party appeared on at least four state ballots was in 1984 with nominee Earl Dodge.\nThe Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the US, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late nineteenth century. As its name suggests, the party supported the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the period known as Prohibition (1919–33).  Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the party has declined.  It stays afloat, in part due to the George L. Pennock Trust established in 1939, which pays the party's operating expenses.  It continues to nominate candidates for president as well.  Wikinews has previously interviewed two of those nominees: 2004 and 2008 presidential nominee Gene Amondson and 2016 presidential nominee James (Jim) Hedges.  Collins makes it three.\nWith Wikinews, Collins discusses his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his campaign, presidential nominations, gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations."}
{"title": "Neanderthals 'knew what they were doing': Archæologist Dr Naomi Martisius discusses her findings about Neanderthals' behaviour with Wikinews", "content": "Sunday, June 28, 2020 \n\nLast month, a study conducted by archæologist Dr. Naomi Martisius and other researchers concluded Neanderthals living in Europe tens of thousands of years ago were more sophisticated than previously thought.  The now-extinct species used to carefully select bones from a particular animal species to manufacture their bone tools, the research showed.  The research was published on May 8 in Nature's Scientific Reports journal.\n\nDr Martisius and her team used five bone tools discovered from Neanderthals' sites in southwest France for this research.  Four of these bone tools were found in a site called Abri Peyrony and the other one was from Pech-de-l’Azé I.  These tools were just a few centimetres in size and were about 50 thousand years old, Dr Martisius told Wikinews.  Microscopy analysis of these bone tools called lissoirs (smoothers) suggested Neanderthals used these tools for working animal skin to leathers.\nThe study stated the fauna of the sites were primarily medium-sized ungulates such as reindeer, in one layer nearly 90%.  Despite the overabundance of medium-sized ungulates, Neanderthals used ribs of large bovids for making lissoirs.  Dr Martisius told Wikinews this was likely due to the physical characteristics of the bovid ribs, which were \"thicker\" and \"stronger\" as compared to the \"thin and flimsy ribs\" of reindeers.  In order to check the origins of the bone tools, the researchers used a technology called non-destructive Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).\n\nInstead of damaging the bone artefacts in order to discover its origins, the researchers collected collagen from the plastic containers in which these artefacts were kept.  Collagen is a type of protein.  These bone artefacts were kept in plastic containers: some were kept for about five years, some for just a few months.  During this time, the collagen proteins from bone tools were stuck to the walls of its plastic containers.  The collagen samples collected from the walls of the containers are broken into smaller molecules called peptides by using a chemical enzyme called trypsin.\n\nAfter the trypsin has broken collagen fibres into peptides, it is analysed using a technology called Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (ToF MS).  The assisting matrix is a coloured compound.  The acidic peptide is combined with the matrix, vapourised, and peptides are released.  Some of them are positively-charged particles which travel across a vacuum tube in an electric field.  Depending on the weight of the peptides, these molecules reach the end of the vacuum tube at different instances of time, forming a spectrum.  These graphs are like unique fingerprints of a species: they are different for different species of animals.  Looking at the database of such graphs, taxonomic identifications of the collagen proteins came be made.\n\nAll four bone tools from Abri Peyrony gave positive results and showed that the bones were made from large bovids, even though reindeer were more abundant during that time.  One of the advantages of using bovid ribs over reindeer's thin ribs was the bovid ribs would be more resistant to breaking during flexion, Dr Martisius said.\nDr Martisius said such non-destructive ZooMS analysis was previously conducted, but for tools no older than a few centuries.  She said such an analysis had never been previously conducted for artefacts so ancient.\nWikinews caught up with Dr Martisius to discuss this research in-depth."}

{"title": "GitHub blocks public access to youtube-dl after RIAA issues DMCA notice", "content": "Monday, October 26, 2020 \n\nOn Friday, code hosting and sharing website GitHub blocked the public access to youtube-dl, a software which can download videos from the internet via the command-line.   The blockade came after GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  After stripping the metadata from the notice, GitHub published the take-down notice on their site.\nInitially started in July 2008 by Ricardo Garcia, youtube-dl is a script written in Python which can download videos from multiple websites including YouTube, LiveLeak and Vimeo.  youtube-dl is a FLOSS software and is under public domain.  Currently, the repository on GitHub is locked for viewers other than maintainers of the project.\nRIAA's DMCA notice alleged the script's purpose of existence was to \"circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube\" and \"reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use\". \nyoutube-dl has multiple unit tests in its source code, which test whether the software works in different circumstances or not.  Some of the tests include checking if the script can download Creative Commons licensed videos, videos which did not have square pixels, videos with no age restriction, \"offensive to some audiences\" per YouTube community and age-restricted videos.  One of the tests included the URL of some copyrighted songs.  Citing this test, RIAA's take-down notice claimed \"comments in the youtube-dl source code make clear that the source code was designed and is marketed for the purpose of circumventing YouTube's technological measures\".\nRIAA's notice published by GitHub alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems which says \"No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title\".  RIAA listed a number of forks of youtube-dl and requested GitHub via the notice they all be made inaccessible.\nThe notice did not list any incident of anyone using youtube-dl to download or share copyrighted material, nor mention any damages that actually occurred.  Unremarked by the notice, YouTube allows videos to be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license.  When a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work.  YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.\n\nyoutube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world.  Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on Wikimedia Commons are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media.  youtube-dl also lets users download videos from LiveLeak — a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism.  Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence.\n\nyoutube-dl comes with a small JavaScript interpreter where it acts as a web-browser would behave while receiving video data from the server.  The script has \"extractors\" for various websites to handle videos from different sources.  Whenever something is displayed on the user's screen, the device has a copy of that content.  Web browsers \"download\" data while surfing the web, though most of it is not persistent on the device.  It is possible to download copyrighted photos by using a web-browser.  The way the world wide web works, there are no technological prevention measures to prevent recording and sharing of content such as RIAA talks about in the notice.  Photos and texts can be downloaded by taking screenshots, videos by screen recording tools, and audio by recording on a tape if not an audio recording software.\nMultiple users expressed their disappointment on Twitter and Internet Relay Chat.  One of the users said \"this is yet another example of why we should use git as it was intended, as a distributed network, rather than rely on one single proprietary server\".  Git is decentralised version-tracking software which is used by a large number of software companies and projects.  It is possible to host one's own git server for software development.  While Microsoft's GitHub is a centralised git server, development of software using git does not require a GitHub account.\nSoon after the public access to the repository was locked, multiple users started sharing the source code via self-hosted git servers, Tor sites and via the Torrent protocol leading to a Streisand effect.  Streisand effect is when a measure to censor information causes further spread of that information.  The binary files of the software are still available on its website for users to download.  Some people came up with esoteric ways to share the source code, by converting the compressed code into photographs and providing shell commands to convert to the source code.\nGitHub's DMCA repository, where the takedown notice was published for public viewing, was subject to contant vandalism from multiple GitHub users.  One user submitted a pull request, merging the source code of youtube-dl along with the DMCA repository.  This enabled users to view youtube-dl's source code from within the DMCA repository, provided they know the commit id.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation said on Twitter \"Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of a lawful uses.  Demanding its removal from Github is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.\"  Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now.\nWikinews reached out to Sergey M․, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl script, however Sergey said he \"won't give any comments at this time\".  Later, he shared an update on the IRC channel.  Sergey said, \"they require complete removal of so called YouTube's rolling cipher implementation [...] GitHub requires in order to reinstate the repo [...] under this conditions I could reinstate it in Saturday/Sunday already but this is an unsatisfactory outcome\".  He also said, \"I can't guarantee whether [or] not we will bend over them considering the situation with @phihag [Philipp Hagemeister] but we'll see soon what we can do in order to keep the max we have and mitigate potential legal issues at the same time\".\nEFF is yet to respond to Wikinews queries.  Wikinews also reached out to Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer and contributor of the youtube-dl project to discuss this takedown.\n\n When did you get to know about the takedown notice and what were your initial reactions?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  I saw the takedown notice along with anyone else, on reddit.  Since I am no longer involved with the youtube-dl project (except for occasional contributions, my maintainership ended in 2016), I don't know any details.\n((RS))  Does YouTube implement DRM for videos not under Creative Commons license, and if so, how does youtube-dl bypass it?  Could you please elaborate the procedure?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  YouTube implements DRM for YouTube Movies.  youtube-dl does not support those.\nYouTube has multiple non-DRM video delivery protocols.  I'm not up to date about specifics; my last dabbling in this was in 2015.\nOne of these protocols is described here.  YouTube uses JavaScript to compute parts of the URLs.  youtube-dl executes this JavaScript, just like a web browser.\n((WN))  Could you also explain in brief how youtube-dl functions, and how the maintainers had intended it to be used?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, just like any other web browser, from over 1000 different services. Its uses are varied: It enables video playback on many devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi) where the video services don't work properly, it makes high-quality video playable for people with a bad or no Internet connection, it enables disabled users to use tools to play videos, and it is used for archival and research.\n((WN))  What do you think of the DMCA notice?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  I think it is not warranted because youtube-dl is entirely legal.  As the DMCA notice has no effect for me personally, I'm not really the right person to address it.\n((WN))  Why were the copyrighted tests in the source code?  Could they be replaced?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  I'm not sure why, but my guess is that users requested support for these videos and thus they were added as test cases.  They can be removed trivially, without losing any function of youtube-dl.\n((WN))  Are you aware Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was a \"disappointing and counterproductive move\"?  What do you think should be the next steps?\n((Philipp Hagemeister))  Yes, and I concur.  I'm no longer involved in the project. If I were, I would probably just remove the test cases, block these music videos (RIAA is not worth the trouble for me, that can be done by other projects), and get the project back online.\nI understand people who think differently."}

In 1992, with the Libertarian Party's backing, she ran for public office, seeking South Carolina's 4th congressional seat in the United States House of Representatives.  She finished the race in third place with almost 2.16 percent of the total vote. Four years later, the Libertarian Party tapped Jorgensen to be its vice presidential nominee.  She joined a ticket with the late Harry Browne.  Browne-Jorgensen appeared on every state ballot and received a total of 485,798 votes, which was roughly 0.5 percent. This marked the best performance for the party since 1980 and would not be topped percentage-wise until 2012 when former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson attained 0.99 percent of the vote.  Johnson bested that performance in 2016 as the party's presidential nominee for a second time, earning 3.27 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for the party  since its 1971 inception.\nFor the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen navigated through a primary campaign that featured the short-lived campaigns of former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, the first sitting Congressman to be a member of the Libertarian Party.  At the virtual 2020 Libertarian National Convention, Jorgensen won the nomination on the fourth ballot, edging attorney Jacob Hornberger, performance artist Vermin Supreme and activist Adam Kokesh, among others.

{"title": "Joe Biden projected US president-elect", "content": "Saturday, November 7, 2020 \n\nToday, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden was projected by multiple media outlets to have surpassed 270 electoral college delegate total and therefore become the 46th President of the United States elect.\nHis running mate, Kamala Harris, would become the first female and first African- and Asian-American vice president.  \nAt around 11:25 am US east coast time (1625 UTC), the Associated Press (AP) called the election for Biden, as did NBC News, when Biden was declared to have won Pennsylvania's 20 electoral college votes. Later in the day, the AP and NBC News also called Nevada for Biden, giving him an additional six electoral college votes, for a total by NBC's reckoning of 279 electoral votes to President Donald Trump's 214, or 290 electoral votes by AP's reckoning.\n\nBiden said in a statement, \"I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris\". He added, \"With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It's time for America to unite. And to heal [...] We are the United States of America. And there's nothing we can't do, if we do it together.\"\nPresident Trump has yet to concede, saying earlier in the morning before the call for Biden, \"I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!\" on Twitter. Following the announcement of Biden's win, Trump issued a statement at his golf club outside Washington, D.C. saying, \"The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor\". The lack of a concession from Trump has no legal standing."}

At least five of the nine CentOS Governing Board listed on the project are Red Hat employees.  \nStarted in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided binary-code compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — Red Hat's GNU General Public Licensed paid operating system.  CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".\nRed Hat also sponsors the Fedora operating system.  Red Hat even gives the software engineering interns laptops with Fedora on it.  Till now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription.  CentOS would then follow RHEL to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.\nStream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM.  CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL.  Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle.\nWith CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat emplyees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a rolling release, before those features are absorbed into RHEL.  CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution.  Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.  Stream, on the other hand, has features added to it before those features become a part of RHEL.  That implies Stream would be ahead of RHEL's development, containing new features which are not yet tried and tested by RHEL developers, and not be binary code-compatible with RHEL.\nWriting \"The future of CentOS Linux is CentOS Stream\", Wright further wrote in the announcement, CentOS Stream \"provides a platform for rapid innovation at the community level but with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics.\"  Wright also said, \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\"\nSince the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list.  CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.\n\nGregory Kurtzer, who had started the CentOS project, announced a new operating system, Rocky Linux.  Rocky Linux describes itself as \"a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux\".  The project said \"Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to the upstream vendor, not before.\"  The project maintainers have not decided a date for when the operating system will be released.\nKurtzer explained the reason to call the OS as Rocky Linux: \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh.  He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [hat tip] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\".\n\nWikinews reached out to the members of the CentOS project, Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen, to discuss this move, its implications as well as the future of CentOS.  Greco is a maintainer of armhfp (32-bit processors) and is a part of the CentOS' quality assurance team.  Bowen — who unlike Greco, works for Red Hat — is the community manager of the CentOS project."}

Reportedly several thousand supporters turned out, with Trump flags and hats, in D.C. to protest, some in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, which rejected, the day before the rally, a lawsuit filed by Texas which tried to overturn the results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nTrump tweeted he wasn't aware of the event but would go to see it anyway: \"Wow!  Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal.  Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA\"  MAGA stands for Make America Great Again — a slogan commonly used by Trump and his supporters.\nTrump flew above the rally on his Marine One helicopter on his way to West Point, New York, with supporters cheering below. Former Trump adviser and retired general Michael Flynn was on stage while Trump flew over.  This was the first time Flynn made a public speech since he was pardoned by Trump.  He said \"That's pretty cool.  Imagine just being able to jump in a helicopter and just go for a joy ride around Washington\".  Another former Trump adviser, Sebastian Gorka, also spoke in the rally and encouraged supporters to remain hopeful after the recent court decision.\nThe rallies happened two days before the formal vote of the Electoral College to choose the president-elect.  Trump and his supporters claimed Joe Biden only won the elections due to voter fraud and sought to overturn the results.  Organizers of the rally said they were fighting corruption and dishonesty.  Flynn said there was a lack of transparency in the elections and urged the crowd to consider what the counters are hiding from them and why don't they let them look at the signatures and at the machines.\nA couple from Florida, Richard and Lisa Parry, made a 14-hour drive to D.C. for the rally.  Lisa Parry, a retired nurse, said, \"I went to bed at 1 o'clock and Trump was ahead.  There's no way[...] I don't believe it, it's fake.\""}

{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "Friday, December 25, 2020 \nIn May, a study was published in journal Nature Astronomy, conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Dr Sara Seager and other researchers, showing single-celled organisms like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast can thrive in both 100% hydrogen gas and helium atmospheres.  Wikinews discussed the findings with Dr Seager to know more about her research.\n\nLife has not been observed in any habitat other than Earth, which has an oxygen-rich environment.  While Earth's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen gas, oxygen is essential for advanced living organisms.  Some species of microorganisms do not require oxygen for metabolism, called anærobic organisms, such as methanogens which rely on carbon-dioxide while releasing methane.\n\nResearchers used Escherichia coli strain K-12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiæ strain S288C for this experiment.  The two microorganisms were kept in four different environments: one being 100% air, and the other three being anærobic environments: 100% H2, 100% He, and 80%-20% N2-CO2.  The environments were kept in at 28° Celsius.  The researchers made sure the anaerobic experiment environments were anoxic, and had installed oxygen sensors to report fluctuation in the oxygen level.  They monitored growth of E. coli using optical density measurement, and they used a hæmocytometer for yeast.\n\nThe study reported the organisms were reproducing normally in both 100% H2 and 100% He environment.  However, the sigmoid-shaped growth curve was not on par with 100% air.  E. coli and yeast switch from ærobic respiration, which uses oxygen, to anærobic respiration and fermentation.  Both processes are less efficient and do not produce as much energy as ærobic respiration.\n\nE. coli in an 80%-20% N2-CO2 environment had slower growth rate as CO2 dissolves and makes the liquid medium acidic.  Such reduction in growth rate was not observed for yeast cultures, which can thrive in acidic environments.  However, yeast's growth rate in 100% air was far greater than in the other three media.  The likely reason for this significant difference was lack of oxygen for non-respiratory purposes, the research reported.  Oxygen is essential for synthesis of biochemicals such as heme and sterols, which are important for yeast.  In atmospheres lacking oxygen to produce these chemicals, yeast fungi have stunted growth rate.\nWith this discovery, Dr Seager said scientists can now observe even more planets to study for habitable life.\n\"There's a diversity of habitable worlds out there, and we have confirmed that Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres.  We should definitely add those kinds of planets to the menu of options when thinking of life on other worlds, and actually trying to find it\", Professor Seager said.\nA rocky planet with expanded hydrogen-rich atmosphere should be easy to detect using the emerging technologies.  Hydrogen and helium gas have very low density.  Dr Seager said, \"It's kind of hard to get your head around, but that light gas just makes the atmosphere more expansive [...] And for telescopes, the bigger the atmosphere is compared to the backdrop of a planet's star, the easier it is to detect.\"\nThe research paper noted rocky planets which have radius below 1.7 times Earth's radius (Earth's radius is roughly 6360 km) can support a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, if water were to react with Iron.\nThe research paper reported E. coli releases a number of gases when it lives in hydrogen-based atmosphere including ammonia, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, carbonyl sulfide, carbonyl disulfide and nitrous oxide.  These gases can serve as biosignature gases which can help astronomers detect and study potential life on exoplanets.\nConfirming life can thrive in atmospheres that do not have oxygen, Seager said \"Astronomers should keep an open mind as to which planets are worth searching for life\".\nWith NASA's James Webb Telescope scheduled to be deployed next year, the paper suggests researchers could observe smaller exoplanets that orbit small red-dwarf stars."}
{"title": "US federal agency announces plans to begin presidential transition process following Trump election loss", "content": "Thursday, November 26, 2020 \nOn Monday, United States General Services Administration administrator Emily W. Murphy sent a letter to President-elect Joe Biden and his team, giving them permission to access what she described as post-election resources for a presidential transition process following the 2020 US Presidential Election on November 3, which multiple national news outlets have projected former US Vice President Joe Biden won against incumbent US President Donald Trump.\n\nMurphy claimed she made this decision without influence from the White House, insisting she was \"never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official\". However, she claimed she and her family had received violent threats due to her involvement in the process of allowing the incoming president elect access to federal documents. \nPresident Trump, who appointed Murphy to her position himself in 2017, responded to her letter on Twitter, calling for the beginning of a presidential transition process \"in the best interests of the country\". The president's response is a drastic departure in tone from his previous rhetoric and demeanor regarding the issue, in which he asserted he had won the election despite several key swing states certifying their results in favor of Biden. \nThe president did not concede or admit defeat in the election in his statement, however, and vowed to keep fighting \"the good fight\" with court cases challenging the election results in swing states. \nTo date, the president's claims of widespread voter fraud have not gained any momentum in the courts. Two days prior to Michigan's final certification of its election results, a federal judge dismissed a Trump lawsuit attempting to prevent the state of Pennsylvania from certifying their results.\nTrump and his legal team have come under scrutiny from both sides of the aisle in response to their claims of election fraud. Biden and others in the Democratic Party warned the delayed transition process could potentially be a threat to national security, in withholding resources from Biden and his team. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer commented the president's tweets Monday are likely as near as the US public will ever have to an official concession from the president. \nOther Republicans have broken with Trump and have urged him to move forward with the presidential transition, such as former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who denounced the Trump legal team's claims as a \"national embarrassment\". Additionally, businessman and Trump loyalist Stephen Schwarzman said the president should accept the election outcome and \"move on\". Over 100 Republican national security experts signed an open letter urging Republican officials to push the president to concede the election.\nTraditionally, the General Services Administration has acted once the national media has called the presidential race for a candidate. Joe Biden is projected to win the electoral college and was also victorious in the popular vote, winning by over six million votes. He was projected on November 7 to have won, and would be sworn into office on January 20."}
