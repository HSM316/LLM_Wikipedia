Crown Prince Frederik, her oldest son, is to succeed her.\nShe is 83 years old and has served as Queen for nearly 52 years. In her live television address, Margrethe also discussed global issues like climate change.\nIn Denmark, the monarch serves as head of state; the parliament is in charge of forming the government. \nMargrethe received high levels of support from the Danish people, with about 80 percent of the public approving of her as of 2022. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed gratitude for the queen's decades of service on the throne, calling her the \"epitome of Denmark\" in a statement.\nSince the death of the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II, she has been the longest-reigning sitting monarch in Europe and the world's only reigning queen.\nBorn days after the Nazi invasion of Denmark in 1940, she ascended to the monarchy in 1972. During her childhood, the 1953 Act of Succession gave women the ability to inherit the throne, and she became the first female monarch of Denmark in over 500 years.\nSince Denmark has no formal coronation ceremonies, Crown Prince Frederik is set to be proclaimed King immediately after Margrethe formally abdicates.\nThe queen explained that her February back operation had led her to consider moving on. \"The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future,\" she said.\nDuring her reign, she frequently traveled around her country without formal accompaniment and visited deployed Danish soldiers in the War in Afghanistan at 70 years old. Margrethe is also known for her interest in archaeology and the arts. Under a pseudonym, she was the illustrator of a 1977 Danish-language version of The Lord of the Rings."}

Anderson, reversing a Colorado Supreme Court decision that had deemed Donald Trump, the former U.S. president, ineligible for Colorado's 2024 presidential Republican primary due to involvement in the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot. The justices ruled the responsibility to disqualify a presidential candidate under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \"rests with Congress and not the States.\"\nThe central issue in the case was whether Donald Trump, a candidate for the Republican nomination, was correctly ruled ineligible by the Colorado Supreme Court. The Colorado court found Trump's actions constituted an insurrection in opposition to the U.S. Constitution, disqualifying him from being president. \nNo one may hold an office if they have taken an oath \"to support the Constitution\" while in certain roles but \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against it following that, the Fourteenth Amendment stated.\nThe case began with a petition by voters from the state in September aiming to have Trump be denied ballot access. While Trump did commit insurrection, a trial court in Colorado found, the president and presidency were not covered by Section 3. After the latter facet of the decision was overturned by the Colorado Supreme Court, Trump sought review from the U.S. Supreme Court."}

Iran described this unprecedented assault as retaliation for an earlier Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria, which reportedly resulted in significant casualties, including high-ranking officials.\nThe complex attack included kamikaze drones, long-range ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. Al Jazeera reported this as Iran's largest-ever drone and missile strike, as well as the largest drone strike conducted by any country to-date. Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said, \"The operation achieved a level of success that exceeded our expectations.\"\nIsrael's response to the attack was swift, involving the activation of its missile defense systems and readiness measures across the country. The country also saw disruptions in civilian life, including the temporary closure of airspace and a slight downturn in the stock market reflecting investor concerns over the escalating conflict.\nOn Sunday, the Group of Seven (G7) met virtually to coordinate a response. Following that meeting, the G7 members issued a joint statement forcefully condemning Iran's \"direct and unprecedented attack\" on Israel. They proclaimed their \"full solidarity and support to Israel and its people\" and reaffirmed their commitment to Israel's security.\nOther international actors, including the EU, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, Norway, and others have called for restraint and emphasized the need for a diplomatic resolution to prevent further escalation.\nLast year Iran unveiled new drones and long-range ballistic missiles, named after significant figures and locations in Iranian military history, signaling a robust enhancement of their military capabilities. These advancements are seen by Tehran as shifting the regional power balance, potentially increasing Iran's leverage in geopolitical negotiations.\nThe Iranian government has openly praised groups like Hamas for their attacks on Israel, underscoring Iran's support for what it views as anti-Zionist resistance movements across the region. This stance is part of a broader Iranian strategy aimed at countering Israeli influence and operations in the Middle East."}

A living example is Viktor Pinchuk, who has traveled to dozens of countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania. Based on materials from one of his expeditions, where the main goal was to visit Afghanistan, the Russian traveler wrote and published a book, held a personal photo exhibition, and published 25 articles in the press; in general, his contribution to culture and art amounts to hundreds of realized ideas.\" ((ru))Russian language: ‍В XXI веке поступками большей части общества движет материальный интерес, а образцом для подражания служат промышленные магнаты и банкиры.

{"title": "Industry leaders see energy supply as the next hurdle for AI", "content": "Thursday, April 25, 2024  \n\nIn a podcast published on Friday, Mark Zuckerberg reiterated industry concerns that energy supply would soon become the major challenge to the further development of artificial intelligence (AI). These concerns echoed Elon Musk's warning from last month, that AI could exceed energy capacity as early as next year. According to Musk, AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate; by a factor of ten every six months. That rate of growth has reached a point where it is straining both chip manufacturing capacity and energy capacity.\nBig tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. (Google), Microsoft, and Amazon.com are rapidly expanding their AI capabilities and that is pushing them into more and larger data centers. According to ArsTechnica, the three companies combined are projected to spend over US$120 billion on data center expansion in 2025. This increased demand for data centers will increase the demand for energy. At the current expansion rate, energy demand could surpass supply. \nZuckerberg, co-founder of Meta AI, an AI-development laboratory, anticipates the need for 1-gigawatt data centers, a capacity that has not yet been achieved. According to Zuckerberg, building power plants to supply that amount of energy will take time. \"If we wanted to stand up some massive facility, to power that is a very long-term project. I think [some people will] do it, but I don't think this is something that can be quite as magical as 'you get a level of AI, get a bunch of capital, and put it in [a big data center].'\" \n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, one of the hurdles to expanding power supply quickly is government regulation. \"When you're talking about building large new power plants or large build-outs and building transmission lines that cross public or private land ... you're talking about many years of lead time.\"\nCompounding the issue, the electronic vehicle (EV) market is competing with the AI industry for energy supply. In a teleconference video for the Bosch Connected World conference, Musk said “The simultaneous growth of electric cars and AI, both of which need electricity, both of which need voltage transformers – I think, is creating a tremendous demand for electrical equipment and for electrical power generation.\"\nWhat could this mean for the future of AI, EVs, and global energy supply and demand? We may already be experiencing its effects. In Ireland, Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers reportedly faced restrictions on launching new resources from its Irish data centers. The Register attributes these restrictions to limited energy supply for AWS data centers in Ireland.\nWikinews asked ChatGPT about AI growth versus energy supply growth.

As a result, customers are being directed to use AWS data centers in other European regions, such as Sweden, where there is spare capacity. These issues stem from the overall strain on Ireland's power grid, which has been exacerbated by the significant energy demands of numerous data centers concentrated around Dublin. This situation reflects broader challenges related to power supply and demand affecting data centers not only in Ireland but in other regions as well​ (Enterprise Technology News and Analysis)​.\n\"This power crunch in Ireland is significant given the role that data centers play in the local economy, contributing substantially to employment and economic output. However, the growing energy consumption by these data centers, which has significantly increased over the years, poses sustainability challenges and has led to tighter restrictions on new data center builds and the requirement for new facilities to demonstrate they are matched by renewable energy generation​ (RTE)​.\"\nWikinews: \"Do you think renewable energy production can be leveraged quickly and effectively to help meet energy demand?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Leveraging renewable energy production to meet energy demand quickly and effectively is feasible, but it comes with several challenges and considerations. The potential for rapid deployment and effectiveness largely depends on technological advancements, policy support, infrastructure readiness, and financial investment.\"\nWikinews: \"Do you think the country of Ireland has all four of those necessary components already, to be able to meet the challenge effectively?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Ireland has made significant strides in renewable energy, particularly in wind power, which is a major focus under its Climate Action Plan. The country has ambitious targets for both onshore and offshore wind energy development. By 2030, Ireland aims to significantly increase its wind-generated electricity, with specific goals for onshore and offshore capacities.\n\"Technological Advancements: Ireland is advancing in wind technology and exploring innovative approaches for onshore and offshore wind farms. The government supports various schemes, like the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, to facilitate this growth and connect more renewable sources to the grid.\n\"Policy Support: The Irish government has implemented strong policy frameworks such as the National Marine Planning Framework and the Maritime Area Planning Act to support the development of offshore wind projects. These policies are designed to streamline planning and bolster the contribution of renewable energy.\n\"Infrastructure Readiness: Ireland is focused on enhancing its infrastructure to integrate more renewable energy efficiently. This includes updating grid capabilities to handle the variable nature of wind energy and other renewables.\n\"Financial Investment: The country has witnessed significant investment in renewable energy, with support from both public and private sectors aimed at achieving the set targets and ensuring community benefits through funds linked to renewable projects.\n\"Overall, Ireland is actively developing its renewable energy sector, particularly wind energy, which supplied 34% of its electricity demand in 2022. This progress is supported by comprehensive government plans and community involvement, though challenges such as local opposition and environmental concerns need careful management.\"\nWikinews: \"Given the timeframe proposed by Musk, the fact that we're already seeing impacts in Ireland similar to what Musk is predicting, and the need for a TPIF framework in each country, what do you think this means for the future of AI, EVs, and global, energy supply and demand?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"The future of AI, EVs, and the global energy supply and demand landscape is poised to be highly dynamic and interconnected, influenced by developments like those described by Elon Musk and the situations unfolding in countries like Ireland. Several key implications emerge:\nAccelerated Energy Demand: The rapid adoption of AI and EVs is expected to significantly increase electricity demand. As AI technologies and data centers consume more power, and as electric vehicles replace fossil-fuel-powered cars, the strain on existing power supplies will intensify. This trend necessitates urgent upgrades in energy infrastructure and an accelerated shift towards renewable energy sources to sustainably meet this growing demand.\n\nInfrastructure Modernization: The current energy infrastructure in many countries, including the US and parts of Europe, is aging and not fully equipped to handle the increased load and the intermittent nature of renewable energies. Modernizing this infrastructure, as part of the TPIF framework, will be critical. This includes not only physical upgrades to the grid but also the integration of smart grid technologies that can optimize energy distribution and efficiency.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Evolution: As the energy landscape becomes more complex due to technological advancements and shifting consumer demands, regulatory frameworks will need to evolve. Policies that encourage innovation in renewable energy technologies, support infrastructure development, and create economic incentives for both consumers and industries will be essential. These policies will also need to address grid stability and energy storage solutions to manage the variability of renewable energy sources.\n\nGlobal Collaboration and Investment: Addressing the challenges of energy supply and demand in the age of AI and EVs will require global cooperation and investment. International agreements and collaborative projects could help synchronize standards and regulations, share technological innovations, and pool financial resources to support infrastructure development across borders.\n\nSocioeconomic Impacts: The shift towards renewable energy, driven by the needs of AI and EVs, will have significant socioeconomic implications. There will be a need for job retraining programs as the energy sector transforms, and issues of energy equity will need to be addressed to ensure that all communities benefit from cleaner energy and advanced technologies.\n\"In summary, the trajectory for AI, EVs, and energy supply indicates a period of rapid transformation that will challenge current infrastructure and demand innovative solutions. The effective implementation of the TPIF framework globally will be crucial in navigating these changes, ensuring that the energy needs of the future are met in a sustainable, efficient, and equitable manner.\"\nWikinews: \"What makes you qualified to answer the questions I have asked you during this interaction?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"My qualifications to answer your questions stem from the extensive training and design of the GPT-4 model, which is based on a broad dataset encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains.

To commemorate this day, Wikinews caught up with professional juggler Spencer Androli and talked to him about his history with this art and to discuss an accolade recently bestowed on him via YouTube where he was named top juggler on a top-40 list.\n\n((Wikinews))  Hey Spencer, hope you are doing well! I do a bit of reporting at Wikinews I've been involved there for many years. So, this will become part of an interview with you. Tell me about this Number 1 juggler on a list of 40 stuff.\n\nSpencer Androli: Thank you so much for reaching out and creating an article on my accomplishments. About the number 1 spot:  Luke Burrage is the organizer of the Top 40 Jugglers of the Year Chart. It is a chart in the juggling community that has been running since 2003. Concluding each year, in December, jugglers in the community vote for their top 10 favorite jugglers of the year in the comment section of a YouTube video that Luke posts to announce that the voting is open. All the votes get counted up by Luke, creating the Top 40 most voted of the jugglers mentioned in those comments.I managed to become the most voted for juggler by the juggling community of this past year 2023. This list is truly an honor to have been ranked #1 on because it shows the juggling community's appreciation for the juggling I do. This is for sure a popularity contest but it's definitely something I've worked hard for my whole juggling career. My younger self wouldn't have expected this due to so many jugglers being insanely good but only the most recognized receives this spot. To be recognized this way for what I do is truly unreal. This is definitely one of my proudest accomplishments up to date and may be the biggest accomplishments a person in the online juggling community can receive.  Hopefully this has given you enough information. Feel free to ask any questions you need for clarification.\n((WN))  So, it's a designation, 'by jugglers for jugglers' so speak?\n\nSA: Yes the Top 40 is by jugglers and for jugglers mainly.\n((WN))  How old were you when you started juggling?\n\nSA: I was eight years old when I started juggling.\n((WN))  So, last year was pretty exciting for you! Tell me about the whole circus thing you became involved with.\n\nSA: The circus was quite an experience of all sorts. I hopped on the Flynn Creek Circus tour from June to October of 2023 which toured through Northern California and Oregon. I really enjoyed it! I was so happy to be finally showing what I’ve worked on for so many years, to people on stage on a consistent basis. I gave it my all on stage and had so much fun. There is something special about performing that I have come to love. I feel like I have the best job in the world because I am bringing genuine joy to people in all walks of life. What is unique about Flynn Creek Circus is that one of its main goals is to bring circus to people in the rural areas of California and Oregon. Based off of the audience responses, Flynn Creek definitely executes it well. Most of the people in these rural areas don’t see much of any live entertainment in their day to day life, so these shows were often a break from the norm. The shows feel really special because people love it and it often makes their year distracting them from the normal day to day. It was a physically taxing contract in which I learned so much about things like building a tent, towing a trailer, living in a mobile home, performing, and working hard. As my first circus contract, it really showed me how much I enjoy performing and bringing joy to others through my art of juggling.\n((WN))  You did some performing for a while in the Tyler, Texas area, didn't you? \n\nSA: Yes, I did. I performed for a while doing gigs locally in Tyler whenever the opportunities presented themselves as well as surrounding areas like Shreveport, Dallas, Houston, etc. I also was a part of the juggling duo with my friend Paul Haygood known as the Spence and Paul Show that performed 45-60 minute educational and motivational juggling show in several schools as part of Young Audiences of East Texas, a non profit organization that strives to bring education through the arts to schools. We also took The Spence and Paul Show to Dickens on the Strand street festival in Galveston as well as a few other events that weren’t only schools."}

Arizona, Illinois, Kansas, and Ohio held primary elections for both parties, while Florida conducted elections solely for the Republican Party. The Democratic Party in Florida awarded all 224 delegates to Biden as the incumbent.\nBoth Biden and Trump have now secured the necessary delegates to receive their parties' official nominations for President. This development sets the stage for a potential rematch between Biden and Trump in this year's election. The Republicans will officially choose their nominee in July, and the Democrats in August at their respective national conventions.\nThere are still 31 primaries or caucuses scheduled before both parties hold their national conventions and announce their formal candidates. Despite the clear victories in the primaries, there is a growing sentiment among voters reflecting a lack of enthusiasm for a rematch between Biden and Trump. Polls and interviews with voters have underscored a desire for fresh faces in the political arena, with many expressing dissatisfaction with the possibility of either candidate being nominated.\nOne potential voter told a pollster, \"This is probably the most uniquely horrible choice I've had in my life.\""}

This accident has severed the vital connection between Baltimore's container port and the global shipping network, leaving at least six people missing.\nDali, constructed in 2016 by Hyundai, owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd, and operated by Maersk, struck a pillar of the bridge around 01:30 EDT (05:30 UTC). The timing of the collision likely avoided a higher casualty rate, which could have been much worse if the incident had occurred during peak traffic hours.< The collapse and subsequent blockage marks a severe disruption for the Port of Baltimore, important for both the local and national economy, as it processes, on average, 1.1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), or containers, per year.\nThis disruption comes at a critical time for East Coast ports, already under strain from contract renegotiations and global rerouting of cargo due to various international logistics challenges. The incident is expected to exacerbate congestion and delays across the Eastern seaboard.\nThis incident is not Dali's first encounter with infrastructure damage; a similar, though less severe, event occurred in Antwerp in 2016. In the Antwerp incident, the crew—specifically the ship's master and pilot—was blamed for a collision with the dock. Though the investigation is on-going, early reports from Tuesday's collision indicate mechanical issues could be a factor, with reports of black smoke and flickering lights seen on the ship just prior to the collision."}

Ollongren's only ask was that Ukraine \"comply to international law and the right to self-defense as stated in the U.N. Charter, which means they use it to target the military goals they need to target in their self-defense.\"\nThe F-16s are American-made, which generally means the U.S. can influence how and where they are used. According to NL Times, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins consulted with NATO colleagues, including US representatives, and determined that permission from the U.S. is not needed.\nThe Netherlands is one of four countries working together to supply F-16s to Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, and the U.S. are also sending the fighter aircraft.\nIn March, Russian President Vladimir Putin was addressing Russian pilots when he was asked about the prospect of F-16s supplied to Ukraine. According to transcripts released by the Kremlin, he asserted they would not materially change the conflict and said \"we will destroy the aircraft just as we destroy today tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment, including multiple rocket launchers.\"\nThe F-16s will replace older aircraft Ukraine has lost during the conflict as well as provide improved capabilities such as stronger radar, further strike range, and better air-to-air combat capabilities. Additionally there is the ability to network the F-16s with other weapons platforms that may be provided by NATO countries such as advanced radar jamming and air-launched cruise missiles."}

The next day, Germany also granted permission for usage of their weapons against targets inside Russia. A US official said \"Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them\". Despite this, according to the official, no strikes deep inside Russia, such as through the ATACMS system, were allowed.\nThis is presumed to be in response to a request from Ukraine a few weeks ago for permission to attack Russian targets near the Kharkiv region. President Emmanuel Macron of France questioned how the Ukrainians were expected to protect Kharkiv without targeting \"the point from which the missiles are fired?\". He added \"we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired\". The United Kingdom also expressed a desire for Ukraine to have the ability attack inside Russia.\nThis is a major change from previous U.S. policy of not permitting strikes inside Russia, due to concerns about escalation. Ukraine was not permitted to use Western weapons to attack Russia and was forced to rely on its own arsenal for that task.

It is the first time a US president has been convicted on criminal charges, and Trump is now the first former president to become a felon.\nThe prosecution alleged Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen gave hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, amounting to US$130,000, in 2016, shortly before that year's presidential election. The payment was to ensure Daniels did not talk publicly about her affair with Trump in 2006. Then, in 2017, Cohen received US$420,000 from Trump himself and his trust as reimbursement for various payments Cohen had made on Trump's behalf, including the payment to Daniels. The prosecution had argued the fraud occurred when Trump intentionally filed documents which misclassified the payments to Cohen.\n\nTrump has vowed to appeal the case and claimed the trial was \"rigged\" against him. Trump denies he ever had an affair with Daniels, or that he committed fraud. President Biden called Trump's remarks \"reckless.\" Conversely, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky came to Trump's defense, writing on the social media platform X: \"These charges never should have been brought in the first place. I expect the conviction to be overturned on appeal.\" Elise Stefanik, Ted Cruz, and Jim Jordan each voiced their support for the former president.\nDaniels' attorney commented after the verdict was handed down: \"I think it was the culmination of a lot of things — the finality of it and, you know, the worry and nervousness she had throughout leading up to this,\" adding it \"hit [Daniels] hard\" and the end of the trial \"was more or less a relief.\"\nOn June 1, Daniels spoke out about the trial. She said she thought Trump should be sentenced to jail time and community service. She added Trump was \"completely and utterly out of touch with reality\" and talked further about the trial's aftermath: \"I’ve been telling the truth the entire time. It’s not over for me. It’s never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.\" However, it should be noted that not all of Daniels' testimony about Trump during the trial was negative.\nSeveral commentators predicted in the lead-up to the jury's deliberation that the verdict could affect Trump's poll numbers. A poll conducted by Morning Consult on Friday showed 54% of registered voters approved of the verdict, and 34% disapproved.

If the court votes to remove Yoon from office, an election to replace him must be held within 60 days.\nConstitutional Court Acting Chief Justice Moon Hyung-bae affirmed that the trial would be \"speedy and fair.\"\nThe motion was met with celebratory fireworks and song outside the National Assembly from thousands of dissenters, in the \"bitter cold\", BBC reported. NPR reported that many were seen waving light sticks often seen at K-pop concerts.\nPolling data suggested that three-quarters of South Koreans supported the removal of Yoon from office.\nWhile serving as prosecuter, Yoon himself personally oversaw the investigation that resulted in the impeachment of former South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2016."}
{"title": "Luigi Mangione, suspect in killing of US healthcare CEO, charged with terrorism", "content": "Sunday, December 22, 2024  \n\nOn Tuesday, New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced that Luigi Mangione, 26, had been charged with first-degree murder in relation to the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan, New York, United States on December 4. Bragg contended that Mangione carried out the attack with the intent to \"sow terror.\" \nA post-9/11 law in New York State allowed prosecutors to pursue terrorism charges if the defendant \"intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\"\nMangione's lawyer did not comment on that matter. However, he contended that he had yet to see evidence that would tie his defendant's weapon to Thompson's killing.\nMangione faced two additional counts of second-degree murder.\nMangione was held at State Correctional Institution Huntingdon, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania under maximum security without bail. He faces the potential penalty of life in prison with no parole for the murder.\nA court hearing was scheduled for December 19, that would decide whether Mangione would face extradition to New York for the murder charges. This is the same day as Mangione's preliminary hearing for gun charges in Pennsylvania.\nLocal police arrested Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on December 9, after an employee recognized and reported him.\nPolice arrived and questioned Mangione, and said that he became \"visibly nervous\" and started shaking when asked if he had been to New York recently, CBS News reported. The authorities charged Luigi Mangione with \"carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing instruments of crime,\" Australia's ABC News reported. \nPolice mentioned that he was found in possession of a \"ghost gun\" and a silencer that was consistent with the one used to slay Thompson, ABC News reported. He was also found in possession of fake IDs that were consistent with the ones he used while staying at a hostel in Manhattan, CBS News reported. The suspect was found carrying a large sum of cash, some of which was foreign currency, BBC News Online reported.\nAuthorities noted the suspect had a handwritten note about health insurance companies supposedly prioritising profits over customer care.\nCBS News reported that the New York Police Department (NYPD) clarified Mangione was never a UnitedHealthcare client and officials suggested he targeted Thompson because of the company's significant size and influence.\nNew York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch was quoted saying \"any attempt to rationalize this is vile, reckless and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice.\"\nMangione was originally from Maryland. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny recounted that prior to Mangione's arrest, his mother, who had reported her son missing on November 18, told the FBI that the murder \"might be something that she could see him doing.\""}
{"title": "International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Deif over alleged war crimes in Israel-Hamas war", "content": "Thursday, November 28, 2024   \n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants on November 21, 2024, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and senior Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif. The warrants accuse the three of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 2023-2024 Israel–Hamas war.\nIn response, Netanyahu’s office rejected the decision, calling it an expression of “antisemitism” in an official statement. Hamas, on the other hand, expressed support for the ICC's involvement. Several countries and organizations have voiced differing opinions on the matter.\nAccording to Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief, the ICC's decision is binding on all member states of the European Union. Non-member states like the U.S. reject the court, but several signatory states, including France, Italy and the Netherlands, have expressed their intention to follow ICC rules. The ICC’s decision has turned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others into internationally wanted suspects, exposing them to potential arrest during foreign travel.\nAccording to the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC, Netanyahu and Gallant are charged with co-perpetrating war crimes, including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, persecution, and systematic attacks on Palestinian civilian populations. Deif, who is accused of orchestrating and committing war crimes such as targeted rocket attacks and the intentional murder of Israeli civilians, was reported killed by Israel. While Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied the claim, the ICC stated it is still gathering information about his alleged death. Previously, the court dropped charges against seven individuals due to their deaths.\nThese warrants legally compel the 124 ICC member states to arrest officials should they enter their territories. Since the ICC lacks its own police force, it relies on member states to carry out arrests. Previous warrants have effectively limited the international movement of those involved, as member states are obligated to enforce these legal orders within their jurisdiction."}
