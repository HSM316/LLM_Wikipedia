{"title": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces UK budget 2021", "content": "Friday, March 5, 2021 \nChancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced the UK's 2021 budget on Wednesday in the House of Commons.  This comes amid significant damage to the country's economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, in which over 700 thousand people have lost their jobs, with the economy shrinking by 10%.\n\nSunak announced an extension of the furlough scheme, which had been paying employees who could not work due to the pandemic 80% of their wages.  He said it would be extended until September.  The scheme also mentioned firms would have to pay 10% of this in July, and 20% in the months of August and September as the scheme ends.  It was also announced that support for self-employed people would continue, with another grant for between February and April.\nOther support for workers included the minimum wage increasing to £8.91/hour from April, and an existing £20 weekly increase in Universal Credit being extended through September.\nSunak also announced some changes to taxation in the country, with corporation tax rising to 25% in April 2023.  Sunak said that this would be the lowest rate in the G7, and that businesses would only be taxed if they made profits of over £250 thousand, which is only 10% of companies.  Companies with profits of less than £50 thousand will continue to pay 19% corporation tax.  Sunak said that income tax, national insurance, and VAT would not change in this budget with alcohol and fuel duty continuing to be frozen.\nFor hospitality firms, VAT will continue to be frozen at a reduced rate of five percent.  The contactless payment limit will be increased from £45 to £100 this year.  New freeports were also announced in locations at East Midlands Airport; Felixstowe and Harwich; Humber; Liverpool City Region; Plymouth; Solent; and Thames and Teesside.  These would allow reduced customs costs, and encourages investment."}

The investigation is to be led by British lawyer Karim Ahmad Khan, who is scheduled to replace Bensouda as chief prosecutor on June 16.\n\nBensouda said \"[t]he decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years\".  Bensouda promised a \"principled, non-partisan, approach\" for the case and said the case will be handled \"independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor.\"  The preliminary examination was conducted in December 2019, finding \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip\".\nThe chief prosecutor said the probe will focus on alleged war crime committed since June 13, 2014, a few weeks before the Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip.  Bensouda said the priorities of investigation are to be \"determined in due time\".  She named both Israeli Defense Forces as well as Palestinian militant group Hamas as the potential perpetrators.\nPalestine is a member of the ICC since 2015 and has long accused Israel for war crimes.  Israel is not a member of the ICC and claims the court has no jurisdiction over Palestinian Territories because Palestine is not sovereign.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called ICC's decision \"the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy\" and said the court was \"turning a blind eye to Iran, Syria, and the other dictatorships that are committing real war crimes.\"\nIn the statement Netanyahu also said: \"Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists in the world who deliberately target civilians, it's our soldiers who are war criminals\".  He has promised to \"fight for the truth until we annul this scandalous decision\".  Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi called the ICC's decision \"morally bankrupt and legally flawed\".\nSpokesperson from the U.S. State Department Ned Price said \"[w]e will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security\".  Price also said ICC \"has no jurisdiction over this matter\".  Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Gilad Erdan promised to \"continue working together\" with the US.\nThe United States, also a non-member of the organisation, has targeted sanctions against the prosecutor's office under former US President Donald Trump. American Israel Public Affairs Committee urged current US President Joe Biden to keep the sanctions in place calling this move by ICC \"illegitimate, politically motivated investigation\".  The United States also opposes the ICC investigation on U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\nThe Foreign Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, which exercises authority in the West Bank, called the decision \"a long-awaited step that serves Palestine's tireless pursuit of justice and accountability\", while also asking nations not to politicise \"these independent proceedings\".\nSpokesperson for Hamas Hazem Qassem, who had asserted rocket attacks fired on Israel in 2014 were legal under international law, said: \"we welcomed the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people\".  Qassem also told the Associated Press it \"is a step forward to implement justice, punish the occupation, and do justice to the Palestinian people\". \nAccording to the estimates by the United Nations, 2200 Palestinians including 1500 civilians were killed in the 2014 Gaza war, referred to as Operation Protective Edge in Israel.  According to Israeli estimates at least 73 Israelis including six civilians were killed in that operation.\nThe Israeli government has conducted public relations and diplomatic campaigns in an attempt to prevent the investigation, The Associated Press reported."}

{"title": "Wales widens smoking ban, includes at hospitals, schools and playgrounds", "content": "Monday, March 1, 2021 \nToday, Wales extended the prohibition on smoking at hospitals, schools, and playgrounds, with violators to face a £100 fine.  Wales is the first of the UK nations to introduce this ban.\n\nThis is in addition to various restrictions on the practice, including a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in place since 2007 and a ban on smoking in cars with children in place since 2015.\nThe Welsh government, governed by left-wing party Welsh Labour, said the measure was to discourage adults and children alike from smoking by making it appear less normal, and encourage the already partaking to quit. \nTwo hospitals in the country's south have installed a button-activated speaker system to remind people hospitals are smoke-free.  In 2016, a similar mechanism was tried at hospitals across Wales, where an announcement recorded by local school children would play upon pressing a button.\nMinister for Mental Health, Wellbeing, and the Welsh Language Eluned Morgan said she was \"immensely proud to have brought into force this law\", and \"[t]his legislation will benefit the health of future generations in Wales, as fewer children will be exposed to smoking\".  She concluded, \"[w]e need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\nThe government was criticised by many smokers rights groups.  Simon Clark, Director of the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco compared the law to \"taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\", saying: \"There is no evidence that smoking in the open air poses a risk to anyone else's health, including children.\"  The director further explained, \"Banning smoking on hospital grounds is particularly unjust because it targets smokers who may be stressed and in need of a comforting cigarette.  Most smokers use their common sense and don't smoke around small children. They don't need politicians telling them how to behave.\"\nWikinews contacted Eluned Morgan's office to know more about this ban."}

Moore had raised nearly £ 33 million for the National Health Service (NHS) last year by walking 100 laps around his garden by his 100th birthday. He was also a World War II veteran who fought in the Burma campaign.\n\nHis daughters announced his death saying \"the last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable\", adding he was \"an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay in our hearts forever\".\nMoore was born in Keighley, in West Yorkshire, England. He joined the British Army in 1939. After leaving the army, he was an instructor in the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Bovington, Dorset. He moved to Bedfordshire in 2007 where his family lived.\nIn April 2020, he began to walk laps around his garden in an attempt to raise £1000 for the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. His campaign became highly popular, resulting in raising millions of pounds, and broke the Guiness world record for the most raised by an individual doing a charity walk. He also released a duet with singer Michael Ball, which reached number one on the UK charts, making Moore the oldest person to make this achievement. On his birthday, April 30, the British Army made him an honorary colonel; and in July, Elizabeth II knighted him for these achievements.\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid his respects, saying Moore was \"a hero in the truest sense of the word\", adding \"he embodied the triumph of the human spirit\". Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said \"Britain has lost a hero\". A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the Queen would send a private message of condolence to the family of Moore. Flags at buildings such as 10 Downing Street flew at half mast to pay respect.\nMoore had previously suffered from skin cancer on his head, and broke his hip in 2018. He said his hospital treatment inspired him to fundraise for the NHS, describing the staff who treated him as \"marvellous\". He is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren."}

The motion originated from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a global campaign supporting implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The motion called upon the council to write to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in indication of their support for the treaty.\n\nThe motion was moved at Tuesday's council meeting by Councillor Tony Crook, and seconded by Councillor Jane Greacen. While Crook acknowledged \"clearly this forum has very little influence over the use or production of nuclear weapons\", he acknowledged Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle, stating nuclear weapons \"have bought untold misery to communities around the world\". Councillor Arthur Allan opposed the motion, saying while he agreed with what Crook and Greacen had stated, the issue of nuclear weapons was a \"federal issue\" and the motion amounted to \"virtue signalling\".\nDeputy Mayor Mark Reeves supported the motion, contending it was an issue of \"moral standing\" and representing the views of the community, quipping \"nobody's said to me — 'You know what we need? A really good intercontinental ballistic missile in the shire.'\" Councillor Trevor Stowe called the motion \"feel-good stuff\" and \"an absolute waste of time\". \nThe vote ultimately resulted in a tie, with Crook, Greacen, Reeves, and Mayor Mendy Urie voting in support, and Councillors John White and Kirsten Van Diggele, as well as Allen and Stowe, voting against. Councillor Sonia Buckley abstained. Mayor Urie broke the tie in favour of the motion.\nThe Australian government has previously boycotted prohibition treaty talks, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stating \"a ban treaty risks undermining the [non-proliferation treaty] which Australia rightly regards as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation and disarmament architecture\". The opposition Labor Party has pledged to sign and ratify the treaty if elected to government."}

{"title": "International Criminal Court rules its jurisdiction includes Palestine", "content": "Monday, February 8, 2021 \nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled on Friday its territorial jurisdiction extends into the areas of Palestine, evoking objections from Israeli and U.S. officials.\nJudges said the 2-1 decision was based on Palestine's membership to its founding treaty, the Rome Statute, but said the court is not ruling on the statehood of the disputed territory, nor its borders. In a 60-page legal brief, the court claimed its \"territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine [...] extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\".\nChief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda expressed approval for the ruling's \"judicial clarity\", but said \"[t]he Office is currently analysing this decision & will then decide its next step guided strictly by its independent and impartial mandate\". Bensouda in December 2019 said \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip\", naming both the Israeli Defence Forces and Palestinian revolutionary group Hamas as potential perpetrators.\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh praised the ruling as \"a victory for justice and humanity\". Hamas also praised the ruling, as did the Palestinian Foreign Ministry and international organisation Human Rights Watch.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision as one of hypocrisy and said \"[w]hen the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes, this is pure anti-Semitism.\" In a videotaped statement, he claimed \"we will fight this perversion of justice with all our might!\"\nIsrael also accuses the international tribunal of injudiciously ruling on matters of politics and said jurisdiction cannot be extended to borders it claims has yet to be decided in peace talks. The Israeli military has systems in place to prevent misconduct, which systems have been criticised in the past as insufficient.\nThe United States also objected. State Department spokesman Ned Price said, in spite of President Joe Biden's promises to mend relations with Palestine the government was opposed not only to Friday's ruling but to Palestine being deemed a member of the Rome Statute at all.\nIn a statement, Price reiterated \"As we made clear when the Palestinians purported to join the Rome Statute in 2015, we do not believe the Palestinians qualify as a sovereign state, and therefore are not qualified to obtain membership as a state, or participate as a state in international organisations, entities, or conferences, including the ICC [...] the court’s jurisdiction should be reserved for countries that consent to it, or that are referred by the UN Security Council.\"\nBoth Israel and the United States have signed, but not ratified, the Rome Statute.  They do not recognise the court's jurisdiction.\nThe Israeli government was widely condemned amongst the international community for constructing settlements in disputed territory — where some 700,000 people now live."}

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio will cease producing a movie-adaptation of Nimona, which was scheduled to be released next year.\nBased in Greenwich, Connecticut, Blue Sky Studios was founded in 1987, and was later acquired by 20th Century FOX in 1999.  Blue Sky's control went to Disney in 2019 when Disney bought assets of FOX Studios for around US$71 billion.

{"title": "New Zealand announces new Matariki public holiday", "content": "Sunday, February 7, 2021 \nThe New Zealand Government on Thursday announced the creation of a new public holiday, Matariki. Matariki marks the beginning of the Māori New Year, which coincides with the rising of the star cluster Pleiades, known as Matariki in the Māori language.\n\nAt Waitangi, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said \"This will be a day to acknowledge our nation's unique, shared identity, and the importance of tikanga Māori. It's going to be something very special, and something uniquely New Zealand.\" Ardern also said the new holiday would break up the over-4 month gap between public holidays in June and October.\nThe date of the Matariki holiday is not consistent from year to year, as it follows Maramataka, the Māori lunar calendar, but would likely always fall on a Monday or Friday according to Ardern. A Matariki advisory group has been established, with Māori Crown Relations — Te Arawhiti — Minister Kelvin Davis explaining that the purpose of the group is \"to provide advice on future dates of the public holiday, how it should be celebrated and to support the development of resources to educate the public on Matariki and the celebrations\". The first Matariki holiday is scheduled for Friday, June 24 of next year.\nArdern's Labour Party made the Matariki holiday an election promise, and won last year's general election with a majority. This result was the best for any party since New Zealand's 1996 adoption of a mixed-member proportional system.\nThis is not the first attempt to make Matariki a public holiday. In 2009, Māori Party Member of Parliament Rahui Katene introduced legislation to create a Matariki public holiday. While it was supported by the then-opposition Labour Party, the governing National Party did not support it, and it was defeated with 59 votes in favour and 63 votes against."}

This malnutrition crisis is in part caused by COVID-19 border closures, according to The Korea Times.\nIn the statement, the director of the Research Institute for Nutrition Care of Children, which is a part of the Academy of Medical Science of the DPRK, described the report as \"a sheer lie\", \"seriously distorted\" and being \"a black-hearted act of hostility to tarnish the image of our country\". The statement further added: In our country, nutrition care of children is deemed a top priority despite difficult conditions and insufficiency. [...] But those self-styled experts wearing the berets of UN are distorting the situation of our country in order to create an impression that serious \"malnutrition of children\" exists in our country.\nUN's report published on March 10 used the observations of Tomás Ojea Quintana, special rapporteur on the matter of human rights in North Korea.  In the report, Quintana said COVID-19 led to deaths by starvation following the decline in business.  UN's report mentioned \"several individuals who were caught breaking anti-epidemic prevention measures were reportedly executed in public\".  These alleged executions are said to have taken place in cities including the country's capital city, Pyongyang, where a man was allegedly executed for having partaken in 'illicit trade' with China, the report elaborated.\nIn a The Korea Times article, an unnamed non-governmental organisation said \"approximately 440 thousand children and pregnant and lactating women will not receive micronutrients, approximately 95 thousand acutely malnourished children will not receive necessary treatment and approximately 101 thousand kindergarten-aged children will not receive fortified foods\".\nBorder restrictions in North Korea have been implemented as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19, but the restrictions have caused shortages of necessary goods such as medicine, Reuters reported quoting Russia's diplomatic mission to North Korea.

{"title": "Chinese NPC to take control of Hong Kong electoral system", "content": "Sunday, March 7, 2021 \nThe Chinese National People's Congress put forward plans on Friday that would mean electoral candidates from Hong Kong would have to be thoroughly vetted before being allowed to run.  The plans ensure that only \"patriots\" to the People's Republic of China would be allowed to run.  This comes after protests against the republic over the last two years, with 47 pro-democracy election candidates, activists, and campaigners remaining in jail on national security laws.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said he would \"resolutely guard against and deter\" interference from other countries during the annual work report.  Li delivered a speech to about 3000 members of the congress.  As a result, a draft decision was made, containing recommendations from Wang Chen, who is the vice chair of the standing committee of the NPC.  It included modifications to the Hong Kong constitution, including granting a committee that currently elects the chief executive additional powers to \"directly participate in the nomination of all legislative council members\", and create \"a qualification vetting system for the whole process\".\nPolitical scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Willy Lam told Agence France-Presse the vetting committee proposed by the NPC would to disqualify any candidate from running for office who was seen as not being loyal to the Chinese Communist Party.  After the plans were announced, Beijing's liaison office said \"from all walks of life in Hong Kong have voiced their support\" for the changes.\nIn last year's work report, national security laws were introduced that gave the Chinese government more powers to convict residents of Hong Kong and prevent them from running for office.  On Thursday, 47 pro-democracy activists and potential election candidates were still being held after an informal \"primary poll\" they had carried out, which prosecutors said was designed to \"overthrow\" the government. \nThis comes after about a thousand protestors had gathered outside the Hong Kong court on Monday demanding the release of what they called \"political prisoners\", The Guardian reported.  Those arrested were charged under the laws on Sunday.  The Guardian said 32 were denied bail, in part because the national security laws make it difficult for those arrested to be given bail.  Fifteen defendants were granted bail that prosecutors opposed."}

Ingenuity is a part of Perseverance's mission, which primarily focuses on astrobiology, and Ingenuity is planned to fly and explore Mars and gather rocks samples looking for signs of life.\n\nIngenuity has previously been in the belly of Perseverance, a car-sized rover which landed on Mars' Jezero Crater on February 18.  Perseverance charged Ingenuity and kept it warm.  Ingenuity left the rover on Sunday, after which the rover moved away to expose Ingenuity's photovoltaic array to direct sunlight.\n\nThe NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory released a statement saying this was the first time Ingenuity survived the night by itself while being exposed to the planet atmosphere directly.  In the statement NASA wrote this has confirmed they have \"the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a big win for the team.\"  The temperatures could go as low as -90 °C (-130 °F), the statement said.  The helicopter used the energy from its solar array to power a small heater and protect its electronics from the cold.\nMars just has 1% of atmosphere as compared to Earth.  Ingenuity's propeller had to rotate about three times faster for flight on the Martian atmosphere as compared to flying on Earth, ABC News reported.  Ingenuity has been designed to be light to make the takeoff easier.  Its mass is about 1.8 kilograms.  Tim Canham from NASA said \"The processor on the helicopter is about 100 times more powerful than the processor on the rover itself\".\nThe next step would be a blade movement test scheduled for today, CNN said.  If successful, it would be followed by first flight test, which can take place by Sunday.  That would be the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.  Five flights were expected to occur in the next 31 days.  If successful, they would be followed by further movement of the helicopter, as it would collect samples of rocks, and collect photos of its observations.  Throughout the entire duration of research, Ingenuity would also measure its temperatures and battery recharge performance.\nPerseverance rover is to deliver images from Ingenuity to Earth, reportedly a few hours after they were captured.  NASA said the rover travelled a distance of 471 million km to reach the crater."}

The decision, passed 166–132 in a parliament of 300, was opposed by many students and professors, who claim it would stifle freedom of expression.\nChanges proposed included establishment of a campus police division, restriction of entry into university grounds, and formation of a \"disciplinary council\" empowered to suspend or expel students.\nA Ministry for Citizen Protection spokesperson called university campus violence \"timeless\"; and said \"[t]he police will drive out extremist political groups and guard the infrastructure, finally making the university a safe place\".\nPrior to the vote, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, leader of the centre-right New Democracy political party which first introduced the legislation, told lawmakers \"[n]owhere in the world do we see images [...] of historical buildings being vandalised\".\nMany incidents of unrest have occurred at Greek universities, including a 1973 student revolt at Athens Polytechnic against the 1967–1974 military junta.  The government forcefully repressed the uprising, resulting in the death of at least 26.  Due to another protest in 1990–91 against high school reform pushed by Mitsotakis' father Konstantinos, one teacher died.  In October, a rector was taken hostage by hooded anarchists.\nIn 2019, the government repealed a restriction in place since 1982 that had effectively prevented police from entering university grounds.\nOpponents of the introduction of police at universities have described it as stifling freedom of expression, which the government claimed is \"ridiculous\".  At recent demonstrations, protestors have chanted \"Bread, education and freedom\", a common anti-junta slogan of the 1973 uprising.  In January, Athenian police used tear gas to break up a protest which was defying lockdown restrictions.\nMany Greek professors have also opposed the idea, with Professor of State Theory and Law at Panteion University Dimitris Kaltsonis claiming, in remarks to Euronews, \"there is no need for special police to control the campuses\".  Oxford University's University and College Union (UCU) stated on Twitter \"its solidarity to Greek colleagues [...] opposing the creation of such a special university police force, which is unlikely to respond to the most pertinent problems of Greek higher education institutions\", and that the then-proposal was \"alarming and not in line with best practice.\"\nSome recent demonstrators have called for \"more doctors, fewer police\".  Eurostat data from 2016–2018, which a spokesperson for the Ministry for Citizen Protection called \"inaccurate\", showed Greece had the second most police officers per capita of any country in the European Union.  The spokesperson said the government is \"investing in the quality of education as well\", but emphasised \"[p]olice on campuses is not a choice, but a necessary move\".\n€23 million was recently budgeted for Greek law enforcement to better \"face contemporary challenges, such as COVID-19 and external threats\".\nLeft-wing opposition party Syriza has criticised the legislation as an attempt to make universities \"sterile and unfree\"."}

The states Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat among others have reported a shortage of oxygen; India Today reported on the Ahmedabad Medical Association pleading the state government for oxygen, writing to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani \"[i]f such conditions persist, the death toll will rise, violence against doctors will increase and doctors will be forced to shut down their hospitals due to lack of oxygen supply\".\nNationally, the government has shifted its focus from vaccine exporting to domestic production, entering 114 million jabs in peoples' arms — the third-most, behind the US and China — and three million on Wednesday after recently approving for emergency use its third vaccine: Russia-developed Sputnik V.  The government maintains there is not an oxygen shortage and that the primary issue with distributing inoculations to states is over-planning, not a supply shortage.\nNew Delhi announced stay-at-home orders and shuttered restaurants, malls, gyms and spas, with an exception for movie theatres at limited times and at limited capacity.  Mumbai went further Wednesday, closing most industries, businesses and public places and restricting movement of people amidst a surge of labourers to the city.  In addition to many cities and towns, the epicentral city of Maharashtra imposed a curfew, with only essential services open between 8pm and 7am.  The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 exams have been cancelled, and Class 12 exams postponed. \nThere has also been 1038 new deaths, adding to the total death count of over 173 thousand and putting a strain on local cremation centres and burial grounds.

This decision allowed rent to be increased as the Court ruling invalidated the previously introduced law which had capped the rent for about 90% of renters in the country.  Protesters gathered in the capital city of Berlin with demonstrations against the ruling and against the possible increases in rent.  Some demanded dispossessions of large real estate companies.\n\nProtesters gathered in Berlin's Neukölln and Kreuzberg districts, and reportedly thousands of people participated.  The crowd reportedly walked from Hermannplatz towards Kottbusser Tor and then to Oranienplatz.  Police closed several streets for the day.  Organizers said 25 thousand people reportedly joined the protest, The Berlin Spectator reported.\n\nProtesters marched with posters such as \"You can have our hatred, You do not get our rent. (Housing is not a commodity.)\" ((de))German language: ‍unseren hass den konnt ihr haben, unsere miete bekomm ihr nicht (wohnenist keine ware) and \"The rich should pay! (Social struggles connects [us].)\" ((de))German language: ‍die reichen sollen zahlen (soziale kämpfe verbinden).  Some protesters brought lids of boiling of frying pans and made noise.  The German word for lid is same as the one for rent cap.  They reportedly chanted slogan \"If you take a cover from us, we'll come back with thousands.\".\nThe Social Democratic Greens and Left parties' coalition previously introduced the rent cap through the country's Senate in February last year, citing raising rent prices in the country. Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union alliance and the Free Democratic party had filed the appeal leading to the present ruling.\nThe overturned ruling by Berlin State Government had previously fixed the rent from February 2020 to February 2025 on its June 2019 level.  A senator who was in charge of urban development, Sebastian Scheel, commented about his disappointment, and said either the federal government or any of the states now had an opportunity to create laws to control the rent."}

Similar troop withdrawals by the United Kingdom and NATO were also announced.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump had set May 1 as the deadline.  Both the US and NATO allies are to begin troop withdrawals on May 1.  The date of conclusion of the US withdrawal is to coincides with the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, incidents which began the US-led incursion into Afghanistan, now the nation's longest war.\nSpeaking from the room George W. Bush announced the US had launched airstrikes on Al-Qaeda training camps, Biden said \"[w]e went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.  That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. [...]  We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result\".  On the war's longevity, Biden said \"I'm now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats.  I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth\".\nBiden said of a worldwide threat assessment claiming \"the Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield\" and \"American troops shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries.  That's nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely.\"  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in a tweet \"we will work with our U.S. partners to ensure a smooth transition.\" \nThe US currently has about 2500 troops stationed in Afghanistan of a NATO mission of 9600; according to NPR, as many as 1000 special operations forces may be present as well.  However, combat operations from both the US and UK ended in October 2014.\nBiden said \"[i]t's time for American troops to come home\", the exit will be done \"responsibly, deliberately and safely\".  Though NATO and the United Kingdom will join the US in making considerable withdrawals in the coming months, according to the BBC the US will continue \"diplomatic and humanitarian work\" in Afghanistan.\nNATO has said they have achieved their goal of \"prevent[ing] terrorists from using Afghanistan as a safe haven to attack us\", and \"[t]here is no military solution to the challenges Afghanistan faces\".  According to Politico, NATO' statement read: \"Our troops went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted together, and now we are leaving together\".  Defence Minister of Germany, a NATO member, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told the German public broadcaster ARD \"we'll go in together, we'll leave together.  I am for an orderly withdrawal\".\nPledging co-operation, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Brussels \"I am here to work closely with our allies [...] on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together and out together.\"\nAccording to the BBC, in announcing the British \"drawdown\" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said while \"[t]he people of Afghanistan deserve a peaceful and stable future\", \"the security of our people currently serving in Afghanistan remains our priority and we have been clear that attacks on Allied troops will be met with a forceful response.\"  Wallace said in his statement \"we must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten.\"\nAfter a phone call to the former President Bush, Biden said \"[w]e're absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, the courage and integrity of the women and men of the United States armed forces who have served\".\nIn the United States Senate, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the move \"a grave mistake\", adding \"[f]oreign terrorists will not leave the United States alone simply because our politicians have grown tired of taking the fight to them.\"  Republican Representative Liz Cheney called it \"a huge victory, huge propaganda victory, for the Taliban, for Al-Qaida\".  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan criticised the plan saying \"Withdrawal of U.S. troops must be based on the facts on the ground, not arbitrary deadlines\".  Her fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren said Biden \"recognizes the reality that our continued presence there does not make the U.S. or the world safer.\"  Former US President Barack Obama gave his support as well, saying it was \"the right decision\".\nDirector of the US' Central Intelligence Agency told the Senate \"I think we have to be clear-eyed about the reality, looking at the potential terrorism challenge\", there is a \"significant risk\" and \"Al-Qaida and ISIS in Afghanistan\" could pose a threat to \"US targets\"."}

Arirang News asserted the \"peaceful spring\" refers to the inter-Korean meetings held in April 2018.\n\nIn her statement, Kim described 'the south Korean authorities' as \"all born with stupidity\" and \"become the dumb and deaf bereft of judgment\".  In response to the drills — which the North Korean government reportedly perceived as a threat — Kim expressed the possibility of closing various inter-Korean organizations like the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country and the Kumgangsan International Tourism Bureau.  \"We also examine the issue of dissolving the Kumgangsan International Tourism Bureau and other organizations concerned as any cooperation and exchange with the south Korean authorities antagonizing us are no longer necessary\", Kim said.\nTowards the end of the statement, Kim said, \"If it [the United States] wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.\"\nSpeaking to Arirang News, Yang Moo-Jin, the vice president for public affairs at the University of North Korean Studies, said the message indicates \"the regime is willing to talk [...] as long as the South [Korean authorities] show some sincerity by not raising tensions through the joint drills\".  Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at the Kyungnam University, said the North \"is reaffirming its long-held stance that there will be no talks unless sanctions against the regime are lifted\".  In an interview with Arirang News, Andrei Lankov, the director of the Korea Risk Group, said the message is nothing out of the ordinary, and similar messages have been coming each spring and the contents of this message are not to be overestimated.  He qualified the statement as being \"business as usual\" and \"by the North Korean standards it's pretty tame\"."}

He would now lead a church of 12 million faithful in the former Yugoslav republics, the disputed region of Kosovo, and associated dioceses in Australia, the United States, and Western Europe.\nHe has expressed conservative pro-government views in the past, writing a critique in December of Serbian reporter and human rights advocate Sonja Biserko.  Perić also encouraged the firing of outspoken professors at the Faculty of Theology in Belgrade.\nA current controversy concern Church property in neighbouring Montenegro.  A law passed in 2019 requires evidence for ownership of property in Montenegro built before 1918, and the — relatively recent — Montenegrin Orthodox Church continues to claim all Orthodox property in the country as its own, in spite of most being controlled by the Serbian Church.\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church refuses to recognise Kosovo as independent, which is also the official position of Russia and Serbia.  Kosovo contains many important religious sites in Orthodox Christianity and is considered a cradle of the religion.  Perić was ordained as monk at Decani monastery in Kosovo.\nThe election took place amongst 39 eligible bishops of the Holy Assembly of Bishops, who voted in a secret ballot at Belgrade's Memorial Cathedral of Saint Sava.  After deliberation, three candidates are chosen and their names placed in envelopes.  Perić's name, pulled at random, is considered to believers an expression of the Holy Spirit's will. \nA thanksgiving service immediately followed the election.\nOrthodox Christianity is the predominant faith in Serbia, Montenegro, and disputed Kosovo, and has considerable impact on public life."}

It also stated there may be a relation between \"very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia\".\nOver 469 reports, including 191 from the European Economic Area, it was concluded \"[o]verall the number of thromboembolic events reported after vaccination [...] was lower than that expected in the general population.\" \nAccording to multiple sources, many countries in Europe and elsewhere halted inoculations after reports of blood clots and deaths from those who received the jab, while countries including Austria paused rollout of certain batches.\nOn Thursday, the World Health Organization said in a press briefing countries should still use the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said while \"we do not know whether some or all of the conditions have been caused by the vaccine or by other coincidental factors [...] the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks\".  The international body was to release the results of its report on Friday.\nWhile nations can choose whether or not to follow EMA advice, many countries said they would only resume inoculations with its approval.  On Tuesday, when the preliminary statement was \"encouraging\", France and Italy said they would \"promptly restart\" if positive results were found. \nAstraZeneca said there is no elevated risk of blood clotting as a result of its vaccine, and of the 17 million inoculated in the EU and the UK, only 37 reports of blood clots were received; \"much lower than would be expected to occur naturally\" and \"similar across other licensed COVID-19 vaccines\". \nThe recent suspensions have only further exacerbated the European Union's vaccine drive, hindered by serious supply shortages.

Floyd was 46 years old. The incident was recorded on video by a bystander, and the video shows Floyd repeatedly saying \"I can't breathe\". Floyd's death prompted protests around the world.\n45-year-old Chauvin was charged with three different crimes: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. The trial began on March 29.\n\nIn his defense, Chauvin's lawyers argued his actions were \"reasonable\" and sought to cast doubt on the cause of Floyd's death, arguing a heart condition and the use of illegal drugs by Floyd were to blame. The defense witnesses included both an expert on the use of force by police, and a forensic pathologist. The Associated Press reported that Floyd's system contained both fentanyl and methamphetamine.\nWitnesses for the prosecution, including a forensic pathologist, a cardiologist, and a pulmonologist, testified the cause of death was a lack of oxygen — asphyxia — due to the way in which Chauvin pinned Floyd against the ground, and Chauvin used excessive force in violation of his training.\nThe jury returned guilty verdicts on all three charges after deliberating for two days. Three other Minneapolis police officers, Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Lane, have been charged with aiding-and-abetting Chauvin and are awaiting trial.

{"title": "Wikinews discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman after GitHub re-enables public access to youtube-dl", "content": "Wednesday, April 21, 2021 \n\nOn November 16, code-sharing and hosting service GitHub re-enabled the public access to youtube-dl repository, a software which can download videos from the internet via the command-line.  This move comes after Mitchell Stoltz, a Senior Staff Attorney of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent a letter to GitHub on the behalf of youtube-dl's maintainers.  The repository was previously blocked on October 23,  after GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nStarted in July 2008, youtube-dl is a free/libré open source software written in Python which can download videos from various websites.  Citing alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems, RIAA's takedown notice had alleged youtube-dl was intended to circumvent the technological protection measures of streaming services and to redistribute music videos without authorisation.  youtube-dl's source code had a number of unit tests to check if the software works in different circumstances or not.  Some of the test cases included URLs of some copyrighted songs.\n\nIn the letter to GitHub, EFF's attorney Stoltz said \"This file contains series of automated tests that verify the functionality of youtube-dl for streaming various types of video.  The youtube-dl source code does not, of course, contain copies of these songs or any others [...] the unit tests do not cause a permanent download or distribution of the songs they reference; they merely stream a few seconds of each song to verify the operation of youtube-dl.  Streaming a small portion of a song in a non-permanent fashion to test the operation of an independently created software program is a fair use.\"  The letter stressed  \"youtube-dl does not decrypt video streams that are encrypted with commercial DRM technologies\".\nThe URLs to copyrighted songs were removed from the source code on November 16, and replaced with a test video that uploaded on YouTube by Philipp Hagemeister, former maintainer of youtube-dl.  Philipp Hagemeister had previously spoken about the takedown with Wikinews.\nyoutube-dl comes with a small JavaScript interpreter where it acts as a web-browser would behave while receiving video data from the server.  The script has \"extractors\" for various websites to handle videos from different sources.  \"Any software capable of running JavaScript code can derive the URL of  the  video  stream  and  access  the  stream,  regardless  of  whether  the  software  has  been approved by YouTube\", the letter read.  It borrowed an analogy of Doors of Durin from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings for explanation: travelers come upon a door that has writing in a foreign language.  When translated, the writing says \"say 'friend' and enter.\"  The  travelers say \"friend\" and the door opens.  As with the writing on that door, YouTube presents instructions on accessing video streams to everyone who comes asking for it.\nHours after the public access was restored, Sergey M, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl wrote on GitHub, \"We would like to thank @github for standing up for youtube-dl and making it possible to continue development without dropping any features.  We appreciate [GitHub] for taking potential legal risks in this regard.  We would also like to thank [EFF] and personally [Mitch Stoltz] for invaluable legal help.  We would also like to heartily thank our main website hoster Uberspace who is currently being sued in Germany for hosting our essentially business card website and who have already spent thousands of Euros in their legal defense.\"\nHours after GitHub restored the public access to the repository, Stoltz tweeted \"I think of youtube-dl as a successor to the videocassette recorder.  The VCR empowered people to take control of their personal use of free-to-air video, but it had to be saved from the copyright cartel.  The same goes for youtube-dl.  GitHub did the right thing here.\"\n\nyoutube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world.  Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on Wikimedia Commons are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media.  youtube-dl also lets users download videos from LiveLeak — a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism.  Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence.  \nWhen a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work.  YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.\nIn the blog post announcing \"youtube-dl is back\", GitHub said, \"Although we did initially take the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn't mean it can't also be used to access works in non-infringing ways.  We also understood that this project's code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or public domain videos.\"\nGitHub also announced any new 1201 takedown notices will be \"carefully scrutinised by legal experts\" to reject \"unwarranted claims\", and said it will side with software developers if the claims are ambiguous.  The announcement also mentioned GitHub Trust and Safety team would treat developer's tickets as a \"top priority\".  GitHub also pledged donation of USD 1 million for developer defense fund \"to help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA Section 1201 takedown claims\".\nGitHub had blocked public access to many forks of youtube-dl upon receiving the DMCA notice in October.  At that time, Wikinews noted public access was not yet restored for the forked repositories listed in RIAA's copyright notice and was still displays \"Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown\".\nDuring the period when GitHub had disabled public access for the repository, Sergey M had been developing youtube-dl and hosting it on GitLab, another code-sharing and hosting site.  However, since GitHub has restored public access of youtube-dl, Sergey M has made the GitLab repository private.\nAfter this, Wikinews reached out to Richard Stallman, the founder of Free Software Foundation, who has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now, to discuss the harms of DRM and DMCA 1201."}

According to members of the European Parliament (MEP) those will ensure 57% net reduction target is in place.  This claim has been disputed by senior policy officer for climate and energy at the European Environmental Bureau Barbara Mariani, who says the measures equal a 52.8% cut in actual emissions.\nA September 2020 press release by the European Commission (EC) promised \"[f]ollowing broad public consultation and thorough impact assessments, the Commission will come forward with the corresponding legislative proposals by June 2021\", including, according to the BBC News a limit on CO2 removal that counts toward the target, encouraging member states to actually reduce carbon emissions instead of merely removing them. \"Adopting the new target in time would allow the EU to communicate its higher ambition to international partners well ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow and set the bar for others to follow\", the press release read.\nThis decision means the EU is to spend at least 30% of its €1.8 trillion long-term budget on the concerns related to the climate.  Poland has adopted its own climate strategy.  According to Reuters, Poland is the only EU member state to refuse a pledge to climate neutrality, instead aiming to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030.  The country relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, but will move towards renewable energy and its first nuclear power plant, Reuters reported.\nThe EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the decision leads \"the EU on a green path for a generation\".  Criticising this decision, MEP Michael Bloss said, \"[w]e fought hard but achieved little\", as well as saying the law was a \"big disappointment.\"  Director of Climate Action Network Europe Wendel Trio said \"[t]he 'at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030' is not in line with the Paris Agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century\", adding the law was \"rushed\" and \"not the kind of climate law that will help the EU to lead the global efforts to tackle climate change\".\nMEP and chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee Pascal Canfin said \"it was not possible\" to convince the member states \"to change the wording 'at least 55 net'\", and while \"parliament was obviously ready to go even further\", he said \"the compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.\"\nAccording to The Guardian under current measures the EU is expected to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030.  The EC's press release said between 1990 and 2019, green house gas emissions fell by a quarter.\nPer multiple reports, the United Kingdom set its target to 78% by 2035."}

This 12.5% rate benefits large corporations including Apple, Google and Facebook which account for one in eight jobs in the country.  According to CNBC, corporate tax receipts in Ireland totalled €11.8 billion in 2020, and the Department of Finance has projected, according to The Irish Times that figure increase from €11.6 billion in 2021 to €12.5 billion by 2025.\nDonohoe also said Ireland's low taxes serve as an incentive to attract jobs and investment, saying while he supported an agreement with \"appropriate and acceptable tax competition\", it must be lower than the 21% proposed by the United States.  \nDonohoe said nations should recognise the low tax rates present in Ireland and other small countries, citing \"advantages of scale, location, resources, industrial heritage\" present in larger ones.  Defending his own long-established rate, Donohoe said a 12.5% rate is \"within the ambit of healthy tax competition\" as a rate which \"stimulate[s] investment, growth and innovation, which are core to Ireland's industrial policy\".  According to The Guardian, current proposals would shrink Ireland's corporate tax base by 20%; and tax receipts to be €2 billon lower than it would otherwise be in 2025, per Irish Department of Finance.\nBrian Keegan, the director of public policy at Chartered Accountants Ireland said it was \"not tax change, it's political change\".  Head of tax for the OECD Pascal Saint-Amans said \"there is a new dynamic that is likely to bring us to a resolution\", and the US' willingness to address expressed concerns simplifies an admittedly-complex blueprint.  \nA spokesperson for the Irish Department of Finance told CNBC on Monday \"political level discussions on these issues have not yet taken place\".\nThe Guardian reported many companies in Ireland pay less on revenues as compared to other countries; with Apple paying as little as 0.005% in 2014.  A European Commission ruling in 2016 ordered Apple to pay €13 billion it owed back taxes to the Government of Ireland ; it was struck down in July on the grounds \"[t]he commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage.\""}

The US Department of Commerce defended the high rates, ranging from 9.49 to 59.72% on steel and 60.81% on transformers, by citing the \"adverse facts available\" (AFA) provision.\nThe AFA calls on accused companies to provide comprehensive information, or otherwise face significant anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. After negotiation failed, South Korea formally filed a suit with the global trade body in February 2018.\nA three-person WTO panel concluded the US Commerce Department had failed to specify in detail what information South Korean companies were to supply, and improperly ignored or rejected some of what was submitted. The tariffs imposed on Hyosung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems, Hyundai Steel, and POSCO, therefore, were considered inconsistent with WTO guidelines.\nHowever, the panel did not uphold South Korea's claim US authorities had an \"unwritten measure\" encouraging its use of adverse facts to justify higher duties.\nThe United States may appeal within 60 days. However, due to restrictions imposed by former President Donald Trump on the Appellate Body, it has less than a quorum.\nThe European Union joined the case, citing as justification the plight of British, Dutch, and Italian steelworkers under US practice. \nA 2018 ruling between the United States and Canada also found evidence of negligence involving the provision."}

Over the course of the prior five days, these heavy rains caused floods and hazards to farms and dwellings, with up to a month quantity of rainfall falling within 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday in some areas, notably 150mm of rain at the Great Dividing Range, Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, BoM said the situation reportedly started to ease, with rains moving towards the east, but emphasised the water levels were continuing to rise in some areas and many flood alerts remained active.  Meteorologists said the eastern areas may clear from floodwater quickly, the other regions to the west of the Great Dividing Range would be affected for much longer, potentially weeks or months before the water levels come back to normal.  Thick fog was likely to occur at approximately this coming weekend as air temperatures drop below dew point at night and mist may develop, meteorologists warned, as News.com.au reported.\n\nIn Taree, NSW, ABC News reported multiple cows rescues in rivers and in the surf, and an instance of a dwelling being reportedly swept from premises on a wedding day of its owners.  ABC News reported a farmer losing his animals and his house at Mid-North Coast.  Of residential areas, Hawkesbury continued to experience raising levels of flood as of Monday.  Ian Wright, a researcher from Western Sydney University, commented saying the floods in Hawkesbury are dangerous due to the terrain and rigorous water supply from adjacent rivers to the area, citing a related publication about it by the State Emergency Service.\nOn Monday, NSW Police has rescued a 80-year old woman trapped in a car at River Road, Wyong, Central Coast, with the car subsequently falling into the river shortly after the rescue was completed.\nLocal authorities warned people to stay away from flooded areas.

Since 1994, the area's six historical societies have received a yearly grant of A$500 each from the council for administrative purposes.  In her speech, Johnson spoke about historical societies as a \"repository of information for [the council]\", and stressed that they needed to \"remain alive and viable\" to provide services to the council when needed.\nThe meeting of the council which Johnson spoke at was unscheduled, coming about after the council's draft budget was released on April 12, with a period of 28 days being allowed for submissions on proposals in the draft budget.  Johnson, who submitted on behalf of the Latrobe Combined History Group, opted to also speak on her written submission at the Monday's meeting.\nJohnson mentioned rising communication costs in her speech, saying that in the past few years, postage costs have doubled.  While historical societies have attempted to reduce costs by moving to the internet, said Johnson, this still meant spending on domain names, software and web development.  Societies are also obligated to test and tag their equipment, and in the case of the Traralgon Historical Society, the expense for this is in excess of A$250 annually.\nJohnson said that each society has had to make its own changes on meeting increased cost and demand, citing the Traralgon Historical Society as an example, which reduced the number of bulletins it produces, and stopped outsourcing production of bulletins to local businesses, which Johnson said took \"income away from businesses within the town\".  She concluded her speech by remarking that historical societies \"need to remain here if we are able to have that for future generations\".\nIn her written submission, Johnson requested A$1000 per society, and confirmed  after a question from Councillor Dale Harriman that such a suggestion would cost the council A$3000 more than the status quo.  Harriman stated that \"there's ongoing work [that historical societies] are doing for council, of great benefit to the whole community, and we're paying [historical societies] A$500 like we did seventeen years ago\".\nHarriman also asked Johnson how much historical societies were charging for the work they were doing.  In one example, Traralgon and Moe societies provided maps to identify asbestos in residential housing, with Johnson saying that the cost charged was A$400, to which Harriman responded that A$400 was \"less than it cost you to actually chase up and find them\".\nThe Latrobe Combined History Group, which Johnson represents, includes six historical societies from Boolarra, Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Yallourn North and Yinnar."}

The Navy also declared the submarine's crew of 53 dead, and said the wreckage was found.\nAccording to Air Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto, pictures received were of the parts of the submarine such as the rear vertical rudder, anchors, outer pressure body, and embossed dive rudder.\nThe Navy stated on Saturday, the submarine was now considered sunk, not merely missing, having previously said that the oxygen supply would have run out by Saturday morning.\nPer reports, items were found from the submarine that included a bottle of grease, prayer mats and a piece of metal pipe.  The ones found near the last location of the submarine were parts of the submarine itself, and would not have gotten out unless there was water pressure, Tjahjanto said.\nTjahjanto also said there was an oil spill in the area and the debris were indications the submarine had a leakage due to diving too deep, or released the oil while rising to the surface.\nThe search team focused on determining the exact location of the submarine, but authorities warned it would be hard to do any salvage operation because of the deep waters.\nThe Singapore Navy's MV Swift Rescue submarine rescue ship helped in the effort and deployed a robot which took the images. Other countries including Malaysia, the United States, India and Australia aided search for potential rescue.  KRI Rigel, an Indonesian ship, scanned the area where the submarine was presumed to have sunk using multi-beam sonar and a magnetometer.\nAccording to military chief Yudo Margono, the scan determined the submarine to be at a depth of 850 metres.  According to Al Jazeera, it was well below its survivable limit of 500 metres.  \"The cracks happened gradually in some parts when it went down\", Margono said."}

Editing under the name Pi zero, he was at the time the top contributor to Wikinews by edit count, and came third on English Wikibooks. Dr Shutt was 56 years old.\n\nDr Shutt's elder sister, Ms Barbara Shutt, informed Wikinews about his death via email on early Friday.  His mother Elsie Shutt had called 9-1-1 emergency services after he had trouble breathing.  By the time the ambulance came, Dr Shutt was unconscious.  Ms Barbara Shutt also added the doctors operated on him for two hours, but at the end, Dr Shutt died either by blood clots or by a series of heart attacks.\nDr Shutt was the most active editor and administrator on this project and had been contributing as Pi zero since September 2008. He was promoted to administrator in July 2010 and became a reviewer in August 2009.  Since then, he has peer-reviewed then published over a thousand news articles on-wiki, the most recent being just a day before his death.  He made over 160 thousand edits and over 120 thousand log entries on English Wikinews.\nHe also held reviewer and administrator privileges on English Wikibooks, having contributed to several wikibooks including Conlang, World Religions, Solar System and The Elements; and created Stacks, a mechanism for sorting the project's content.\nDr Shutt would occasionally write blogs on his blogger called \"Structural insight\".  Dr Shutt was interested in constructed languages (conlangs).  He was an avid reader, and enjoyed J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novels.\nIn a discussion about Tolkien's works last year, Dr Shutt said, \"I read The Hobbit when I was, I think, a teenager.  I read it again a few months ago; not sure if I ever read it between those times.  It's a wonderfully written story --- by a linguist and, in fact, a conlanger.  I've got the Lord of the Rings (the books, I mean), which I've read at least a couple of times over the years.  And the Silmarillion, which covers the earliest part of Tolkien's legendarium.  Christopher Tolkien, his son who was close to his fantasy writing, is his literary executor and has spent the past half century of his life editing and publishing various of his father's papers.  I actually got for christmas... a year ago, I think, The Fall of Gondolin, which Christopher says will be the last of his father's books that he publishes.\"\nDr Shutt was awarded a PhD in Computer Science in 2011 from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Massachusetts.  His research interests included Abstraction theory; the Kernel programming language, a Lisp-based language which he created and was his dissertation topic; Recursive Adaptive Grammars, the core of his master's thesis as well as Self-Modifying Finite Automata which he developed with Roy Rubinstein.  He had received his master's degree in 1993, five years after finishing his bachelor's degree, both from WPI.  Dr John Shutt was also interested in adaptive grammar as well as category theory.  He often programmed in Lisp, enjoyed xkcd comics and used Emacs as his choice of text editor.\nHe had spent one year at the Brown University for his post-graduate academics.  Recalling the experience, Dr. Shutt said, \"I spent one year at Brown, but it didn't work.  And was a traumatic experience for me; it took me a couple of years to recover enough to make a second try at graduate school.\"  Dr Shutt shared an office with Paul Howard in the 1988/89 academic year at Brown University.  In July 2019, Dr Shutt said, \"It saddens me that I forgot to wish Paul Howard a happy birthday this year, and he appears to have forgotten to wish me one either.  First time we've failed to exchange birthday wishes, even if belatedly, since we were assigned to share an office in the 1988/89 academic year at Brown\".\n\nAndres Navarro and Oto Havle had created an implementation of Kernel programming language, called kernel, which was mentioned in a presentation at BSDCan by Michael MacInnis.  Recalling that incident in November, Dr Shutt said, \"Two or three years ago, this guy Michael MacInnis emailed me.  He was getting ready to give a talk at BSDCan (an annual BSD conference in Canada) about a new UNIX shell he was ready to release, called Oh; and he wanted to know if it was okay if he mentioned my name in regard to fexprs, 'cause my dissertation had come out as he was putting the design together and Kernel-style fexprs fit wonderfully well with his concept so he used them.  I assured him I was fine with having my name mentioned.  Last night I was watching the video he provides of his talk, which iirc he felt went very well.  I've been meaning to learn in more detail how the shell works; it was kind of fascinating to me how it very easily does away with most of Lisp's parentheses despite being fundamentally Lisp.  (Cons cells and fexprs.  Profoundly Lisp.)\".\n\nDr Shutt lived with Asperger's syndrome.  In a discussion with one of the Wikimedia volunteers, he said, \"As often happens with aspies, I was a hyperlexic kid, some of which has lingered.\"\nDr Shutt lived in Massachusetts, US, and is survived by his mother Elsie Shutt, his sister and niece Barbara and Hannah Shutt, his cat Pickles and his brother David Shutt.

In a statement, Ducey said, \"[t]here's immeasurable value in every single life — regardless of genetic makeup [...] We will continue to prioritize protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives.\"  The news release, originally published on his website also read, \"[w]ith this legislation, Arizona remains among the top pro-life states in the nation.\"\nSenator Nancy Barto said, according to the release \"[w]e need to protect our most vulnerable, especially those with treatable genetic conditions [...] They are loved, integral members of our community that make Arizona whole\".  Cathi Herrod, president of Center for Arizona Policy said in her own news release, according to the Associated Press \"[t]oday, Arizonans win.\"  \nRepresentative Diego Espinoza wrote in a tweet, \"I'm disappointed to see Arizona moving in this direction, ignoring the needs and desires of doctors, women, and families for an extreme political agenda.\"  Representative and House Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding wrote in a statement \"it's disturbing and wrong that the legislature is not focusing on policies to help [women], and instead is stripping away the fundamental freedom to choose if, when, and how to start or grow a family.\"\nIn a letter shared to a Facebook post, the union United Campus Workers at Arizona State University urged last Saturday to the Arizona Board of Regents, university president Michael M. Crow and University of Arizona president Robert D. Robbins to \"immediately speak out against SB 1457\", calling it \"a blatant attack on reproductive freedom\"."}

Many air carriers in Europe including Austrian Airlines have been avoiding to fly over the Belarusian airspace and using Belarusian airports after sanctions were imposed.\nAn Austrian Airlines official told TASS, because it \"has suspended flights over Belarusian airspace until further notice [...] it is also necessary to adjust the flight route from Vienna to Moscow.  The change in the flight path must be approved by the authorities.  Russian officials did not give their approval to us.\"\nThe representative cited a recommendation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).  A recommendation published in a Safety Information Bulletin by the aviation body dated May 25 stated: EASA operators are to \"avoid operations in FIR [Flight Information Region] Minsk\" unless its use is \"deemed necessary\", and third country operators \"authorised by EASA\" do the same \"when conducting operations to, from and within the EU\" until an international investigation into Protasevich's arrest hasn't completed.\nAccording to The Guardian, Air France was also following an EASA recommendation, and cancelled a flight from Paris to Moscow for the second consecutive day.  It was denied permission on Wednesday.  Air France has cancelled at least four flights from Paris to Moscow, the BBC reported.  An Austrian Airlines cargo flight in Nanjing, China bound for Vienna was also grounded over similar concerns.\nThe Guardian reported KLM and British Airways  had modified routes approved.  Along with those air carriers, RT also listed LOT Polish Airlines's modified routes were also approved.\nThe Foreign Ministry of Austria called Russia's position \"absolutely incomprehensible to us\", adding, according to Deutsche Welle, that all flights bound for and over Russia should be able to continue without hindrance.  According to Interfax, when asked by journalists, Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said \"[t]he presidential administration is not in charge of controlling air traffic\" and advised the question be posed to \"our aviation authorities\".\nThe United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization held an \"exceptional session\" Thursday on the initial grounding, The Guardian reported.  Belarus is accused of violating the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which it is a signatory.\nAccording to a May 25 BBC article, European airlines KLM, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines and Finnair announced their suspension of flights over Belarusian airspace.  LOT Polish Airlines suspended flights to and from Minsk, and Ukraine banned all carriers from flying over or into Belarus.  Singapore Airlines declared rerouting its flights as well.\nBelarus' national carrier Belavia has been the subject of many cancellations, including a suspension of its operating permit in the United Kingdom and its suspension of eleven routes to EU cities and one to the Russian city Kaliningrad.  Belavia also suspended flights to France and the UK until October 30, the BBC reported."}

{"title": "Ransomware attack hits over 200 US companies, forces Swedish grocery chain to close", "content": "Monday, July 5, 2021 \nOn Friday, a ransomware attack which initially targeted software company Kaseya spread to over 200 companies in the US through Kaseya's network management software.  Huntress Labs, a cybersecurity company, alleged the attack was carried out by REvil, a Russia-based ransomware group.  Kaseya told its customers to stop using its services when it learned of the attack.\nAccording to NBC News, the ransomware first spread to about 40 of Kaseya's customers, which are mainly companies that manage Internet services for their customers, some of which manage them for thousands of companies.  John Hammond, a security researcher at Huntress Labs, said that \"It's reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses\".  Kaseya notified its customers of the attack on Friday afternoon and warned them to stop using its services immediately.\nBusiness Insider reported REvil is a Russian-based organization which provides ransomware-as-a-service.  BleepingComputer reported receiving a sample of the ransomware used in REvil's attacks and says that they demand USD five million for the ransomed files to be decrypted, though it is unknown if every victim received a demand for that same amount.  Fabian Wosar, Chief Technical Offier (CTO) at the Emsisoft security firm, said affected customers had received demands for USD 44,999.\nSwedish grocery chain Coop was also affected by the attack, and had to close all 800 of its stores because its checkout tills could not process payments due to the ransomware.  Speaking to Swedish Television, Therese Knapp, a Coop spokesperson, said \"We have been troubleshooting and restoring all night, but have communicated that we will need to keep the stores closed today\".  Swedish company Visma Esscom, which manages servers for businesses, was using Kaseya software, according to Reuters.  Railway services in Sweden were also disrupted.\nOn Saturday, US President Joe Biden directed intelligence agencies to investigate who was behind the attack.  He said that \"we're not certain\" who is behind the attack, adding \"[t]he initial thinking was it was not the Russian government but we're not sure yet\".  The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency stated that it is \"taking action to understand and address the recent supply-chain ransomware attack\"."}
{"title": "130 countries at OECD summit agree to back global corporate tax rate", "content": "Sunday, July 4, 2021 \n\nOn Thursday, 130 of the 139 countries and jurisdictions participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) summit on taxation agreed to support an overhaul to the international taxation system that would introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate, committing most of the world's economies to a two-pillar \"solution\".\nThe states which agreed to the plan's key components included regional divisions such as Gibraltar, Hong Kong and Montserrat, tax havens according to the Associated Press (AP) Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and all Group of Twenty (G20) countries, according to an OECD list, but not Barbados, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Kenya, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  Peru also abstained, but due to its lack of government, reported The Guardian.\nThose that have signed represent over 90% of global gross domestic product (GDP).  A press release by the OECD called the framework the result of \"negotiations coordinated by the OECD for much of the last decade\" and criticises the \"century-old international tax system\" for being \"no longer fit for purpose\".  The plan was backed by United States president Joe Biden according to multiple sources, and comes after a similar Group of Seven deal on international taxation agreed on June 5.\nThe plan, officially the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\", adopted a pillared approach.  An implementation plan is to be finalised by October.\nIf implemented, the first would force multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover exceeding €20 billion and profitability above 10% to reallocate tax on over USD100 billion in profit from their home markets to each market jurisdiction it derived at least one million or 250 thousand euros from, depending on its GDP.  An OECD statement confirmed the threshold for affected MNEs under pillar one may change to those exceeding ten billion euros in turnover, dependent on the results of a review to be conducted in seven years' time.\nThe second pillar consists of two \"Global anti-Base Erosion Rules\" allocating top-up tax of a minimum of 15%, and one treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule\" to be made effective in 2023.\nThe effects of both pillars, though dependent on the plan's final framework, was estimated by the OECD to increase global corporate income tax (CIT) reserves by between 1.9 and 3.2%, or 50 and 80 billion USD.  If including the existing US tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the growth of CIT reserves would be between 2.3 and 4%, or 56 and 102 billion USD.  This would also protect against tax avoidance practices the OECD says costs countries between 100 and 240 billion USD in lost revenue per year, according to the AP.\nThe OECD also projects a \"relatively small\" negative effect on investment and activity equivalent to 0.1% of GDP in the medium- to long-term.   Other concerns cited include the potential governments may lose the ability to use tax incentives for policy objectives, as well as the cost of ensuring compliance. \nCountries opposed include Hungary and Ireland who have, according to Politico, sought lower rates to attract foreign direct investment, and have, in addition to Estonia according to the BBC, at least some corporate rates below the proposed floor of 15%.  The Irish and Hungarian headline corporate rates stand at 12.5 and 9%, respectively, according to The Guardian, with Ireland standing to lose over two billion euros in the next four years according to Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ).  A PricewaterhouseCoopers tax summary mentions a tax exemption on undistributed corporate funds in Estonia, in addition to instances where a 14% rate is applicable.\nOECD secretary general Mathias Cormann said in the press release \"this historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere\", adding while it \"does not eliminate tax competition [...] it does set multilaterally agreed limitations\".\nBiden said the deal means the world is in \"striking distance of full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom\", which US treasury secretary Janet Yellen described as a race \"no nation\" has won, according to The Guardian.  Finance minister for France Bruno Le Maire called it the \"most important international tax agreement in a century\", according to the BBC.\nAccording to RTÉ, finance minister for Ireland Paschal Donohoe said while he \"expressed Ireland's reservation\", he remains \"committed to the process\" and assures the global community \"Ireland will continue to play our part in reaching a comprehensive and, indeed, historic agreement\".  According to Reuters, on June 9, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán called the proposal \"absurd\", and insisted the country's low rates \"is not meant to attract certain companies to declare their taxes here\", nor makes it \"a tax haven\".\nVenice, Italy is to host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at a \"G20 High-Level Tax Symposium\" on July 9, according to the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance."}

Those wishing to book accommodation must only do so with \"their household, intimate partner or single bubble person\".  Public gatherings of up to ten people are to be allowed in the state, with weddings and funerals also scheduled to be allowed with no more than 50 people.  Schools will return to on-site learning on Wednesday.\nWith Victoria having recorded ten new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, the Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews has warned that COVID-19 is \"with us still\", and in a press release, the Premier's office has told \"people will need to remain vigilant to stay on top of this highly infectious Delta variant.  That means COVIDSafe behaviours like checking in everywhere, every time, wearing a mask and getting vaccinated when you’re eligible will remain key as we cautiously open up again.\" \nWhile maintaining that \"we are in no way triumphant, in no way boastful\", Premier Andrews noted that \"we have seen off two Delta outbreaks, I don't think there is a jurisdiction in the world that has been able to achieve that\", encouraging Victorians to take pride in that fact, while retaining vigilance. The state's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, shared similar thoughts, claiming that the state was \"on the cusp\" of restraining the outbreak of COVID-19, but advised state residents that \"we can't call it mission accomplished yet\".\n\nNew restrictions were put in place for cross-border travel, with the City of Wagga Wagga, Hay Shire Council, Lockhart Shire Council, and Murrumbidgee Council local government areas in New South Wales to be removed from the cross-border travel bubble at 11:59 pm on Tuesday.

One was the Coles supermarket, exposed on August 22 between 11:45AM and 12:05PM, and the other is the food court, exposed on August 27 between 11:10AM and 11:15AM.\nTwo more exposure incidents were added yesterday - an additional exposure at the above food court between 12:25PM and 2:45PM on August 22, and an exposure at the Traralgon Woolworths on Seymour Street on August 23 between 5:20PM and 5:45PM. Anyone who visited these sites has been urgently advised to receive a COVID-19 test and self-isolate until they receive their results.\nIn regards to the earlier announcement of exposure sites, Sharon Gibson called upon people who had visited them or had symptoms to get tested. She said \"I would urge people to be tested if they were anywhere near the Exposure Sites and if they have any symptoms at all, please go and get tested. Now it is especially important to follow the public health advice.\" Gibson added \"I would hope the person who has tested positive recovers quickly.

I encourage everyone who is eligible for vaccination to make a booking and get the jab, to protect you, your family, and the wider community.\"\nRussell Northe expressed his hope the circumstances would be handled well in regards to the exposure sites. He wrote \"there are a number of local exposure sites which have been announced and hopefully health authorities and contact tracers are able to get on top of the situation prior to it becoming a major issue like we have seen in other communities such as Shepparton.\" The City of Greater Shepparton recorded nine COVID-19 cases on Sunday, adding to a total of 92 active cases in the area.\n\nNorthe also stated \"many community members were shocked to learn on Sunday of an active COVID case in the region.

Should it do so, Netanyahu's twelve-year tenure of fifteen years total as Israel's longest-serving prime minister would end, being replaced by head of right-wing party Yamina Naftali Bennett, a staunch advocate for the controversial Israeli settlement in the West Bank and opponent of an independent state of Palestine.\nUnder the rotation agreement agreed by the eight parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years of a four-year term, and Lapid foreign minister, according to CNN.  The two men will then swap on August 27, 2023 according to the BBC.\nThe coalition is comprised of parties with a wide array of interests, including the United Arab List, also known by its Hebrew acronym Ra'am and led by Mansour Abbas, which became the first Arab party in Israeli history to partner in the formation of a government.  According to the Associated Press (AP), the agreement secured a number of concessions in Abbas' favour, including legal recognition for villages by the Bedouin minority in southern Israel and a plan to invest ILS30 billion and reduce violent crime in Arab communities.\nAccording to the BBC, the other five parties that ensured a 62-seat majority of a required 61 in the 120-seat Knesset are Blue and White with eight seats and led by Benny Gantz, Yisrael Beiteinu with seven seats and led by Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Labor Party with seven seats and led by Merav Michaeli, New Hope with six seats and led by Gideon Sa'ar and Meretz with six seats and led by Nitzan Horowitz.  Yesh Atid has seventeen seats and is the largest opposition party.\nThe parties have little in common with one another apart than a desire to oust the prime minister.\nIn announcing the coalition, Lapid promised \"[t]his government will work for all the citizens of Israel, those that voted for it and those that didn’t.

Stretton covers suburbs in south Brisbane such as Calamvale, Sunnybank Hills, Kuraby, and the eponymous town.  At the 2020 Queensland state election, Pegg won 56.59% of the first preference vote in Stretton, with his closest opponent being Peter Zhuang of the Liberal National Party, who won 30.21% of the vote.\nSince the seat's establishment in 2001, it has been held by the Labor Party except for one exception in the 2012 Queensland state election, which was a victory for the Liberal National Party, who won 78 of Queensland's 89 seats.  Pegg was first elected in 2015, after defeating the Liberal National incumbent Freya Ostapovitch.\nFive candidates are running in this by-election, including Andrea Wildin of the Greens.  The Greens' website describes Wildin as a former nurse and midwife, who now has been \"volunteering as a disability advocate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic\", being a wheelchair user herself.  Wildin previously ran for the Greens in Stretton at the previous state election, coming in third place among four candidates and winning 8.71% of the vote.

However, the average wait time of just under eleven weeks has been steadily declining since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove total admissions to hospital down, according to The Guardian.\nTotal admissions for surgery and normal treatment have increased fourfold to nearly pre-pandemic levels from 54,550 last year to 242,064 in May, according to Sky News.  In May 2019, there were 295,881 admissions for routine treatment.\nThe rise in demand is primarily due to a surge in non-COVID-related admissions: over two million people visited the accident and emergency department (A&E) last month, for example, in the busiest ever June.  A blog post published Wednesday by the NHS Confederation warned increasing demand in urgent, non-COVID-related healthcare in both children and adults are \"putting severe and unprecedented strain on the urgent care system, with unsustainable numbers of people now visiting A&E, seeing their GPs [general practitioners] and calling ambulances.\"\nWait times are trending downward, according to Sky News.  Between April and May, the number of people waiting over 52 weeks for treatment fell by 50 thousand, though still thirteen times higher than last year.  Patients waiting over eighteen weeks dropped by 83 thousand in the same time, \"for the first time this year\", according to NHS medical director Stephen Powis.  However, the percent of those who received treatment within eighteen weeks, 67%, remained below the NHS standard of 92%, according to The Guardian.\nThe average wait time for elective care of 10.8 weeks was down 29% from May last year, according to the NHS Confederation's chief executive Matthew Taylor. In a blog post on the  organisation's web site he remarked the \"treatment backlog of 5.3 million patients\" nonetheless \"show[s] that while waiting lists are still rising, more people are coming forward for care, which is encouraging, as this is exactly what the NHS is there for.\"\nTaylor went on to say \"our urgent care system [is] running a winter-like service in the middle of summer\", adding \"we must go into this next phase with our eyes wide open, and acknowledge much of the care the NHS can provide to patients is likely to be disrupted further, including in the community.\"\nThe Guardian reported other issues, including that nearly 25% of patients in A&E waited over four hours to be seen.  Only 75% of cancer patients were seen within two weeks of cancer screening, below a target of 90%, or a GP's urgent referral, below a target of 85%.  An October analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support  estimates from the year before, 50 thousand fewer people were diagnosed with cancer, a backlog it warned could grow by four thousand missed diagnoses per month to over 100 thousand this October, and urgent referral activity in England for August was 11% behind 2019 levels. \nThe NHS has said it budgeted one billion GBP on restoring services and clearing the waiting list, according to The Guardian.\n32,551 new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom were reported on Thursday and another 35 attributable deaths, according to Sky News, up over four thousand from the week before, and the highest since the week of January 27 .  This comes after health minister Sajid Javid said cases of COVID \"could go as high as 100,000\" ahead of the expected lifting of all remaining lockdown restrictions on July 19, dubbed \"Freedom Day\", as reported by Sky News and The Guardian."}

{"title": "California to require large retailers to have gender-neutral toy sections from 2024", "content": "Sunday, October 10, 2021 \n\nOn Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 1084 (AB-1084), which requires retailers with 500 or more employees throughout the state to keep a gender-neutral area for childcare products and toys. The law is set to take effect in 2024.\n\nThe bill says that \"a retail department store that offers childcare items or toys for sale shall maintain a gender neutral section or area, to be labeled at the discretion of the retailer, in which a reasonable selection of the items and toys for children that it sells shall be displayed, regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.\" Boy and girl sections are not prohibited, but a common section alongside them is required. While the original version included clothing, during California Senate proceedings that part was removed from the text.\nNon-compliance calls for a US$250 civil penalty for a first case, and US$500 for subsequent violations. Courts could order the violator to pay court costs and attorney's fees. \nAssembly members Evan Low and Cristina Garcia, both members of the Democratic Party, introduced the bill into the California Assembly, the lower house of the state's legislature. AB-1084 was amended by both houses, then passed the Assembly in a 49-16 vote on September 2 before being sent to the governor's desk for approval.\nSpeaking about the bill, Low said, \"Part of it is to make sure if you're a young girl that you can find a police car, fire truck, a periodic table or a dinosaur. And then similarly, if you're a boy, if you're more artistic and want to play with glitter, why not? Why should you feel the stigma of saying, 'Oh, this should be shamed', and going to a different location?\"\nOn July 25, Garcia noted in a Facebook post, \"As a math teacher I saw 1st hand how playtime creates the building blocks for attaining spatial awareness that’s important for studying geometry, unfortunately these toys are often labeled as boy toys. Removing the gender identity from these toys will hopefully lead to more boys & girls entering STEM fields.\"\nThe bill was opposed by members of the Republican Party: Republican state Senator Melissa Melendez said, \"I don't think parents need the government to step in and tell them how they should shop for their children\". In opposition of the bill, the Capitol Resource Institute argued that \"it is not the business of the government to instruct retail stores how they should display and market their merchandise.\" \nOn April 6, during a public hearing before the Business and Professions Committee of the Assembly, Greg Burt of the California Family Council called AB-1084 \"impossible to comply with\" as it does not define the intended meaning of \"reasonable amount\" and \"a bill like this opens the door to a never-ending number of complaints from activist groups who don’t like the way stores are marketing their products to one sex or another\".\nAssembly Bill 2826, introduced to the Assembly by Low in 2020, which targeted a similar goal, died in the Legislature.\nRetail corporation Target, with 1915 stores in the United States, dropped traditional toy section labeling in 2015. \"In fact it would be more difficult to find a large retailer today that segregates toys by gender\", noted the Southwest California Legislative Council, an opponent of the bill."}

This statement warned authorities in South Korea they \"should keep in mind the meaning of reopening of the communication lines and make active efforts to solve pending important issues for saving the inter-Korean relations and opening its bright prospect.\"\nThe communication lines had been severed on the North's order in August as a method of protest exercised during US-South Korea joint military drills. The KCNA had previously stated communication would be re-established 9 AM on Monday KST (UTC midnight). In an article by CTV News, it is said officials exchanged greetings over telephone lines and discussed fishing activities in their disputed western maritime border.\nThis thawing of Korean relations comes at a heated time, with the North having conducted multiple missile tests last week.

Evermore, which was released in December, only had its vinyl edition issued on May 28, although preorders were available from the moment of the album's release.\nIn the week ending on June 3, Evermore sold 192 thousand copies, setting the record for the biggest sales week of the year.  Billboard credited the rise of Evermore back to No. 1 to a number of factors, including \"modern-era record-breaking vinyl LP sales — 102 thousand — Swift-signed CDs and deep discounting on its digital album\".  The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums in the United States on a weekly basis, combining album sales and streaming.\n\nIn this week's chart, Evermore jumped from 74 to 1, marking the biggest jump to the number 1 position since Radiohead's In Rainbows went from 156 to 1.  Since then, three albums have also re-entered the chart at no. 1, the most recent of which was Bon Jovi's This House Is Not for Sale on the March 10, 2018 chart, caused by a bundling of concert tickets with the album.  Evermore broke the record for the biggest sales week for a vinyl album, having initially sold over 40 thousand copies from May 28 to May 31 to edge out the previous record holder, Jack White's Lazaretto.  By the end of the week, Evermore had sold 102 thousand vinyl copies.\nThe delay of Evermore's vinyl release is due to the length of time vinyl records take to produce.  As Evermore was only announced a day before its release, it is likely that there was not sufficient time before its release to complete the production of physical editions of the album, including vinyl editions.  In other countries where Evermore hit no. 1 upon its December release, it also recieved a boost.  On the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart Top 100, Evermore jumped 70 spots to the no. 4 position. Australia's ARIA Top 50 Albums chart saw Evermore go up nine spots to no. 38.  In New Zealand, Evermore was one of the fastest rising titles on the Official Top 40 Albums chart, re-entering at no. 30."}

The bill for the budget, SB 129, and the bill for the stimulus payments, SB 139, both passed both houses of the California Legislature for this fiscial year.\nThe payments, dubbed the Golden State Stimulus II, are set to be paid out to eligible California taxpaying residents beginning in September.  To be eligible, residents must have filed a state tax return for last year, not be someone's dependent, and must have earned no more than US$75 thousand in wages last year.\nEligible Californians would get a one-time payment of US$600, and households with dependents would receive an additional US$500.  Around two-thirds of Californians are expected to get a stimulus payment, according to the governor's office.  Newsom initially proposed the payments in May to aid the state's economic recovery, as part of his \"California Comeback Plan\".\nCalifornians who already received a stimulus payment earlier in the year are not eligible for this second payment.  An additional payment of US$500 is still available for those who claimed dependents on their returns.\nThe budget also provides for US$5.2 billion in renters' aid for low-income residents and landlords, which would pay for all rent left unpaid during the COVID-19 crisis, and cover rent for several coming months.  Overdue water and utility payments would also be covered by US$2 billion in funding.\nAn additional US$1.5 billion was for grant money intended for small businesses, with US$120 million in tax credits for businesses willing to relocate to California.\nCalifornia had a budget surplus of nearly US$76 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn signing SB 129, Newsom line-item vetoed Section 19.55 of the bill concerning US$2.58 billion in appropriations to various funds \"on a technical basis\", citing in an explanation appropriations covered under the section were superseded by the budget.

The project will include building new shared paths for pedestrians and cyclists.\" \nThe upgrades will see the Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong, and Warrnambool V/Line rail services temporarily replaced with coach services from September 4–5. The works are part of the Sunbury Line Upgrade, a series of improvements which began in 2019 and are scheduled to end in 2023. The Victorian Government describes the upgrade as delivering \"major improvements in capacity, reliability and frequency of services on the Sunbury line\". \n\nAccording to the earlier-mentioned press release, the Sunbury Line Upgrade will \"create space for 113,000 more passengers in peak periods every week when the Metro Tunnel is operational\". The Metro Tunnel is a railway infrastructure project that will create an end-to-end link between the Sunbury line and the Cranbourne and Pakenham railway lines.\nIn regards to these planned improvements, Victorian Minister for Transport Infrastructure, Jacinta Allan, said that \"we're not wasting a moment delivering these vital upgrades to the Sunbury line, which will enable bigger, more modern trains to run on the line, giving passengers a better public transport journey. These upgrades will benefit commuters, road users and residents – supporting the needs of the growing communities in the West.\"\n\nDaniel Bowen, a spokesperson of the Public Transport Users Association, told Wikinews via email that \"it's good to see these upgrades going ahead. They will enable the new Evolution high capacity trains to run on the Sunbury line once the Metro tunnel opens, which will help cut crowding on the line. Removal of level crossings also helps improve safety and train service reliability.\"  \nBowen continued by saying that \"while the infrastructure works are welcome, the government does need to do more to improve train services, particularly running more trains across the day to help reduce waiting times. Passengers currently wait up to 20, 30 or even 40 minutes for trains outside peak times - this is not good enough for Melbourne's fast-growing north-western suburbs.\" \nDeputy mayor of Hume City Council and local Sunbury councillor, Jack Medcraft, wrote in an email to Wikinews that \"in terms of the upgrades to the Sunbury line, this is well overdue and I think all the work that is being done will only improve the services in the future. I think Sunbury residents will be happy with the underpass from the railway line plus the improved services they will be getting.\" \n\nMedcraft elaborated on the topic of transport infrastructure, saying that \"however, I think the only thing I have query on is the duplication of Macedon Street and Sunbury Road, where two lanes each way will end up with a one lane bridge in Bulla, and that is going to be a real nightmare, not to mention the traffic signals along that road where the new housing estates are being developed. I can’t complain about the duplication of roadworks but I can complain about the lack of action on the single Bulla Bridge.\" \nHe also added that \"the other most pressing issue with regards to public transport is the failure of Government to set up a smart bus route from Melbourne Airport to Sunbury and Diggers Rest and returning the same way. We have around 30% of residents working in and around the airport and they don’t have a public transport system to take them there.\""}

As of January 31, V/Line operates five return services on weekdays to Shepparton.\nFrom September 4 to September 12, coaches will replace trains to Seymour and Shepparton, during which stage two works will continue on the line, while as part of the stage three upgrades, the crossing loop at Murchison East will be extended by 1.1 kilometres, allowing two six-car V/Line VLocity trains to pass each other. \nOutside of these dates, the stage three upgrades will also involve the expansion of a new Shepparton train stabling facility, as well as signalling and track upgrades on the Shepparton railway line.

More efficient and reliable freight and passenger transport will benefit the city’s economy and help ease traffic on our roads.\"\nQuilty added that \"Shepparton is an important regional centre and this investment should continue to improve transport links – with nine passenger services a day, lots of Northern Victorian towns will be envious of the service Shepparton is going to have,\" but also commented on the government's announcements, remarking that \"you have to wonder, though, just how many times they can announce the same project before the next election.

As reported by Sky News, state media says the diversion was due to threat of explosives on board, a claim Global Affairs Canada calls \"dubious and still unverified\".\nTotal restrictive measures varied between the countries and regional organisation.  Canada sanctioned 17 new individuals for a total of 72, and five entities described in a press release as being \"due to the ongoing disregard for human rights demonstrated\".\nThe EU, through the Council of the European Union, extended its restrictive measures by 78 individuals and eight entities related either to human rights violations or the \"forced and unlawful landing\", to a total of 166 individuals and fifteen entities.  Those who are impacted, including judges, businesspeople, university rectors and government ministers, will be subject to an asset freeze, and persons affected prohibited to enter or transit through EU territory.\nThe measures also prohibit EU citizens and companies from making money available to the designated.  According to the Associated Press, EU policy chief Josep Borrell said the measures \"are going to hurt [...] the economy of Belarus heavily\".  The decision to affect entities, not just individuals, foreign minister of Germany Heiko Maas said, will impact the \"economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime’s income\"; those targeted include the export of fertiliser ingredient potash, and those of tobacco and petroleum.\nThe United Kingdom furthered sanctions levied with Canada in September on eight Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko, his son, and senior government members.  New restrictions include eleven individuals and two entities, which are henceforth subject to asset freezes and travel bans.\nAmong those targeted includes petroleum exporter BNK (UK) Ltd, which, according to its 2019 report of the director presented to Companies House, \"provides intermediate services to oil sector companies\" in Belarus.  According to a government press release, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said \"cutting off oil export revenue streams\" was one way the government would \"hold the [Belarusian] regime to account\".\nThe United States, through the State Department and Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Treasury Department, imposed visa restrictions on 46 Belarusian individuals holding \"key positions\" in the country, according to a press release, and added 16 individuals and five entities to a designated list.  In addition to concerns of the country's \"transnational repression\" and \"affronts to international efforts\", the US also cited the \"fraudulent\" 2020 Belarusian presidential election as cause for the sanctions' imposition.\nThe timing of the sanctions was questioned by Belarusian Nikolai Shchekin on state media network the Belarusian Telegraph Agency, noting the date June 21 is one day before the anniversary of the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, or the \"Great Patriotic War\".

The gloves have various pieces of metal and often ferrocerium rods attached, which serve to create a sparking effect. \nSpeakers and teachers covered many topics, also including the technical aspects of haunted attractions, like lighting.  Another speaker discussed the financial aspects of starting and operating a haunted attraction.  He noted haunted attractions in the U.S. generate US$300-500 million in ticket sales each year."}

The deceased, a man in his thirties, died last Wednesday after being diagnosed and admitted for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare side-effect of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as reported by Arirang TV.\nThe man, who had received the vaccine in late May, suffered from severe headaches and nausea nine days following his inoculation.  In a press conference, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency commissioner Jeong Eun-kyeong said meetings were held to investigate deaths following inoculation, of which there were 224.  Out of them, 210 were determined not be linked to the vaccination, while 13 other cases remain under investigation.\nJeong added people who received any dose of the vaccine should watch out for symptoms of TTS, including headaches, blurred vision, vomiting, shortness of breath and abdominal pain.\nSouth Korea currently administers the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines, but limits the usage of the AstraZeneca shot to those over the age of 30 due to concerns of TTS.  7.9% of the country is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 29.2% received a first dose."}

The explosion occurred in South Los Angeles (L.A.), California, U.S. on East 27th Street, injuring seventeen and damaging vehicles and property.\nFive members of LAPD's bomb squad have been removed from duty, said Moore. \nOn June 30, LAPD officers discovered a cache of over 32 thousand lb (14,500 kg) of illegal fireworks at a South L.A. residence. Bomb disposal technicians responded by placing an estimated 16.5 lb (7.5 kg) of explosives, into a \"total containment vessel\", or TCV, where they detonated the material. According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), technicians actually detonated 42 lb (19 kg) of explosives. The vehicle failed to contain the explosion and the blast injured seventeen people and damaged thirteen nearby businesses, 22 residences, and 37 vehicles.\nThe TCV's capacity was 15 lb (6.8 kg) for repeated use, or 25 lb (11 kg) for single use, according to Moore. The containment truck had been used by officials for ten years, with the June 30 blast its 42nd usage.\nATF special agents are also investigating the LAPD's actions. They expect to complete their investigation in the next one to two months.\nThe owner of the home where the fireworks were discovered, 26-year-old Arturo Ceja III, was arrested by LAPD and apprehended on suspicion of unlawful possession of destructive devices and child endangerment. Fireworks are illegal to possess in the City of L.A., and in unincorporated areas of L.A. County. Ceja posted the US$500 thousand bail for release. He is due back in state court in October.\nFederal prosecutors charged Ceja III with the illegal transportation of explosives without a license. Prosecutors allege that Ceja III purchased the fireworks from Area 51, a fireworks dealer in Pahrump, Nevada, on the border with California. He was released on US$25 thousand bond pending arraignment, scheduled for August 2.\nL.A. Councilmember Curren Price, Jr. criticized the LAPD's bomb squad in a statement saying, \"[i]t's clear there was negligence involved and this instance shows zero regard for the people that reside in our South LA community. Every individual that I have talked to including myself wonder if this would have been acceptable protocol in more affluent areas of the City.\"\nThe city opened a resource center for affected residents at the YMCA on East 28th Street, where residents can file claims against the city and receive referrals to mental health services. \nOn Tuesday L.A. City Attorney Mike Feuer said his office received 56 claims against the city, saying, \"We're trying to speed this up as much as we can [...] this is an all-hands-on-deck effort to make sure that anybody who suffered because of that explosion gets relief as fast as possible, because they deserve it\".\nCallers to Tuesday's L.A. Police Commission meeting called for the police department to make reparations to affected city residents and businesses.

While not all of these deaths were necessarily caused by COVID-19, excess deaths can be used to help calculate the impact of the pandemic.   \nThe researchers said the death toll was \"likely to be far greater than the official count\" and \"likely to be in several millions\". Arvind Subramanian, a co-writer of the report, said that \"after the first wave, which was more spread out, there was a sense that India had escaped the worst because there was this undercounting of deaths, and that led to a culture of complacency. But in the second wave, with all the horrendous images that we saw, that really galvanised Indian society to get to the bottom of the numbers.\" Subramanian also added that the figures only went up to May and didn't include all of June or any of July, meaning the true death toll may still be undercounted.\nMore than 414,000 COVID-19 deaths have been officially recorded in India, the third-highest total in the world.

According to the article, around 50 North Korean defectors and escapees were recently sent back to their place of origin following their arrest by Chinese police and border authorities.\nAn anonymous witness told Radio Free Asia that \"The Dandong customs office was opened just for today and they [Chinese border authorities] sent about 50 North Korean escapees back to North Korea on two buses.\" The witness also added that \"dozens of police officers lined up in front of the customs office to block public access and ensure nobody was filming.\"\nAs a reaction to the sudden spread of COVID-19, North Korea closed its borders totally, which halted the repatriation of defectors. The recent repatriation was the first of its kind since January 2020, when North Korean authorities closed the Sino-Korean border as a way to protect the country from the pandemic. Repatriations of this kind were held routinely for the defectors who had crossed the Yalu and Tuman rivers into China before the pandemic occured.\nThis repatriation action caught the eye of the United States' Department of State, with an official spokesperson saying that \"We are particularly concerned by recent reports that nearly 50 North Koreans were forcibly repatriated.\" The spokesperson said that the United States urges China to \"fulfill its international obligations as a party to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and the UN Convention Against Torture.\"\nRadio Free Asia's article cites that some among the 50 repatriated were soldiers and pilots who had served in the North's Air Force.\nReturning such refugees to North Korea, where they face imprisonment and torture from the authorities, is a violation of the United Nations' 1951 Refugee Convention, 1967 Protocol and the UN Convention against Torture. According to the article by Human Rights Watch, at least 1170 North Korean people are held in various prisons in China's Jilin and Liaoning provinces, where they face deportation after being charged with criminal offenses.\nBoth countries maintain a friendly relationship, with both leaders having exchanged greetings on July 11, as reported by state newspaper Rodong Sinmun. A 1986 bilateral border protocol signed by both nations warrants the deportation of any and all defectors and other North Koreans illegaly staying in China.\nAccording to data reported by South Korea's Ministry of Unification, only two defectors from the North reached South Korea between April and June of this year, the lowest number ever recorded since the Ministry started recording the inflow of defectors. Such a decrease in the amount of defectors is mainly being attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, as North Korea entirely stopped people from leaving or entering the country, while still claiming to have no cases of the virus.\nNorth Korean defectors often transit through China to reach either South Korea or another safe country, as the Sino-Korean border is easier to cross than the North-South border. The closest defector-friendly country accessible by land to defectors is the South-East Asian country of Vietnam."}

At a Beijing forum Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He described the risks as controllable, and chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission Yi Huiman said that while authorities needed to curb excessive debt more broadly by \"improv[ing] the effectiveness of the constraint mechanism on debt financing\", the matter would be dealt with properly.\nOnce China's top real estate developer, Evergrande had accumulated approximately USD305 billion in liabilities, two per cent of the Chinese gross national product, after \"dwindling resources\" cut its value by 80%, according to Reuters. September data revealed Chinese home sales by value fell by nearly 17% year-on-year, according to The Guardian, and fears over its default led to a slowdown in China's third quarter GDP growth to a year low of 4.9%.  Two sale negotiations with rival developers Hopson Development and Yuexiu, valued at USD2.6 billion and USD1.7 billion, respectively, were suspended, reportedly due to a lack of consent by the government of Guangdong province currently overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.\nNews of Evergrande's remittance caused its shares to rise by as much as 7.8% this morning after a two-week pause in trading for the anticipated sale of 50.1% in Evergrande Property Services Group, and offering some reprieve for bondholders, according to Reuters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's aim to transform the country's economy from one of debt-fuelled \"inflated\" growth to one of improved \"quality and returns\" included imposing regulations on developers that limited their capacity to borrow.  A Guardian comment piece from economist George Magnus published on October 15 made reference to China's \"ghost cities\" and \"rampant credit creation\" that has given rise to high vacancy rates and the \"financialisaton of housing\"."}

These protests were largely aimed against the largest party in parliament, the Ennahdha. \nSaied announced he would take control until he appointed a new prime minister, parliament would remain suspended for 30 days, and the immunity of the members of parliament would be suspended. Saied invoked Article 80 of the 2014 Tunisian constitution to take executive power intended for when there is \"imminent danger threatening the institutions of the nation\". \nThe speaker of the parliament Rached Ghannouchi said Saied consulted neither him nor Mechichi as required by the constitution. The constitution calls for a special court to resolve similar disputes, but it has not yet been established.\nSaied held an emergency meeting yesterday in response to the violent protests across Tunisia. Following this meeting, he announced Mechichi's dismissal and parliament's suspension. In a televised address afterward, Saied said, \"We have taken these decisions [...] until social peace returns to Tunisia and until we save the state\". He said further violence would be met with armed response by the country's armed forces.\nPolice blockaded roads leading to the capital's main street Avenue Bourguiba. Security forces were deployed to surround the parliament building, preventing access to it. Police in Tunis used pepper spray against protesters throwing rocks, during demonstrations against Mechichi.\nGhannouchi, a member of the Ennahdha party, called the president's actions \"a coup against the revolution and constitution\", and said, \"We consider the institutions to be still standing and supporters of Ennahda and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution\". Ghannouchi said parliament would continue its work despite its suspension.\nMosaïque FM reported Ghannouchi arrived at the parliament building early Monday morning, but he was barred from entry by the army.\nHeart of Tunisia and Karama, two other parties in parliament, decried the dismissal as coup as well. Al Jazeera reported that Saied and Mechichi have been in conflict for over a year during an economic crisis in the country, and as the country tries to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.

While a pay rise is in order from spring next year, the precise details are pending consultation by independent advisers and pay review bodies, according to the i.  The Guardian writes some 5.7 million public sector employees could see a pay rise. \nIn addition, about two million on minimum wage, including some from the above 5.7 million, could benefit from an increase in the national minimum and national living wages.  According to the i and The Guardian, the National Living Wage applicable for over-23s will increase by 59p to GBP9.50 an hour from next April, about GBP1000 for a full-time worker, in line with recommendations from independent advisory board the Low Pay Commission.  The National Minimum Wage for those aged 21 to 22 will rise 82p to GBP9.18 an hour, and the Apprenticeship Rate will go up 51p to GBP4.81 an hour.\nHowever, according to senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies Tom Waters: \"While this boosts earnings for full-time minimum wage workers by over £1,000 a year, those on universal credit will see their disposable income go up by just £250 because their taxes rise and benefit receipt falls as their earnings increase.\"  Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP Bridget Phillipson said the offer was \"underwhelming\", and \"[m]uch of it will be swallowed up by the government’s tax rises, universal credit cuts and failure to get a grip on energy bills\".  UK inflation rose 2.9% the year to September, according to the Office of National Statistics.\nPhillipson contrasted Sunak's measures with those of a Labour government, according to The Independent: \"With a new deal for workers, exploitative practices like zero hours contracts banned, Fire and rehire outlawed, a minimum wage of at least £10 an hour and fair pay agreements, a Labour government will transform work and raise standards.\"\nHowever, the Daily Mirror says Mr Sunak is considering a rise to GBP10.50 an hour, and the qualifying age for the National Living Wage lowered from 25 to 21 by the next election in 2024.  This would match or exceed Labour's pledge of \"a decent income that you can raise a family on\": an increase of the \"minimum wage to at least £10 an hour\".\nMr Sunak said during the media briefing that Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle would later call \"riding roughshod\" over parliamentarians, that it was \"[t]he economic impact and uncertainty of the virus\" that led to the \"difficult decision to pause private pay\", which \"[a]long with our Plan for Jobs, this action helped us protect livelihoods at the height of the pandemic.  And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it’s right that nurses, teachers and all the other public-sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise.\"\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had announced at the Conservative Party conference his intent to create a \"high-pay, high-skill economy\" after Brexit, but it may take years for salary growth to catch up with mounting financial pressures, according to the i.\nAccording to The Guardian, analysis by the Resolution Foundation indicates those impacted by the freeze earned nearly 8% less than their private sector counterparts.  The differential widened to 0.6% for all public sector employees, including those exempt.  The Office of National Statistics writes total private sector pay grew 8.3% from June to August 2021, while public sector pay grew only 2.5%."}

More than 300 thousand people were evacuated from the southeastern islands of Philippines. After making landfall, the storm ripped off roofs and toppled concrete power poles while knocking out communications and electricity.

{"title": "New Zealand raises interest rates in second straight month to 0.75%", "content": "Thursday, November 25, 2021 \n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75% during its last policy meeting of the year yesterday, after the rate of consumer price inflation was recorded at 4.9% in the third quarter, the highest since December 2007.\nThe hike to the national official cash rate (OCR) was widely expected by economists and the markets alike: 21 of the 23 economists surveyed in a November 15-19 Reuters poll predicted an increase of 25 basis points, while the other two projected an increase by 50 basis points, to 1%.\nNew Zealand's handling of COVID-19 included injecting \"huge amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus\" into the economy, according to The Guardian, in line with other major economies, which has pushed the unemployment rate to the lowest and inflation to its highest in over a decade. Stimulus spending and low interest rates, along with a shortage in housing led home prices to double in the last seven years, the least affordable of the OECD nations, according to Reuters.\nA statement from the Reserve Bank said the \"near-term rise in inflation [accentuated] by higher oil prices, rising transport costs and the impact of supply shortfalls\" are risking \"generating more generalised price rises\", as reported by ABC News. The RBNZ forecasts rates would rise to 2.5% by 2023, and still higher by 2024, according to Reuters; however, medians from a Friday article predicted the OCR would reach only 2% by year-end 2023, below what it was in 2014.\nMore recent projections include to 2% by mid-2022 according to economist at Capital Economics Ben Udy, to a high of 3% by Q3 2023 according to acting chief economist at Westpac Michael Gordon, including a 0.5% rate hike during the RBNZ's next meeting in February, as reported by The Guardian.\nYesterday's announcement came after a widely-expected rate hike from 0.25% to 0.5% on October 6, the first in seven years, as part of the RBNZ's tightening cycle initially slated to begin August but pushed back due to the Delta variant of COVID-19 and lockdown in the largest city Auckland. Senior market strategist at the Bank of New Zealand Jason Wong told Reuters then: \"We're on a path towards a series of rate hikes and the market is well priced for that.\"\nRBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told reporters yesterday \"we see steady steps of 25 basis points back to levels where the OCR is marginally above the neutral rate as the most balanced approach we can take\", though Reuters reports the bank had considered a range of options, including a 50 basis point hike.\nOrr added on housing, \"Homeowners who have just entered the market with extremely high leverage levels have to be incredibly wary and have to understand they have to weather the higher interest rates\", after earlier taxes levied on property investors failed to cool rising house prices, which Reuters reports the RBNZ believes are above their sustainable level, and at increased chance for a correction. He also defended the stimulus but noted the growth in household debt ensuing.\n\nWhile countries globally are winding down pandemic-related stimulus measures, according to Reuters, there has been pushback from some countries when it comes to raising interest rates: in the United States, the inflation rate recently rose to 6.2%, the highest in 31 years, which has led some economists to put pressure on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to accelerate the process of tapering its monthly bond purchases, according to the Associated Press. The Bank of England and European Central Bank (ECB) also both withstood criticism for a forecasted rise in inflationary pressures, according to The Guardian and Reuters.\nECB President Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament on November 15 \"an undue tightening of financing conditions is not desirable, and would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery\", adding \"[i]f we were to take any tightening measures now, it could cause far more harm than it would do any good\", as reported by Reuters.\nAustralia's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintained its position that interest rates are not likely to rise until 2024. RBA Governor Philip Lowe told an Australian Businesses Economists lunch last week \"the latest data and forecasts do not warrant an increase in the cash rate in 2022\", and for one to be considered by the board \"[t]he economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario\", according to ABC News.\nHowever, several central banks have increased rates ahead of even New Zealand: Reuters names Norway, the Czech Republic and South Korea, which is expected to raise rates again in a meeting today.\nReuters reports the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% due to some investors predicting a higher hike, and both 2- and 10-year government bonds slipped by 10 basis points each."}
{"title": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promises repeal of three farm laws", "content": "Monday, November 22, 2021 \n\nIn an address to the nation on Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to repeal three controversial farm laws, explaining \"we have decided to repeal all three farm laws and will start the constitutional process to repeal all the three laws in the upcoming parliament sessions that starts at the end of this month\".\nIn September 2020, President Ram Nath Kovind assented to three farming laws passed by the Parliament. Collectively known as the 2020 Indian agriculture acts, they were the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.\nThe bills were passed by the Indian Parliament during the monsoon session of 2020. Some farmers in Punjab and Haryana protested the reforms, expressing strong apprehension and criticism that the new laws would disrupt the Minimum Support Price system and leave them at the \"mercy\" of large conglomerates.\nModi also asked the protesting farmers to desist and return to their homes. While farmers were seen celebrating after the decision of the government near the Ghazipur border, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers' Union) leader Rakesh Tikait declared that the farmers would continue the protests until the bills have been completely scrapped in the parliament.\nThe Indian National Congress, the country's main opposition party, hailed the decision of the government, with former party leader Rahul Gandhi stating \"the country's farmers, through their satyagraha, made arrogance bow its head. Congratulations on the victory against injustice! Hail India, hail India’s farmers!\""}
