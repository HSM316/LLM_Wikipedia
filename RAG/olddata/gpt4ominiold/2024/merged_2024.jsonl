{"title": "Industry leaders see energy supply as the next hurdle for AI", "content": " \n\nIn a podcast published on Friday, Mark Zuckerberg reiterated industry concerns that energy supply would soon become the major challenge to the further development of artificial intelligence (AI). These concerns echoed Elon Musk's warning from last month, that AI could exceed energy capacity as early as next year. According to Musk, AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate; by a factor of ten every six months. That rate of growth has reached a point where it is straining both chip manufacturing capacity and energy capacity.\n\nBig tech companies such as  (Google), Microsoft, and Amazon.com are rapidly expanding their AI capabilities and that is pushing them into more and larger data centers. According to , the three companies combined are projected to spend over US$120 billion on data center expansion in 2025. This increased demand for data centers will increase the demand for energy. At the current expansion rate, energy demand could surpass supply. \n\nZuckerberg, co-founder of , an AI-development laboratory, anticipates the need for 1-gigawatt data centers, a capacity that has not yet been achieved. According to Zuckerberg, building power plants to supply that amount of energy will take time. \"If we wanted to stand up some massive facility, to power that is a very long-term project. I think [some people will] do it, but I don't think this is something that can be quite as magical as 'you get a level of AI, get a bunch of capital, and put it in [a big data center].'\" \n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, one of the hurdles to expanding power supply quickly is government regulation. \"When you're talking about building large new power plants or large build-outs and building transmission lines that cross public or private land ... you're talking about many years of lead time.\"\n\nCompounding the issue, the electronic vehicle (EV) market is competing with the AI industry for energy supply. In a teleconference video for the  Connected World conference, Musk said “The simultaneous growth of electric cars and AI, both of which need electricity, both of which need voltage transformers – I think, is creating a tremendous demand for electrical equipment and for electrical power generation.\"\n\nWhat could this mean for the future of AI, EVs, and global energy supply and demand? We may already be experiencing its effects. In Ireland,  (AWS) customers reportedly faced restrictions on launching new resources from its Irish data centers.  attributes these restrictions to limited energy supply for AWS data centers in Ireland.\n\nWikinews asked  about AI growth versus energy supply growth. Its response centers on a concept it called the TPIF Framework, conceptualized as Technological advancements, Policy support, Infrastructure readiness, and Financial investment. Minimal editing has been done for appearance and to make the interaction more concise.\n\nWikinews: \"Tell me about yourself in both raw, technical terms such as version, architecture, etc, and how you see yourself.\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Technical Overview: I'm built on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture, which is a large multimodal model (meaning it can process both text and images, though my current capabilities are text-based).

As a result, customers are being directed to use AWS data centers in other European regions, such as Sweden, where there is spare capacity. These issues stem from the overall strain on Ireland's power grid, which has been exacerbated by the significant energy demands of numerous data centers concentrated around Dublin. This situation reflects broader challenges related to power supply and demand affecting data centers not only in Ireland but in other regions as well​ (Enterprise Technology News and Analysis)​.\n\n\"This power crunch in Ireland is significant given the role that data centers play in the local economy, contributing substantially to employment and economic output. However, the growing energy consumption by these data centers, which has significantly increased over the years, poses sustainability challenges and has led to tighter restrictions on new data center builds and the requirement for new facilities to demonstrate they are matched by renewable energy generation​ (RTE)​.\"\n\nWikinews: \"Do you think renewable energy production can be leveraged quickly and effectively to help meet energy demand?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Leveraging renewable energy production to meet energy demand quickly and effectively is feasible, but it comes with several challenges and considerations. The potential for rapid deployment and effectiveness largely depends on technological advancements, policy support, infrastructure readiness, and financial investment.\"\n\nWikinews: \"Do you think the country of Ireland has all four of those necessary components already, to be able to meet the challenge effectively?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Ireland has made significant strides in renewable energy, particularly in wind power, which is a major focus under its Climate Action Plan. The country has ambitious targets for both onshore and offshore wind energy development. By 2030, Ireland aims to significantly increase its wind-generated electricity, with specific goals for onshore and offshore capacities.\n\n\"Technological Advancements: Ireland is advancing in wind technology and exploring innovative approaches for onshore and offshore wind farms. The government supports various schemes, like the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, to facilitate this growth and connect more renewable sources to the grid.\n\n\"Policy Support: The Irish government has implemented strong policy frameworks such as the National Marine Planning Framework and the Maritime Area Planning Act to support the development of offshore wind projects.

This includes updating grid capabilities to handle the variable nature of wind energy and other renewables.\n\n\"Financial Investment: The country has witnessed significant investment in renewable energy, with support from both public and private sectors aimed at achieving the set targets and ensuring community benefits through funds linked to renewable projects.\n\n\"Overall, Ireland is actively developing its renewable energy sector, particularly wind energy, which supplied 34% of its electricity demand in 2022. This progress is supported by comprehensive government plans and community involvement, though challenges such as local opposition and environmental concerns need careful management.\"\n\nWikinews: \"Given the timeframe proposed by Musk, the fact that we're already seeing impacts in Ireland similar to what Musk is predicting, and the need for a TPIF framework in each country, what do you think this means for the future of AI, EVs, and global, energy supply and demand?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"The future of AI, EVs, and the global energy supply and demand landscape is poised to be highly dynamic and interconnected, influenced by developments like those described by Elon Musk and the situations unfolding in countries like Ireland. Several key implications emerge:\n\n Accelerated Energy Demand: The rapid adoption of AI and EVs is expected to significantly increase electricity demand. As AI technologies and data centers consume more power, and as electric vehicles replace fossil-fuel-powered cars, the strain on existing power supplies will intensify. This trend necessitates urgent upgrades in energy infrastructure and an accelerated shift towards renewable energy sources to sustainably meet this growing demand.\n \n Infrastructure Modernization: The current energy infrastructure in many countries, including the US and parts of Europe, is aging and not fully equipped to handle the increased load and the intermittent nature of renewable energies. Modernizing this infrastructure, as part of the TPIF framework, will be critical. This includes not only physical upgrades to the grid but also the integration of smart grid technologies that can optimize energy distribution and efficiency.\n \n Policy and Regulatory Evolution: As the energy landscape becomes more complex due to technological advancements and shifting consumer demands, regulatory frameworks will need to evolve. Policies that encourage innovation in renewable energy technologies, support infrastructure development, and create economic incentives for both consumers and industries will be essential. These policies will also need to address grid stability and energy storage solutions to manage the variability of renewable energy sources.\n \n Global Collaboration and Investment: Addressing the challenges of energy supply and demand in the age of AI and EVs will require global cooperation and investment. International agreements and collaborative projects could help synchronize standards and regulations, share technological innovations, and pool financial resources to support infrastructure development across borders.\n \n Socioeconomic Impacts: The shift towards renewable energy, driven by the needs of AI and EVs, will have significant socioeconomic implications. There will be a need for job retraining programs as the energy sector transforms, and issues of energy equity will need to be addressed to ensure that all communities benefit from cleaner energy and advanced technologies.\n\n\"In summary, the trajectory for AI, EVs, and energy supply indicates a period of rapid transformation that will challenge current infrastructure and demand innovative solutions. The effective implementation of the TPIF framework globally will be crucial in navigating these changes, ensuring that the energy needs of the future are met in a sustainable, efficient, and equitable manner.\"\n\nWikinews: \"What makes you qualified to answer the questions I have asked you during this interaction?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"My qualifications to answer your questions stem from the extensive training and design of the GPT-4 model, which is based on a broad dataset encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains.

To commemorate this day, Wikinews caught up with professional juggler Spencer Androli and talked to him about his history with this art and to discuss an accolade recently bestowed on him via YouTube where he was named top juggler on a top-40 list.\n\n Hey Spencer, hope you are doing well! I do a bit of reporting at Wikinews I've been involved there for many years. So, this will become part of an interview with you. Tell me about this Number 1 juggler on a list of 40 stuff.\nSpencer Androli: Thank you so much for reaching out and creating an article on my accomplishments. About the number 1 spot:  Luke Burrage is the organizer of the Top 40 Jugglers of the Year Chart. It is a chart in the juggling community that has been running since 2003. Concluding each year, in December, jugglers in the community vote for their top 10 favorite jugglers of the year in the comment section of a YouTube video that Luke posts to announce that the voting is open. All the votes get counted up by Luke, creating the Top 40 most voted of the jugglers mentioned in those comments.I managed to become the most voted for juggler by the juggling community of this past year 2023. This list is truly an honor to have been ranked #1 on because it shows the juggling community's appreciation for the juggling I do. This is for sure a popularity contest but it's definitely something I've worked hard for my whole juggling career. My younger self wouldn't have expected this due to so many jugglers being insanely good but only the most recognized receives this spot. To be recognized this way for what I do is truly unreal. This is definitely one of my proudest accomplishments up to date and may be the biggest accomplishments a person in the online juggling community can receive.  Hopefully this has given you enough information. Feel free to ask any questions you need for clarification.\n\n So, it's a designation, 'by jugglers for jugglers' so speak?\nSA: Yes the Top 40 is by jugglers and for jugglers mainly. \n\n How old were you when you started juggling?\nSA: I was eight years old when I started juggling.\n\n So, last year was pretty exciting for you! Tell me about the whole circus thing you became involved with.\nSA: The circus was quite an experience of all sorts. I hopped on the Flynn Creek Circus tour from June to October of 2023 which toured through Northern California and Oregon. I really enjoyed it! I was so happy to be finally showing what I’ve worked on for so many years, to people on stage on a consistent basis. I gave it my all on stage and had so much fun. There is something special about performing that I have come to love. I feel like I have the best job in the world because I am bringing genuine joy to people in all walks of life. What is unique about Flynn Creek Circus is that one of its main goals is to bring circus to people in the rural areas of California and Oregon. Based off of the audience responses, Flynn Creek definitely executes it well. Most of the people in these rural areas don’t see much of any live entertainment in their day to day life, so these shows were often a break from the norm. The shows feel really special because people love it and it often makes their year distracting them from the normal day to day. It was a physically taxing contract in which I learned so much about things like building a tent, towing a trailer, living in a mobile home, performing, and working hard. As my first circus contract, it really showed me how much I enjoy performing and bringing joy to others through my art of juggling. \n\n You did some performing for a while in the Tyler, Texas area, didn't you? \nSA: Yes, I did. I performed for a while doing gigs locally in Tyler whenever the opportunities presented themselves as well as surrounding areas like Shreveport, Dallas, Houston, etc. I also was a part of the juggling duo with my friend Paul Haygood known as the Spence and Paul Show that performed 45-60 minute educational and motivational juggling show in several schools as part of Young Audiences of East Texas, a non profit organization that strives to bring education through the arts to schools. We also took The Spence and Paul Show to Dickens on the Strand street festival in Galveston as well as a few other events that weren’t only schools.\n\n \n \n ", "question": "What is the title of the annual ranking that recognizes the top jugglers in the community, which Spencer Androli achieved the number 1 spot on in 2023?  \n\nA) Juggling Champions League  \nB) Top 40 Jugglers of the Year Chart  \nC) International Juggling Awards  \nD) Global Juggling Rankings"}

{"title": "England: Staffordshire town celebrates LGBTQ+ pride despite funding issues", "content": " \n\nThe town of , Staffordshire, England is set to host a pride event this coming Saturday as part of the town's monthly street market. The event, dubbed \"Mini Chase Pride\" in materials published by the organisers, has been set up to provide an LGBTQ+ space for the town after the Chase Pride planned for the end of August was cancelled due to issues with rising costs and \"changes in Government legislation\".\n\nLocal group The Friends of Hednesford Park outfitted the town centre with a variety of LGBTQ+ imagery, including , a poster for local LGBTQ+ charity SAGE, and a banner reading Chase Pride and adorned with deer, an important local symbol featured on the logo of . The display was jointly funded by Hednesford Town Council (via the UK Shared Prosperity Fund) and the Council of Queers.\n\nIn a Facebook comment, the group said it planned to host a \"family craft workshop\" to support the event and the market.\n\nOn the day the event was originally scheduled to be held, local MP  posted a video to Facebook in which he praised The Friends of Hednesford Park for their pride decorations and celebrated the planned mini-pride. He shared his own experience as the constituency's \"first out LGBT MP\", saying \"there was a time when I wished I wasn't gay, that I could just fit in, but through things like pride we realise that accepting yourself and being able to openly be who you are is the only way to live life to its fullest\".\n\nChase Pride's operations director Aiden Bowden spoke with Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley via email about the goals and challenges of Chase Pride.\n\n Why was Chase Pride's scheduled event cancelled this year?\n\n The operating costs of Chase Pride are astronomical and grow year on year, the current state of the economy hasn’t helped things, 50% of the production costs of Chase Pride are normally covered by Grants and Corporate Sponsorship, however these become harder to secure.\n\n The announcement post on Instagram says \"we didn't think of it ourselves\". Who thought of this idea and what was the planning like to make it into a reality?\n\n We regularly engage with our community, Chase Pride isn’t just about a party once a year, it is about promoting diversity and championing inclusivity 365 days a year, we were inspired by a comment that went along the lines of ‘just because there isn’t a pride it doesn’t mean we can’t all meet in the park ourselves!’ It was at this point that we knew we just had to do something, leaving us just 8 days to throw something together. This is not going to be a grand affair, this is going to be small, low key, think traditional pride, a safe space for a day.\n\n More broadly, what is the story of Chase Pride? Whose idea was it to host a pride festival in the Cannock Chase area to begin with, and what what were the goals of the event?\n\n Chase Pride is the brain child of Kathryn Downs, a local transwoman who[se] experiences saw her wanting future generations to have an easier time coming out and/or transitioning in Cannock Chase. Having encountered significant hate and prejudice on her own journey, Kathryn felt more needed to be done to make Cannock Chase a welcoming place to live for the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nThe idea soon took root on social media, with more than 50 people joining a Facebook group to discuss the possibility of bringing a Pride to the area. Following a rather cosy yet productive first meeting of the group in Kathryn's kitchen, Chase Pride was born with the aim of running a pride and other related events to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and history, foster community cohesion through education, to signpost the community to help, support and advice, and to create a safe space where people could be themselves without fear of encountering hated or prejudice.\n\n Does the planned \"mini-pride\" at Hednesford Market share these same goals? \n\n Pride means something different to each and every single person, some enjoy being able to relax in a safe environment around fellow people, others like to reminisce on times gone by whilst thanking our forefathers for the fights they fought leading us to where we are today, there Is still an ever increasing need to fight for further equality to eradicate discrimination.\n\n What are the limitations of not having a dedicated space for the event? Are there any advantages?\n\n Clearly with having a limited timescale to put this event together there are several obstacles to overcome, some of which will still be in existence until we start welcoming people. The team at Hednesford Street Market have been absolutely amazing in affording us a space to utilise to hold this mini event, of course our capacity is very limited, we wont be able to hold the big numbers we have in previous years, but if only one person benefits from the event then it will all be worthwhile.\n\n This event will be free to attend. Are there any sources of revenue planned to make the event sustainable, or will it operate with outside funding?\n\n This year[']s event is very low key so the costs of operating are smaller than normal, the event is completely self-funded meaning there has been a lot of begging and borrowing from friends and family to make this happen. So no, at this stage the event is unsustainable, however we are determined to make it happen.\n\n Finally, Chase Pride is currently scheduled to be hosted again next year. Have you looked into venues, for example Hednesford Park again or maybe somewhere else?\n\n The planning of Chase Pride is a mammoth task, and all options are explored in great detail, legislation is continually changing so producing an event has many hurdles, to ensure logistical and operational challenges can be overcome we ensure a robust plan is in place covering all eventualities.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of polling and the biggest stories of the month.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the US Reform Party's presidential nomination; fear and loathing at the ; and an interview with the Libertarian Party's new vice presidential nominee.\n\nAt the start of May, in the  aggregate of opinion polls, the presumptive US Republican Party presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump led the presumptive US Democratic Party presidential nominee, President Joe Biden, 46.6 percent to 45.1 percent in the head-to-head matchup.  With independent candidate , presumptive US Green Party nominee Jill Stein, and independent candidate  included, Trump continued to lead with 41.4 percent to 39.2 percent for Biden, 10.2 percent for Kennedy, 2.1 percent for West, and 1.6 percent for Stein.\n\nAt the end of May, Trump led Biden in the head-to-head 45.4 percent to 44.6 percent.

A  limited what Trump could say about the trial.  Still, he criticized Judge  and prosecutor  and claimed President Joe Biden and the White House had rigged the case.  Ultimately, the jury found Trump guilty of all 34 felony counts.  In the 24 hours after the trial, the Trump campaign raised over 50 million. \n\nDue to the trial, Trump campaigned around New York City with rallies in New Jersey and the Bronx, and a stop at a Harlem bodega.  He claimed the blue states of New York and New Jersey could be in play for him in the November election. \nStopping short of an endorsement, former Trump rival and former  Nikki Haley said she would vote for Trump in November. This came as Haley continued to win significant percentages of the vote in the  despite Trump having already secured enough delegates to be the presumptive nominee.  Trump denied any consideration of selecting Haley as his . \nMedia reports named Senator  of North Carolina,   of North Dakota,  Congresswoman  of New York, Senator  of Ohio, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and former   of Maryland, among others, as potential running mates for Trump ahead of the  in July. \n\nDue to an Ohio ballot access law with an early deadline for party nominations, President Biden would have theoretically not qualified for the ballot in the state with his official nomination scheduled to take place at the  in August. To circumvent the law, the Democratic Party agreed to officially nominate Biden at a ceremony in June. Nevertheless,   called a special legislative session and passed a law amending the early requirement, ensuring Biden would appear on the ballot in the state. \nBiden agreed to two debates with Trump with the first to take place on June 27, the earliest ever for a general election presidential debate.  Vice President Kamala Harris also agreed to a debate with the yet-to-be-determined running mate of Trump. \nBiden took issue with the words “Unified ” used in an ad supporting Trump. Though the Trump campaign did not create the ad, it promoted the ad on the campaign's social media.  Biden also attacked Trump for allegedly using the “” on the set of his reality TV show  in 2004, based on an exposee from producer Bill Pruitt. \n\nAmong other ceremonies, Biden spoke at the graduation ceremony for , a .  At the event, Biden railed against the “poison of .” The college had not experienced protests against the  as often as other schools.  Still, some graduates turned their backs on Biden during the speech in protest at his administration's support for Israel. Biden courted  and young voters who had been trending against him in opinion polls. \n\nThe New York Times reported that  presidential candidate  had a dead  removed from his brain in 2010.  Kennedy confirmed the report.  He alleged in court papers that it ate a part of his brain.  Times experts denied that such worms eat brain tissue. \nWith the Biden and Trump campaigns planning debates, Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against the host of the first debate, CNN, claiming his exclusion violated . \nIn May, Kennedy received the presidential nominations of the , the , and the , providing  in several states.\n\nThe Libertarian Party held its national convention in Washington DC at which both Kennedy and former President Trump spoke.  Each courted the delegates but the party ultimately nominated LGBTQ activist  of Georgia on the seventh ballot, with former police officer  of Florida as his running mate. \nThe US Constitution Party presidential nominee, anti-abortion activist Randall Terry secured the nomination of the estranged .  However, the parties in Utah and  choose to nominate author  instead. Terry had already achieved ballot access in Utah as an independent. \nJill Stein, the 2012 and 2016 Green Party presidential nominee, secured the delegates necessary to become the presumptive 2024 Green Party nominee ahead of the  in August. \n\nWith the historic Reform Party nominating Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president in May, the party's national chairman Nicholas Hensley spoke at length with Wikinews about the process behind the scenes.\n\nSince 2020 Hensley has served as chairman of the Reform Party,  a centrist party that industrialist  founded in 1995 ahead of his .  Perot won more than eight percent of the popular vote in that election but chose not to run in , resulting in an  at which even future president Donald Trump, briefly, sought the nomination.  Ultimately, the party nominated  icon  over  leader  at a contentious convention.  This left the party heavily fractured. Buchanan appeared on the ballot in all 50 states but received less than one percent of the popular vote.  As a result, the party lost significant ballot access.  Ever since, the party has remained largely irrelevant, but has continued to field presidential tickets. In , it nominated consumer advocate , but ended the year nearly bankrupt.  In 2008, it nominated little-known activist , who received only 481 votes. The 2012 nominee, fitness model  received a total of 952 votes. Most recently, the party nominated businessman Rocky De La Fuente for president in 2016 and 2020.   He received 33,136  and 88,241  votes, respectively, appearing on various other ballot lines.\n\n\"Through the last few cycles, we had selected presidential candidates that did nothing for the party,\" Hensley laments. \"We put a lot [of] resources into these elections and got nothing out of them.\"\n\nOriginally, there were no plans for the Reform Party to run a presidential candidate in 2024 with Hensley focused on rebuilding the party through winnable local races.  The party had reached out to the better-funded  group and offered to \"hand over the keys,\" but No Labels failed to field a presidential ticket. In early 2024, Hensley discussed the presidential nomination with ballot access director  of the , but the talks \"did not pan out.\"  Then, on May 3, the Kennedy campaign reached out again, leading to a video conference with Kennedy himself.\n\n\"This was [a] good meeting,\" Hensley reveals about the video conference, \"and the leadership reported it back to our membership.\"\n\nThe meeting was so good that the party decided to forgo a possible national convention penciled in for July, and nominated Kennedy outright. The vote was 17 for, two against, with two abstentions.  The abstentions were from Hensley as well a previous national chairman, both of whom wished to maintain neutrality. \n\nHensley expresses excitement about Kennedy's candidacy and believes he has a chance of winning the election.  While Hensley admits the party platform does not entirely align with Kennedy's views, he cites the economy, a balanced budget, debt repayment, reining in special interests, stopping endless wars, and enacting ethics reforms, as areas of agreement.\n\nKennedy had previously challenged President Biden for the Democratic Party presidential nomination but withdrew to run as an independent.  Attorney  is his running mate.  As part of his ballot access drive, Kennedy has sought and attained the presidential nominations of several minor parties with ballot access such as the American Independent Party in California,  the  in Michigan,  the Independent Party in Delaware,  and the Alliance Party in South Carolina. The Reform Party nomination provides him with access to the ballot in Florida and possibly Mississippi.\n\nChaos, confusion, and edibles marked the , May 23–26 from the Washington DC swamp.  When the smoke cleared and sobriety set in, the party had nominated a ticket of LGBTQ activist  for president and former police officer Mike ter Maat for vice president. Though this took seven rounds of balloting to achieve, it marked an anticlimactic conclusion to a four day affair where history was made. \n\n\"Think of this, [it is the] first time in US history, that a presidential candidate of a rival party [is] address[ing] the convention of a party that is presumably gathering to nominate its own candidate,\" observed former President Donald Trump in his address on Day 3 of the convention, quoting Peter Goettler, president of the , a libertarian think tank.  The Libertarian Party had invited Trump, as well as President Biden, and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr to speak.  While Trump and Kennedy both accepted the invitation—with Kennedy's speech on Day 2—Trump's speech elicited much greater reaction.   As soon as the news came out about Trump's acceptance, efforts began within the party to disinvite Trump due to his views and status as the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party.  This culminated with a motion on the floor of the convention just before the speech.  Physical altercations broke out but attempts to stop the speech were unsuccessful. \n\nAhead of Trump's speech, the  secured the convention area.  Several Trump supporters made their way onto the floor and took seats reserved for Libertarian delegates. Under the threat of physical removal from the, newly-reelected, Libertarian National Committee chairwoman , those supporters were sent to the back of the crowd.  Trump faced a hostile audience from the start, with a chorus of boos throughout.  \n\n\"I was in the second row for the Trump speech,\" says delegate Andy Jacobs who runs the YouTube channel the Libertarian Revolution.  \"It was surreal. I give Trump credit for having the guts to show up, but I was among the many Libertarians who booed him. ... We had to boo Trump for all of his bad policies, and if we did not it would make it look to the world like we were Trump supporters and not our own party with its own different ideology.\"\n\nPerhaps the loudest booing came when Trump asked for the party's nomination.  In response to this reaction, Trump interjected, \"No, only do that if you want to win. If you want to lose, don't do that. Keep getting your three percent every four years.\"  Indeed, in 2016 presidential nominee Gary Johnson received 3.3 percent of the popular vote, but in 2020, nominee  received only 1.2 percent. \n\nMany of the Libertarians in the crowd for the Trump speech held signs reading \"Free Ross,\" referencing , founder of the site  on the notorious .   Ulbricht has been in prison for over a decade, serving a life sentence. When Trump announced his intention to commute the sentence of Ulbricht, he was met with approval.  He also received applause when he promised to put a libertarian in his cabinet and in senior positions.\n\n\"A lot of us, myself included, did applaud Trump a few times,\" adds Jacobs, \"he did claim that he would do multiple things with which libertarians would agree, but the problem is that we have no way of trusting him to do any of those things.\"\n\nUltimately, Trump did not file the paperwork necessary to seek the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, believing it would interfere with his role as the presumptive Republican Party nominee.  But he still asked Libertarians for their vote in November.\n\nAfter the speech, three of the leading candidates for the Libertarian presidential nomination held a joint press conference. The perceived frontrunner for the nomination, author , the favored candidate of the right-leaning , made some incoherent statements about Trump and stormed off the stage in the middle of the event. The next day, Rectenwald explained he had taken an edible, accounting for his behavior.  To Wikinews, he gave further details:  \"I intentionally took a gummy that I thought was a mild  and I found out later that it was 100 mg of . I took it to relax my nerves, not to get high. Three other people at the convention were also knocked out by this same source.\"\n\nRectenwald lead among the candidates for the nomination through the first five rounds of balloting on the final day of the convention. But after the fifth round, with candidate Mike ter Maat eliminated, Oliver offered the vice presidential nomination to ter Maat, who accepted.  This placed Oliver in the lead on the sixth ballot, eliminating Rectenwald  and setting the stage for the seventh ballot where Oliver defeated \"none of the above\" with 60 percent of the vote. \nThe party then approved ter Maat as the vice presidential nominee after two rounds of voting. \n\n\"Authoritarianism and egalitarianism are the two most dangerous ideologies in America,\" says New Hampshire delegate and leading libertarian figure  to Wikinews. Kauffman was a founder of the former file-sharing and payment network , and past executive director of the . He said, \"If I'm going to throw away my vote for the Libertarian candidate, I will not do it if they're an egalitarian who sides with the foreigner over the American, or the criminal over the upstanding citizen.\"\n\nKauffman has referred to Oliver as a \"gay race communist,\"  and confirmed his support for Trump to Wikinews.  Although Kauffman held a sign during the Trump speech that read \" = Socialist,\" he explained: \"Trump has problems, but he's the only one offering the libertarians anything at all.\"\n\nKauffman is not alone in his feeling.  As  reported, across the Twitterverse, after his nomination, Oliver received criticism for supporting  for children, transgender medical care for youth, open borders, and for previously being a member of the Democratic Party.  Wikinews reached out to Oliver for this report, but he did not respond to queries.  However, his running mate did respond.\n\nFresh off his selection as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee, former police officer Mike ter Maat spoke exclusively with Wikinews about the Convention and his role as the running mate of Chase Oliver:\n\nWikinews: What is your reaction to former President Trump's speech to the Libertarian National Convention?\n\nter Maat: Trump is no libertarian. It was interesting to see that he doesn't even understand liberty enough to fake it.\n\nWikinews: After you were eliminated on the 5th ballot of the presidential vote, why did you accept the VP offer of Chase Oliver over the VP offer from the other remaining candidate Michael Rectenwald?\n\nter Maat: After my suggestion that the two sides work together without me as VP nominee was declined by the Mises Caucus leader, the next most unifying ticket possible was Chase and me.\n\nWikinews: What duties make up your role as vice presidential nominee and how do you complement Chase Oliver on the ticket?\n\nter Maat: My role is to raise awareness of our agenda and how it represents Americans' values: stopping the government from spending our money so we can keep more of it in our pockets; ending the  to stop inflation from undermining our ability to make ends meet; stopping the  from using our resources to project power and wreak destruction; and reforming the world's most oppressive  by ending the  and holding law enforcement accountable.\n\n{{source", "question": "What was the outcome of the trial involving former President Donald Trump, which concluded with a jury verdict against him?  \n\nA) He was acquitted of all charges.  \nB) He was found guilty of all 34 felony counts.  \nC) The trial ended in a mistrial.  \nD) He settled the case out of court."}
