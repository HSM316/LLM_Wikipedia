{"title": "Argentine president Fernández to send bill legalising abortion to National Congress within 10 days", "content": "**Argentina's President to Propose Bill Legalizing Abortion within Ten Days**\n\nOn Sunday, the President of Argentina announced plans to submit a bill to Congress within the next ten days aimed at legalizing abortion. He emphasized that this issue is fundamentally a \"matter of public health.\"\n\n“In the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalizes abortion during the initial stages of pregnancy, allowing women to access the healthcare system when they decide to terminate their pregnancy,” President Fernández stated. Thousands gathered outside the National Congress, voicing their support for the legalization of abortion.\n\nCurrently, abortion is illegal in this predominantly Catholic nation, permitted only in cases of rape or when the pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's health. Fernández pointed out that the existing law has “condemned many women, often those with limited resources, to resort to unsafe abortive practices in secrecy, endangering their health and lives.”\n\nGovernment estimates suggest that approximately 350,000 illegal abortions occur annually in Argentina. Since 1921, illegal abortion has been classified as a crime punishable by imprisonment. \"A state that is present must protect all citizens, especially women,\" Fernández added.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Mariela Belski, director of Amnesty International Argentina, remarked that the president had \"heard the calls from women, adolescents, and girls.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed legislation has faced criticism from Monsignor Jorge Eduardo Scheinig, who described it as a promotion of a \"culture of death.\" He called for prayers that in Argentina, the value of life prevails over death.\n\nUruguay, Guyana, and Cuba are the only other Latin American countries where early abortion is legally permitted. In 2018, the Argentine Congress approved a similar bill, but it was ultimately rejected by the Senate.\n\n**Legislative Proposal to Legalize Abortion to be Presented to Argentina's National Congress**", "question": "What was the purpose of the bill announced by President Fernández of Argentina?  \n\nA) To ban all forms of abortion in the country  \nB) To legalize abortion at the initial time of pregnancy  \nC) To restrict abortion to cases of rape only  \nD) To increase penalties for illegal abortion"}

The decision to lift the emergency was unanimously voted on by officials on Saturday afternoon and was announced by the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) that evening. NEOC reported a 95% immunization rate as of December 24, with the final measles-related death occurring on December 26.\n\nWith the state of emergency lifted, restrictions on public gatherings and travel are being removed, and schools will reopen. The Health Emergency Operation Centre will now take over relief efforts that were previously managed by the NEOC. In addition, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been tasked with developing a recovery plan for cabinet consideration within two weeks.\n\nAs of Sunday, the Disease Surveillance Team reported a total of 5,667 measles cases during the outbreak. Of these, 1,846 individuals were hospitalized, with 1,720 discharged, while 81 tragically lost their lives. According to the National Measles Response and Recovery Appeal on December 6, children under five years old were found to be at the highest risk of mortality, largely due to a lag in vaccinations within that age group.\n\nTupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital resumed normal operations on Sunday, joining Faleolo District Hospital and Leulumoega District Hospital, which returned to regular services on Friday. During the outbreak's peak, Tupua Tamasese Meaole's Acute Primary Care Clinic and Leulumoega District Hospital were converted into measles wards, while Leulumoega was designated to treat patients without measles, allowing for better quarantine measures.

At that time, the immunization rate had reached 92%, which has since increased to 95% according to NEOC data. Aid organizations have indicated that high vaccination rates are crucial to preventing further outbreaks, as those who are infected are less likely to come into contact with unvaccinated individuals.\n\nUNICEF reported delivering over 105,000 vaccine doses to Samoa by November 22, with a national vaccination campaign launching on November 20. The government mandated free vaccinations for children aged six months to 19 years and women aged 20 to 35.

The U.S. government characterized the strike as a defensive measure, citing the December 31 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as an incident in which Soleimani was implicated.\n\nThe airstrike took place near Baghdad International Airport as Soleimani arrived by plane. He was greeted by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), who was also killed in the attack. Other casualties included a high-ranking Iraqi official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer. The Daily Telegraph reported that the airstrike was executed using three rockets launched from helicopters, according to local paramilitary sources.\n\nIn a statement following the airstrike, the U.S. justified its actions, which were authorized by President Donald Trump, as necessary for the protection of U.S. personnel overseas. The statement emphasized that Soleimani was actively planning attacks against American diplomats and service members in Iraq and the broader region, highlighting his responsibility for the deaths of numerous U.S. and coalition personnel. The statement further asserted that the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian aggression and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to safeguard its people and interests globally.\n\nThe airstrike came in response to a series of rocket attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, carried out by groups connected to the PMF. Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for the PMF, accused both Israel and the United States of being behind the attack, although no evidence of Israeli involvement has been presented as of January 3.\n\nThe IRGC announced that Soleimani was \"martyred\" in the airstrike.

Aparna Garg, the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) for Mysore Division, spoke with Wikinews about this significant event.\n\n---\n\n**Wikinews:** Good afternoon, ma'am. Thank you for joining us today. Congratulations to the Mysuru Division for having an all-women crew operate the Tippu Express from Mysore to Bangalore. How many individuals were part of this crew?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** There were fifteen crew members in total. While a train crew typically consists of just the locomotive pilot and the guard, our team included ticket inspectors, escort staff, and Railway Police Force personnel, so the overall crew included around fifteen people.\n\n**Wikinews:** How unusual is it to have an all-women crew running a train?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** It is quite rare. We are actually conducting a ten-day campaign for International Women’s Day, with a new activity each day, and this initiative is part of that campaign.\n\n**Wikinews:** Has there ever been an all-women crew in the Southern Western Railway before this?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Not really, although it has happened in other divisions. Mysore may be the first within our division.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are you aware of any similar events in other regional divisions?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** I believe Bangalore has engaged in similar initiatives, but regarding an all-female crew, there have been accomplishments on a national level.\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you elaborate on this event and when it was planned?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** As I mentioned, we have a ten-day campaign themed \"Each for Equal.\" This theme emphasizes that everyone can contribute to creating a gender-equal world, and we aim to highlight the various roles women hold in male-dominated areas, including railway positions such as locomotive pilots and track patrols.\n\n**Wikinews:** Was this campaign initiated by the Southern Western Railway or Indian Railways more broadly?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** This initiative specifically came from the Mysore Division, which is part of South Western Railway.\n\n**Wikinews:** What other activities has Indian Railways planned for International Women’s Day?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Indian Railways has outlined various initiatives, focusing on \"Each for Equal.\" From March 1 to March 10, we are organizing talks, lectures, and other activities aimed at highlighting the steps taken to enhance women's empowerment across all sectors. This includes social media posts and creating videos that specifically feature women in our workforce. \n\nIn Mysore division, we’ve conducted medical screenings for cervical cancer, providing access to healthcare for both office staff and contract cleaners, who often lack good health facilities. Today, we organized a trekking event for some of our female employees, and we have more activities planned for the upcoming days.\n\n**Wikinews:** How does this year’s celebration differ from last year's?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Last year’s focus was mainly on March 8 alone. This year, by spreading the celebration over ten days, we aim to deepen our impact and encourage greater participation.\n\n**Wikinews:** What activities are planned during this celebration period?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Our goal is to encourage women employees to engage in activities outside of their routine work, allowing them to showcase their talents. For instance, we've organized events like \"pick-and-speak\" that highlight the skills of our female staff, including those in lower-level positions. Furthermore, our focus is also on ensuring enhanced security for women passengers.\n\n**Wikinews:** Would you consider this event a success so far?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Yes, we’ve made significant progress.\n\n**Wikinews:** What challenges do women face while working for Indian Railways?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** The challenges for women mirror those in broader society. Achieving workplace success often requires women to exert more effort than their male counterparts, and recognition can come late. Women often juggle multiple responsibilities, including household duties, and yet remain dedicated and sincere in their work.\n\n**Wikinews:** What solutions do you recommend for these challenges?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Events like Women’s Day help bring focus to these issues, but broader societal change is needed. We must work to shift mindsets, beginning in the home. It’s crucial to sensitize male colleagues and family members to support women’s contributions.\n\n**Wikinews:** What is the current gender distribution in the Mysore Division?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Currently, women represent about ten percent of our total workforce of approximately 6,900 employees, which equates to around 650 women.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are you satisfied with this percentage?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** It’s a start, but I believe that individuals should choose their careers based on personal interest. This is not just about gender but about capabilities.\n\n**Wikinews:** Has the number of women employees increased over recent years?\n\n**Aparna Garg:** Yes, it has increased from about seven or eight percent to the current ten percent.

He mentioned that the Greek government has rejected the demarcation, and he noted the possibility of the matter being resolved at The Hague if diplomatic discussions do not succeed. Mitsotakis expressed a desire for open dialogue with Turkey, stating he would be \"very, very happy\" if Turkey reconsidered its stance.\n\nLater, Mitsotakis met with officials from the International Monetary Fund and President Trump, where he reiterated his condemnation of the Turkey-Libya agreement, highlighting its infringement on Greece’s sovereign rights.\n\nThis past Thursday, delegations from Cyprus, Greece, and Israel convened in Athens for their seventh trilateral summit, where they agreed to expedite the construction of the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The summit was attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with energy ministers from Greece, Cyprus, and Israel. The agreement was formally signed by the energy ministers. A Greek daily reported that Greece and Cyprus must accelerate their efforts to prevent potential Turkish interference with the project.\n\nEarlier on the same day, a Greek gas producer signed a letter of intent to supply two billion cubic meters of gas annually to a Greek gas distributor, while the EastMed pipeline is expected to support a total capacity of 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean, the gas producer, has committed $1.7 billion to development in the Karish and Tanin fields.\n\nNetanyahu, in forming this political and economic alliance with Greece and Cyprus, expressed hopes that the EastMed pipeline would help elevate their geopolitical status. He urged Italy and Egypt to join the project, inviting any interested parties to participate. In Cyprus, the ruling party celebrated the pipeline project as a significant advancement in national sovereignty, though the main opposition party cautioned that actual construction depends on securing investment from still undecided private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hami Aksoy asserted Turkish and Turkish Cypriot rights in the area, suggesting that overlooking these rights could jeopardize the project.\n\nItaly is a proposed endpoint for the pipeline, and the Italian economic development minister expressed support prior to the signing. However, the minister indicated that Italy is pursuing an alternative pipeline route to Greece. The United States has shown support through various initiatives, including the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill and a quadrilateral meeting held in Washington.\n\nIn December, a Turkish official claimed that the operational Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline renders the EastMed project unnecessary. Tensions escalated when Turkey and Libya signed a maritime border agreement in November, asserting rights over sections of sea between Crete and Cyprus, causing Greece to expel the Libyan ambassador.\n\nThe EUM has partially funded feasibility studies for the EastMed pipeline, which is viewed as a Project of Common Interest (PCI) aimed at enhancing Europe's energy security by reducing reliance on Russian gas and diversifying supplies. \n\nProminent energy experts have pointed out the project's geopolitical implications may outweigh its economic viability, given the high estimated costs and fierce competition in the gas market.

{"title": "Iranian International Master Dorsa Derakhshani discusses her chess career with Wikinews", "content": "### Iranian International Master Dorsa Derakhshani Reflects on Her Chess Journey with Wikinews\n\nIn February 2017, the Iranian Chess Federation announced that two teenage chess players, International Master (IM) Dorsa Derakhshani and her younger brother, Borna, had been banned from representing the national team. This decision came despite Dorsa's prior notification to the federation that she no longer wished to play for Iran.\n\nNow 21, Dorsa holds both the IM and Woman Grandmaster (WGM) titles, while Borna currently plays for the UK and also holds the title of IM.\n\nDorsa's ban stemmed from her decision to compete without a hijab during the 2017 World Youth Chess Championship, where adherence to the hijab as a mandatory dress code is enforced under Islamic law in Iran. Borna's ban occurred after he played against Israeli Grandmaster (GM) at the same tournament. Iran does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel, leading to a historic avoidance by Iranian athletes of competing against Israeli counterparts.\n\nMehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, president of the Iranian Chess Federation, clarified their decision, linking it to the players’ actions.\n\nDorsa, who is now studying at Saint Louis University in the United States and playing for the US chess federation, spoke with a Wikinews correspondent about her chess career, life in Iran, the 2017 controversy, and her experiences in St. Louis.\n\n**Early Chess Interest and Background**\n\nGrowing up in Tehran, Dorsa was influenced by her father, who played chess in high school before the Islamic Revolution. Despite the ban on public chess games during that time, he played at home, eventually teaching Dorsa the game.\n\n\"My dad is a pediatrician and my mom is a psychiatrist. They put a lot of emphasis on education,\" she recalls. Dorsa excelled academically, completing first grade at just two-and-a-half years old and finishing fourth grade by age four. The lack of available chess tournaments for talented young players was a significant challenge she faced in Iran.\n\n**Training as a Young Chess Prodigy**\n\nDorsa's competitive spirit motivated her to become the best at chess. She reflects on winning the Girl's Under-8 National Championship as a pivotal moment in her chess career. \n\n\"Chess had a clear category for success. I won my first tournament early on, and it became apparent to me that I was really good at it,\" she said.\n\n**Challenges Faced in Iran**\n\nDorsa faced numerous hurdles as a female chess player in Iran, including limited access to tournaments and strict regulations on women's participation. She advocated for female players, compelling her federation to allow her to compete in male tournaments despite initial resistance.\n\nAt just eight years old, she sought to participate in competitions beyond the constraints placed on female players. Ultimately, Dorsa made the decision not to represent the Iranian Chess Federation, stating, \"It wasn't a good fit.\"\n\n**Decision to Immigrate and Change Federations**\n\nIn 2016, Dorsa informed the Iranian Chess Federation of her choice to switch federations. Following her immigration to Spain, she received scholarship offers from several US colleges, ultimately deciding to move to the United States.\n\nDorsa emphasized that her decision was not solely about the hijab but about the larger societal view of women in Iran, forcing her to work much harder to gain recognition as an equal player. \n\n\"If I had a better voice and future prospects in Iran, I might have made a different choice,” she remarked.\n\n**Current Life and Future Aspirations**\n\nNow, Dorsa is thriving at Saint Louis University, studying to become a surgeon and playing chess actively. She is involved in the chess community and enjoys a supportive environment at her university. \n\n\"My biggest dream is to break into the top five players in the US and to teach younger players about chess,\" she stated.\n\nDorsa also expressed her desire for chess to become more inclusive and for the titles to be restructured to provide a level playing field for all players, regardless of gender.\n\n**Reflections on Identity and Growth**\n\nReflecting on her journey, Dorsa acknowledges the impact of her experiences in Iran and her ongoing mental adjustment to life in the US.\n\n“I’ve learned to be true to myself. It’s okay not to please everyone,” she concluded.\n\nThe challenges Dorsa has faced and her determination to succeed serve as an inspiration to many, highlighting the resilience required to navigate the intersections of culture, identity, and ambition in the world of chess.", "question": "What was the reason for Dorsa Derakhshani being banned from representing the Iranian national team in 2017? \n\nA) She did not win any tournaments  \nB) She refused to play against Israeli players  \nC) She did not wear a hijab during competition  \nD) She wanted to join an international chess federation"}

{"title": "Native American groups sue US state of Montana over ballot law", "content": "On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Montana filed a lawsuit against the state over its 2018 Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), arguing that the law would disenfranchise many Native American voters.\n\nAccording to reports, the majority of Montanans cast their votes by mail, with 73% utilizing this method. Many residents of Montana's Native American reservations lack access to reliable transportation, making it difficult for them to reach voting sites. Consequently, these individuals often complete their ballots and rely on voting organizations to deliver them to election offices. However, BIPA restricts ballot collection by limiting each carrier to six ballots from others, down from the previous limit of 80, unless they are immediate family members. Violating this law could result in a $500 fine.\n\nJacqueline De León from the ACLU stated, \"BIPA disregards the everyday challenges faced by Native American communities. Expecting voters to drive an hour just to drop off their ballots is unreasonable; it's logical to collect ballots within reservation communities. Criminalizing this process is unjust and does not address the underlying issue of mail delivery to Native homes.\"\n\nSupporters of BIPA, including state legislators, argue that it is designed to combat voter fraud by preventing individuals from collecting and potentially discarding ballots based on the voters' preferences. Montana's Secretary of State defended the law, asserting that it has substantial support among Montanans, including those in Indian Country, and criticized attempts to overturn the will of the people.\n\nAs of 2020, approximately 70,000 people lived across seven Native American reservations in Montana, which has a total population of just over one million.\n\nIncluded as plaintiffs in the suit are organizations such as Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote, and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck.

{"title": "Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction", "content": "On Saturday and Sunday evenings, major Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase limits on toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction nationwide, respectively. ALDI followed suit on Monday, implementing a one-pack limit as well. These restrictions were communicated through messages at checkouts and on the chains' Facebook pages, prompted by heightened consumer demand linked to concerns about COVID-19 and potential self-isolation. Additionally, Woolworths announced on Wednesday that customers could only purchase one pack of toilet paper for home delivery.\n\nThis change follows the earlier introduction of a four-pack purchase limit by Woolworths on March 4 and by Coles on March 5. In a March 8 media release, Coles noted that despite the restrictions, many stores were still selling out within an hour of their deliveries, calling the demand \"unprecedented.\" ALDI described the situation as \"unexpected\" in a Tuesday Facebook post. A spokesperson from Woolworths confirmed a \"sharp increase\" in sales last week. A store in Canberra also imposed a two-pack limit last week.\n\nTo help alleviate the shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequencies. Woolworths has also ordered extra stock, while ALDI made its planned special stock available early. Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, highlighted that although retailers are trying to boost their inventory, local council restrictions on delivery timings complicate the process. He anticipates rising production costs as suppliers attempt to meet demand, along with fewer promotional specials. ALDI announced on Tuesday that due to the early release of stock, some stores would not be able to run their scheduled Wednesday specials.\n\nIn a report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, pointed out that stores restock every night. He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, which leads to lower quantities on shelves. When sold out, the empty shelf space exacerbates the perception of a shortage. Zimmerman added that if products like toilet paper and hand sanitizers were available in ample quantities, it could help reduce consumer panic, as reported by ABC News.\n\nMeanwhile, recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap announced on Wednesday that it had run out of stock. Both Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, producer of Sorbent, have emphasized that they are working around the clock to maintain supply, according to a report from News.com.au.\n\nIn an unusual trend, domain.com reported that some property sellers in Melbourne began offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions, coinciding with a decrease in auctions during the long weekend. Additionally, the Thursday edition of the Daily Telegraph included an eight-page insert designed for cutting and using as toilet paper.\n\nInitially, stores had been hesitant to impose restrictions; an ABC Australia report from March 3 indicated that they had no immediate plans to introduce purchasing limits.\n\nZimmerman also noted that other products are experiencing high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dried goods, handwash, and flour. Outside of Australia, British supermarket Tesco was observed limiting purchases of toilet paper to two 12-roll packs on Sunday evening.", "question": "What was the maximum number of toilet paper packages allowed per transaction at Coles on Saturday evening? \n\nA) Two  \nB) Three  \nC) Four  \nD) One"}

We have never felt the need to consume Western medicine.\"\n\nThe event featured a ritual at its outset, where a poster depicting the coronavirus as a demon was displayed, personifying it as an enemy of the Hindu god. Chakrapani, the president of the All India Hindu Union, claimed, \"The coronavirus has emerged because of those who kill and eat animals. Such actions generate destructive energy in their surroundings.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Chakrapani controversially stated, \"The coronavirus is not merely a virus but an embodiment aimed at protecting innocent creatures.

{"title": "Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far", "content": "**Astronomer Discusses Discovery of Closest Known Black Hole**\n\nA recent study published last month in a leading journal has revealed that astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and their collaborators have discovered a black hole located approximately 1,010 ± 195 light years from Earth, making it the closest known black hole to our planet. The previous closest black hole, V616 Monocerotis (V616 Mon), was estimated to be over 3,000 light years away.\n\nThe newly identified black hole is situated in the HR 6819 system within the Telescopium constellation, marking it as the first known system visible to the naked eye to contain a black hole. The HR 6819 system comprises two observable stars, which have been under observation since 1999. Initially thought to be a simple binary system, further investigation revealed an unseen third object, identified as a black hole, around which one of the two stars orbits every 40.333 ± 0.004 days.\n\nThis particular black hole does not exhibit an accretion disk, which typically forms when a significant amount of matter gathers around a black hole and emits X-rays, making detection easier. Instead, our understanding of this black hole's existence relied on its gravitational effects on the nearby star.\n\nUsing spectroscopy, researchers determined that the black hole has a mass of at least 4.2 solar masses (M☉). The star orbiting the black hole is classified as a Be star, which rotates rapidly, while the other star in the system is classified as a main-sequence star. The Be star's rapid rotation causes it to take on an oblate shape, with a noticeable bulge at the equator.\n\nThe research suggests that HR 6819 is remarkably similar to other binary systems and estimates its age to be between 15 to 75 million years. The inner star has a minimum mass of 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉. By analyzing the mass and rotation speed of this star, the researchers estimated the black hole's mass to be around 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉. Thomas Rivinius, a researcher and co-author of the study, informed Wikinews that the distance between the inner star and the black hole is closer than that between the Earth and the Sun (approximately 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles).\n\nThe study is dedicated to Stanislav Štefl, a fellow researcher who tragically lost his life in a car accident in 2014.\n\nWikinews interviewed Thomas Rivinius to learn more about this significant discovery:\n\n**Wikinews:** Thank you for joining us to discuss this discovery. What inspired the team to investigate HR 6819?\n\n**Thomas Rivinius:** We were initially drawn to HR 6819 because it was listed in a catalog of exceptionally rapidly rotating Be stars. Over the years, we narrowed our focus to this system due to its intriguing characteristics.\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you elaborate on the significance of discovering this black hole?\n\n**Thomas Rivinius:** This discovery highlights that black holes are more common than previously thought. Identifying black holes in multiple star systems, rather than as isolated entities, allows us greater opportunity to study them through their gravitational influence on companion stars. \n\n**Wikinews:** What technologies were instrumental in this discovery?\n\n**Thomas Rivinius:** We used spectroscopy to analyze the light from the stars, allowing us to measure their velocities and infer the presence of the unseen black hole through the gravitational effects observed.\n\n**Wikinews:** How do black holes without accretion disks differ from those with them?\n\n**Thomas Rivinius:** Black holes lacking an accretion disk do not emit radiation in the same way as those with a disk. The absence of an accretion disk means we rely on other indicators, such as gravitational effects, to establish their existence.\n\n**Wikinews:** What future investigations do you foresee regarding HR 6819?\n\n**Thomas Rivinius:** We plan to conduct further measurements to refine our estimates of the black hole's mass and the distances within the system. This will help us understand the evolution of such massive stellar systems.\n\nThis remarkable discovery sheds light on black holes’ prevalence and presents an exciting opportunity for further research into stellar evolution and gravitational interactions in multiple star systems.", "question": "What is the distance of the newly discovered black hole, HR 6819, from Earth?  \n\nA) 1010 light years  \nB) 310 light years  \nC) 3000 light years  \nD) 150 million kilometers"}

{"title": "COVID-19 may spread like flu, say scientists", "content": "In a report released on Wednesday, scientists studying patients in China announced that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, may spread in a manner similar to influenza. This finding suggests that the outbreak, which began in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, might require containment measures analogous to those used for influenza.\n\nThe researchers analyzed polyester swab samples from the noses and throats of eighteen infected volunteers, including one who was asymptomatic. Their findings indicated that the virus behaves more like influenza than the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), despite SARS-CoV-2 being more closely related to SARS coronaviruses than to typical influenza viruses.\n\nUnlike SARS viruses, which primarily infect the lower respiratory tract and can lead to pneumonia, COVID-19 can reside in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Significant amounts of the virus were found in samples from the participants' nasal and throat swabs. The presence of the virus in an asymptomatic individual, alongside others who exhibited only mild symptoms, raises concerns that, similar to flu, SARS-CoV-2 could be spread by individuals who are unaware they are infectious.\n\nImmunologist Kristian Andersen commented on the study, stating, \"This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we've ever seen. Its transmission is more akin to that of influenza.\"\n\nContainment strategies during the SARS outbreak in 2003 focused largely on preventing viral spread within hospitals. If these recent findings hold true, experts suggest that managing the COVID-19 outbreak may require a fundamentally different approach.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, or R0, for SARS-CoV-2 — which indicates how many people an infected individual will transmit the virus to before recovering or dying — has not yet been established. R0 can fluctuate as populations adapt through increased immunity, vaccination, or changes in behavior. To provide context, the R0 for SARS is estimated to be between 2 and 4, while that for influenza ranges from 2 to 3. In contrast, some sources suggest that the R0 for COVID-19 could be as high as 12 to 18. Generally, outbreaks with R0 values below 1 tend to taper off, while those above 1 can continue to spread.", "question": "What notable similarity did scientists find between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza regarding transmission?  \n\nA) SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lower respiratory tract.  \nB) Asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus.  \nC) The R0 value of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of influenza.  \nD) Both viruses require hospital containment measures."}
{"title": "Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists", "content": "A new study released by Florida researchers on Monday reveals that spiky skulls have evolved independently at least 25 times across various frog species. The findings are set to be published in an upcoming scientific journal.\n\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida, explained, \"Although frogs may appear similar at first glance, their skull structures reveal significant differences. Some of the most unusual skulls belong to frogs that prey on birds and mammals, use their heads as shields, or, in rare cases, are venomous. These variations highlight the incredible diversity of frogs.\"\n\nContrary to previous hypotheses suggesting that smaller frogs were more likely to develop spiky skulls, this study found different results. Researchers analyzed skulls from 158 distinct frog species and discovered that frogs with similar ecological roles—whether in terms of foraging or predator defense—tended to develop comparable skull features, such as grooves, spikes, and specialized jaw joints.\n\nThe study indicates that skull formations featuring spikes, grooves, or ridges—referred to as ornamentation—are often found in frogs that consume prey significantly larger than themselves. These robust skull structures enable frogs to capture larger animals, including birds, rodents, reptiles, and even other frogs. Additionally, spikes may be linked to venomous frogs, as they could deter predators by damaging venom sacs located just beneath the frog's skin when threatened.\n\nThe research also noted other bone formations, such as fang-like projections and distinctive lower teeth, which some frog species utilize for prey capture and combat. It’s important to note that very few frogs possess true lower teeth.\n\nHerpetologist David Blackburn, another author of the study, pointed out that the frequent evolution of spiky skulls in unrelated frog species suggests a deeper biological pattern: \"These findings imply that these frogs are activating some ancient developmental mechanisms in their evolution.\"\n\nSince the last comprehensive survey of frog skulls in 1973, scientists have identified enough new species to double the known number of frogs. Advances in technology, particularly the use of CT scans, played a critical role in this research, as Paluh and his team extensively utilized these imaging techniques. This study is part of the oVert project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation and aims to CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from museums across the United States.", "question": "What significant finding did the new study on frog skulls report regarding their evolution?  \n\nA) Frogs with spiky skulls tend to be smaller in size.  \nB) Spiky skulls in frogs have evolved at least 25 times independently.  \nC) All frogs have similar skull structures regardless of their diet.  \nD) Frogs with flat skulls are more common than those with spiky ones."}

Wikinews spoke with Dr. Valeria Gazzola and her colleague, Dr. [Name], both authors of the paper, to explore their findings.\n\nIn the experiment, rats were placed in a container with two levers after developing a preference for one that was easier to press. Each lever dispensed a pellet of sucrose, with the more favored lever also delivering a shock to a nearby rat, known as the \"victim rat.\" The study found that \"actor\" rats were inclined to switch to the harder lever in order to avoid causing the other rat distress.\n\nBoth male and female rats exhibited similar levels of harm aversion. The study indicated that actor rats exposed to shocks previously demonstrated an increased sensitivity to harming others. Interestingly, even when the injured lever offered two sucrose pellets, the rats often chose not to engage with it to prevent harming the victim rat, although this changed when the reward increased to three pellets.\n\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was shown to play a significant role in harm aversion. When the ACC was deactivated using the drug muscimol, rats no longer displayed an aversion to inflicting pain on the victim rat, whereas control rats with intact ACC function maintained their sensitivity.\n\nWikinews further engaged Dr. Gazzola and [Name] about the motivations behind their research and its implications for understanding empathy in both animals and humans. They emphasized that the study aimed to uncover the brain mechanisms that facilitate empathetic behavior, motivated by curiosity about how distress in one animal might be perceived by another.\n\nWhile they acknowledged challenges in human research, the scientists sought to replicate similar behaviors in rats, understanding their contributions to social dynamics even in a laboratory setting. Their findings suggest that harm aversion is deeply rooted in the evolutionary history shared between species, possibly dating back over 100 million years.\n\nOverall, the research points to the complex interplay of reward, empathy, and decision-making in both rats and humans. By understanding these mechanisms, the scientists hope to pave the way for interventions that could enhance empathy in individuals who exhibit anti-social behaviors, potentially leading to more peaceful interactions within society.\n\nAs their research progresses, the team plans to explore the differences in harm aversion across species and potentially investigate how genetics and environment might influence empathetic responses in future studies.", "question": "What brain region was found to be crucial for harm aversion in rats, according to the study conducted by neuroscientists?  \n\nA) Hippocampus  \nB) Prefrontal Cortex  \nC) Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)  \nD) Amygdala"}

{"title": "Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti discusses observation of birth of potential exoplanet with Wikinews", "content": "**Title: Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti Discusses Observations of Possible Exoplanet Formation with Wikinews**\n\nIn March, a study led by astronomer Anthony Boccaletti and his team offered intriguing evidence suggesting the potential formation of an exoplanet around the young star AB Aurigae, a discovery that highlights the dynamics of planets beyond our Solar System.\n\nBoccaletti explained to Wikinews that AB Aurigae, approximately five million years old, is much younger than our Sun, which is around 4.6 billion years old. Located about 520 light-years away from Earth, in the constellation Auriga, AB Aurigae provided a prime target for the astronomers as they examined its protoplanetary disk—a swirling mass of gas and dust that could give rise to new planets.\n\nUsing the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, Boccaletti and his colleagues focused on the disk's detailed structures. They discovered twists within the disk, which might indicate the formation of a massive planet, potentially larger than Jupiter, or possibly another celestial object.\n\nThe observed disturbances in the disk occurred approximately 30 astronomical units from AB Aurigae, roughly the same distance as from our Sun to Neptune. However, since AB Aurigae is about 2.4 times more massive than the Sun, its gravitational influences differ markedly. The team began monitoring this system in 2019 and hopes to conduct follow-up observations to confirm their findings regarding the detected twists.\n\nDespite various theories about exoplanet formation, direct observations of planet birth remain elusive. The young exoplanet, identified in 2016, is approximately 9.3 million years old.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Wikinews last month, Boccaletti shared insights on his research and motivations, emphasizing the thrill of investigating astronomical phenomena that remain fundamentally distant from our experience on Earth.\n\nWhen asked about his passion for astronomy, Boccaletti lightheartedly remarked, \"It's fun! Exploring objects that are incredibly far away and entirely different from us presents a thrilling challenge.\" Involved in instrument development since 2005, Boccaletti played a crucial role in the creation and implementation of the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE) instrument, which specializes in imaging exoplanets.\n\nHis team focused on AB Aurigae because prior observations indicated the presence of a protoplanetary disk around the star, providing an opportunity to investigate potential planet formation with greater detail. They noted that the spirals visible in the disk indicated gravitational disturbances that could hint at a planetary presence.\n\nBoccaletti elaborated, explaining how the twisted structures in the disk align with modeling predictions of where a forming planet might create observable influences on surrounding gas. He emphasized that while they suspect they are observing a forming planet, additional observations will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe study's timeline began with telescope time requests made last year, leading up to successful observations in December 2019. “We were particularly interested in very young stars, where planets tend to form,” Boccaletti noted.\n\nIn total, the collaborative effort brought together experts from France, the United States, Taiwan, and Belgium, demonstrating the global interest in this astronomical inquiry. Boccaletti anticipates future observations will illuminate the stability and evolution of the spiral structures and ascertain whether the material observed is indeed indicative of a forming planet. \n\nAs ongoing research continues into the nature of planet formation, Boccaletti views this discovery as a stepping stone that could enhance our understanding of how giant planets like Jupiter come into existence—highlighting that while their study is still in its infancy, significant strides are poised to unravel the mysteries of exoplanetary systems.\n\nIn closing, Boccaletti expressed his eagerness to gain deeper insight into the functions of these young planetary systems, remarking that significant discoveries remain on the horizon.", "question": "What is the distance of the potential exoplanet's formation from the host star AB Aurigae?\n\nA) 5 astronomical units  \nB) 30 astronomical units  \nC) 520 astronomical units  \nD) 4.6 billion kilometers"}

He pointed out that heroin, which was typically laced with fentanyl, is now being mixed with the sedative carfentanil or other nervous system depressants.\n\nBob Hughes, the Executive Director of the Ask Wellness Society, noted that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), a pandemic relief program, may have contributed to a rise in overdose deaths this year.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden held a lead over incumbent President Donald Trump, according to head-to-head opinion polls, averaging 47.4% to 42.1%. A specific poll that included Jovin Amash, the then-Libertarian candidate, showed Biden with 47% and Trump trailing at 40%, while Amash garnered 5%.\n\nAfter initially contending for the Libertarian presidential nomination, Congressman Amash withdrew just before the party’s online convention, where former presidential candidate Jacob Hornberger secured the nomination. Podcast host Spike Cohen was nominated for vice president. In a separate online convention, the U.S. Constitution Party selected businessman Don Blankenship for president, with Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman William Mohr as his running mate. Meanwhile, in the Green Party, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura expressed interest in running but ultimately opted out. Labor activist Howie Hawkins increased his lead among pledged Green Party delegates in anticipation of the online convention scheduled for July 11, while his hopes for a left-wing coalition were affected by other party nominations.\n\nBiden recently addressed allegations from his former staffer Tara Reade concerning an incident from 1993. He vehemently denied the claim on a television program, stating, \"It never happened.\" An additional claim surfaced from a niece of Biden's opponent, who alleged inappropriate comments made by Biden when she was 14 years old, which Biden's campaign called “absolutely false.” The Biden campaign is actively seeking a female running mate, with potential candidates including Georgia's Stacey Abrams, Florida’s Val Demings, and California’s Kamala Harris. Biden aims to announce his choice by August 1. \n\nIn May, Biden faced backlash for a comment suggesting that African Americans who struggle to distinguish between him and Trump \"ain't black.\" His remarks prompted an apology, with Biden acknowledging the insensitivity of his words. Additionally, he came under scrutiny regarding his involvement in the unmasking of former national security advisor Michael Flynn, an issue that has drawn the ire of President Trump, who referred to it as \"Obamagate.\" Analyses on social media have seen Biden referred to as \"Dementia Joe.\"\n\nPresident Trump also made headlines in May with several controversial statements. Following previous remarks about using disinfectant to treat COVID-19, he faced criticism but later claimed to have taken hydroxychloroquine, despite reported side effects. He expressed support for protests aimed at lifting stay-at-home orders, which contradicted his own public health guidelines. Trump also advanced unverified conspiracy theories regarding the death of a Congressional intern, and partially incited backlash regarding his tweet referencing the Minneapolis protests that followed George Floyd's death.\n\nBy month's end, with over 100,000 COVID-19 related deaths and ongoing protests across the country, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics poll average at 48.4% to 42.5%.\n\nDuring the Constitution Party's National Convention held online on May 2, Don Blankenship was nominated for president, with William Mohr as his running mate. Blankenship's prior tenure as CEO of Massey Energy during a tragic mining disaster and his subsequent legal troubles have drawn scrutiny, while Mohr remains a relatively lesser-known figure in politics.\n\nIn the Libertarian National Convention on May 23, psychologist Jo Jorgensen was nominated for president along with podcast host Spike Cohen as her running mate. Cohen, formerly a neoconservative, began his journey towards libertarianism as he reassessed his views on foreign wars and government intervention. \n\nOn May 5, Hawkins announced Angela Walker as his running mate for the Green Party nomination. Walker, who previously ran as the Socialist Party USA's vice presidential nominee, articulates a need for progressive change and empowerment of marginalized communities through increased political engagement and education.\n\nThis month has proven to be dynamic and multifaceted on the campaign trail, as candidates navigate a complex political and social landscape with high stakes heading into the election.", "question": "Who was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party at the online national convention held on May 23, 2020?\n\nA) Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen  \nB) Jo Jorgensen  \nC) Gary Johnson  \nD) Bill Weld"}

Saturn, an accredited reporter for Wikinews.\n\nKnown as the \"king of coal,\" Blankenship served as chairman and CEO of Massey Energy from 2000 to 2010. His tenure was marred by the tragic 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster that claimed the lives of 29 miners. In 2016, he was convicted of a misdemeanor for conspiracy to willfully violate safety standards and sentenced to one year in prison. Blankenship has consistently maintained his innocence, attributing the disaster to federal regulatory failures. After his release, he pursued a failed campaign for the Republican Party’s U.S. Senate nomination in West Virginia before turning to the Constitution Party, where he garnered the presidential nomination during a virtual convention in May 2020. Blankenship selected party chairman Mike Mohr as his running mate. Mohr praised Blankenship in a June interview with Wikinews, calling him \"a good man with vast knowledge in the political field\" who possesses \"superior backbone\" and the potential to be the strongest President in decades.\n\nThe Constitution Party, initially founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1991 and renamed in 1999, promotes limited government, gun rights, protectionism, non-interventionism, and a strong opposition to abortion and illegal immigration. In the 2016 election, the party's nominee received 203,091 votes, which represented 0.15% of the total votes cast, with ballot access in 24 states. The Blankenship-Mohr campaign is currently on the ballot in 18 states, with some write-in options available.\n\nDuring the interview, Blankenship shared insights about his background, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on his campaign, and his vision for a presidency. He also made a direct appeal to voters as Election Day approached.\n\n**Q&A Highlights:**\n\n**Wikinews:** Which past leader do you most admire and why?  \n**Blankenship:** Anyone who has put their life where their mouth is.\n\n**Wikinews:** How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?  \n**Blankenship:** I have navigated the intricacies of government and understand its flaws. My life experiences, having been poor, wealthy, imprisoned, and defamed, equip me to confront the establishment effectively. \n\n**Wikinews:** How would you describe your leadership style in comparison to President Trump and former President Obama?  \n**Blankenship:** My leadership is centered on truth and conviction, where I stand for what is right, even when it's unpopular. Neither Trump nor Obama exemplify true leadership; rather, they mislead.\n\n**Wikinews:** If you were president, how would you have managed the COVID-19 pandemic differently?  \n**Blankenship:** I would have enforced quarantines for symptomatic individuals, protected the elderly, and allowed healthy, younger individuals to continue working.\n\n**Wikinews:** How has the pandemic impacted your campaign?  \n**Blankenship:** The pandemic significantly restricted our ability to gather signatures for ballot access due to social distancing measures.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your expectations for votes in the 2020 election, compared to the 2016 Constitutional Party nominee?  \n**Blankenship:** We believe we can exceed that number, especially if we had full ballot access in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\n**Wikinews:** What would a Blankenship administration entail?  \n**Blankenship:** It would be streamlined, with fewer cabinet positions filled by those from outside the government who have faced its challenges.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you approach Supreme Court nominations?  \n**Blankenship:** I would nominate judges committed to upholding the Constitution, prioritizing legal rather than political decisions.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you engage with Congress to advance your proposals?  \n**Blankenship:** Through a strategy of common sense and reason, avoiding theatrics while emphasizing factual discourse.\n\n**Wikinews:** What is your stance on climate change?  \n**Blankenship:** I believe the government should focus on more pressing issues than climate change, as we need to prioritize our country’s more immediate challenges.\n\n**Wikinews:** Regarding the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, how would you handle it as president?  \n**Blankenship:** The U.S. should refrain from policing the world and allow nations like Armenia and Azerbaijan to resolve their own conflicts independently.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on censorship by social media platforms?  \n**Blankenship:** Free speech must be protected, with minimal restrictions on social media, which should serve as platforms for public assembly.\n\n**Wikinews:** How can the U.S. improve race relations?  \n**Blankenship:** We must stop providing privileges that infringe upon others' rights and address educational inequalities based on neighborhood rather than race.\n\n**Wikinews:** As Election Day nears, what is your final message to voters?  \n**Blankenship:** My plea is for voters to recognize that the preservation of your rights, American values, and the future for your children depends on America’s survival.

{"title": "British supermarket chain Tesco to sell its Polish branch to Salling Group A/S", "content": "On Thursday, UK retailer Tesco announced its agreement to sell a significant portion of its Polish operations to Denmark-based Salling Group. Tesco intends to exit the Polish market entirely, while Salling aims to expand its presence in the country.\n\nThe deal involves 301 stores, two distribution centers, and the head office. Salling plans to enhance its coverage in Southern Poland and, over the next 18 months, will invest one billion złotys to integrate these stores into its existing network of 386 outlets. As part of the acquisition, Salling will also inherit approximately 7,000 employees from Tesco, with Netto Poland currently employing around 5,000 staff. Tesco will retain 19 stores that are not included in the sale.\n\nThe sale price, to be paid in cash, is 900 million złotys (approximately 181 million pounds). In the fiscal year 2019/20, Tesco reported a 24 million pounds operating loss from its Polish branch, which generated a turnover of 1,368 million pounds, with the divested units contributing a turnover of 947 million pounds and a loss of 107 million pounds. At the end of the fiscal year, these sold units had a book value of 681 million pounds.\n\nThe deal requires approval from the Polish anti-monopoly agency, with both parties expecting a decision later this year.\n\nTesco has faced ongoing losses in Poland due to shifts in consumer preferences from larger stores to smaller discount retailers like Biedronka and Lidl. Tesco's performance was further impacted by the introduction of the \"Sunday Trading Act\" in 2018, which restricted its operating hours. Notably, many discount stores have adapted by offering postal services as a workaround to maintain Sunday trading.\n\nIn 2015, Tesco centralized its management across its Central European operations, which included Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, but later reversed that decision. The company invested in e-commerce and began offering home deliveries, though only 0.5% of its Polish grocery turnover now comes from this segment, compared to 7% in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, Tesco Polska has reduced expenses by streamlining its product range, cutting its workforce by half, discontinuing home delivery in certain areas, and closing stores, including its distribution center last year. As reported in mid-2019, 62 Tesco locations shut down within a year, leading to staff shortages in departments such as meat, fish, and delicatessen, as well as the closure of staff canteens and administrative simplifications.\n\nIn addition to its Polish exit, Tesco sold around 2,000 stores in Thailand and 74 in Malaysia to a local company in March, announced its departure from a joint venture in February, and sold its South Korean chain in 2015. Matt Simister, Tesco’s CEO for Central Europe, noted that the company held a 4% share of the Polish retail market, significantly lower than its 16% share in Hungary, where it plans to remain. Last March, Tesco's CEO had stated that the company had no intentions of leaving Thailand or Poland.\n\nIndustry observers indicate that Tesco's Polish operation is too expansive for a single, monolithic sale. Tesco's press release mentioned that it sold 22 units in the past year and a half for a total of around 200 million pounds. Among the prospective buyers were the Netto chain and property developer Vögele.\n\nBoth Tesco and Salling entered the Polish market in 1995.", "question": "What is the total number of stores included in the sale agreement between Tesco and Salling Group? \n\nA) 301 stores  \nB) 386 stores  \nC) 74 stores  \nD) 7000 stores"}

Saturn spoke with Bill Hammons, the Unity Party of America’s presidential nominee from Colorado, regarding his campaign for the 2020 presidential election. \n\nA former manager and owner of the website \"Bill's List,\" Hammons founded the Unity Party in 2004 with supporters of General Wesley Clark, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. The Unity Party advocates for several reforms, including a global minimum wage for fair trade, the elimination of the tax deduction for health care costs, campaign finance reforms, lowering the voting age, and expanding access to voting.\n\nThroughout his political career, Hammons has increased the party’s visibility by running for various public offices. He has campaigned for U.S. Congress in 2008 and 2010, the U.S. Senate in 2014 and 2016, and for governor in 2018. In his current presidential campaign, he has become the Unity Party's first official nominee, with engineer Eric Bodenstab—who was the party's 2018 gubernatorial candidate—as his running mate. The Hammons-Bodenstab ticket has obtained ballot access in Colorado, Louisiana, and New Jersey.\n\nIn his interview with Wikinews, Hammons discussed a range of topics, including his campaign, the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n**Q: Which past leader do you most admire and why?**  \n**Hammons:** George Washington. Our first president established many precedents, most importantly, the principle of keeping the presidency from becoming overly powerful.\n\n**Q: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?**  \n**Hammons:** I am the founder and chairman of the Unity Party, which has a presence in 42 states, and my experience as a former manager at *Newsweek* has equipped me with knowledge of national and international affairs. Owning “Bill’s List” has also taught me how to engage a wide audience without depending on traditional media.\n\n**Q: How would you describe your leadership style? How does it compare to that of President Trump and former President Obama?**  \n**Hammons:** My approach is collaborative, believing in the importance of listening to all perspectives—even those I disagree with—before seeking common ground.\n\n**Q: How would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?**  \n**Hammons:** We need to ramp up the use of wartime production to secure necessary resources to combat the pandemic. Taiwan's success demonstrates what can be achieved, and we need widespread testing and a robust contact tracing initiative. Additionally, we can utilize empty hotels for quarantining exposed individuals and provide financial support for their isolation.\n\n**Q: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and outreach to voters?**  \n**Hammons:** The pandemic has hindered traditional door-knocking efforts. Since declaring my candidacy, we’ve emphasized phone and text outreach to connect with voters.\n\n**Q: What is your expected vote count in the 2020 election?**  \n**Hammons:** My support has been on an upward trajectory, and that trend is likely to continue, along with increasing Unity Party registrations.\n\n**Q: What would a Hammons administration look like? Who would be in your cabinet?**  \n**Hammons:** I would model my administration after Lincoln’s “Team of Rivals,” selecting individuals motivated by a commitment to effective governance rather than strict ideology.\n\n**Q: Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court? Do you have any specific litmus tests?

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Phil Collins, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee", "content": "**Phil Collins Discusses 2020 Presidential Campaign with Wikinews Reporter**\n\nPhil Collins, the presidential nominee for the U.S. Prohibition Party, recently sat down with William S. Saturn, an accredited reporter from Wikinews, to discuss his campaign and thoughts on various political issues.\n\nCollins, currently the chairman of the Prohibition Party, has a notable political history. He previously served as a trustee in Illinois and chaired the Prohibition Party of Illinois. After relocating to Nevada, he ran for a Las Vegas office in 2019, finishing second. Initially, the Prohibition Party nominated Bill Bayes for president and C.L. Gammon for vice president in November 2018. However, after Bayes withdrew in March 2019, Gammon assumed the presidential nomination, while Collins became the vice presidential nominee. Following Gammon's withdrawal due to health issues in August 2019, Collins stepped in as the presidential nominee, with anti-alcohol advocate Billy Joe Parker as his running mate.\n\nFollowing his nomination, Collins aimed to secure ballot access by pursuing endorsements from the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party in California and Florida, respectively. He won the AIP California Presidential Primary in March but ultimately lost the nomination to businessman Rocky De La Fuente in August. Similarly, he failed to secure the Reform Party's nomination in June. Despite these setbacks, the Prohibition Party has successfully gained ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont. The last presidential election in which the party appeared on at least four state ballots was in 2004.\n\nEstablished in 1869, the Prohibition Party is the third oldest political party in the United States, peaking in popularity during the late 19th century. The party is historically known for advocating Prohibition, which led to the nationwide ban on alcohol from 1919 to 1933. Since the repeal of Prohibition, the party has seen a decline in influence, although it continues to operate with the support of the George L. Pennock Trust, established in 1939. Collins is the third Prohibition Party presidential nominee to speak with Wikinews, following Jim Hedges in 2008 and 2016.\n\nIn his interview with Wikinews, Collins addressed various topics, including his background, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on his campaign, presidential nominations, governmental gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations. \n\n**Key Quotes from Collins:**\n\n- **On Historical Figures:** \"I admire Abraham Lincoln because he was a good leader during the Civil War. He ensured that the Union was preserved and effectively chose capable cabinet members and generals.\"\n- **On Joining the Prohibition Party:** \"I joined in the summer of 2014 because I found that I agreed with most of the platform and realized I could be a state leader as there weren't many members in Illinois.\"\n- **On Leadership Style:** \"I would adopt a constitutional approach, focusing on the Constitution when deciding whether to sign or veto bills, unlike Presidents Trump and Obama who increased spending and debt.\"\n- **On Handling COVID-19:** \"I would encourage governors to collaborate better and share successful strategies publicly to help mitigate the pandemic.\"\n- **On Anticipated Votes:** \"I believe I will receive between 9,000 and 11,000 votes since I have greater ballot access and recognition in more states compared to Mr. Hedges.\"\n- **On Climate Change:** \"Some scientists argue that climate change isn’t human-caused but part of a natural cycle. If most scientists point to human contributions, I'll seek advice from formerly serving heads on how to address it.\"\n- **On Social Media Censorship:** \"I am concerned about censorship. As president, I would promote the use of various social media platforms to encourage free speech.\"\n\nCollins' campaign continues to advocate for Prohibition Party values and hopes to increase their presence in the 2020 election.", "question": "What was the original presidential nominee of the Prohibition Party before Phil Collins was selected for the 2020 election?  \n\nA) C.L.

{"title": "Neanderthals 'knew what they were doing': Archæologist Dr Naomi Martisius discusses her findings about Neanderthals' behaviour with Wikinews", "content": "**Neanderthals Were More Skilled Than Previously Thought: Dr. Naomi Martisius Talks About Her Research**\n\nIn a recent study published last month, archaeologist Dr. Naomi Martisius and her team revealed that Neanderthals in Europe thousands of years ago exhibited a level of sophistication previously unrecognized. Their research, published on May 8, demonstrated that these early humans selectively used bones from certain animal species to craft tools, suggesting a deeper understanding of their environment and resources.\n\nDr. Martisius and her colleagues examined five bone tools discovered at Neanderthal sites in southwest France. Four of these tools came from a site known as Abri Peyrony, while the other originated from Pech-de-l’Azé. Measuring only a few centimeters in size, these artifacts date back approximately 50,000 years. Microscopic analysis identified the bone tools, called lissoirs (or \"smoothers\"), as being employed for processing animal skins into leather.\n\nThe study highlighted the significant presence of medium-sized ungulates, such as reindeer, in the area; however, the Neanderthals favored large bovid ribs for crafting their tools. Dr. Martisius explained that the choice was likely due to the sturdiness of bovid ribs, which are \"thicker\" and \"stronger\" compared to the more delicate ribs of reindeer. To pinpoint the origins of the bone tools, the researchers utilized non-destructive Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).\n\nThis innovative approach enabled the team to gather collagen samples from the walls of plastic containers where the artifacts were stored over varying periods—some for five years and others for just a few months. The collagen proteins had adhered to the containers, allowing them to be analyzed without harming the artifacts themselves. The team used an enzyme called trypsin to break the collagen down into peptides, which were then tested with a Mass Spectrometer to identify the species of origin.\n\nThe results confirmed that the four bone tools from Abri Peyrony were derived from large bovids. This finding suggests intentional selection, as Neanderthals consciously chose sturdier bones despite the abundance of smaller ungulates like reindeer. Dr. Martisius emphasized that although non-destructive ZooMS analysis has been applied before, it had never been done on such ancient artifacts.\n\nWikinews engaged Dr. Martisius to delve deeper into her research.\n\n**Wikinews (WN):** What spurred your interest in archaeology?\n\n**Dr. Martisius (DM):** My passion for archaeology goes back to my childhood, inspired by my father's keen interest in history. However, I didn't grasp what archaeology truly encompassed until I began studying it formally. Unlike history, which often revolves around the elite and documented events, archaeology focuses on understanding the lives of everyday people.\n\n**WN:** What was the main objective of this study?\n\n**DM:** The primary goal was to determine the specific animal origins of the bone tools I was studying. These small fragments were challenging to identify based solely on their morphology, as they had undergone significant transformation through manufacturing and usage.\n\n**WN:** Can you summarize the findings of your study?\n\n**DM:** We studied five bone tools from two sites in southwest France, which were all quite similar in size and shape. While we weren't able to obtain results from one artifact, the four from Abri Peyrony consistently identified as coming from large bovids. Notably, despite reindeer remains dominating the archaeological layer—comprising about 90%—the Neanderthals opted for large bovid ribs, suggesting intentional material selection for their tools.\n\n**WN:** How did you get involved in this research?\n\n**DM:** My journey began as an undergraduate student at UC Davis, where I took a zooarchaeology course and later interned under Dr. Teresa Steele, who studied the faunal remains at Abri Peyrony. My work there led to my discovery of one of the bone tools, which set the stage for my ongoing research.\n\n**WN:** How many institutions participated in this study?\n\n**DM:** The study involved seven institutes, but the primary work was conducted at UC Davis and the Max Planck Institute, with various researchers contributing.\n\n**WN:** What challenges did your team face during the study?\n\n**DM:** Validating our results was the most daunting aspect. We needed to ensure that our non-destructive sampling didn't introduce contamination and that the results accurately reflected the identity of the bone tools.\n\n**WN:** What implications does this study have for understanding Neanderthal behavior?\n\n**DM:** The findings indicate that Neanderthals possessed advanced knowledge and deliberate strategy when selecting materials for tool-making. They demonstrated a clear understanding of the properties of different bones, suggesting cognitive sophistication.\n\nThis research not only sheds light on the skills of Neanderthals but also opens avenues for future inquiries into their tool-making practices and daily lives. As Dr. Martisius aptly stated, the perception of Neanderthals as simplistic or subhuman is increasingly being challenged by emerging evidence of their sophisticated behaviors.", "question": "What was the main focus of Dr. Naomi Martisius's study regarding Neanderthal bone tools?  \n\nA) The manufacturing process of stone tools  \nB) The selection of large bovids for making bone tools  \nC) The migration patterns of Neanderthals in Europe  \nD) The genetic analysis of Neanderthal remains"}

Biden was polling at 49.0 percent compared to Trump's 42.2 percent.\n\nProtests against police brutality surged nationwide in response to the death of George Floyd. In Washington, D.C., violence erupted as rioters set part of St. John's Church on fire. President Trump delivered a controversial speech, declaring himself the \"president of law and order,\" before walking to the church while law enforcement dispersed primarily peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square. During his visit, Trump held up a Bible for cameras, a move that received significant backlash. Protests continued to escalate throughout June, particularly following a police shooting in Atlanta, which prompted charges against the officers involved. The handling of the incident by Atlanta's Democratic mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, has raised her profile as a vice presidential candidate for Biden.\n\nWith race issues at the forefront, Senator Amy Klobuchar withdrew her name from Biden's running mate consideration, advocating for a candidate of color instead. Notable potential candidates included Atlanta’s Bottoms, Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small from New Mexico, and Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAs the protests gained momentum, the phrase “Defund the Police” became widely recognized among Black Lives Matter supporters, leading to notable changes in policing policies; for instance, Minneapolis voted to disband its police force. Additionally, in Seattle, protesters established police-free zones, known as CHAZ or CHOP. The Trump campaign seized upon these developments, linking them to Biden. Moreover, public statues related to historical figures, including slaveholders and U.S. presidents, were vandalized or torn down across the country. \n\nPresident Trump retaliated with threats of executive orders against those vandalizing federal property. His first rally since the pandemic began took place on June 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where health concerns regarding COVID-19 arose due to the lack of social distancing. Although the attendance was lower than expected, Trump made headlines with comments regarding testing and the pandemic. While infections rose in several states, the death rate from COVID-19 began to decline, though this led to complications in the reopening process. The Republican National Convention was moved from North Carolina to Jacksonville, while the Democrats planned a largely online convention.\n\nOn June 23, former National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized Trump in his new book, prompting the administration to seek its publication's halt over concerns of classified information. Bolton claimed Trump sought help from China regarding the election, a statement Trump denied, asserting Bolton had broken the law during his service. Despite his critiques, Bolton expressed intentions to write in a candidate instead of supporting either Trump or Biden.\n\nIn party updates, Rocky De La Fuente was nominated for president by both the Reform Party and the American Delta Party while historian Darcy Richardson was positioned as his running mate. The newly formed Life and Liberty Party nominated activist J. R. Myers for president and Professor Tiara Lusk for vice president. In the Green Party, co-founder and union leader David P. McCracken received the necessary delegate support to secure the party’s presidential nomination ahead of its July convention.\n\nAt the end of June, Biden held his first press conference since the pandemic began, addressing a contentious report alleging Russian bounties on American troops while Trump dismissed it as potentially fabricated. Biden also countered concerns regarding his mental acuity, asserting confidence in his cognitive capabilities compared to Trump. Despite some polls suggesting doubts about Biden's fitness, he maintained a strong lead over Trump; RealClearPolitics polling showed Biden leading 50.0 percent to 40.4 percent at month’s end.\n\nIn addition, the Prohibition Party's Collins/Parker ticket faced challenges in securing ballot access in Florida but managed to obtain access in Mississippi and Arkansas while pursuing ballot inclusion in other states. Meanwhile, the Reform Party successfully nominated the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket, ensuring Florida ballot access.\n\nAs we look ahead to the upcoming election, the political landscape remains dynamic, with all candidates positioning themselves amid continued social and political upheaval across the nation, setting the stage for a highly contentious race in November.\n\n### Campaign Insights\n\nWikinews recently interviewed Billy Joe Parker, the Prohibition Party's vice presidential nominee, discussing his journey with the party, his responsibilities, and why voters should support the Collins/Parker ticket.\n\n**Parker on Joining the Prohibition Party:**\n“I first discovered the Prohibition Party around 2000, drawn by the caliber of its leadership and its commitment to high standards for American families. I believe the party prioritizes the well-being of American children—an issue that both major parties often overlook.”\n\n**On His Responsibilities:**\n“As vice presidential nominee, my main role is to support Phil Collins and advocate for our platform, which I believe offers a superior choice to any Democratic or Republican candidate. I urge voters to consider the Prohibition Party for a safer future for their children.”\n\n**Why Vote Collins/Parker?**\n“If you care about the future of your children and want a leadership that guarantees their prosperity and happiness, vote Collins/Parker. Our campaign is dedicated to ensuring every American’s right to life and liberty as outlined in the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nThe Reform Party's Richardson also shared his thoughts on his partnership with De La Fuente, emphasizing their desire to offer a viable third-party option within a polarized political landscape.\n\n**Richardson on Being a Running Mate:**\n“It is crucial to promote Rocky's candidacy and to present an alternative to the hyper-partisanship that has failed many Americans. Our ticket isn’t about party affiliations but providing a pragmatic solution to the current turmoil.”\n\n**Focus of the Campaign:**\n“Our campaign aims to restore the U.S. as the ‘Gold Medal Nation’ by addressing economic inequities and promoting environmental sustainability. Together, we can overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the subsequent economic downturn.”\n\nThe new Life and Liberty Party, led by J. R. Myers and Tiara Lusk, is positioning itself as a unifying conservative alternative, moving away from traditional party boundaries to attract a broader base of conservative voters.\n\n**Lusk on L&L's Vision:**\n“The Life and Liberty Party aims to welcome diverse belief systems while advocating for policies such as a debt jubilee. We seek to focus on unity and real solutions rather than divisiveness and inflammatory rhetoric.”\n\nThe upcoming months will be pivotal as candidates continue to campaign and refine their messages in preparation for the November election, set against a backdrop of social change and public demand for reform.", "question": "What was the outcome of Joe Biden's campaign during the June primaries?\n\nA) He lost to President Trump.  \nB) He secured the Democratic nomination with victories.  \nC) He withdrew from the race entirely.  \nD) He was declared the winner of the Reform Party nomination."}

This action followed a takedown request issued under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After removing the personal information included in the notice, GitHub made the notice publicly accessible on its platform.\n\nOriginally created in July 2008 by Ricardo Garcia, youtube-dl is an open-source tool written in Python that allows users to download videos from multiple sources. It is free and open-source software (FLOSS), licensed under the MIT License. Currently, only the maintainers of the project can view the locked repository on GitHub.\n\nThe RIAA's DMCA notice claimed that the software's primary function was to \"circumvent the technological protection measures\" used by authorized streaming services like YouTube and to \"reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization.\" Furthermore, the notice highlighted certain tests in the youtube-dl source code designed to determine whether the software could download various types of content, including Creative Commons licensed videos and age-restricted content. The RIAA asserted that aspects of these tests indicated intentional design to bypass YouTube's protections.\n\nThe RIAA’s notice cited a violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201, which prohibits circumvention of technological measures controlling access to copyrighted works. The notice called for the removal of several forks of youtube-dl from GitHub as well.\n\nSignificantly, the RIAA's notice did not provide evidence of any specific instance where youtube-dl had been used to download or share copyrighted material, nor did it address any resultant damages. Importantly, many videos on YouTube are available under Creative Commons licenses, allowing users to legally share and modify them with proper attribution. Additionally, a range of content, including videos in the public domain, can be accessed on YouTube without restrictions.\n\nThousands of users around the world rely on youtube-dl, which also facilitates the download of Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos for archival projects. The software is also employed to capture multimedia content from platforms like LiveLeak, and users sometimes utilize it for creating backups or collecting evidence.\n\nyoutube-dl operates via a lightweight command-line interface that mimics browser behavior when retrieving video data from servers. It includes various \"extractors\" to handle content from diverse sources, demonstrating that it essentially downloads media in a way similar to standard web browsing. However, unlike traditional browsing, which may have ephemeral access limitations, downloading via tools like youtube-dl can yield persistent copies of content.\n\nThe decision to restrict access led to considerable backlash on social media, with users expressing their frustration on platforms like Twitter. Some criticized reliance on centralized services like GitHub, arguing for a return to decentralized software development practices enabled by systems like Git.\n\nIn the wake of the GitHub actions, users began sharing the source code through self-hosted Git servers, leading to what is known as the Streisand Effect — the phenomenon where attempts to suppress information only lead to its increased spread. While public access to the repository is restricted, binaries of the software remain available on its official site, with some users employing innovative methods to propagate the source code, such as encoding it into images.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) commented on the incident, stating, \"Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of lawful uses. Demanding its removal from GitHub is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.\" Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, has likewise expressed strong criticism of Digital Rights Management (DRM) practices associated with the DMCA for years.\n\nWikinews reached out to Sergey M., one of the maintainers of youtube-dl, for comment. Sergey indicated he was unable to provide detailed responses at that moment but later shared an update in an IRC channel. He noted that GitHub's reinstatement conditions involved a complete removal of certain code related to YouTube’s security measures, which he found unsatisfactory but could potentially comply with to restore access.\n\nThe EFF has not yet responded to questions from Wikinews. Additionally, former youtube-dl maintainer Philipp Hagemeister was contacted for insights on the takedown. He revealed that he first learned about the DMCA notice from Reddit and expressed his thoughts on youtube-dl’s legal standing, the nature of its DRM circumvention, and potential next steps for the project.\n\nAs users continue to navigate these challenges, the wider implications of this takedown on open-source software and digital rights remain a topic of significant discussion in technology and legal circles.", "question": "What was the primary reason GitHub blocked public access to the youtube-dl repository?  \n\nA) It was due to a violation of privacy policies.  \nB) GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the RIAA.  \nC) The maintainers decided to discontinue the software.  \nD) Users reported malicious activity related to the software."}

At the time, Minecraft was a multi-platform title still in its developmental stages, and Ahola sought to build a similar experience from the ground up.\n\nUnlike Minecraft, which costs $26.95 for its computer version and is owned by Microsoft, Minetest is open-source and free for anyone to download and play. According to Ahola, Minetest is designed to run efficiently on older hardware with limited graphics capabilities, allowing more individuals to access the game without any cost.\n\nA correspondent from French Wikinews first contacted Ahola several weeks ago, leading to this in-depth interview to explore more about this nearly decade-long project.\n\n**Introduction to Perttu Ahola**\n\n\"Hi, I’m Perttu Ahola, known as 'celeron55' online. I'm a programming enthusiast and geek from Finland,\" he introduced himself.\n\n**Early Beginnings and Motivation**\n\nAhola shared that programming has been a lifelong hobby. \"As a child, I programmed on my dad's computers and later took formal programming courses in school and university.\"\n\nHis motivation for creating Minetest stemmed from an initial challenge, which evolved into an exploration of what could be achieved in gaming that a corporate entity like Microsoft might overlook. \"I was curious about how a game world works under the hood,\" he explained.\n\n**Development Journey**\n\nAhola began working on Minetest in October 2010, starting solo until the first contributor joined six months later. The initial public release was shared within a private IRC channel for testing, followed by a public debut on a programming channel soon after.\n\n\"The first users were hobbyist programmers who enjoyed the quirky multiplayer experience,\" he recalled.\n\n**Current Development Team**\n\nToday, the Minetest development team comprises 13 core developers, though the number of active contributors fluctuates. \"Core development is about trust and deciding what gets merged, so not all contributors hold that title,\" he noted.\n\n**Workflow and Changes**\n\nDescribing his workflow, Ahola said, \"I allocate as much continuous time as possible for tasks, starting with writing prototypes that evolve into final implementations.\" This approach contrasts sharply with more structured development models, focusing instead on iterative progress.\n\nSignificant evolutionary changes to Minetest have come from building on prior iterations, with one major upgrade shifting from version 0.3 to 0.4, which introduced a content-based engine that fundamentally altered user perceptions.\n\n**Community Engagement and Contributions**\n\nAhola emphasized the importance of community in Minetest, stating that users are encouraged to create and share mods, set up servers, or document experiences through screenshots on forums. \"The beauty of Minetest is that it empowers people to use it for various purposes, whether for education or prototyping games,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Ahola highlighted the decentralized nature of contributions, noting that there is no single figure managing patches or improvements. Instead, the project thrives on voluntary collaboration, with users taking initiative based on their interests.\n\n**Future Plans and Challenges**\n\nLooking ahead, Ahola referenced ongoing discussions among developers regarding future updates, which include planned releases with new gameplay features. Yet, he cautioned against setting unrealistic milestones in a hobbyist project. \"Great ideas often come but don’t always materialize due to varying contributor engagement,\" he admitted.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**\n\nReflecting on the significance of Minetest and its journey, he remarked on how the community's involvement shapes its direction. \"The project depends on users enjoying it. If it resonates with people, that's what matters.\"\n\nIn a world dominated by commercial entities, Ahola's passion for open-source gaming continues to inspire many, offering a platform for creativity, learning, and collaboration without monetary barriers.", "question": "What programming language is used for the modding API in Minetest?  \n\nA) Python  \nB) C++  \nC) Lua  \nD) Java"}
{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, August 2020", "content": "**Monthly Update: 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Highlights - August Edition**\n\nThis is the fourth installment of our monthly series tracking the 2020 United States presidential election, featuring highlights and analysis of significant events from the past month.\n\nThis month’s campaign trail includes a bizarre incident where a bat attacks Libertarian Party candidate Jo Jorgensen, the American Independent Party (AIP) gets embroiled in controversy with its presidential ticket selection, and renewed questions about the eligibility of Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nIn head-to-head polling as August began, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, with 49.4% to 42.0%. Amidst the campaign, early August saw heated discussions following Trump's late July tweet alleging that voting by mail could lead to fraud. Changes made by Louis DeJoy, the new Postmaster General appointed by Trump, resulted in delays in mail service, raising accusations that Trump was intentionally creating obstacles to mail-in voting. While DeJoy insisted that the U.S. Postal Service could manage the influx of mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, Democrats in Congress called for additional funding to mitigate any potential voter disenfranchisement. Trump expressed support for blocking emergency relief measures as a strategy against an increase in mail-in voting, and Biden condemned this approach, suggesting it indicated Trump's reluctance for the election to occur. Trump also continued to voice concerns about fraud in mail-in voting, filing lawsuits against certain states' procedures, particularly a Nevada law that mandated ballots be sent to all registered voters.\n\nBiden made history by selecting Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, fulfilling his promise to choose a woman for the position. This choice drew criticism from Trump, who referred to Harris as \"phony\" and alleged that her previous attacks on Biden during debates were disingenuous. The selection sparked renewed questions from some, mainly within the AIP, regarding Harris's eligibility, echoing similar unfounded claims made about former President Barack Obama. The AIP subsequently nominated a ticket featuring Rocky De La Fuente and rapper Kanye West, without previously consulting West, who is also pursuing his own presidential campaign primarily through the Birthday Party.\n\nIn the wake of these developments, Donald Trump’s younger brother passed away from an undisclosed illness, with Biden and Harris expressing their condolences. Observers speculated whether the death was tied to COVID-19, leading to the viral spread of the hashtag #WrongTrump on Twitter, suggesting a morbid wish for the President's demise. \n\nThe Democratic National Convention took place in a predominantly virtual format due to the pandemic, featuring pre-recorded speeches and live business sessions held in Wisconsin. Numerous speakers criticized Trump's handling of COVID-19. Biden was officially nominated, becoming the oldest major party nominee for president at age 77. The convention included messages from three former presidents—Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama—as well as comments from Republicans like former Ohio Governor John Kasich and family members of George Floyd, who died in police custody, sparking widespread protests this summer. Michelle Obama delivered the keynote address, urging voters to support Biden, and Harris formally accepted the vice presidential nomination, marking her as the first Black woman nominated for the role.\n\nConversely, Trump criticized the convention as \"dark\" and \"gloomy\" and cast doubt on Biden’s commitment to combating the pandemic. Opinion polls indicated no significant convention bounce for Biden, whereas Trump appeared to gain ground in the nationwide polls, trimming Biden's lead by the end of August.\n\nOn the campaign front, Jo Jorgensen's August kicked off dramatically with a bat attack at her South Carolina home that resulted in her needing precautionary rabies shots. After sharing her experience on Twitter, the story gained traction across various media outlets. Meanwhile, the AIP nominated De La Fuente and West, igniting controversy over De La Fuente’s previous financial interactions with the party’s vice chairman and concerns regarding the AIP's motive in possibly aiding Trump’s campaign.\n\nLastly, significant discourse surrounded Harris's natural-born citizenship status. Critics have drawn parallels between this scrutiny and the \"birther\" controversies faced by Obama.

This edition includes original reports compiled over the past month, highlighting significant stories.\n\n**Key Developments on the Campaign Trail:** \n- Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen has achieved ballot access across all 50 states, marking a significant milestone for third-party candidates.\n- Bill Hammons, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee, proposed an innovative approach to address concerns over \"packing\" the U.S. Supreme Court.\n- Candidates shared their perspectives on the escalating military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nAs September commenced, Democratic nominee Joe Biden held a lead over President Donald Trump in the average head-to-head polling, 49.0% to 43.0%.\n\nTrump began the month in Wisconsin, a state grappling with unrest following police incidents in August. He characterized the situation as \"domestic terror\" and emphasized the need for law and order. Biden responded in a fundraising message, accusing Trump of \"trying to scare the hell out of America.\" Two days later, Biden visited Kenosha, where he spoke on racial inequality and met with the family of Jacob Blake. The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing violence and for visiting despite health concerns related to COVID-19. Wisconsin’s Democrat governor, Tony Evers, expressed a preference for neither candidate to visit.\n\nThree controversies arose around Trump early in September. First, following speculation from CNN about his health during a visit to Walter Reed last November, Trump asserted that media claims of \"mini-strokes\" were false. He criticized CNN's reporting while demanding the network fire a specific journalist. Next, Trump faced allegations he insulted U.S. soldiers during a trip to France in 2018, with confirmations of parts of the story from sources like Fox News. Finally, excerpts from journalist Bob Woodward's book indicated Trump downplayed the coronavirus threat in February to prevent public panic, a claim Biden labeled as \"almost criminal.\"\n\nAt a North Carolina interview and a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump stirred further controversy by suggesting supporters fill out absentee ballots and then vote in person if their ballots were not counted—an act classified as voting twice, which is illegal. After his tweet prompted a warning from Twitter, Trump’s team stated his comments were misinterpreted.\n\nIn mid-September, Trump hosted his first indoor rally in three months in Nevada, ignoring state COVID-19 guidelines. He later visited California to discuss the devastating wildfires, denying that climate change was a significant factor and attributing the fires to forest management issues. Biden labeled Trump a \"climate arsonist\" during a speech in Delaware, warning that environmental disasters would escalate if Trump were re-elected. \n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, recent polls indicated a growing support for Trump, possibly linked to his social conservative stances and opposition to socialism. Biden's team expressed concerns about acquiring Latino votes as his running mate Kamala Harris campaigned in the state. In a significant boost for Biden, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged to invest $100 million in Florida and assist former inmates in regaining voting rights—an initiative Trump declared as illegal.\n\nFollowing a peace deal brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, the Trump administration announced new agreements recognizing Israel’s diplomatic relations with both Bahrain and Serbia, in a move Trump called a \"new Middle East.\" Concurrently, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated, prompting discussions among presidential candidates regarding U.S. involvement.\n\nThe month also witnessed the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, prompting debates over her replacement. Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, leading to calls from some Democrats for court expansion to ensure ideological balance. Amid these developments, Trump refused to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power, claiming potential fraud due to increased mail-in voting—a statement criticized by both parties.\n\nAs September concluded, Biden maintained his lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average at 49.7% to Trump's 43.1%.\n\nThe Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen celebrated her campaign's full ballot access in all states. In her message to supporters, she expressed gratitude for the efforts of volunteers and staff. Jorgensen is campaigning for inclusion in presidential debates, arguing that her campaign is a viable alternative to both major parties.\n\nThe September edition also touched on the consequences of Ginsburg's death and the subsequent Supreme Court vacancy. While discussions about court packing have resurfaced, candidate Bill Hammons proposed a balanced approach to prevent further partisan shifts in judicial appointments.\n\nThe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, centered on the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, saw renewed violence, with both sides claiming aggression and casualties. Candidates Jorgensen and Blankenship emphasized a non-interventionist U.S. foreign policy.\n\nIn closing, September proved to be a defining month in the lead-up to the election, with candidates navigating controversies, electoral strategies, and positioning on critical national and international issues.", "question": "What significant event occurred involving the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in September 2020?  \n\nA) The nominee secured ballot access in 40 states.  \nB) The nominee was the first third-party candidate to receive federal funding.  \nC) The nominee secured ballot access in all 50 states.  \nD) The nominee announced a partnership with the Unity Party."}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews Jo Jorgensen, U.S. Libertarian Party presidential nominee", "content": "**South Carolina Professor and Libertarian Presidential Nominee Jo Jorgensen Shares Insights on Her Campaign**\n\nJo Jorgensen, a psychology professor from South Carolina and the Libertarian Party's nominee for the 2020 presidential election, recently engaged in an interview with accredited Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn.\n\nJorgensen first entered the political arena in 1992, running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives with the support of the Libertarian Party. Although she finished third, garnering just over 2.16% of the vote, she later became the party's vice presidential nominee in 1996 alongside the late Harry Browne. Together, they appeared on ballots across the nation and secured approximately 485,798 votes, equating to about 0.5% of the total—a record performance for the party at the time, which held until it was surpassed in 2012 by Gary Johnson, who received 0.99% in his campaign.\n\nDuring her quest for the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen faced tough competition in a primary campaign that included former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, the first sitting congressman to join the Libertarian Party. Ultimately, she clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot after overcoming challenges from notable figures like Vermin Supreme and Jacob Hornberger, with Mike ter Maat joining her as vice presidential nominee. The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket secured ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nAs a staunch libertarian advocating for limited government intervention, Jorgensen's platform blends liberal and conservative views. She is a proponent of both LGBT rights and gun rights, and she stands against the expansion of police powers and broad taxation. Additionally, she endorses an open immigration policy while voicing opposition to the welfare state.\n\nIn her conversation with Wikinews, Jorgensen addressed a variety of topics ranging from her personal background and the COVID-19 pandemic to climate change and race relations.\n\n**Question: Which past leader do you admire most and why?**\n\n**Jo Jorgensen:** \"I admire Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence. I'd amend the phrase 'all men are created equal' to 'all people are created equal!'\"\n\n**Question: How have your experiences prepared you for the presidency?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"The most critical preparation is understanding that people thrive when free to manage their own lives without governmental interference. My grandmother, an immigrant from Denmark, instilled in me a passion for freedom, and my life experiences have reinforced that government should primarily protect life, liberty, and property.\"\n\n**Question: How would you characterize your leadership style in comparison to Presidents Trump and Obama?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"My style emphasizes individual liberty and scrutinizing any proposal for government force. This stands in stark contrast to both Trump and Obama, who have embraced broader government powers.\"\n\n**Question: How would your response to the COVID-19 pandemic differ from President Trump's?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"I would have ensured that the CDC and FDA did not hinder access to tests and treatments from the free market. Recognizing the virus's primary threat to vulnerable populations, I would have advocated for personal responsibility over lockdowns.\"\n\n**Question: How has the pandemic impacted your campaign strategy?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"Our in-person events have shifted outdoors and to socially distanced formats, limiting engagement. However, increased reliance on cell phones and the internet has also allowed for greater outreach through social media.\"\n\n**Question: Given your polling numbers, what do you anticipate for the popular vote in the 2020 election?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"Despite starting with low name recognition, my support has climbed to between 2% and 5% in national polls, especially in battleground states. We see our ideas resonating more, compelling traditional parties to adopt libertarian principles even if they often fail to uphold them.\"\n\n**Question: What do you want the public to remember about your campaign?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"I hope they recognize me as the candidate advocating for troop withdrawals and a neutral foreign policy, or as the proponent of reinstating a free market in healthcare.\"\n\n**Question: How would a Jorgensen administration be structured?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"My cabinet would consist of talented policy analysts from reputable institutions, along with libertarian thinkers who have demonstrated effectiveness in government.\"\n\n**Question: If elected, how would you avoid gridlock with Congress?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"I would veto any unbalanced budget and aim to shrink government spending year after year. Certain issues, like cannabis decriminalization, already have bipartisan support and could facilitate cooperation.\"\n\n**Question: How should the government approach climate change?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"The government should eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels and support nuclear energy development to foster a competitive energy market that promotes both sustainability and economic efficiency.\"\n\n**Question: How would you handle the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"The conflict rightly belongs to Armenia and Azerbaijan. A non-interventionist policy aligning with a Switzerland-like approach would be best.\"\n\n**Question: Do you have concerns about censorship of conservatives and libertarians?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"My primary concern is government censorship. I would foster an environment where platforms are incentivized to avoid censorship in order to attract users.\"\n\n**Question: What initiatives would you pursue to improve race relations in the U.S.?**\n\n**Jorgensen:** \"Criminal justice reform and the removal of restrictive licensing laws will both promote equality and improve relations, ensuring that all citizens, especially minorities, have access to economic opportunities.\"\n\nThrough her campaign, Jorgensen is determined to advocate for a smaller, more effective government that prioritizes individual liberties and fosters economic opportunities for all citizens.", "question": "What percentage of the popular vote did Jo Jorgensen's running mate in the 2016 election, Gary Johnson, receive as the Libertarian presidential nominee?  \nA) 0.5%  \nB) 2.16%  \nC) 3.27%  \nD) 0.99%"}

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Brian Carroll, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee", "content": "**Retired Teacher Brian Carroll Discusses Presidential Campaign with Wikinews**\n\nBrian Carroll, the presidential nominee of the American Solidarity Party, recently outlined his campaign in an interview with Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn.\n\nCarroll, a retired educator with 44 years of experience, primarily taught history to elementary students in California. He also spent nine years teaching in Colombia for children of U.S. military personnel. Carroll entered politics by joining the Solidarity Party and ran for Congress in 2018, finishing fifth with 1.3% of the vote. He secured the Solidarity Party's presidential nomination in September 2019, defeating fellow candidates Joshua Perkins and a previous Wikinews interviewee. Carroll selected fellow educator Amar Patel as his running mate, who spoke to Wikinews in August.\n\nThe Solidarity Party, established in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party, emphasizes Roman Catholic social teaching, advocating for social justice, environmentalism, and a multicultural society, including opposition to violence, racism, and sectarianism. The party rebranded ahead of the 2016 election, where its first ticket received a total of 6,777 votes, primarily through write-ins in Colorado. The party has expanded its ballot access in preparation for the 2020 election, securing positions in eight states and write-in access in an additional 23.\n\nIn his conversation with Wikinews, Carroll shared insights about his background, COVID-19's impact on campaigning, presidential nominations, and his views on pressing issues such as climate change, foreign policy, and internet speech.\n\n**Q: Which past president do you most admire and why?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** My two childhood heroes were Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, who had a profound curiosity and pursued their interests relentlessly. I shaped my own educational goals accordingly. Over time, I recognized the more complex sides of historical figures, including Jefferson. I focused on teaching history for 40 years, highlighting both the positive and negative impacts of various presidents, including both Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson. Recently, I've gained an appreciation for Ulysses S. Grant, especially his decisive actions against the Ku Klux Klan during his presidency.\n\n**Q: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** As a teacher, I constantly explain complex concepts, much like a politician does. Additionally, my efforts have often centered on raising community awareness on critical issues, a fundamental aspect of political engagement.\n\n**Q: How would you describe your style of leadership? How does it compare to Donald Trump's and Barack Obama's?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I consider myself the \"unTrump.\" I am confident and secure enough to embrace expert opinions. Like Jefferson, I have diverse interests and a collaborative approach, though I feel more comfortable in public speaking than he did. I intend to hire an organized staff to help keep my administration focused.\n\n**Q: If you were president, how would you have handled the COVID-19 pandemic differently than President Trump?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I would not have dismissed the pandemic preparedness plan left by Obama. I would have acted proactively to mobilize American industries to produce necessary equipment.\n\n**Q: How has the pandemic affected your campaign?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** The pandemic has limited my travel and made it more challenging to gather signatures for ballots. However, it has also allowed me valuable time at home with my wife, which has been a positive aspect amidst the challenges many face.\n\n**Q: In the 2016 election, your party's nominee garnered 6,777 votes. What are your expectations for the upcoming election?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I believe we will exceed that number significantly, possibly by a factor of ten or twenty.\n\n**Q: What would a Carroll administration look like?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I won't name specific individuals before reaching out, but I would invite key advisors to suggest candidates and consult with congressional caucuses known for bipartisan cooperation to form my Cabinet.\n\n**Q: Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I believe many of us have been misled by judges who favor business interests over those of workers and consumers. My focus would shift that priority.\n\n**Q: How will you work with Congress to enhance bipartisanship?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I will emphasize a Cabinet that fosters collaboration and signal that bipartisan cooperation is essential for success. \n\n**Q: What measures should the government take to address global climate change?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** We are at a critical juncture and must reduce our carbon footprint by embracing renewable energy sources, assessing practical applications of wind, solar, and other technologies, and exploring innovative solutions.\n\n**Q: What is your stance on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** I advocate for a diplomatic resolution without military intervention.\n\n**Q: What are your views on censorship of certain opinions on social media?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** Social media is still maturing, and while it struggles with the complexities of free speech, I believe patience and persistence will help us reach a more equitable situation.\n\n**Q: How would you improve racial equity and justice?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** A key starting point would be to publicly commit to prioritizing these issues. Initiatives like the recent \"Contract with Black America\" feature numerous constructive ideas, though realizing them all in the first 100 days may be unrealistic. A visible commitment will be crucial from day one.\n\n**Q: As Election Day approaches, what final message do you have for voters?**  \n**Brian Carroll:** Many citizens feel disenfranchised, but this is their opportunity to support a party that aligns with their values.

It features key updates from the campaign trail over the past month, alongside a recap of significant events.\n\nIn October, the political landscape was defined by two presidential debates and the final appeals of three candidates who opted out of the debates. Three political analysts also weighed in with their predictions for the election outcome.\n\nAs the campaign entered its final month, polling averages indicated that Democratic nominee Joe Biden was ahead of Republican incumbent Donald Trump, with support at 50.1% to 42.9%.\n\n**The Month in Review:**\n\nOctober began dramatically when President Trump, his wife Melania, and their son Barron tested positive for COVID-19 after a staff aide contracted the virus. Trump experienced minor symptoms and was hospitalized as a precaution. Footage showed him wearing a mask while being transported to Walter Reed Medical Center. He was treated with a combination of medications, including an experimental drug and the steroid dexamethasone. After a three-day hospital stay, he returned to the White House, assuring the public not to fear COVID-19.\n\nShortly after Trump's release, the only vice presidential debate took place, featuring Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in Utah. The debate was noted for its civility compared to the earlier Trump-Biden clash. A notable moment occurred when a fly landed in Pence's hair, drawing immediate media attention. \n\nAmid discussions of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Biden and Harris dodged questions about \"court-packing.\" Biden later stated that 56% of respondents who believe their situation has improved in the past four years were mistaken.\n\nTrump returned to the campaign trail shortly after his recovery, hosting rallies in Florida, where he claimed to be \"immune\" and even joked about kissing supporters. Meanwhile, Biden held a town hall that drew more viewers than a competing one held by Trump the same night.\n\nIn an \"October surprise,\" the New York Post reported on emails from a laptop allegedly owned by Hunter Biden, suggesting potential ethical violations involving international business dealings. This accusation was met with controversy, as intelligence officials warned of potential misinformation linked to the allegations. Social media platforms responded to the story with varying degrees of censorship, prompting backlash from critics of their policies.\n\nJust before the final debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner claimed that Joe Biden was involved in his son's dealings, which Biden fiercely denied during the second presidential debate. The debate showcased sharp exchanges on issues like healthcare, climate change, and the economy. \n\nAs Halloween approached, Trump intensified his campaign efforts, holding multiple rallies daily across key battleground states. In contrast, Biden's campaign focused on smaller, socially distanced events.\n\nSignificant developments included the Senate confirmation of Judge Barrett and the announcement of a deal to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel. Additionally, widespread protests erupted in Philadelphia following the police killing of a mentally ill Black man.\n\nBy the end of October, polling data indicated Trump trailing Biden in national averages, while some independent candidates were also making final appeals to voters ahead of Election Day. \n\n**Predictions from Political Analysts:**\n\nFormer U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo projected a Trump victory with an electoral count of 362 to 176. Political blogger Thomas Knapp, however, foresees a Biden win at 319 to 219.

Trump responded to ongoing protests by sending federal officers to protect government buildings in Portland, a move Biden criticized as fostering \"chaos and division.\" The Trump campaign retaliated, alleging that Biden was \"siding with criminals.\" Throughout July, the President focused his campaign on themes of law and order.\n\nDespite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Trump attended a large celebration in South Dakota on July 3, where he condemned those vandalizing historical statues and announced plans for a new park dedicated to honoring significant American figures. Many attendees at the event did not adhere to social distancing guidelines or wear masks. The following day, he hosted a \"Salute to America\" event in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, rapper Kanye West announced his candidacy for president via Twitter on July 4. Following an interview, he declared Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball as his running mate and introduced his campaign under the moniker \"Birthday Party.\" West criticized both Biden and Trump while also expressing findings on mental health concerns amid his rally discussions. Despite indicating withdrawal from the race through his spokesperson, he later filed with the FEC to appear on the ballot in Oklahoma.\n\nOn July 9, Biden unveiled his \"Build Back Better\" economic plan aimed at revitalizing the U.S. economy post-pandemic, featuring increased corporate taxes and advocating \"Buy American\" initiatives. Trump countered by urging schools to resume in-person classes, vowing to cut federal funding for those that did not comply but later acknowledged that some school openings might need to be postponed. Notably, he was photographed wearing a mask for the first time as COVID-19 cases surged in several states.\n\nAmidst these developments, Trump commuted the sentence of former adviser Roger Stone, causing significant backlash from the Biden campaign, which labeled the act as an abuse of power.\n\nThe month also saw the passing of civil rights leader Congressman John Lewis, which reignited discussions on civil rights issues and bolstered Biden's vice presidential selection process, with several prominent candidates being considered. Notably, Trump faced criticism for his election-related tweets during Lewis's memorial service, which Biden condemned as distracting.\n\nAs July concluded, Biden's polling average showed a slight decrease in his lead, with Biden at 49.9% and Trump at 42.1%.

{"title": "Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews", "content": "**Red Hat Shifts Focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream, Community Voices Concerns**\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S.-based software company Red Hat announced a significant shift in its focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream, sparking discussions within the community and among CentOS project members.\n\nIn a blog post, Red Hat’s Chief Technology Officer stated that the company has officially informed the CentOS governing board of the decision to \"shift our investment fully from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream.\" Notably, at least five of the nine board members are employees of Red Hat.\n\nFounded in 2004, CentOS provided a free and open-source alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat’s commercial OS. The CentOS project was absorbed by Red Hat in 2014, giving the company control over the CentOS trademark.\n\nIt's worth noting that Red Hat also sponsors the Fedora operating system, which has traditionally served as the upstream source for RHEL. Previously, software development occurred in Fedora before being incorporated into RHEL, followed by the release of CentOS, which mirrored RHEL without the associated support.\n\nIntroduced in September 2019—just months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM—CentOS Stream was designed to function as an upstream distribution, allowing community members and Red Hat to collaborate on new features before they are incorporated into RHEL. Unlike CentOS, which adhered to a traditional release cycle, CentOS Stream is updated more frequently and is ahead of RHEL in terms of new developments.\n\nWright emphasized that while CentOS Stream is not intended to replace CentOS Linux, it provides \"a platform for rapid innovation at the community level, with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics.\" He views this transition as a step toward advancing enterprise Linux innovation.\n\nThe announcement has led to backlash from CentOS users across platforms including IRC, Reddit, and mailing lists. A significant change is the accelerated End of Life (EOL) for CentOS 8, now set for December 31, 2021, rather than May 2029, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive updates until June 2024.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Gregory Kurtzer, the founder of CentOS, announced the launch of a new community-driven operating system called Rocky Linux. This distribution aims to be \"100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux,\" replicating the previous downstream approach of CentOS by building releases after they have been integrated with upstream vendors.\n\nWikinews spoke to CentOS project members Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen about the implications of this shift. Greco is a maintainer focused on 32-bit processors, whereas Bowen serves as the community manager of the CentOS project.\n\n**Concerns and Future Directions**\n\nThe reaction from the community indicates strong feelings of betrayal, as many users feel the decision was made without adequate notice or input. \"The future of CentOS Linux is now uncertain,\" said an anonymous community member. \"With the shift to CentOS Stream, many users are left without a suitable alternative that offers the stability and support they relied on.\"\n\nBowen explained that while the restructuring aims to provide greater community involvement in the development process, many existing users may find CentOS Stream does not meet their needs. “We want to ensure that those who are impacted articulate their needs as the community adjusts to this change.”\n\nKurtzer believes that for those dissatisfied with CentOS Stream, alternatives include transitioning to RHEL or exploring other distributions.\n\nDespite the upheaval, Red Hat insists that they are committed to maintaining an open development process and encouraging participation in CentOS Stream. They are also developing low- or no-cost programs for those unable to transition smoothly.\n\nAs CentOS pivots towards a new model, the challenge will be to meet user expectations while fostering an inclusive environment for community contributions. Whether CentOS Stream can fulfill the legacy of CentOS Linux remains to be seen, but the community’s response will undoubtedly shape its evolution moving forward.", "question": "What is the primary reason for Red Hat's shift in focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream?\n\nA) To discontinue all support for CentOS entirely  \nB) To allow community participation in development for future releases of RHEL  \nC) To enhance the commercial offerings of Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nD) To eliminate the CentOS Governing Board"}

Thousands of supporters rallied, brandishing Trump flags and wearing his signature hats. The event unfolded in the shadow of the Supreme Court, which had just dismissed a lawsuit from Texas that sought to overturn election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump tweeted about the event, expressing surprise at the turnout: \"Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA.\" The hashtag refers to his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nAs the rally took place, Trump passed overhead in a helicopter on his way to New York, with enthusiastic supporters cheering below. Former Trump adviser and retired General Michael Flynn spoke at the rally, marking his first public appearance since receiving a presidential pardon. He remarked, \"That's pretty cool.

{"title": "Gregory Kurtzer discusses plans for Rocky Linux with Wikinews as Red Hat announces moving focus away from CentOS", "content": "**Gregory Kurtzer Discusses the Future of Rocky Linux with Wikinews Following Red Hat's Shift Away from CentOS**\n\nOn December 8, Red Hat, a US-based software company, announced a strategic shift away from CentOS, previously a popular free alternative to its Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).\n\nLaunched in 2004, CentOS was created as a free and open-source platform, providing a community-based environment with RHEL’s source code. Gregory Kurtzer, who founded CAOS Linux, explained to Wikinews that he initiated CAOS around the time Red Hat transitioned from community-supported Red Hat Linux (RHL) to a subscription-only model with RHEL. Kurtzer's initiative led to the development of CentOS when developer Rocky McGaugh rebuilt RHEL's source code to offer a free alternative. CentOS was integrated into Red Hat in 2014, granting Red Hat trademark rights to the name.\n\nRed Hat also backs the development of Fedora, the upstream project that contributes to RHEL. Traditionally, CentOS mirrored RHEL’s release cycle, providing a stable and cost-free option for users without support. In September 2019, however, CentOS Stream was introduced, coinciding with Red Hat's acquisition by IBM. Unlike previous iterations, Stream adopts a rolling release model, integrating community and Red Hat developments before they enter RHEL, resulting in more frequent but less stable updates.\n\nIn the wake of Red Hat's announcement, which many users expressed dissatisfaction with on platforms such as IRC, Reddit, and the CentOS mailing list, the End of Life (EOL) for CentOS 8 was moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021. In contrast, CentOS 7 will continue to receive maintenance updates through June 2024.\n\nIn response to the changes, Kurtzer revealed plans for Rocky Linux—a new distribution aimed at fulfilling the role CentOS played. Named in honor of McGaugh, Kurtzer emphasized that Rocky Linux is designed to be “for the community.” He reassured users that decisions regarding the project would prioritize community interests, free from corporate influence, including that of his own company.\n\nWhile a specific release date for Rocky Linux has not been set, Kurtzer anticipates its launch will occur before CentOS 8’s EOL. Rocky Linux will be compatible with both x86-64 and ARM architectures, allowing current CentOS users to transition seamlessly via a simple command.\n\nKurtzer highlighted the importance of maintaining a stable, community-driven distribution, stressing that Rocky Linux will ensure a “freely available version” of enterprise-grade software—respecting contributions from developers worldwide. “We are committed to providing a bug-for-bug compatible operating system that can be used freely by anyone,” he declared.\n\nAs for hardware support, Rocky Linux aims to cover the same range as CentOS, with preliminary interest in ARM architectures. The project has already garnered significant community interest, with around 65 active contributors and hundreds more volunteering to help.\n\nLooking ahead, Kurtzer acknowledged growth as a primary challenge but expressed confidence in the support Rocky Linux has begun to receive. The end goal is to create a transparent, community-driven structure that prioritizes the interests of its users and fosters collaboration.\n\nIn summary, as Rocky Linux develops with community backing, it seeks to address the void left by Red Hat's changes and provide a trustworthy, accessible platform for users and developers alike.", "question": "What was the main reason for Gregory Kurtzer to start Rocky Linux?  \n\nA) To replace Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nB) To honor his late co-founder Rocky McGaugh  \nC) To provide a paid support option for CentOS users  \nD) To compete with Fedora"}

{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "**Study Reveals Life Can Thrive in Hydrogen-Rich Environments, Says MIT Professor**\n\nIn May, a study published in a journal by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Professor Dr. [Name] and other researchers found that organisms like *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) and yeast can survive in both 100% hydrogen (H2) and helium (He) atmospheres. To delve deeper into these groundbreaking findings, Wikinews interviewed Dr. Seager about her research.\n\nSo far, life has only been observed in Earth's nitrogen-oxygen-rich atmosphere. While Earth's environment is primarily composed of nitrogen gas, oxygen plays a crucial role for complex organisms. Some microorganisms, known as anaerobes, do not rely on oxygen for metabolism. For instance, certain strains can utilize carbon dioxide while releasing methane.\n\nIn their experiment, researchers utilized the *E. coli* strain K-12 and the yeast strain *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* S288C. They subjected these microorganisms to four distinct environments: one with 100% air and three anaerobic settings, consisting of 100% H2, 100% He, and an 80%-20% N2-CO2 mix, all maintained at 28°C. To ensure the anaerobic conditions remained stable, the researchers installed oxygen sensors and monitored fluctuations in oxygen levels. They measured the growth rate of E. coli using optical density while employing a different method for the yeast.\n\nThe study revealed that both E. coli and yeast were able to reproduce normally in 100% hydrogen and helium environments. However, their growth rates were not as robust as those observed in a 100% air environment. The researchers noted that under these conditions, E. coli and yeast switched from aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen, to anaerobic respiration and fermentation. These processes are less efficient, resulting in reduced energy production compared to aerobic respiration.\n\nIn an 80%-20% N2-CO2 atmosphere, E. coli showed a slower growth rate due to the dissolving CO2, which made the liquid medium acidic. Conversely, yeast cultures flourished in acidic environments, but their growth rates in 100% air significantly surpassed those in hydrogen or helium environments. The research indicated that the growth impairment was likely due to the lack of oxygen for non-respiratory functions, which is essential for synthesizing important biochemicals like heme and sterols.\n\nDr. Seager emphasized that this discovery could lead astronomers to expand their search for habitable life on other planets. \"There's a diversity of habitable worlds out there, and we've demonstrated that Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. We should consider these planets as potential candidates for life,\" she stated.\n\nShe mentioned that detecting a planet with an extensive hydrogen-rich atmosphere could be feasible with advancing technologies. Hydrogen and helium have low densities, making them more expansive and easier to detect through telescopes. \"The larger the atmosphere compared to the backdrop of a planet's star, the easier it is to observe,\" she explained.\n\nThe research paper noted that rocky planets with a radius less than 1.7 times that of Earth could maintain a hydrogen-rich atmosphere if water were to react with other elements.\n\nFurthermore, the findings indicated that E. coli releases various gases in a hydrogen-based atmosphere, including hydrogen sulfide, methane, and ammonia. These gases can serve as biosignature markers, aiding astronomers in the search for potential life on exoplanets.\n\nHighlighting the implications of this research, Dr. Seager stated, \"Astronomers should maintain an open-minded approach when seeking life on distant planets.\" With NASA's upcoming initiatives set to launch next year, the study suggests that researchers could observe smaller exoplanets orbiting small red-dwarf stars.\n\nReflecting on her motivation for the study, Dr. Seager remarked, \"We aimed to demonstrate that life could exist in hydrogen-rich environments, as these atmospheres are easier to analyze with current technologies compared to nitrogen or carbon dioxide-dominated atmospheres.\"\n\nAs the research continues, Dr. Seager and her team are excited about the possibilities it presents for astrobiology and the potential to identify signs of life beyond our solar system.", "question": "What conclusion did the study conducted by Dr. Seager and her team draw regarding the survival of microorganisms in hydrogen-rich atmospheres?\n\nA) E. coli and yeast cannot survive without oxygen.  \nB) Microorganisms can thrive in hydrogen-rich environments without oxygen.  \nC) Only yeast can survive in anaerobic environments.  \nD) The growth of microorganisms is doubled in hydrogen atmospheres compared to air."}

Groom, located in Queensland, centers around the city of Toowoomba. In the last federal election, the Liberal National Party, Queensland's leading conservative party, secured this seat with over 70% of the vote. Since its establishment in 1984, Groom has consistently been held by conservative parties.\n\nPolitical analysts consider the outcome largely predetermined, with Kevin Bonham labeling it \"Australia's most boring by-election\" on his blog. However, he emphasized that any significant swing could reflect the general performance of the dominant center-left Labor Party in Queensland, which experienced a 4.2% swing against it in the previous federal election.\n\nWikinews spoke with one of the four candidates in the by-election, Craig Farquharson, who represents the Liberal Democrats. The party advocates for \"individual liberty, free markets, and small government\" and currently has two elected officials in the Senate. Farquharson, a former military contractor, owns the King Vapealot vape store in Toowoomba.\n\n**Q: Why are you running to be Groom's local MP?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** I decided to run as a candidate for Groom because, as a small business owner, I struggled to get my elected MP to engage with me or even return my calls. This frustration with representatives who are inaccessible motivated me to take action. If elected, I am committed to being as accessible as possible to my constituents.\n\nAfter 36 years of Groom being a safe seat, residents are ready for change and seek the level of attention that comes with a more marginal electorate — or they want a new party to represent their interests. As a Liberal Democrat, I assure voters in Groom that I can bring them more attention and improve their dealings with the government. Listening to constituents will be my first step towards advocating for a better deal for Groom.\n\n**Q: The Liberal Democrats advocate for small government and reduced regulation. What specific law do you believe needs revision?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** We want to eliminate subsidies and allow all technologies to compete on equal footing to lower electricity prices and the cost of living through competition. A significant issue for Groom is overcoming regulatory hurdles, especially in obtaining environmental approvals for local mining operations, which is both a Federal and State concern. \n\nWhile Australia can transition to alternative energy sources, many developing nations rely on affordable electricity to combat poverty. By providing high-quality coal, we can make an environmental improvement while addressing global poverty and creating jobs in Groom. This approach would benefit all stakeholders through a sensible reduction of unnecessary regulations.\n\n**Q: As a vape store owner, do you think reforms are needed regarding e-cigarette laws and drug laws overall?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** The Liberal Democrats support relaxing certain restrictions to allow individuals to take personal responsibility for their health. We believe that criminalizing recreational drug use is detrimental to society and shifts funds to dangerous criminal enterprises. Drug abuse should be viewed as a health issue rather than a criminal one. We advocate for reforms based on evidence and a scientific approach, rather than punitive measures enforced by unfeeling bureaucrats. Personal health challenges should be addressed by individuals and their healthcare advisors, not by the justice system.\n\n**Q: Why did you decide to join the Liberal Democrats?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** The principles of the Liberal Democrats align with my values and those of many small business owners in the electorate, who see themselves as responsible adults capable of making their own decisions.\n\n**Q: The Liberal Democrats have yet to secure a seat in the House of Representatives and have not contested Groom before. What is your goal for this election?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** Our goal is to challenge the dominance of the major parties and make a significant impact with our campaign, encouraging a more equitable deal for Groom's residents from the Federal Government. We aim to ensure that the two major parties receive only the proportion of votes they received in the last federal election, while we capture the remaining vote.\n\n**Q: How have COVID-19 restrictions affected your campaign efforts?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** In Queensland, very few COVID-19 restrictions have impacted campaigning. Businesses have implemented COVID plans, but these have not limited voter participation or our campaigning efforts. The border closures that separate families and hinder access to healthcare services pose a far greater challenge to the community than our campaign has faced. We empathize with those still experiencing the effects of the pandemic.\n\n**Q: What's a key issue in Groom that requires urgent attention?**\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** Groom has not been a marginal electorate, resulting in insufficient infrastructure funding over the past 36 years under LNP representation. This has left us with significant water, road, and infrastructure issues to resolve. We aim to make Groom a contested seat to ensure that the government is held accountable and to represent the community’s needs. Listening to constituents and local businesses is paramount in my approach, with the principles of the Liberal Democrats guiding my solutions.

The Sustainable Australia Party has a comprehensive plan, which includes:\n- Funding and subsidizing renewable energy research and energy efficiency initiatives.\n- Committing to net zero or negative emissions by 2050, or ideally sooner.\n- Enacting a moratorium on new coal mines and major coal mine expansions.\n- Implementing a ban on new coal-fired power stations.\n- Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.\n- Establishing a fair carbon pricing mechanism.\n- Promoting the benefits of plant-based diets.\n- Addressing population growth pressures.\n\n**Q: What actions do you believe are necessary in Toowoomba for environmental and water protection?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Despite hosting an annual Carnival of Flowers, Toowoomba faces challenges in residents' access to green spaces. It’s essential to protect and expand areas in and around Toowoomba to prevent housing sprawl that harms tree canopies and green spaces. Water management is critical; we need to reduce waste, expand water tank usage, and explore recycled water options. Long-term water security for Toowoomba is also contingent upon decisive action on climate change.\n\n**Q: What are your thoughts on the federal government's COVID-19 response?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Overall, the Morrison Government's response has been prudent, despite initial hesitance to prioritize health over economic growth. However, there were significant gaps in support for vulnerable workers and industries, like casual workers and the arts, who faced inadequate assistance during the pandemic.\n\n**Q: Why did you choose to join Sustainable Australia?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** My science background played a significant role in my decision. It was critical for me that Sustainable Australia Party follows a science-based approach to policy. I believe they are the only party offering a holistic plan addressing environmental issues, with emphasis on strong climate action and stabilizing population growth both domestically and globally.\n\n**Q: Why is foreign ownership of farms and land an important issue?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** As a sovereign nation, it’s crucial for Australia to manage its natural resources sustainably and ensure that profits, jobs, and tax revenue benefit Australians. Selling off our resources undermines our ability to fulfill vital economic, environmental, and social objectives.\n\n**Q: How have COVID-19 restrictions impacted your campaign efforts?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** I've been able to work at early voting centers and conduct media interviews without significant restrictions, which has allowed me to campaign effectively.\n\n**Q: What’s one key issue in Groom that requires immediate attention?**\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** The Sustainable Australia Party prioritizes three main issues in this by-election: protecting our environment, curtailing overdevelopment, and combating corruption. Our foremost priority is environmental protection, which includes vigorous action on climate change. Unlike the other candidates, only the Sustainable Australia Party advocates for a moratorium on new coal mines and major expansions, such as the proposed New Acland Mine expansion.\n\n**zh:維基新聞專訪澳洲2020年地方選舉補選候選人桑德拉·傑弗科特**", "question": "What is one of the key priorities of Sandra Jephcott's campaign for the Groom by-election with the Sustainable Australia Party?  \n\nA) Increasing foreign ownership of land  \nB) Promoting economic growth over environmental concerns  \nC) Protecting the environment and taking strong action on climate change  \nD) Expanding coal mine operations"}
