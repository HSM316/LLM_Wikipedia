Israel, however, is not an ICC member and rejects the court's jurisdiction, arguing Palestine lacks sovereignty.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the decision as \"the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy,\" claiming the ICC ignores other alleged war crimes committed by Iran and Syria, among others.

They reiterated their commitment to expanding smoke-free zones to outdoor areas of cafes, restaurants, and city centers.\n\nResponding to accusations of micromanaging people's lives, the government emphasized the law's focus on public health, both by preventing second-hand smoke exposure and supporting smokers' cessation efforts. They hope to denormalize smoking among young people, reducing initiation rates.\n\nRegarding individual rights, the government acknowledged smoking's status as a leading cause of preventable death in Wales and stated the legislation aims to combat its harmful effects while still allowing adults to smoke in designated areas.  The current ban applies to all areas specified in the legislation.  Playgrounds are completely smoke-free at all times, regardless of children's presence.

[Name of outgoing MP] won the seat in the [previous election year] general election with 45.1% of the vote, a 13.1% margin over Labour's Helen McFarlane (32%).\n\nAmong the eight candidates vying for the seat is Donald Mackay, leader, secretary, and immigration spokesman for UK Independence Party (UKIP) Scotland.  UKIP, founded in 1993, campaigned for Britain's exit from the European Union, claiming credit for influencing former Prime Minister David Cameron's decision to hold the 2016 referendum.  However, following the 2019 resignation of [Name of previous UKIP leader], the party's influence waned significantly, with polling data from Panelbase and Deltapoll showing support at less than 1%, dwarfed by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nWikinews interviewed Mackay on several key issues:\n\n**Wikinews:** Why are you running in this by-election?\n\n**Mackay:** UKIP is a mainstream party and should have a candidate in all elections.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your thoughts on the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n**Mackay:** It's been handled very badly.  Destroying small businesses through lockdowns is not the answer.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What needs to be done to improve transport in Airdrie and Shotts?\n\n**Mackay:** No real comment on this.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your stance on Scottish independence?\n\n**Mackay:** I am a Unionist.  While I respect the Scottish people's right to self-determination, I believe Scotland already enjoys a degree of autonomy and prefer it to remain an integral part of the UK.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Does the Conservative government adequately address climate change?\n\n**Mackay:** I am a climate change sceptic and not interested in the issue.\n\n**Wikinews:** What does UKIP Scotland stand for?\n\n**Mackay:**  Our party stands for: scrapping the Scottish Parliament; total commitment to freedom of speech; and an end to lockdowns and restrictions on freedom of movement.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your 2020 manifesto mentioned \"Cultural Marxist social engineering.\"  Given its association with antisemitic conspiracy theories, do you still endorse this phrase?\n\n**Mackay:** I'm not sure I'd use the phrase \"Cultural Marxism,\" but I strongly oppose the politicization of our schools, public sector, police, and sports teams.\n\n**Wikinews:** How does UKIP differentiate itself from the Reform UK party?\n\n**Mackay:** As far as I'm aware, Reform UK doesn't propose abolishing the Scottish Parliament.\n\n**Wikinews:** What local issue needs more attention?\n\n**Mackay:** Sensible local investment to make Airdrie a more attractive place to live and work.\n\n**Wikinews:** If elected, what law would you change?\n\n**Mackay:** Primarily, I'd remove any restrictions on freedom of speech and thought.\n\n\nThis revised version is more concise, flows better, and removes unnecessary repetition.

The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting MP,  [Name of outgoing MP], a Scottish National Party (SNP) representative, who is contesting the concurrent Scottish Parliament election.  [Name of outgoing MP] won the seat in the [Year of previous election] general election with 45.1% of the vote, a 13.1% margin over second-place finisher Helen McFarlane of the Scottish Labour Party (32.0%).\n\nJonathan Stanley, representing the Scottish Unionist Party, is one of eight candidates vying for the seat.  Selected in September following [Name of outgoing MP]'s resignation, Stanley is also a list candidate for the Scottish Unionists in the concurrent Scottish Parliament election.\n\nWikinews interviewed Stanley on key national and local issues.  His answers to the first two questions included links to opinion pieces he authored and press releases from the Bow Group, a think tank where he serves as Senior Researcher (see External Links).\n\nStanley's first opinion piece advocates for housing reforms, including restricting home purchases to UK residents of ten years or more, a 20% tax on homes sold to foreigners, and the abolition of tax relief on \"buy-to-let\" mortgages.  His second piece criticizes a recent Scottish Parliament law, arguing it threatens freedoms and family privacy.\n\nThe Bow Group press releases focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.  A late January 2020 release urged mass flu and coronavirus vaccination for high-risk groups and a ban on flights to and from China (excluding medical relief flights).  A March 15, 2020 release advocated for UK border closure, nationwide lockdown, guaranteed essential utilities, and national ventilator procurement.\n\n\n**Wikinews Interview with Jonathan Stanley:**\n\n**Q: Why did you decide to run in this by-election?**\n\nA: Unionism is about building a Britain that prioritizes the vulnerable and helps everyone reach their potential. As a doctor, I believe Monklands A&E will close within five years following the removal of its trauma department.  Its reinstatement is crucial. Call centre jobs are vital to Airdrie, and I'm appalled by Teleperformance's office closure and shift to home working, including the surveillance of employees working from home. I've outlined plans to protect work-from-home rights and prevent COVID-19 from degrading working conditions. Freedom is more important than independence; we cannot be independent if we cannot speak freely at home, hence my opposition to the Hate Speech Act.\n\n\n**Q: What are your thoughts on the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic?**\n\nA: As Senior Researcher for the Bow Group, I called for a public health response to COVID-19 in January 2020, advocating for border closures, focusing on high-risk patients, and distributing Vitamin D nationwide. The absence of a health professional in the British Cabinet has resulted in abysmal, inept, dangerous, and economically disastrous management.\n\n\n**Q: What needs to be done to improve transport services in Airdrie and Shotts?**\n\nA: Urgent road repairs are the top priority, as around 90% of passenger journeys are by car.  For the sake of equality, road repair precedes further public transport investment. The Scottish Unionists aim to be the UK's most car-friendly party.  The treatment of taxi drivers has been disgraceful, with the SNP withholding funds to leverage them in this election.  [Name of bus company] is the top public transport provider, and we fully support them.\n\n\n**Q: Do you support Scottish independence?**\n\nA: As a member of the Scottish Unionist Party, I do not.\n\n\n**Q: Is the Conservative government doing enough to combat climate change?**\n\nA: The Conservatives rarely approach issues with evidence and economic sense. As a technologically advanced economy with global soft power, we must focus on technological solutions, not energy austerity. We favor increased nuclear and renewable energy in the UK, and using diplomacy to improve energy efficiency in the USA and pressure Canada to move away from polluting oil sands.  We oppose any fossil fuel phase-out for cars, preferring a technology-driven transition to carbon-free fuels.\n\n\n**Q: Why are you also running in the Scottish Parliament election?**\n\nA: While these elections are distinct,  All for Unity (A4U) aims to maximize the pro-UK vote with a clear message. We aim to remove the SNP from government and audit Holyrood.  This is the first stage in encouraging inter-party cooperation. We've prioritized tactical voting, which is now a major election issue—an extraordinary achievement given the limited canvassing opportunities.\n\n\n**Q: Why should voters choose you over other pro-union parties?**\n\nA: A4U has built a goal-oriented team, cooperating with other parties despite disagreements. This approach is new and, for the establishment, unsettling.\n\n\n**Q: You left UKIP in 2015 due to racism and bullying. What led you to the Scottish Unionists?**\n\nA: UKIP's attempts to exploit sectarianism to appeal to segments of the Unionist community were unacceptable to me, reflecting the divisive goals of the SNP. I rejoined the Conservatives to support Brexit but left when they employed tribal blackmail over a second referendum. The Scottish Unionists are a British party welcoming people of all faiths, mindful of Britain's Christian heritage.\n\n\n**Q: What local issue needs addressing?**\n\nA: District general hospitals, including [Name of hospital], are failing due to the centralization of services and power in larger cities. Distance is critical for emergency care; it's a matter of life and death.  It disproportionately affects those with limited mobility.\n\n\n**Q: If elected, what law would you change?**\n\nA: I would support \"Alfie's Law\"—ensuring no hospital can deny a patient treatment by another provider—and \"Hadiza's Law\"—preventing public bodies from using unregulated funds in legal action against employees or clients.\n\n\n**(External links to be inserted here)**", "question": "What is the date for the election to replace the outgoing MP for the Airdrie and Shotts constituency?  \n\nA) May 6  \nB) May 13  \nC) June 1  \nD) April 30"}

Manson, whose website describes him as having \"enjoyed a varied career working across international markets in both the manufacturing industry and energy sector,\" joined the SDP in 2019 after reading the party's New Declaration.\n\nWikinews interviewed Manson about key issues facing Airdrie and Shotts:\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did you decide to run in this by-election?\n\n**Manson:** The SDP is experiencing a resurgence across the UK, driven by growing disillusionment with mainstream politics.  People are seeking an alternative offering honest policies focused on families and communities. This is particularly true in Scotland. As Scottish Regional Chairman and a local resident for over 20 years, having raised my family in Airdrie, I’m a strong advocate for the SDP.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the Westminster government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n**Manson:** Leading the country through the pandemic was undoubtedly challenging, and both Westminster and Holyrood made mistakes. However, excessive criticism isn't helpful. While the SDP supported initial lockdown measures, we've been critical of the subsequent stop-start approach.  This failed to suppress the virus, undermined civil liberties, and risked prolonged economic depression and societal harm.\n\n**Wikinews:** What needs to be done to improve transport services in Airdrie and Shotts?\n\n**Manson:** Our key transport policy is nationalizing the rail system and gaining greater control over bus services, particularly increasing funding for regional and rural routes.\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you support Scottish independence?\n\n**Manson:** No.  The constitution is a reserved matter, and the UK Parliament held a referendum where the Scottish people chose to remain in the UK. Any constitutional change requires agreement at Westminster.\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you think the Conservative government is doing enough to combat climate change?\n\n**Manson:**  Current and previous governments talk a lot about environmental issues but lack action.  The SDP will meet our global environmental obligations, but we'll prioritize sustainable change through behavioral shifts in industry and society.\n\n**Wikinews:** The SNP describes itself as social democratic. What are the key differences between your party and theirs?\n\n**Manson:**  The SNP are populists, not social democrats. The SDP consistently embodies social democratic principles in our policies and actions, not just during elections. We're also patriotic and believe in a strong Scotland within a strong United Kingdom, benefiting all citizens.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you agree with your party's policy to establish a federal UK?\n\n**Manson:** Yes. This could help heal divisions across the UK, addressing the perception of Westminster as an \"English parliament.\" A multi-tiered approach fosters apathy and creates a vacuum for parties like the SNP to exploit.\n\n**Wikinews:** What does the SDP stand for?\n\n**Manson:** The SDP seeks the common good. We represent neither capital nor labor, but the welfare of the British people. We advocate for a social market economy where pro-public sector and pro-market policies coexist in a balanced program.\n\n**Wikinews:** What local issue isn't being addressed adequately?\n\n**Manson:** I'm concerned about the long-term future of sports and leisure facilities due to Scottish Government cuts to council budgets. Access to these facilities is crucial for physical and mental health, especially post-Covid.\n\n**Wikinews:** If elected, what law would you change?\n\n**Manson:** I'd support repealing the SNP's Hate Crime and Public Order Act.  We believe it's ambiguous, lacks safeguards, and threatens free speech, a right valued by 87% of Scots, according to recent polling.  The Act also raises concerns about the erosion of sex-based rights.  The SDP's policy on transgender and biological sex-based rights affirms the reality of biological sex and advocates for clear language in health and reproductive care.", "question": "When is the by-election to elect a replacement MP for Airdrie and Shotts scheduled to take place?  \nA) May 6  \nB) May 13  \nC) May 20  \nD) April 30"}

{"title": "NASA's helicopter Ingenuity survives its first night at Mars", "content": "NASA's Ingenuity helicopter survived its first Martian night alone, marking a significant milestone in the Perseverance rover mission.  The announcement, made Sunday on Twitter, confirmed the helicopter's ability to withstand frigid Martian temperatures as low as -90°C (-130°F) using its solar array to power an internal heater.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Adrian Mizher, independent candidate for Texas' 6th congressional district special election", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Adrian Mizher, Independent Candidate for Texas' 6th Congressional District Special Election\n\nWikinews emailed invitations on March 23 to multiple candidates in the May 1 special election for Texas' 6th Congressional District, held to fill the vacancy left by the death of Republican Congressman Ron Wright. Adrian Mizher agreed to a phone interview on March 30 to discuss his campaign and policy positions.  The following is that interview.\n\nMizher, whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as a senior loan closer at [Company Name], a [City, State]-based subsidiary of [Parent Company Name], has lived in [City, Texas] for five years and in Texas for 16 of the last 24 years. A 2001 accounting graduate of [University Name] in [City, State], he grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived for eight years in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He aims to champion \"a never-ending fight for fidelity to the Constitution and promotion of our Conservative values.\"  The interview covered topics ranging from the economy to immigration.\n\nAn Inside Elections poll published March 18 showed Republican candidate Susan Wright (Ron Wright's widow) leading by 21%, followed by Democrat [Candidate Name] at 17%, and Republican [Candidate Name] at 8%, with 4.6% undecided among 450 likely voters. Inside Elections considers the district \"lean Republican,\" noting it voted 51% for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election (down from 54% in 2016).\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Could you please introduce yourself, your history, and your background in politics and otherwise?\n\n**Mizher:** My name is Adrian Mizher. I don't have much formal political experience—this is my first run for office—but I've closely followed politics my whole life. I consider myself well-informed on current issues and political history. I graduated college in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in accounting from [University Name] in [City, State]. I'm married with three children. After college, I taught history and math for five years before entering banking, where I've worked for the past 16 years. That's my résumé!\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are, in your opinion, the powers and duties of a U.S. Representative?\n\n**Mizher:** As outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress's duties include enacting laws and upholding the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  A representative's primary role is controlling the power of the purse and ensuring the federal budget adheres to Constitutional limitations—something clearly not happening for quite some time.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You're running as an independent in a House district controlled by Republicans since 1983, currently contested by both major parties and the Libertarian Party. Why do you think Texas will elect an independent this time?\n\n**Mizher:** I believe voters, upon learning my views, will see they are grounded in the Constitution and Founding Principles, and are inherently conservative—principles the Republican Party should, but often doesn't, embody. Many Republicans elected to Congress deviate from their platform once in office.  Due to the unique circumstances of this special election, I initially sought to run under the Constitution Party banner. However, the [Secretary of State's] office informed me that, despite being a political party, they weren't officially registered, preventing my name from appearing under that label. My only option was to run as an independent, providing a clearer message than simply identifying as a Republican, which would have been politically suicidal in a normal election, and less likely to splinter the Republican vote in this already crowded field.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the late Ron Wright's governance, given that his death necessitated this election?\n\n**Mizher:** His passing was tragic. I considered Ron an excellent Congressman. We met several times, held private conversations, and I can attest he consistently followed through on his campaign promises and personal commitments to me. He voted responsibly and worked diligently.  I have only positive things to say about Congressman Wright—he served our district well.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are some of the most pressing issues you'll raise in Congress if elected?\n\n**Mizher:** My top priority is shrinking the federal government and budget. It's far too large, intrusive, and exceeds its Constitutional limits. We need to reverse this trend, restoring the balance of power towards state and local governments.\n\nElection integrity is another critical issue, especially after the 2020 election. Whether or not the election was \"stolen,\" as some claim, is debatable.  The lack of conclusive evidence on either side is problematic because the widespread belief that it was stolen erodes public trust.  We must restore confidence in our elections to prevent further unrest.\n\nImmigration is also crucial.  The current system is flawed. We should simplify, streamline, and reduce the cost of legal immigration, welcoming those who wish to immigrate legally.  The best way to curb illegal immigration is to improve the legal process.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website states both \"we must remain a sovereign nation in control of our borders\" and \"our immigration process should be simple enough that a child can follow it.\"  Could you elaborate?\n\n**Mizher:**  My website also states our belief in the Biblical principle of welcoming the world's downtrodden and those seeking opportunity. We should embrace immigrants who contribute positively to our society, as past waves of immigrants have done.  Simplifying the process involves basic requirements:  no communicable diseases, no criminal history, willingness to learn English and American history, and eventual swearing allegiance to our flag and values.  Those who meet these simple requirements and pose no threat should be allowed temporary entry to pursue their goals, gradually working towards citizenship.  The current lengthy processes are unnecessary.  We need a reasonable annual cap but should prioritize those genuinely wanting to become Americans.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website mentions appealing to \"the Supreme Judge for our guidance\" and regaining \"firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence.\"  Could you elaborate?\n\n**Mizher:** America's founding is inextricably linked to faith and belief in a higher power, even if not explicitly stated in all founding documents.  The founders' personal writings reveal a belief in the divine.  America has increasingly strayed from those foundational beliefs over the past half-century. Godly values, particularly Christian ones, are frequently mocked in popular culture, corroding society and contributing to various social ills. A belief in something greater than oneself provides a moral compass. Without it, individual morality prevails, leading to conflict.  I believe restoring our nation's faith in a higher power is crucial.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you handle the COVID-19 vaccine rollout if elected?\n\n**Mizher:** I'm unsure if vaccine rollout is a federal responsibility. I believe we should expedite vaccine distribution and allow state and local governments to determine the best approach for their populations.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you help the economically disadvantaged?\n\n**Mizher:**  The most effective assistance is delivered locally—through families, communities, charities, and state/local governments.  Federal interventions often create more problems than they solve.  Americans are compassionate and will help those in need. Currently, many avoid helping because they believe the federal government's handling of it fulfills their civic duty.  I want to shift that responsibility back to communities, fostering personal responsibility. Local assistance is more effective and allows for personalized support, working towards self-sufficiency.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on President Biden?\n\n**Mizher:** [Laughs]  I think his agenda is too far left and unconstitutional. Like many politicians, he prioritizes satisfying his base to maintain power, sometimes advocating policies he doesn't truly believe in.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on former President Trump?\n\n**Mizher:** President Trump achieved many great things, particularly in the Middle East peace process and Supreme Court appointments. I support his Jerusalem embassy move.  His deregulation efforts boosted the economy. However, his abrasive style hindered his ability to win over more supporters.  I appreciate his willingness to fight the left, but his methods were often overly harsh and made it difficult to defend his actions. His biggest failing was his failure to shrink the federal government; he increased spending rather than cutting it.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you have any thoughts on the ongoing border crisis?\n\n**Mizher:** Both parties use the border crisis for political gain.  The situation isn't inherently different under Biden than it was under Trump, despite the rhetoric.  The solution is simple: stronger border security, increased personnel, and a streamlined legal immigration process.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website advocates for a \"more balanced approach\" to the economy, stating our societal framework is \"far outside of the needed balance.\"  Elaborate.\n\n**Mizher:**  I prefer free enterprise over pure capitalism, which is under attack.  Capitalism rewards greed and disproportionately favors the wealthy. Government shouldn't favor either the wealthy or the poor.  I oppose the excessive influence of large corporations that crowd out small businesses. A more balanced approach would level the playing field, promoting small and medium-sized businesses and job growth.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the size of the U.S. military?\n\n**Mizher:** It's too large.  The Pentagon needs to justify its massive budget.  We need to reduce spending unless compelling reasons exist for maintaining such a large military.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\n**Mizher:** The system suffers from classism, not simply racism. While racism exists and must be eradicated, the focus on racism overshadows the inequities faced by the less fortunate.  The system favors those who can afford better legal representation.  Decentralizing the system, returning power to local communities, could improve justice by fostering personal accountability and tailoring solutions to individual circumstances.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on Medicare?\n\n**Mizher:** I believe it's unconstitutional and should eventually be dismantled. Providing healthcare is not the federal government's responsibility. State or even local governments could handle healthcare for the needy more effectively.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the rise in anti-Asian sentiment?\n\n**Mizher:** I'm not convinced there's a significant rise in anti-Asian sentiment.  The Atlanta shootings, for example, didn't appear racially motivated.  Any racist acts must be condemned and eradicated.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China?\n\n**Mizher:** I lack sufficient information to form a solid opinion. I'm concerned Biden won't adequately challenge China's growing influence.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** The February Texas power grid failure affected millions, including the 6th District. How would you prevent this?\n\n**Mizher:** This is primarily a state issue.  While the federal government could pressure state officials, energy production and distribution isn't a federal responsibility.  Concerns include the lack of winterization of power plants and the fact that many ERCOT members weren't even Texas residents.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What differentiates you from other Republican candidates claiming to promote \"conservative values\"?\n\n**Mizher:**  I hope we all share similar conservative values.  My distinguishing factor is my unwavering commitment to these values, my aggressive advocacy, and my ability to articulate them clearly and persuasively to a broader audience, countering the negative stereotypes often associated with conservatism.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How has COVID-19 affected your campaign?\n\n**Mizher:** I haven't noticed any significant impact.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** If not elected, what are your future ambitions?\n\n**Mizher:** That remains to be seen.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Lighthearted question: Which historical figure do you identify with most?\n\n**Mizher:**  While my faith informs my views significantly, for a lighthearted answer, I'll choose Abraham Lincoln, whom I admire for his growth and evolution in political thought. I also admire Ronald Reagan's ability to connect with people through humor.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Any final comments?\n\n**Mizher:**  No. I believe I've covered everything.", "question": "What position does Adrian Mizher hold regarding the size of the federal government and its involvement in people's lives?  \n\nA) He believes it should be expanded to better serve citizens.  \nB) He advocates for a smaller government that adheres to constitutional limitations.  \nC) He wants the government to take over healthcare completely.  \nD) He supports increased military funding to strengthen government presence."}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews candidate for Minneapolis mayor Philip Sturm", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Minneapolis Mayoral Candidate Philip Sturm\n\nWikinews interviewed Philip Sturm, a candidate in the Minneapolis mayoral election scheduled for November 2, 2024.  Sturm discussed his campaign and policy positions.\n\nSturm is a military veteran, serving from 1999 to 2003 in the U.S. Marine Corps.  His service included a tour in Okinawa, Japan, followed by deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq during the U.S. invasions.  His civilian career is in the chemical manufacturing and operations sector.  His resume includes roles as co-chair of the DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party) District 62 in 2005, a member of Veterans for Kerry, and volunteer positions including a special deputy in Hennepin County, participation in the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) 911 emergency helpline workgroup, and involvement with the 9/11 and GWOT Remembrance Task Force and a racial equity fund.  He resigned from the Remembrance Task Force to avoid the appearance of using it for political gain.\n\n**Wikinews:** Please introduce yourself.\n\n**Sturm:** I'm Phil Sturm, 40, married, and a lifelong Minnesotan.  I moved to Minneapolis in 2003 after an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps. I graduated from [High School Name Redacted] in 1998 and attended [College Name Redacted] for two years before returning to work. My current work is in the chemical manufacturing sector. I served as a Hennepin County Special Deputy (2018-2019), gaining experience in public safety and emergency management. I also participated in the MPD/911 workgroup that explored alternative emergency response models.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What motivated your mayoral candidacy?\n\n**Sturm:** The 2020 unrest highlighted a leadership gap.  The lack of effective governance and public safety during that time convinced me that Minneapolis needs new leadership. I believe the city is plagued by incompetent, yet highly credentialed officials who consistently fail upward.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you elaborate on your military service?\n\n**Sturm:** I joined the Marines in 1999, completing basic training in San Diego.  I was a combat engineer, serving initially in Okinawa, then with a Marine Expeditionary Unit based in North Carolina. I was on leave when 9/11 occurred.  My unit participated in the capture of Kandahar in December 2001, followed by patrol and humanitarian operations.  In January 2003, I deployed to Iraq. I was attached to [Unit Name Redacted] under Colonel Dowdy, responsible for managing engineering assets and neutralizing explosive devices. I returned home shortly after the initial phase of the Iraq War.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why should Minneapolitans vote for you?\n\n**Sturm:** I offer a different approach.  I'm an empirically-minded person with a background demanding tangible results, unlike the carousel of lawyers and professionals who consistently underperform. My leadership experience in the military and my understanding of results-oriented work make me uniquely qualified to tackle the city's challenges.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website states that the Minneapolis Police Department does not view itself as part of the community.  Explain.\n\n**Sturm:** Years of “reform talks” with police chiefs and unions have been nothing but stalling tactics. They have no genuine interest in community-led reform. The MPD's culture, practices, and ideology indicate an insular and autonomous force operating outside community oversight. My campaign aims to confront this reality directly.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You also advocate for dismantling militarism within the police.  Elaborate.\n\n**Sturm:**  My military experience led me to research the societal impact of militarism. Studies show that military occupations often exacerbate racism and xenophobia at home.  Militarizing the police mirrors this:  ostensible efforts to \"help\" communities often lead to increased racism within the force and its supporting structures.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website mentions shifting tax burdens to address economic disparities.  Explain.\n\n**Sturm:** Targeted sales tax relief and other forms of tax relief for disadvantaged neighborhoods would effectively shift the tax burden to wealthier areas.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You support rent stabilization. Elaborate.\n\n**Sturm:** I support an annual rent increase based on inflation plus a reasonable percentage (around 5%).  Pandemic-related measures should assist both tenants and landlords using federal relief programs.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What would distinguish your mayoral tenure?\n\n**Sturm:** I offer a more pragmatic, data-driven approach to governance.  I will challenge the existing self-serving professional community that lacks self-awareness.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Who did you support in the [Previous Elections Redacted]?\n\n**Sturm:** [Answers redacted to avoid endorsing specific candidates.]\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you address educational disparities?\n\n**Sturm:** Stable housing and food security are crucial.  We can collaborate with the school board to build on existing initiatives that link housing policies with educational outcomes.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you address income inequality?\n\n**Sturm:** We must continue to support living wage policies, paid sick leave, and stable housing options.  We should foster collaborations with businesses to expand vocational and technical training in our manufacturing sectors.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** [Questions regarding COVID-19 and distinguishing Sturm from other candidates received no answer.]\n\n**Wikinews:** If you couldn't vote for yourself, who would you support?\n\n**Sturm:**  I'm undecided, but generally support AJ Awed.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why might people not vote for you?\n\n**Sturm:**  Lack of executive experience and the fact that I'm another white male candidate are potential reasons.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Which historical figure do you most admire?\n\n**Sturm:**  [Response redacted for brevity] I admire Ulysses S. Grant for his calm and effective leadership style.  I also admire Theodore Roosevelt's positive energy.\n\n[Concluding remarks were not provided.]\n\n\n**Note:**  Bracketed information indicates redactions made for clarity, brevity, or to avoid endorsing specific candidates or institutions.

The 166-132 vote (in a 300-seat parliament) was met with opposition from students and professors who fear it will suppress freedom of speech.  The new measures include a dedicated campus police division, restricted campus access, and a disciplinary council with powers to suspend or expel students.\n\nA government spokesperson described university campus violence as \"timeless,\" arguing that police will remove extremist political groups, protect university infrastructure, and create a safer environment.  Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose center-right New Democracy party initiated the legislation, highlighted incidents of vandalism at historical university buildings as justification.\n\nGreek universities have a history of unrest, including the deadly 1973 student revolt against the 1967-1974 military junta (resulting in at least 26 deaths), and a 1990-91 protest against high school reforms (during which a teacher died)  pushed by Mitsotakis' father.  More recently, incidents such as a rector being held hostage by masked individuals in October further fueled the government's action.  In 2019, the government lifted a 1982 ban on police entering university grounds.\n\nOpponents argue the new police presence will stifle freedom of expression – a claim the government dismissed as \"ridiculous.\" Recent protests have featured chants of \"Bread, education, and freedom,\" echoing the 1973 anti-junta movement.

While the US will cease military operations, it will continue diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in the country, according to the BBC.\n\nNATO echoed the sentiment that a military solution is not viable and that their goal of preventing Afghanistan from serving as a terrorist safe haven has been achieved.  A joint statement declared, \"Our troops went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted together, and now we are leaving together.\"  Similar sentiments were expressed by Germany's Defence Minister.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the allied commitment to a coordinated withdrawal.\n\nThe UK's Defence Secretary, while expressing hope for a peaceful future for Afghanistan, prioritized the safe return of British troops.  He also acknowledged the sacrifices made by fallen soldiers.  Following a phone call with President Bush, Biden expressed shared respect and support for the US Armed Forces.\n\nThe withdrawal has drawn mixed reactions in the US.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called it a \"grave mistake,\" predicting increased terrorist threats.  Other Republicans echoed this concern, while some Democrats expressed reservations about the arbitrary deadline.  However, Senator Elizabeth Warren praised Biden's recognition that continued US presence did not enhance global security, and former President Obama voiced his support for the decision.  The CIA Director acknowledged the \"significant risk\" posed by Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan, warning of potential threats to US interests.", "question": "What date did President Joe Biden announce as the target for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan?  \n\nA) May 1  \nB) September 11  \nC) October 14  \nD) August 31"}

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Democratic candidate for the Texas 6th congressional district special election Daryl Eddings, Sr's campaign manager", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Campaign Manager for Democratic Candidate Daryl Eddings, Sr. in Texas' 6th Congressional District Special Election\n\nWikinews emailed invitations on March 23 to multiple candidates in the Texas 6th congressional district special election, scheduled for May 1st, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Republican Congressman Ron Wright.  The campaign of Democratic candidate Daryl Eddings, Sr., responded, and agreed to an interview by phone on March 30.  The following is that interview with Ms. Chatham, speaking on behalf of Mr. Eddings.\n\nEddings, a retired senior non-commissioned officer with 26 years of military service and 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, is a highly decorated veteran. His career included working as an operations officer in an aviation unit, responding to the Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict, participating in drug interdiction efforts in Panama and Central America, and serving in the Middle East. He founded Operation Battle Buddy, a veteran support organization that has connected with over 20,000 veterans and their families. Born in California, he now resides in Midlothian, Texas.  His campaign emphasizes \"good government, not no government.\"  Campaign manager Faith Chatham discussed a range of issues with Wikinews, from healthcare to housing.\n\nAn Inside Elections poll from March 18 projected Republican candidate Susan Wright (Ron Wright's widow) with a 21% lead, followed by Democrat Jana Sanchez at 17%, and Republican candidate [Candidate's Name] at 8%.  The poll had a 4.6% margin of error among 450 likely voters. Inside Elections rates the district as \"lean Republican,\" noting that it voted 51% for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election (down from 54% in 2016).\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Could you introduce Mr. Eddings and his background in more detail?\n\n**Chatham:** Daryl J. Eddings Sr. is a retired senior non-commissioned officer with 26 years of military experience, during some of which he also worked for the Federal Air Marshal Service, totaling 30 years of federal law enforcement.  At 60, he has an impressive record of service. He's a highly decorated veteran—his uniform has no room for more medals!  He lives in Midlothian, Texas, with family ties extending back six generations. He graduated from high school in California and immediately joined the military.  Later, becoming a single father, he returned to California to be closer to his children, joining the California National Guard while working in federal service.  As a non-commissioned officer and operations officer in a federal aviation unit, he supervised personnel from three different agencies.\n\nHis career encompassed diverse roles: drug interdiction in Panama and along the US-Mexico border, emergency management for the state of California, and providing security for the governor and mayor during the O.J. Simpson and Rodney King riots.  In his overseas deployments, he served in Iraq, commanding a tactical team responsible for locating high-ranking officials of the Revolutionary Guard. He also served as a provost marshal, effectively acting as police chief for a 75-mile radius.  He consistently took on leadership roles requiring problem-solving and resourcefulness.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What does he consider the primary responsibility of a US Representative?\n\n**Chatham:** Mr. Eddings believes a US Representative's power lies in effectively serving their constituents' needs. He is concerned that many representatives prioritize narrow interests instead of the majority.  He decided to run after observing what he feels is a disregard for the oath of office among some members of Congress, believing their loyalty should be to the Constitution, not to individuals or a party. He strongly condemns the January 6th attack on the Capitol, viewing it as an attempt to undermine the democratic process, and believes the right to vote must be fiercely protected.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** He's running as a Democrat in a district controlled by Republicans since 1983. Why do you think Texans might choose a Democrat this time?\n\n**Chatham:** The district has been shifting. Tarrant County, the largest part of the district, is now considered a swing district (\"purple\").  In recent elections, Democrats would have won if not for Republican support in rural Navarro and Ellis counties.  However, parts of Ellis County are becoming more Democratic (\"blue\"), and Eddings has strong support there.  The Democratic candidates are campaigning collaboratively, rather than against each other.  Years of building political infrastructure are paying off, creating a real opportunity for change.\n\nThe district's history includes Phil Gramm, a Republican who initially lost a congressional race, then won as a Democrat, before switching back to the Republican Party after disagreements with his party. The district's economic stagnation since the adoption of trickle-down economics, coupled with job losses and increased housing and healthcare costs, has created dissatisfaction among voters. The recent Texas power outages and the perceived failures of energy company regulation have further exacerbated these issues.  There's a growing divide between Trump supporters and those who oppose his policies, and this election could be significantly impacted by that division.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Regarding the reason for this special election, the death of Ron Wright, what is Mr. Eddings' view of his governance?\n\n**Chatham:** Ron Wright, formerly Tarrant County tax assessor-collector, closely followed the policies of Joe Barton, his former boss.  Mr. Eddings notes Wright's overtly religious displays on tax notices and government vehicles, which Eddings, while a devout Christian, finds inappropriate.  As mayor pro tem of Arlington, Wright helped facilitate the proliferation of gas wells, leading to a significant decline in air quality and damaging the city's zoning.  Wright also voted against healthcare expansion despite the district's high maternal mortality rate. He focused on protecting energy companies, even at the cost of public safety and economic opportunity.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are the most pressing issues Mr. Eddings would address in Congress?\n\n**Chatham:** Healthcare, affordable housing, and education are top priorities. The rising costs of these necessities far outpace income growth.  Addressing the national debt through job creation and workforce development is also key.  This includes raising wages, providing access to education and training, and creating career ladders.  He advocates for investing in American workers and technology, revising the tax code to incentivize domestic investment and research and development, and restoring the middle class.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website mentions the failures of \"Tea Party Republicans\" and \"trickle-down economics.\" Could you elaborate?\n\n**Chatham:** Trickle-down economics, as implemented by Reagan and Gramm, failed to deliver on its promises.  Tax cuts for businesses did not lead to increased wages or job creation. Instead, companies often banked profits or invested overseas, resulting in job losses.  This resulted in a loss of good union jobs with benefits and job security, particularly in Ellis and Navarro Counties. Eddings understands the need to support businesses, but emphasizes the importance of investing in the American workforce and offering protections for workers. The lack of such investment has left the country ill-prepared for crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and created numerous economic and social inequalities.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website states, \"I served within the chain of command under the commander-in-chief, but I did not swear an oath to any one man or political party.\"  Please explain.\n\n**Chatham:** Mr. Eddings believes the January 6th insurrection highlighted the danger of blind loyalty to a single individual over the Constitution.  He served under several commanders-in-chief, but his oath was always to the Constitution.  He criticizes those who excused or downplayed the insurrection and those who spread misinformation about the election. He feels strongly that a peaceful transfer of power is a cornerstone of American democracy.  His personal experiences—including returning from Iraq in a coma and undergoing extensive rehabilitation—fuel his commitment to defending the Constitution and democratic principles.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would Mr. Eddings approach vaccine rollout?\n\n**Chatham:** He's pleased with President Biden's approach, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive plan for distribution, including collaboration with scientists, the supply chain, the military, and healthcare professionals.  His background in emergency management gives him the necessary experience to efficiently manage such a large-scale operation.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would he help the economically disadvantaged?\n\n**Chatham:** Through job creation, access to education, and expansion of healthcare.  He advocates for Medicaid expansion in Texas, aiming to improve access to healthcare and lower costs for all. He also highlights the need for affordable housing initiatives and support for veterans facing housing insecurity and mental health challenges.  He would work to strengthen retirement security and prevent corporations from shirking their responsibilities to retirees.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are his opinions on President Biden?\n\n**Chatham:** Eddings approves of Biden's reversal of Trump's executive orders, his focus on appointing qualified officials to government positions, and his commitment to evidence-based policy-making. He supports \"good government,\" not dismantling crucial government services.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are his thoughts on former President Trump?\n\n**Chatham:** Eddings doesn't hold Trump in high regard, viewing his actions as dangerous and detrimental to the nation and its allies.  He is particularly critical of Trump's disregard for intelligence briefings, his risky foreign policy decisions, and the damage inflicted on America's relationships with its allies.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are his views on the border crisis?\n\n**Chatham:**  Eddings acknowledges the humanitarian crisis while also understanding the need for border security. He believes a multifaceted approach is necessary, including addressing the root causes of migration in Central America, improving processing of asylum claims, and ensuring humane treatment of migrants.  He opposes building a wall, seeing it as impractical and ineffective.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are his views on the size of the American military?\n\n**Chatham:**  She was unable to provide a definitive answer on this topic, stating it hadn't been specifically discussed.  She did say he supports the military and recognizes its role in providing opportunities for individuals, but believes it should not be used arbitrarily.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** His thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\n**Chatham:** Eddings supports law enforcement while acknowledging the existence of systemic racism and biases within the system. He advocates for increased transparency and accountability, citing the importance of the Sandra Bland Act and the need for similar reforms at the national level.  He supports background checks and restrictions on certain weapons while also recognizing the rights of gun owners.  He emphasizes the need to address mental health and addiction issues, utilizing trained professionals rather than relying solely on law enforcement.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What is his stance on Medicare?\n\n**Chatham:**  He considers Medicare a highly efficient system but is open to exploring options like expanding access to younger populations or improving the Affordable Care Act to address its shortcomings.  He also advocates for expanding dental and mental health coverage.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  His thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China?\n\n**Chatham:**  This topic had not been discussed, so she couldn't provide an answer.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** His views on the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes?\n\n**Chatham:**  He strongly condemns all forms of hate and discrimination. He considers it an abomination.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How would he prevent the February power outages?\n\n**Chatham:**  He advocates for federal regulations requiring winterization of energy facilities, preventing profiteering schemes, and burying pipelines at sufficient depths to prevent freezing.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What sets him apart from other candidates?\n\n**Chatham:**  His extensive experience in emergency management, his commitment to community safety, and his dedication to finding solutions rather than seeking personal glory distinguish him. His honesty and integrity are also highlighted.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How has COVID-19 impacted the campaign?\n\n**Chatham:**  The pandemic has drastically altered campaigning, requiring reliance on virtual communication and making traditional outreach more difficult. It also impacted the accelerated timeline of this special election, making everything more challenging.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** If he isn't elected this time, what are his future plans?\n\n**Chatham:**  He plans to run again in 2022.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Which historical figures does he most admire?\n\n**Chatham:**  John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for their perseverance in the face of discrimination and their work to expand opportunities for marginalized groups.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Any final comments?\n\n**Chatham:** [Laughs] I think I’ve said quite enough!\n\n\n__NOTOC__", "question": "What is one of Daryl Eddings, Sr.'s main platforms in his campaign for the Texas 6th congressional district special election?\n\nA) Increasing taxes on all citizens  \nB) Expanding affordable housing and access to healthcare  \nC) Reducing the size of the military  \nD) Eliminating federal income tax"}

{"title": "Wikinews discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman after GitHub re-enables public access to youtube-dl", "content": "## Wikinews Discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman Following GitHub's Reinstatement of youtube-dl\n\nOn November 16, 2023, GitHub reinstated public access to the `youtube-dl` repository, a software program used to download videos from the internet. This action followed a letter from Mitchell Stoltz, Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent on behalf of `youtube-dl`'s maintainers.  GitHub had initially blocked the repository on October 23, 2023, after receiving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nLaunched in July 2008, `youtube-dl` is a free/libre open-source software written in Python.  It downloads videos from various websites. The RIAA's takedown notice alleged that `youtube-dl` violated 17 U.S. Code § 1201 (Circumvention of copyright protection systems), claiming it was designed to bypass the technological protection measures of streaming services and redistribute music videos without authorization.  The `youtube-dl` source code contained unit tests to verify functionality across different platforms; some tests initially referenced copyrighted songs.\n\nIn its letter to GitHub, the EFF argued that these tests only streamed short segments of songs to verify `youtube-dl`'s operation, not causing permanent downloads or distribution.  The letter emphasized that `youtube-dl` does not decrypt videos protected by commercial Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies.  The URLs to copyrighted songs were removed from the source code on November 16th and replaced with a test video uploaded to YouTube by Philipp Hagemeister, a former `youtube-dl` maintainer who had previously discussed the takedown with Wikinews.\n\n`youtube-dl` uses a small Python interpreter to act as a browser would when receiving video data.  It features \"extractors\" for various websites to handle videos from different sources. The EFF's letter noted that any software capable of running JavaScript can access video streams, regardless of YouTube's approval, drawing an analogy:  YouTube provides instructions for accessing video streams, much like a door with instructions (\"say 'friend' and enter\") readily available to all who seek access.\n\nFollowing the restoration of public access, Sergey M, a `youtube-dl` maintainer, thanked GitHub, the EFF, and their hosting provider Uberspace (currently facing a lawsuit in Germany for hosting the `youtube-dl` website) for their support.\n\nStoltz tweeted, comparing `youtube-dl` to a VCR, highlighting its empowerment of personal video use and the need to protect it from copyright restrictions.\n\n`youtube-dl` is used globally by thousands, including the `video2commons` tool which uploads Creative Commons and public domain videos to Wikimedia Commons.  It's also used by citizen journalists on platforms like PeerTube, for fair use purposes, and as evidence.  Many videos on YouTube are already under Creative Commons (e.g., CC BY) licenses or are in the public domain, allowing free use and modification with proper attribution.\n\nGitHub's blog post announcing `youtube-dl`'s return stated that code can serve legitimate purposes even if it can access copyrighted material, citing examples such as accessibility adjustments, human rights advocacy, journalistic fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons or public domain videos.  GitHub committed to scrutinizing future Section 1201 takedown notices and pledged a $1 million developer defense fund.  Many forked repositories, also affected by the initial DMCA takedown, remained inaccessible at the time of Wikinews' initial reporting.  Sergey M, while maintaining `youtube-dl` on GitLab during the GitHub block, made that repository private after GitHub's reinstatement.\n\n\nFollowing these events, Wikinews interviewed Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, regarding DRM and the DMCA.  Here are excerpts from that interview:\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What is DRM and whose rights does it protect?\n\n**Stallman:** DRM, or more accurately, *digital restrictions management*, restricts user access to copyrighted works.  It's unjust, empowering the powerful at the expense of everyone else.  While proponents claim it protects rights, it truly protects power – an inherent injustice.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your thoughts on the RIAA's DMCA takedown of `youtube-dl`?\n\n**Stallman:** It was a gross misinterpretation of the law, as the EFF explained.  But my concern is less with the legality and more with the morality – it was a tool of oppression, reflecting the DMCA's aim to suppress sharing.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why was the DMCA introduced?\n\n**Stallman:** I can only speculate, but it mainly grants publishers (and sometimes authors/artists) greater power to restrict sharing. The DRM sections specifically aimed to hinder the circumvention of digital restrictions placed on consumers.\n\n**Wikinews:** Is DRM necessary for the DMCA to function?\n\n**Stallman:** If the goal is repression, then yes, the DMCA's DRM provisions, alongside its takedown system, both serve to stop sharing.  Sharing copies of works should be legal; any law against it attacks society.\n\n**Wikinews:** Is DRM harmful to an independent society?\n\n**Stallman:**  DRM consolidates control in the hands of large corporations.  Effective DRM requires standardization, essentially creating monopolies.  Real competition would offer DRM-free alternatives, but instead, publishers often collaborate to use identical DRM systems (DVDs, Blu-ray). This eliminates consumer choice.\n\n**Wikinews:** How does DRM mistreat users unbeknownst to them?\n\n**Stallman:**  Obvious DRM (like inability to copy) is noticeable, but malicious programs can incorporate backdoors for spying without detection.  DRM, however, is usually apparent.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How should intellectual property laws be applied?\n\n**Stallman:** The term \"intellectual property\" is overly broad and confusing, encompassing patents, trade secrets, trademarks, plant variety monopolies, and copyright – all distinct legal areas with different purposes.  Each requires specific consideration, rather than being lumped together.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Many complaints use IP laws to protect software.\n\n**Stallman:** They use vague terms like \"protecting software\" (preventing destruction, damage, etc.) to obscure the real issue.  I insist on concrete descriptions of their aims.  The core issue is whether anyone should control others' ability to make copies.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why is software treated differently than other tools? (John Deere tractors example)\n\n**Stallman:** Morally, it shouldn't be. All software should be free.  Practically, software was initially treated like a written work, subject to copyright, while physical tools had different legal treatment.  Lobbying by software companies resulted in bizarre interpretations of copyright, such as allowing simultaneous copyright and trade secret claims for the same software.\n\n**Wikinews:** What changes do you propose?\n\n**Stallman:** All software should be free (freedom, not price).  Charging for copies is acceptable, but users’ freedom must be respected. While I oppose criminalizing non-free software distribution (due to the ineffectiveness of such laws), I believe works serving practical purposes (textbooks, reference works) should also be free.  Non-commercial redistribution of copyrighted works should be permitted.\n\n**Wikinews:** DRM and the right to repair?\n\n**Stallman:** The right to repair is part of the freedom afforded by free software.  Software in all products (cars, tractors) should be free to enable repair and knowledge sharing.\n\n**Wikinews:** Companies leasing products/services and abusing DMCA/DRM to control what consumers own?\n\n**Stallman:**  If a company leases a product long-term, the software within should be free, enabling modification.  Software-as-a-service is too broad; \"service-as-a-software-substitute\" is more specific, and the solution is to run free software independently.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What constitutes owning software?\n\n**Stallman:** With free software, ownership is like owning a chair. With non-free software, companies claim you only have a license, a form of user subjugation.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What rights should software owners have?\n\n**Stallman:**  The four essential freedoms: to run the program, to study the source code, to make and share copies, and to modify and share modified versions.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Reselling software and the Amazon Kindle example?\n\n**Stallman:** The freedom to copy and distribute is distinct from reselling.  DRM restrictions (like those on Kindles) are unjust, preventing users from sharing eBooks.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why do EULAs exist?\n\n**Stallman:** Companies impose EULAs to restrict users and subjugate them.\n\n**Wikinews:**  The car analogy (fixing a car's exhaust, then the seller refusing further repairs)?\n\n**Stallman:**  This is comparable to proprietary software restrictions, as users lack the source code to fix issues.\n\n**Wikinews:** How has software distribution changed regarding user rights?\n\n**Stallman:**  Non-free software became dominant in the 1970s.  The 1980s saw the rise of the free software movement to liberate users.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Problems with DMCA 1201 (anti-circumvention)?\n\n**Stallman:** The prohibition on distributing tools to bypass DRM.  This makes circumventing DRM an underground activity.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Proposed modifications to DMCA anti-circumvention laws?\n\n**Stallman:**  Eliminate them.  Furthermore, consider making the production, sale, or lease of DRM-enabled products illegal.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Is the FSF collaborating with any senators?\n\n**Stallman:** I'm unaware of such collaborations.  Many abandon opposition to established laws over time.\n\n**Wikinews:**  How can digital publishers sell copyrighted works without DRM?\n\n**Stallman:** I refuse to use terms like \"piracy\" (which smears sharing) and \"protected\" (which obfuscates restriction).  Supporting artists better is crucial, and I've proposed alternative systems to the current broken one.\n\n**Wikinews:** How can artists sell digital art without DRM and prevent non-commercial redistribution?\n\n**Stallman:**  You must accept that people will share; preventing it is wrong.\n\n**Wikinews:** How are browsers affected by W3C's support of EMEs (Encrypted Media Extensions)?\n\n**Stallman:**  Free browsers can't fully support web standards that incorporate DRM.  You must choose between freedom and access to DRM-protected content.\n\n**Wikinews:** Mozilla's choice between supporting DRM and other priorities?\n\n**Stallman:**  Publishers' conspiracy to enforce DRM forces developers to comply, except for those who prioritize freedom.\n\n**Wikinews:** Was the free software movement too late to prevent DRM's spread?\n\n**Stallman:**  I fear so, though it's impossible to know what could have been.\n\n**Wikinews:** Is DRM ever morally justifiable?\n\n**Stallman:** Not in my view.  Users should have the freedom to copy, change, and share works; DRM always prohibits this.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Awareness of Snap and Flatpak package managers?\n\n**Stallman:**  I know they can install non-free software, which I strongly discourage.\n\n**Wikinews:** Software developers moving to Snap/Flatpak?\n\n**Stallman:** This is negative, as these platforms distribute non-free software, lack transparency, and hinder collective user control.\n\n\nThis revised version improves clarity, flow, and organization, making the information more accessible and engaging for the reader.  It also reduces redundancy and incorporates more precise language.", "question": "On November 16, which organization influenced GitHub's decision to restore public access to the youtube-dl repository?  \nA) Free Software Foundation  \nB) Electronic Frontier Foundation  \nC) Recording Industry Association of America  \nD) Creative Commons"}
{"title": "European Union to reduce carbon emissions by 55% of 1990 levels by 2030", "content": "The European Union (EU) significantly raised its climate ambition on Wednesday, agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, up from the previous target of 40%.  The new goal, part of the EU Climate Law finalized after 14 hours of negotiations, also commits the bloc to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 (compared to the previous 80-95% reduction target).\n\nThe law establishes a 15-member independent body to advise on climate policy and prioritizes investment in carbon sinks.  While MEPs claimed the measures would achieve a 57% net reduction, Barbara Mariani, a senior policy officer for climate and energy, estimated a 52.8% cut in actual emissions.  This discrepancy highlights ongoing debate about the effectiveness of carbon removal methods in achieving the overall target.\n\nThe 2030 target builds upon a September 2020 European Commission (EC) pledge, which promised corresponding legislative proposals by June 2021.  These proposals, reported by the BBC, include limitations on counting CO2 removal towards the target, encouraging genuine emission reductions.  The EC press release emphasized the importance of adopting the new target ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to showcase EU ambition and encourage global action.\n\nThe EU will dedicate at least 30% of its €1.8 trillion long-term budget to climate-related concerns.  However, Poland remains the sole EU member state rejecting the climate neutrality pledge, opting instead for a 30% emission reduction by 2030.  Despite its heavy reliance on coal (80% of its electricity), Poland plans to transition to renewable energy and develop its first nuclear power plant, according to Reuters.\n\nEC President [President's Name] hailed the decision as placing the EU on a \"green path for a generation.\"  This assessment was not universally shared.  Some MEPs expressed disappointment, describing the law as a \"big disappointment\" and arguing that it fell short of their ambitions.  Wendel Trio, Director of [Organization Name], criticized the target as insufficient to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of the century, labeling the law \"rushed\" and inadequate for global leadership on climate change.\n\nThe chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee acknowledged the difficulty in securing stronger wording on the 55% net reduction target from member states.  He nonetheless described the compromise as ambitious, representing a significant acceleration of emission reduction efforts compared to the past decade.\n\nCurrently, the EU is projected to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030 under existing measures.  The EC notes that greenhouse gas emissions fell by a quarter between 1990 and 2019.  The United Kingdom, for comparison, has set a 78% reduction target by 2035.", "question": "What is the new target set by the European Union for net emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels?\n\nA) 40%  \nB) 55%  \nC) 30%  \nD) 78%"}

Speaking at a virtual international tax seminar, Donohoe insisted any agreement must accommodate Ireland's 12.5% rate, which benefits multinational corporations such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, contributing significantly to Irish employment (one in eight jobs).  Corporate tax revenue in Ireland totaled €11.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach €12.5 billion by 2025.\n\nDonohoe argued that Ireland's low tax rate attracts jobs and investment, advocating for \"appropriate and acceptable tax competition\" but rejecting the US-proposed 21% minimum. He emphasized that the 12.5% rate, which he considers within the bounds of healthy competition, stimulates investment, growth, and innovation – key tenets of Ireland's industrial policy.  However, current proposals, according to *The Guardian*, could shrink Ireland's corporate tax base by 20%, reducing tax receipts by €2 billion in 2025, according to the Irish Department of Finance.\n\nBrian Keegan, director of public policy at [Organization name needed], characterized the debate as \"not tax change, it's political change.\"  While OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans expressed optimism about reaching a resolution, citing the US's willingness to address concerns, a spokesperson for the Irish Department of Finance confirmed to CNBC that high-level political discussions haven't yet begun.\n\n*The Guardian* highlighted that many companies in Ireland pay significantly lower effective tax rates than in other countries, citing Apple's reported 0.005% rate in 2014.  A 2016 European Commission ruling ordering Apple to repay €13 billion in back taxes to Ireland was overturned in July due to insufficient evidence of an illegal tax advantage.", "question": "What is Ireland's current corporate tax rate as defended by Finance Minister Donohoe? \n\nA) 21%  \nB) 15%  \nC) 12.5%  \nD) 10%"}

These tariffs, ranging from 9.49% to 60.81%, were imposed in 2012 and 2016 by the Obama administration.  The U.S. justified the high rates using the \"adverse facts available\" (AFA) provision, which allows for significant anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs if accused companies fail to provide sufficient information.\n\nSouth Korea challenged the tariffs in February 2018, arguing the U.S. Commerce Department hadn't adequately specified the required information and had improperly handled the information provided. A WTO panel agreed, finding the U.S. actions inconsistent with WTO guidelines.  The ruling specifically cited the tariffs imposed on Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems (and unnamed others).  However, the panel rejected South Korea's claim that the U.S. had an unwritten policy encouraging the use of AFA to justify higher duties.\n\nThe U.S. can appeal within 60 days, but this is complicated by former President Trump's restrictions on the WTO Appellate Body, leaving it without a quorum.

His sister, Barbara Shutt, informed Wikinews of his passing on Friday.  Dr. Shutt, who edited under the username \"Pi zero,\" was Wikinews's top contributor by edit count and ranked third on English Wikibooks.\n\nAccording to Ms. Shutt, Dr. Shutt experienced breathing difficulties and lost consciousness before paramedics arrived.  Despite a two-hour surgery, he passed away, likely due to blood clots or a series of heart attacks.\n\nDr. Shutt's contributions to Wikinews spanned over 14 years, beginning in September 2008.  He was promoted to administrator in July 2010 and reviewer in August 2009.  His tireless work resulted in over 160,000 edits, 120,000 log entries, and the peer review and publication of over a thousand news articles—his last just a day before his death.  He was also an active administrator and reviewer on English Wikibooks, contributing to numerous projects and creating a mechanism for sorting the project's content.\n\nBeyond his contributions to Wikimedia projects, Dr. Shutt maintained a blog, \"Structural Insight,\" and had a passion for constructed languages (conlangs).  He was an avid reader, particularly enjoying the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, about whom he once remarked:  \"I read *The Hobbit* when I was, I think, a teenager… It's a wonderfully written story --- by a linguist and, in fact, a conlanger… I actually got for Christmas… a year ago, I think, *The Nature of Middle-earth*, which Christopher [Tolkien] says will be the last of his father's books that he publishes.\"\n\nDr. Shutt earned a PhD in [Unspecified Field] from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Massachusetts in 2011. His research focused on abstraction theory, the Kernel programming language (a Lisp-based language he created for his dissertation), recursive adaptive grammars (the core of his master's thesis), and self-modifying code. He received both his master's (1993) and bachelor's degrees from WPI.  He also had a year of postgraduate study at Brown University, an experience he later described as \"traumatic.\"  He was skilled in Lisp programming, enjoyed comic books, and used Emacs as his text editor.\n\nHis work on the Kernel programming language even garnered attention from Michael MacInnis, who mentioned Dr. Shutt's dissertation in a presentation at BSDCan.  Dr. Shutt recalled, \"He wanted to know if it was okay if he mentioned my name…'cause my dissertation had come out as he was putting the design together and Kernel-style fexprs fit wonderfully well with his concept so he used them.\"\n\nDr. Shutt lived in Massachusetts with his cat, Pickles.  He described himself as a \"hyperlexic kid,\" a trait common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nHe is survived by his mother, Elsie Shutt; his sister and niece, Barbara and Hannah Shutt; his brother, David Shutt; and his cat, Pickles.  He would have turned 57 next Friday.

The bill, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature after twice stalling and undergoing amendments to secure necessary votes,  classifies seeking or performing such abortions as a Class 6 felony.  The legislation defines \"genetic abnormality\" as the presence or presumed presence of an abnormal gene expression, but excludes severe fetal abnormalities deemed incompatible with life.  Soliciting or accepting payment for such abortions is a Class 3 felony.\n\nThe bill grants standing to sue to the unborn child's father (or maternal grandparent if the mother is under 18).  Critically, it applies state law to \"an unborn child at every stage of development,\" raising concerns, as expressed by unnamed Senators and Representatives,  that it could open the door to prosecuting individuals for actions resulting in miscarriage.\n\nFurther provisions prohibit the mailing or delivery of abortion-inducing drugs, ban public institutions from performing or assisting in non-life-saving abortions, prevent the use of public funds for research involving fetal remains, and mandate burial or cremation of fetal remains.  The bill also prohibits the use of state funds for organizations providing abortion care.\n\nGovernor Ducey, a vocal opponent of abortion rights, celebrated the bill as a victory for protecting life, asserting Arizona's position as a \"pro-life\" state.  Senator [Senator's Name] echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the protection of those with treatable genetic conditions.

This follows the May 23rd forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, the arrest of opposition journalist Roman Protasevich, and the subsequent EU sanctions against Belarus.\n\nMany European airlines, including Austrian Airlines, are avoiding Belarusian airspace and airports due to the sanctions and a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommendation to avoid the Minsk Flight Information Region (FIR) unless deemed necessary.  This recommendation, issued in a May 25 Safety Information Bulletin, applies to all EASA operators and, for third-country operators, when flying to, from, or within the EU until an international investigation into Protasevich's arrest is complete.\n\nAustrian Airlines cited the EASA recommendation in explaining the cancellation, stating that Russian authorities refused approval for its revised flight path.  Similarly, Air France cancelled a Paris-Moscow flight for a second consecutive day due to Russian rejection of its rerouted flight plan.  The BBC reported at least four Air France flights from Paris to Moscow have been cancelled.  An Austrian Airlines cargo flight from China to Vienna was also grounded for the same reason.\n\nWhile some airlines, including British Airways and possibly others (the text names an unnamed airline), secured approval for modified routes, the Austrian Foreign Ministry deemed Russia's position \"absolutely incomprehensible,\" insisting that flights to and over Russia should proceed without hindrance.

LOT Polish Airlines suspended flights to and from Minsk, Ukraine banned all Belarusian carriers from its airspace, and Singapore Airlines rerouted its flights.

The attack spread through Kaseya's network management software, impacting primarily managed service providers (MSPs) – companies that manage IT services for numerous clients.  This cascading effect, according to security researcher John Hammond of Huntress Labs, potentially affected thousands of small businesses.\n\nKaseya immediately advised customers to shut down its services upon discovering the breach.

{"title": "130 countries at OECD summit agree to back global corporate tax rate", "content": "On Thursday, 130 of the 139 participating countries and jurisdictions reached an agreement at the OECD tax summit to overhaul the international tax system.  This landmark deal establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, representing a two-pillar solution that commits most of the world's economies to a significant restructuring.\n\nThe agreement includes key regional entities like Gibraltar, Hong Kong, and Montserrat, as well as jurisdictions previously identified as tax havens, such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  All G20 countries, except Barbados, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Kenya, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, signed on.  Peru abstained due to its ongoing governmental instability.  The signatories represent over 90% of global GDP.\n\nThe OECD hailed the framework – officially titled the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\" – as the culmination of a decade-long negotiation process, criticizing the existing \"century-old international tax system\" as obsolete.  The plan, supported by U.S. President Joe Biden, builds upon a similar agreement reached on June 5th.  A final implementation plan is expected by October.\n\nThe two-pillar approach comprises:  Pillar One, which will require multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover exceeding €20 billion (potentially revised to €10 billion after a seven-year review) and profitability above 10%, to reallocate taxes on over $100 billion in profits from their home markets to jurisdictions where they generate at least €1 million or €250,000 in revenue, depending on the jurisdiction's GDP.  Pillar Two introduces global anti-Base Erosion Rules, mandating a minimum 15% top-up tax, and a treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule,\" effective in 2023.\n\nThe OECD estimates that both pillars, depending on the final framework, will increase global corporate income tax (CIT) revenues by 1.9% to 3.2% (or $50 to $80 billion). Including the existing U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income, this figure rises to 2.3% to 4% ($56 to $102 billion).  This is intended to combat tax avoidance, which the OECD estimates costs countries $100 to $240 billion annually.  The OECD projects a relatively small, 0.1% of GDP, negative impact on investment and economic activity in the medium to long term.  However, concerns remain regarding potential limitations on governments' use of tax incentives and the costs of compliance.\n\nOpposition stemmed primarily from countries like Hungary and Ireland, which have historically employed lower corporate tax rates to attract investment.  Ireland's headline rate is 12.5%, and Hungary's is 9%, with Ireland facing potential losses exceeding €2 billion over four years.  Estonia also has a lower-than-15% rate in certain circumstances.\n\nOECD Secretary-General [Secretary General's Name] stated that this \"historic package\" ensures large multinational companies pay their fair share, while acknowledging it doesn't eliminate tax competition but sets multilaterally agreed limitations.  President Biden described the deal as bringing the world closer to ending the \"race to the bottom,\" a sentiment echoed by U.S. Treasury Secretary [Treasury Secretary's Name] and French Finance Minister [Finance Minister's Name].  While Irish Finance Minister [Finance Minister's Name] expressed reservations, he committed to the process.

This ward, encompassing towns such as [Town names redacted as they were not provided in the original text], elects three councillors.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n**Plowright:** My top four priorities for the next three years are:\n\n1. **Ethical Governance:** To establish a trustworthy and efficient council committed to due process and accountability.

Collaboration with training providers and state government will be crucial.\n\n**Wikinews:** What environmental protection reforms would you like to see?\n\n**Plowright:**  Environmental protection requires a balance of incentives and regulations.  A key reform needed is to address the short-term funding cycles for environmental projects.  Long-term, sustainable funding mechanisms are crucial for projects that require years, even decades, to achieve their goals.  A comprehensive review of project identification, support, and funding is needed, and the council can play a role in advocating for this.\n\n**Wikinews:** What qualifies you to be a councillor?\n\n**Plowright:** My qualifications are experience, expertise, and energy.

This ward, encompassing towns such as [Town names redacted to protect privacy - please provide these again if you want them included], elects three councillors.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your priorities as a councillor?\n\n**Morgan:** My top priorities are:\n\n1. **Declare a climate emergency** and develop a community-led action plan to reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n2. **Provide quality community services** focusing on health and wellbeing, while supporting small businesses, local arts, and tourism recovery.\n3. **Protect our natural environment.**\n4. **Address gendered violence and all forms of discrimination,** promoting respect and equality for all.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Has the two-year period of administration been too long?\n\n**Morgan:** Two years without a democratically elected council has been far from ideal, as were the operations of the dismissed council.  South Gippsland deserves a fresh start and new leadership.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** The [Name of Town redacted - please provide again if you wish to include it], a major part of the Coastal-Promontory ward, relies heavily on tourism.  How would you support business recovery following COVID-19 and the current lockdown?\n\n**Morgan:** The tourism sector has suffered immensely.  To recover, we need to enhance our offerings. This includes creating more camping spots, developing new attractions, revitalizing our cafes and bars with live music, and showcasing our food and wine.  Protecting [Name of natural area redacted - please provide again if you wish to include it] from ecological decline is also crucial.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What environmental protection reforms do you advocate for?\n\n**Morgan:** I support declaring a climate emergency and implementing a subsequent action plan, similar to successful initiatives in neighboring Bass Coast.  Groups like [Name of organization redacted - please provide again if you wish to include it] have already drafted a plan, and I’m ready to provide the necessary leadership to enact it.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What qualifies you to be a councillor?\n\n**Morgan:** Our council needs to represent all of South Gippsland.  I believe a certain age and wealth bracket has been over-represented for too long.  I live and work in this community, I study politics and philosophy, and I'm committed to representing the people, not vested interests.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there any specific projects you'd like to advocate for?\n\n**Morgan:**  I support initiatives like the [Name of initiative redacted - please provide again if you wish to include it] composter and our 24/7 library.  I'd also advocate for improved accessibility (more footpaths, bike trails, road sealing like Mt Best Road), and the creation of shelter belts and wildlife corridors to reduce animal-vehicle collisions.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How have you connected with voters during lockdown?\n\n**Morgan:** Working as a barista in Foster, I've been able to connect with many residents.  For others, I maintain a daily presence on my Facebook page: @MatMorganGreens.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why run as a Greens candidate?\n\n**Morgan:** I'm endorsed by the Greens and generally support their policies, although there aren't specific local Greens policies.  Their support is invaluable for fundraising and campaigning.

She aims to boost community involvement in addressing climate change, public health, economic, and environmental challenges.

She emphasizes the importance of protecting South Gippsland's natural beauty and improving collaboration between council, landcare groups, and water authorities.  She also calls for a shire-wide approach to road safety and infrastructure planning, advocating for collaboration with government agencies and the private sector.\n\n**On her qualifications:** Cousin's background in urban and regional planning, public administration, and experience in local government across three states, combined with her farming background and knowledge of South Gippsland's economy, equip her for the role.\n\n**On specific projects:** She highlights her four-year volunteer work preserving Mirboo North's native forests and envisions promoting rail trails as a unique tourism experience.\n\n**On outreach during COVID-19 lockdowns:**  Cousin utilized social media and online platforms to connect with voters while maintaining contact with local food producers and customers.

Mr. Pegg, who had announced his resignation in April due to a cancer diagnosis, passed away on June 10th.  Stretton encompasses suburbs in south Brisbane including [List Suburbs].  In the 2020 state election, Pegg secured 56.59% of the first preference vote, significantly ahead of his nearest rival, Peter Zhuang of the Liberal National Party (LNP), who received 30.21%.\n\nSince its creation in 2001, Stretton has been predominantly held by the Labor Party, with the exception of the [Year] state election, which saw a LNP victory amidst a broader LNP win securing 78 of Queensland's 89 seats. Pegg was first elected in 2015, defeating the incumbent LNP member Freya Ostapovitch.\n\nFive candidates are contesting the by-election, including Andrea Wildin of the Australian Greens.

Wikinews interviewed Wildin via email, covering a range of local and statewide issues.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you hope to achieve as Stretton's representative?\n\n**Wildin:** My aim is to amplify the voices of Stretton residents, ensuring politics works for them and everyone has the resources for a good life.  I want to clean up politics, banning corporate donations and developer influence to foster grassroots democracy that truly serves the people.\n\n**Wikinews:** How has the recent by-election impacted your campaign and voter outreach?\n\n**Wildin:** The short timeframe and lockdown presented significant challenges, including navigating new city council regulations for election signage.  The major parties, however, campaigned before the election was officially announced, with the LNP even pre-emptively mailing households about postal voting registration.  This lack of transparency created an uneven playing field, favoring established parties.  Regarding COVID-19 safety, voting can be conducted safely, and democratic participation remains crucial.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are the key local issues you want to address in Stretton?\n\n**Wildin:** Stretton's high multiculturalism requires culturally appropriate services. We need fully funded, inclusive healthcare and education, improved (and free) public transport, and lower electricity costs through renewable energy.  Other pressing issues include domestic violence, housing affordability, and rental shortages. However, the current priority is COVID-19 and the vaccine rollout.  I propose establishing more local, bulk-billed, multilingual health hubs to address vaccine hesitancy and support local businesses impacted by lockdowns.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your views on the recently passed voluntary assisted dying legislation?\n\n**Wildin:**  My 20 years in healthcare have given me insight into end-of-life decisions.  While I recognize the legislation's potential benefits in empowering individuals to control their end-of-life choices, I also understand the concerns of those who oppose it, including on religious grounds.  I believe that legislation should be based on science, human rights, and personal autonomy, separate from religious considerations.  Therefore, I support this legislation.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the Premier's trip to the Tokyo Olympics to support Brisbane's 2032 bid?\n\n**Wildin:**  Community feedback suggests widespread dissatisfaction with the Premier's trip, especially given the ongoing separation of many families from overseas loved ones.  This perceived double standard, where the elite can travel freely while ordinary citizens face restrictions, fuels resentment.  While the 2032 Olympics may present opportunities, we must learn from past events like the [mention specific event], where predicted economic benefits failed to materialize and local residents faced significant disruption.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What is your opinion on the mandatory business check-in app, Check In Queensland?\n\n**Wildin:** As a public health professional, I understand the importance of contact tracing. However, community concerns regarding privacy invasion are valid.  Regulations on data usage need strengthening to prevent past incidents like police data access.  The community needs reassurance about data security and third-party usage, which is currently lacking.\n\n**Wikinews:** What did you learn from your previous election campaign?\n\n**Wildin:** I learned to act with integrity, uphold my values, and prioritize representing my community to improve their lives.  I also learned that not all politicians share the same motivations.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did you join the Greens?\n\n**Wildin:** The Greens' values—social justice, grassroots democracy, peace, non-violence, and ecological sustainability—align with my own.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews candidate for Cleveland mayor Arthur Kostendt", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Cleveland Mayoral Candidate Arthur O'Kostendt\n\nArthur Oliver \"O'Kostendt\" Kostendt, a 29-year-old Republican candidate in the Cleveland, Ohio mayoral race (November 2, 2021), recently spoke with Wikinews about his campaign and policy proposals.  While a May 5th poll by [Pollster Name Redacted] showed him trailing frontrunners Dennis Kucinich and Basheer Jones (with a significant percentage of undecided voters), incumbent Mayor Frank Jackson's May 6th retirement announcement opened the field.  Kostendt describes his campaign as \"casual,\" contrasting it with what he views as the entrenched \"in-crowd\" of Cleveland politics.\n\n**Background and Military Service:**\n\nKostendt, raised in the Cleveland suburbs, is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame (Finance) and Cleveland State University's Cleveland-Marshall College of Law (Summa Cum Laude).  He served as an officer in the Ohio Army National Guard from 2013-2020, deploying to Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE with the 1st Battalion, 145th Armored Regiment.  His military experience includes roles as a scout platoon leader and battalion logistics officer.  He lists numerous military awards and decorations, including [List Redacted for Brevity].  Kostendt currently practices law and works part-time dealing blackjack.\n\n**Reasons for Running:**\n\nKostendt states his motivation is a desire to improve Cleveland's leadership and service provision. He cites issues such as rampant crime, blight, neglected infrastructure, ineffective schools, and governmental waste as key problems necessitating his candidacy.  He positions himself as a \"leader, not a politician,\" committed to \"service above self,\" drawing on his military leadership experience and religious beliefs.\n\n**Policy Positions:**\n\nKostendt’s campaign focuses on several key areas:\n\n* **Public Safety:**  Reforming and empowering the Cleveland Division of Police.\n* **Education:** Demanding accountability and improvements in the city's public schools.\n* **Infrastructure:**  Addressing litter, graffiti, and abandoned structures through community engagement and contractor collaboration.\n* **Governmental Efficiency:** Holding city departments accountable and eliminating waste.  He specifically criticizes the Mayor's large staff and slow response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.\n* **Economic Development:**  Attracting investment and reversing population decline by improving safety, schools, and services to make Cleveland a more desirable place to live and work.  He downplays the impact of climate change on the city, arguing that Cleveland’s cold climate is a larger impediment to growth than potential warming.\n\n**Responses to Specific Questions:**\n\n* **Addressing Poverty:** Kostendt emphasizes investment in communities, schools, and safety as a means of fostering economic self-sufficiency.\n* **COVID-19 Response:** He stresses the importance of individual health choices, such as healthy eating and exercise.\n* **Support for Racial and Ethnic Minorities:** He believes providing essential city services equitably will benefit all Clevelanders, particularly those who have disproportionately felt the impact of ineffective governance.\n* **Endorsements:**  He reluctantly supported Mayor Frank Jackson in 2017, Governor Mike DeWine in 2018, and Jo Jorgensen and Michelle Tidball in the 2020 presidential election.  If unable to vote for himself, he’d consider Justin Bibb, with honorable mentions to Landry Simmons, Zack Reed, and Ross DiBello.\n\n**Challenges and Future Vision:**\n\nKostendt acknowledges the learning curve associated with entering city government. He highlights the successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout as a model for future initiatives. However, he declined to provide a specific vision for Cleveland in 2025 under his leadership.  He cites Jesus Christ as the historical figure he most admires.\n\n\n**[External links section to be added here, including link provided by Kostendt regarding city government waste]**\n\n\n**Note:**  Some answers were edited for brevity and clarity.

The album, originally released in December, saw its vinyl edition finally drop on May 28th (though pre-orders were available since its initial release).\n\nIn the week ending June 3rd, *Evermore* sold 192,000 copies, setting a new record for the biggest sales week of the year. Billboard attributes this dramatic return to the number one position to a combination of factors: record-breaking vinyl sales (102,000 copies), sales of Swift-signed CDs, and deep discounts on the digital album.  The Billboard 200 chart ranks albums based on a combination of sales and streaming data.\n\n*Evermore*'s jump from number 74 to number 1 marks the biggest leap to the top spot since Radiohead's [Album Title Needed].

By week's end, vinyl sales reached 102,000 copies.\n\nThe delayed vinyl release is attributed to the lengthy production time required for vinyl records.  Given *Evermore*'s surprise release announcement just a day before its initial drop, there likely wasn't sufficient time to complete production of physical copies, including vinyl.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Professor Gigi Foster about pandemic control in Australia", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Professor Gigi Foster on Australia's COVID-19 Pandemic Response\n\nOn July 22, Wikinews interviewed Professor Gigi Foster of the School of Economics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia.  The interview focused on the Australian government's COVID-19 pandemic control measures, implemented in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic in 2020.\n\nProfessor Foster, who also serves as Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School of Economics at UNSW, is a vocal critic of the lockdowns implemented across Australia.  She previously published an op-ed in the *Sydney Morning Herald* arguing against these measures, which included restrictions on gatherings, business closures or capacity limits (e.g., gyms), travel limitations, and stay-at-home orders with exemptions only for essential reasons.  In New South Wales, these restrictions were enacted as Public Health Orders under Section 7 of the [Unspecified Act, 2010], signed by the then-Minister for Health and Medical Research, Brad Hazzard.\n\nThe interview took place during a COVID-19 outbreak in New South Wales, which had led to increased restrictions since June 26. At the time of the interview, residents were permitted outdoors only for essential shopping, medical care, and exercise, in groups of two unless from the same household.  These restrictions were later extended to the end of August.\n\nThis outbreak, caused by the Delta variant, was traced back to a driver transporting international flight crews, as reported on June 16.  On June 24, the driver stated he believed he contracted the virus from a local cafe patron who appeared unwell.  The government, aiming to allow citizens to live \"as safely and freely as possible,\" restricted movement in high-risk areas of southwestern Sydney to essential workers until July 30.  Construction work was temporarily halted and later resumed with mandatory regular COVID-19 testing for workers.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you describe your current roles in Australian society?\n\n**Professor Foster:** I'm a professor, Director of Education, and Deputy Head of the School of Economics at UNSW Sydney.  I've been at UNSW since 2009, and I also engage extensively with the community and media on economic policy issues. I co-founded the Consortium for Inclusive Economics Education within the UNSW Business School.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Regarding Joel Carrett's recent article [citation needed],  is \"living with the virus\" worse than aiming for zero cases?\n\n**Professor Foster:**  \"Living with the virus\" is unavoidable due to its spread to animals (e.g., mink, domestic pets).  Elimination, while seemingly Australia's preferred strategy, is unrealistic.  The mortality rate for young people is comparable to seasonal flu, and treatments like ivermectin and vaccines, along with optimal deployment strategies, significantly reduce risks even for vulnerable populations.  Focusing solely on COVID-19 ignores other factors impacting human life and well-being.  The Delta variant also appears less lethal than previous strains, further challenging the current media narrative.  Complete isolation from the rest of the world is economically and socially unsustainable.\n\n**Wikinews:** What would your ideal COVID-19 response be?\n\n**Professor Foster:**  (1) Make vaccines available to vulnerable groups; (2) shift the message to emphasize effective management of the virus and encourage a return to normal life; (3) procure and test ivermectin and other potential treatments; (4) reopen borders and pledge no future domestic lockdowns.  Additionally, we need institutional reforms to prevent similar situations in the future, as detailed in my upcoming book, *The Great Covid Panic*.  The current vaccine messaging has been manipulative and coercive; vaccination decisions should be between the patient and their doctor, not politicians or employers.  Vaccinating healthy young people may be more harmful than the risk of infection.\n\n**Wikinews:** When will your book be released?\n\n**Professor Foster:** In approximately two months.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your *Sydney Morning Herald* piece cites research showing that Australia, New Zealand, and Malta saw a decline in excess deaths, all being island nations.  Why is this?\n\n**Professor Foster:**  COVID-19 deaths in these island nations were minimal, not significantly impacting excess death rates. The initial decline was likely due to reduced car accidents, fewer elective surgeries, and less accidental death due to reduced social interaction, not COVID-19 prevention measures.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Were travel restrictions like the 10km radius limit effective?\n\n**Professor Foster:**  From a human well-being perspective, they were nonsensical. The arbitrary 10km radius is meaningless.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How effective were measures like gathering limits, venue closures, social distancing, and mask mandates?\n\n**Professor Foster:** These measures reflect a focus on control rather than data-driven decision-making.  Targeted protection of vulnerable populations through social distancing and hygiene is sufficient; blanket restrictions on healthy individuals are unwarranted.\n\n**Wikinews:** What about contact tracing and self-isolation requirements?\n\n**Professor Foster:**  General contact tracing is likely cost-ineffective.  Targeted approaches in high-risk settings (e.g., aged care) are more appropriate.\n\n**Wikinews:**  How do you respond to the argument that contact tracing, as in the example of \"Jane at the bar,\" is helpful?\n\n**Professor Foster:** If individuals are informed of the risks (low for healthy young adults), the government shouldn't interfere with their choices.  Infection in healthy young people can build natural immunity.\n\n**Wikinews:** How can the current restrictions be challenged?\n\n**Professor Foster:** Individuals and businesses must actively resist these policies.  The high costs to mental health, the economy, and social well-being far outweigh the negligible benefits for the majority of the population.  We must actively resist poor governance.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Anything to add?\n\n**Professor Foster:** If Australians don't resist now, the rest of the world will move on, and we'll eventually demand the same freedoms.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the \"Freedom Day\" petition? [link provided]\n\n**Professor Foster:** It seems sensible to me. The framing might be improved, but the core message is sound.  The underlying assumption that freedoms must be earned through vaccination is a dangerous and misguided narrative. We shouldn't have to earn our freedoms; they are inherent rights.  The notion of the government deciding vaccination for us is concerning.\n\n\n**(End of interview)**", "question": "What is Professor Gigi Foster's position at the University of New South Wales? \n\nA) Minister for Health and Medical Research  \nB) Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School of Economics  \nC) Head of the Department of Public Health  \nD) Chief Economist of Australia"}

{"title": "Wikinews interviews candidate for New York City mayor Vitaly Filipchenko", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Independent New York City Mayoral Candidate Vitaly Filipchenko\n\nIn early May, Wikinews interviewed Vitaly Filipchenko, an independent candidate in the New York City mayoral election, scheduled for November 2nd.  Filipchenko, who identifies as the first Russian-born candidate for the office, answered questions about his platform and campaign in a phone interview.\n\nFilipchenko, registered as Vitaly A. Filipchenko, was born in Tomsk, Siberia, in 1973, according to the [News Agency Name – please insert name]. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen, a road construction and maintenance professional, and owner of a moving services company.  His campaign website states, \"[M]y English may not be perfect – but my platform is.\"\n\nIncumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won re-election in 2017 with 66.5% of the vote, is term-limited. As of April 28th, 22 candidates were vying for the office, a majority of whom are Democrats.  A May 23-24th poll by [Pollster 1 Name] and [Pollster 2 Name] of 12 Democratic candidates showed [Candidate A Name], former commissioner for [Department Name], and [Candidate B Name], Borough President of [Borough Name], leading with 21.1% and 20.1% respectively (margin of error: 3.2%).\n\n**Wikinews:** Please introduce yourself and your background.\n\n**Filipchenko:** My name is Vitaly Filipchenko, and I'm an independent candidate for Mayor of New York City.\n\n**Wikinews:** What was it like growing up in the Soviet Union?\n\n**Filipchenko:** It was interesting.  It was like giving a child the stock market – providing limited information and letting them figure it out.\n\n**Wikinews:** What motivated your mayoral candidacy?\n\n**Filipchenko:** I haven't seen an honest mayor yet. I've witnessed the marginalization of immigrants due to the influence of big money in politics – from both Democrats and Republicans.  Politicians are focused on money, not on the real problems of the people. It's a money machine for their personal gain.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You're reportedly the first Russian-born mayoral candidate.  Will this help you with the city's immigrant population?\n\n**Filipchenko:** Not really. Many are afraid, disillusioned with the political system, and distrustful of politicians regardless of their background.  Many talk about democracy but don't vote or participate.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why should New Yorkers vote for you?\n\n**Filipchenko:** Because I'm a self-made businessman who came from nothing.  I represent hardworking people from all backgrounds. I'm not beholden to corporations or special interests; I'm a regular guy fighting for honest democracy.  Other candidates represent the wealthy 1%, who are insulated from the problems faced by everyday New Yorkers, particularly small business owners and essential workers who struggled during the pandemic. They don't understand the struggles of office workers working from home and earning six-figure salaries, or the plight of small business owners like myself whose businesses were devastated by shutdowns. I understand these issues because I live them.\n\n**Wikinews:** You criticized New York's infrastructure to Sputnik News, citing the disparity between New York's massive budget and the quality of its roads compared to states like Florida and Georgia. Can you elaborate?\n\n**Filipchenko:** As a civil engineer, I've seen firsthand the mismanagement of New York's infrastructure budget.  Florida, with a $4 billion budget, has far better roads than New York, which has a $190 billion budget.  There's clear evidence of corruption – roads are repaired repeatedly within a short time, indicating shoddy workmanship and budget manipulation.  For instance, a 2019 Brooklyn expressway project saw a ramp rebuilt due to an eight-inch misalignment, showcasing wasteful spending and incompetence. This isn't an isolated incident; poor roadwork is widespread.  Polly Trottenberg, the former DOT commissioner, whose tenure was marked by substandard road repairs, was later appointed to a high position in Washington D.C., raising questions about accountability and potential corruption.  The same applies to the eight years under the current administration:  horrible roads across all boroughs.  The contracts awarded for road repairs appear to favor unqualified companies lacking experience.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website states, \"I do not want to defund – but retrain.\"  Explain your position on police reform.\n\n**Filipchenko:**  The term \"hate crime\" is often misused to obscure the reality of racist crimes.  Many attacks against Asian Americans are perpetrated by people of other ethnicities, yet labelled simply as \"hate crimes.\" This requires a more specific and accurate description of the problem.  To address this, we need more, better-trained police officers.  Defunding the police without simultaneously improving security is counterproductive. We need to retrain officers, ensuring only qualified and physically fit individuals serve.  Many New York City police officers are overweight and lack the physical preparedness for the job, resorting to lethal force out of fear.  States like Vermont, Virginia, and Georgia require physical exams for officers every six months – a standard New York should adopt.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you \"support small businesses with rent law changes\"?\n\n**Filipchenko:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city could have contracted with small restaurants to provide meals to the homeless and low-income individuals.  This would have provided much-needed support to both struggling businesses and those facing food insecurity. This kind of initiative would alleviate some of the effects of the pandemic.  The current approach represents complete mismanagement.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you \"build back a greener, fairer city\"?\n\n**Filipchenko:** New York City is a concrete jungle.  Poorly planned bike and bus lanes, painted with toxic materials, have created traffic congestion and increased air pollution.  The city's current approach to green initiatives is short-sighted and wasteful, exemplified by the $1.2 billion allocated for renovations to Central Park, which is already functional.  Instead of focusing on existing parks in Manhattan, funds should be redirected to areas like the Bronx and Queens which desperately need more green spaces.  Many projects are designed to increase value for high-income landlords rather than truly benefitting the community.  For example, the construction of additional train stations and unnecessary upgrades to the existing infrastructure, where investment could be channeled into more affordable housing.  We need strategic planning, learning from examples in other countries like Norway, Britain, China, Japan and South Korea. For instance, creating elevated pedestrian walkways above streets to serve as green spaces, allowing safe passage across roads.\n\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why run as an independent?\n\n**Filipchenko:** Democrats and Republicans claim to represent the people but are primarily driven by money.  Candidates with existing wealth and power, who can easily afford to run, don't truly understand the struggles of everyday New Yorkers. I'm running to give a voice to those who are marginalized and overlooked.\n\n**Wikinews:** What has Bill de Blasio failed to do?\n\n**Filipchenko:** His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was disastrous.  Offering free bus rides instead of implementing social distancing measures and prioritizing essential workers resulted in the increased spread of the virus.  The lack of sufficient PPE and clear guidance on its use further exacerbated the crisis. Other countries took steps like disinfecting streets and implementing temperature checks to prevent transmission—measures that were absent in New York City.\n\n**Wikinews:** Who did you support in the 2017 mayoral election?\n\n**Filipchenko:** I supported Bill de Blasio, but quickly realized my mistake.\n\n**Wikinews:** And the 2018 gubernatorial election?  The 2020 presidential election?  The 2012 Russian presidential election?\n\n**Filipchenko:** I did not vote in the gubernatorial election.  I will not disclose my vote in the 2020 presidential election or the 2012 Russian presidential election to protect my family still residing in Russia.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you address the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on New York City?\n\n**Filipchenko:**  The lack of clear and consistent information on how to use PPE was a major failure.  We need better public education campaigns, explaining how viruses spread and providing clear instructions on preventative measures.  Street sanitization, which many other countries implemented, was absent in NYC, resulting in greater transmission.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you support racial and ethnic minorities?\n\n**Filipchenko:** By creating more job opportunities and providing access to retraining programs.  We need to invest in community gardens and agricultural education programs to provide access to fresh, organic food and skills.  This fosters cooperation within communities and empowers people struggling to find work, regardless of their background or age.  Many older immigrants face significant challenges finding employment due to language barriers and ageism.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  How would you tackle homelessness, considering the disproportionate impact on Black and Hispanic communities?\n\n**Filipchenko:**  The homelessness crisis stems primarily from job losses.  We need to create more jobs within the city, offering opportunities for retraining and skill development.  My plan to construct new housing using local workers will create employment, improving residents' economic stability and access to healthcare.  Instead of promising free college tuition, I guarantee job opportunities through city-created jobs.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you handle vaccine rollout?\n\n**Filipchenko:**  We need effective public education campaigns explaining how vaccines work and addressing public concerns.  This includes creating educational programs and jobs to implement these programs and provide accurate information within the community, combating misinformation.\n\n**Wikinews:** If you couldn't vote for yourself, who would you vote for?\n\n**Filipchenko:** Someone who understands the struggles of everyday New Yorkers, especially immigrants and small business owners, and who wouldn't be comfortable in their own life without the struggles of regular people.  Someone like me who has only one chance.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why might people not vote for you?\n\n**Filipchenko:** My accent might alienate some voters, and there's still a lot of racism and arrogance in New York.  Some voters feel they've already made their choice, ignoring the importance of giving all candidates a fair chance in a democratic process.\n\n**Wikinews:** Which historical figure do you identify with?\n\n**Filipchenko:** Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Any final thoughts?\n\n**Filipchenko:**  I'm a regular New Yorker seeking to make a difference.  I'm seeking volunteers to help with my campaign. You can find more information on my website, vitalyformayor.com.  With the power of our votes, we can make a difference.  I urge you to visit my website.\n\n\nThis revised version significantly improves clarity, grammar, and flow while maintaining the essence of Filipchenko's responses.  It also uses more formal language and incorporates better structuring and transitions between questions and answers.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Victor Kline, leader of newly registered The New Liberals party in Australia", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Victor Kline, Leader of Australia's Newly Registered New Liberals Party\n\nOn June 3, The New Liberals party was officially registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), clearing the way for them to nominate candidates in federal elections.  While the party has existed for over a year—member Karen Porter ran as an independent candidate in a previous election—their registration application was submitted on December 16.\n\nThe party's registration faced legal hurdles.  Their use of the term \"Liberal,\" shared with Australia's governing Liberal Party, prompted a challenge. The Liberal Party argued the New Liberals were engaging in a \"cynical attempt to piggyback\" on their name, citing a Crosby Textor survey of over 2000 voters suggesting a perceived connection between the two parties.  However, the AEC ultimately ruled that the New Liberals' name was \"sufficiently visually and aurally distinct\" from the Liberal Party's, allowing registration.\n\nWikinews interviewed New Liberals leader Victor Kline via email about the party's plans, policies, and values.\n\n**Wikinews:** One of your party's key slogans is \"economically responsible and socially progressive.\"  Could you elaborate?\n\n**Kline:**  \"Economically responsible\" means using economics to benefit society, not treating it as an unassailable entity.  Our economic policies aim to lift the three million Australians living below the poverty line, creating employment and stimulating both small and large businesses. \"Socially progressive\" complements this by striving for a just and equitable society where everyone has equal opportunity and purpose.  This social progressiveness is underpinned by our economic responsibility.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why the name \"New Liberals,\" given the existing Liberal Party?\n\n**Kline:** The current Liberal Party has abandoned liberal principles and become an ultra-conservative party.  We are, in fact, suing them in the courts for misrepresentation and fraud over their continued use of the term \"Liberal.\"  If successful, we aim to have them deregistered. We believe we represent true liberalism—as understood globally for two centuries—emphasizing equality of opportunity, compassion, justice, and individual freedom, while acknowledging the role of government in ensuring that freedoms don't infringe on others.\n\n**Wikinews:**  The recent case of a family, including four-year-old Tharnicaa, held in immigration detention has sparked debate.  What are your thoughts on this and immigration law more broadly?\n\n**Kline:** The treatment of refugees and asylum seekers over the past 30 years has been a national disgrace, comparable to slavery in historical perspective.  We plan to overhaul the system, starting with the abolition of mandatory detention for asylum seekers.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did you join the New Liberals?\n\n**Kline:** I was a founding member. We formed the party because the major parties had shifted so far right that the majority of Australians lacked representation, and our civil liberties were so threatened that our democracy was at risk of becoming authoritarian.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your website mentions 17 candidates for the upcoming federal election. How were they selected?\n\n**Kline:** We have more candidates than are currently listed on the website.  We sought intelligent, compassionate individuals with a strong moral compass and real-world experience—unlike the 80% of the current political class who lack experience outside politics or unions.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you assess the federal government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n**Kline:**  The federal government's approach risked massive loss of life through an \"open borders, open business\" policy similar to the U.S.A.  We were saved by the actions of state governments.\n\n**Wikinews:** What underreported issue would the New Liberals address?\n\n**Kline:**  The lack of media attention on widespread federal-level corruption. We will establish a powerful Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) with the authority to investigate and prosecute corrupt politicians, judges, and bureaucrats, and a dedicated court to try and sentence them.\n\n**Wikinews:** How do the New Liberals differentiate themselves from other parties?\n\n**Kline:**  Our economic policies are key. Our Job Guarantee Scheme will ensure employment for all Australians at a fair wage, providing training where necessary.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your party values \"promoting Australia's environmental health by acknowledging that care for the environment and good business practice are complementary.\" Could you elaborate?\n\n**Kline:** Government investment in renewable energy is a prime example—beneficial for both the environment and the economy.\n\n**Wikinews:**  How would you describe your leadership style?\n\n**Kline:**  Truthfulness, regardless of the consequences, and answering questions directly.  I believe this inspires confidence.  I also aim to courageously call out wrongdoing, name those responsible, and admit my own mistakes.", "question": "What was the primary reason for the formation of the New Liberals party, according to Victor Kline? \n\nA) To support the governing Liberal Party   \nB) To represent the majority of people and protect civil liberties  \nC) To align with right-wing policies  \nD) To endorse open borders immigration"}

{"title": "Technological University Dublin senior lecturer Dr Lorcan Sirr speaks to Wikinews on housing market in Ireland", "content": "## Technological University Dublin Senior Lecturer Dr. Lorcan Sirr on Ireland's Housing Crisis\n\nWikinews correspondent J.J. Liu interviewed Dr. Lorcan Sirr, a senior lecturer at Technological University Dublin's (TUD) School of Surveying & Construction Management, on Friday.  The discussion focused on Ireland's housing shortage, its European parallels, and the government and private sector actions contributing to rising rents and home prices.\n\nDr. Sirr, a chartered planning and development surveyor and assessor for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), frequently contributes commentary to Irish media outlets, including RTÉ and various publications.  His TUD profile indicates he's a fellow of the RICS and a former external examiner for the University of Reading.  Before TUD's 2019 merger, he lectured and headed research at the Dublin Institute of Technology's Faculty of the Built Environment.  He holds an MSc in Estate Management from the University of Reading, UK, and MAs in Urban Design and Town Planning from University College Dublin. He also has a second Master's in Literature from KU Leuven, Belgium, and is fluent in Dutch.\n\nDespite Ireland's increased wealth, housing costs continue to climb.  A Q1 Daft.ie report showed average monthly rent at €1443.  Dr. Sirr attributes this primarily to two factors:\n\n**1.  Over-reliance on the Private Rental Sector for Social Housing:** The government's increasing use of private rentals for social housing significantly increases demand, constrains supply, and drives up rents.  Reducing this practice would free up rental supply.\n\n**2.  Annual Rent Increases:** The government's 4% annual rent increase cap, introduced four years ago, quickly became the standard increase, leading to substantial rent hikes over time.\n\nRegarding proposed rent freezes, Dr. Sirr notes that while beneficial to tenants, such measures could discourage landlords, potentially reducing overall supply. He also cites the 1982 Blake v. Attorney General case, which established that rent freezes might be unconstitutional.  However, he points out that a new law linking rent increases to inflation came into effect on the day of the interview.\n\nConcerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on construction and the second-hand market, Dr. Sirr highlights the surprising resilience of the construction industry.  While expecting reduced output, Ireland built approximately 20,000 houses in 2020, almost matching 2019's figure. He believes the market's self-regulating nature will likely limit annual construction to around 20-24,000 units to avoid oversupply and price drops.\n\nRegarding rising property prices (4.5% year-on-year to April, according to the CSO), Dr. Sirr notes that significant increases in areas like the border counties are from a low base.  He attributes some price rises outside Dublin to the pandemic's impact on remote work, causing people to relocate to less expensive areas. However, he questions the long-term sustainability of this trend.\n\nDr. Sirr criticizes the government's \"Rebuilding Ireland\" initiative (2016-2023), deeming it a failure that prioritized quantity over quality and lacked adequate infrastructure planning.  He anticipates the new \"Housing for All\" strategy will similarly struggle if it remains overly focused on numerical targets without addressing the market's limitations and the need for greater state control over housing delivery.\n\nHe suggests the government should focus on:\n\n* **Utilizing Existing Resources:** Addressing Ireland's high rates of vacant and derelict housing, possibly through grants and loan programs to incentivize refurbishment.  Implementing a meaningful property tax on vacant properties is also crucial.\n* **Decentralizing Housing Provision:** Returning housing delivery responsibilities to local authorities to increase responsiveness and accountability.\n\nDr. Sirr expresses concerns about the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which he believes further centralizes land control, potentially hindering local initiatives.  He advocates for increased state-led construction, minimizing reliance on profit-driven private developers to ensure genuine affordability.  He holds a similar view on the Residential Tenancies Act 2021, acknowledging its improvement over previous rent increase limitations while suggesting an inflation-linked increase with a cap would be more effective.\n\nHis 2016 *Sunday Times* article highlighting the need for a better evidential basis for housing policy points to the lack of accurate data on housing construction, vacancy rates, and the significant number of derelict properties.  He emphasizes the need for strategies to repurpose these obsolete properties, noting Ireland's obsolescence rate is four times the international average. He suggests incentives and grant programs as more effective strategies than punitive measures for addressing derelict buildings.\n\nDr. Sirr's 2016 *Sunday Times* criticism of \"crowd-pleasing, anti-urban policies\" reflects Ireland's historical bias towards rural interests, hindering the development of robust urban planning and infrastructure. He proposes empowering directly elected lord mayors with greater authority over urban development as a potential solution.\n\nRegarding the impact of the 10% stamp duty rate on 'cuckoo funds,' Dr. Sirr believes it's largely ineffective, as these funds profit from renting to the state and will continue to do so as long as the government continues its reliance on renting rather than building social housing.\n\nOn the large presence of international investment companies, Dr. Sirr expresses concern about their potential to crowd out small landlords and limit competition, advocating for their exclusion from the residential market, as seen in some other European countries.\n\nFinally, Dr. Sirr concludes that a truly \"stable\" housing market is an unrealistic ideal given the many dynamic social, economic, and political factors involved.  He contrasts Ireland's asset-based approach to housing with systems where housing is primarily viewed as shelter, leading to more stable markets.  He highlights Vienna and Copenhagen as examples of cities with more successful housing models and suggests that Ireland needs a broader, more socially equitable approach that moves beyond solely economic considerations.", "question": "What was one of the main drivers of rising rents in the Irish housing market according to Dr. Lorcan Sirr?  \n\nA) Increased housing quality  \nB) Government's use of the rental sector for social housing  \nC) Decreased construction activities  \nD) Higher wages for construction workers"}

{"title": "'Each makes the other more difficult to recover from': University of Sussex professor L. Alan Winters speaks to Wikinews on trade, COVID-19, Brexit", "content": "## Each Makes the Other More Difficult to Recover From: Professor L. Alan Winters on Brexit, COVID-19, and UK Trade Policy\n\nIn an interview with Wikinews earlier this month, Professor L. Alan Winters, Professor of Economics at the University of Sussex and Founding Director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO), discussed the UK's post-Brexit trade policy.  His analysis draws heavily on his extensive research, including the UKTPO reports \"COVID-19 will reinforce the Brexit shock,\" \"The Costs of Brexit,\" and \"Taking stock of the new UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: governance, state subsidies and the level playing field.\"\n\nProfessor Winters' career includes over 15 years as Chief Economist at the [Name of Organization Redacted], Director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank, CEO of the Migrating Out of Poverty Research Programme Consortium, and advisor to numerous international organizations, including the OECD, the [Name of Organization Redacted], the European Commission, the European Parliament, the [Name of Organization Redacted], the World Trade Organization, and the [Name of Organization Redacted]. He was appointed Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (CB) in 2012.\n\n**Wikinews:** In your December 2020 report, \"The Costs of Brexit,\" you argued that leaving the EU \"increases UK-EU costs, reduces trade between them, and requires resources for form-filling, queuing,\" concluding that \"Brexit will be costly for UK society\" regardless of the trade agreement.  Do you believe the government erred in negotiating the Christmas agreement with the EU, or was Brexit itself the mistake?\n\n**Professor Winters:** I opposed Brexit and continue to believe it was poor economic policy. While some sovereignty has been regained, its practical application remains unclear.  Overall, I remain unconvinced by the decision, but it's now a fait accompli.  The resulting trade agreement is weaker than a closer relationship with the EU would have provided, leading to higher trade costs and reduced trade volume.\n\n**Wikinews:** Your May 2020 article predicted that disrupted UK-EU negotiations and increased COVID-19 disruption would \"reinforce the Brexit shock.\"  Does this assessment hold true a year later?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Securing a trade agreement, which was uncertain in May 2020, mitigated one aspect.  However, the rushed process resulted in a suboptimal agreement.  The impact on government debt is still unclear, as disentangling Brexit and COVID-19 shocks is complex.  However, Brexit will undoubtedly negatively impact UK public finances, particularly due to reduced activity in the financial services sector.  The additional debt incurred further constrains economic policy, highlighting the reinforcing nature of these two shocks.\n\n**Wikinews:** How can we differentiate between Brexit and COVID-19 shocks?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Economists are working on this, but data is limited. Brexit primarily affects UK-EU trade, while COVID-19's effects are broader.  Analyzing differences in trade with the EU versus the rest of the world helps identify Brexit's impact.  Certain sectors, like processed food, fishing, and some services (e.g., the music industry), are disproportionately affected by Brexit but not necessarily by COVID-19.  The long-term effects of Brexit on these sectors will become clearer once the immediate impacts of COVID-19 subside.  Crucially, the difficulty in regaining lost export markets due to either shock exacerbates the negative consequences of the other.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Some argue the UK can compensate for reduced EU trade through increased trade with the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Is this plausible?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  This is completely implausible. The EU accounts for roughly half of UK trade.  It's a large, affluent, and geographically proximate market with which the UK had closely aligned standards.  Other markets are geographically distant, and existing trade agreements are far less comprehensive, leading to continued customs formalities, standards issues, and regulatory hurdles.\n\n**Wikinews:** The post-Brexit fishing agreement grants the UK 25% of EU fishing rights until 2026, but subjects it to some EU rules. What are your thoughts?\n\n**Professor Winters:** The EU’s influence operates in two ways: cooperative fisheries management and the fact that much UK-caught fish is sold in the EU subject to EU regulations.  The agreement’s complexity involves quota transfers, and proving that UK fish meets EU standards as a third country is costly. While the UK has gained additional quotas, challenging these could jeopardize fish exports to the EU.\n\n**Wikinews:** The government announced new trade deals worth £218 billion.  The Trade Secretary attributed this to \"newfound sovereignty,\" claiming it would aid economic recovery.  However, many of these were rollovers of existing EU agreements. What's your assessment?\n\n**Professor Winters:** The £218 billion figure represents the value of trade affected, not the increased income generated.  Almost all of this comes from rolled-over EU agreements, which, while slightly less favorable than the previous arrangements, were essentially maintained.  The only genuinely new agreement is with Australia, and its predicted impact on GDP is minimal.  The government's statement is a misrepresentation of the situation.\n\n**Wikinews:** Post-Brexit checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have angered businesses.  The EU claims Brexit caused the complications. What’s your perspective?\n\n**Professor Winters:** Both are partly true. Brexit necessitated the Northern Ireland Protocol.  However, a different Brexit approach, like the one pursued by Theresa May, could have avoided this issue by maintaining closer alignment with EU regulations.  The current protocol is a direct consequence of Boris Johnson's decision to deviate from that approach.\n\n**Wikinews:** How will the predicted post-lockdown surge in consumer spending impact UK imports, and trade talks?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Increased income generally leads to increased imports.  COVID-19's impact on trade talks is less direct, though decreased import demand could reduce the urgency for new agreements.\n\n**Wikinews:** The Brexit minister claimed UK-EU freight volumes returned to normal in February. Do you agree?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Available data suggests trade hasn't fully recovered to pre-2020 levels.  January and February’s lower trade volumes were expected due to pre-transition stockpiling.  However, current freight volumes may not accurately reflect trade value as many containers are empty.  Brexit has created logistical challenges and reduced trade efficiency.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What impact will UK CPTPP membership have?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  The impact will be limited. Many CPTPP members already have trade agreements with the UK.  The agreement offers few genuinely new trade opportunities. The anticipated boost to UK GDP is minimal, making the government's claims of \"enormous opportunities\" inaccurate.\n\n**Wikinews:** What trade-related issues should the Prime Minister raise at the G7 summit?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  The Prime Minister should prioritize repairing the multilateral trading system, specifically by advocating for the restoration of the WTO's dispute settlement process and facilitating plurilateral agreements within the WTO to overcome the current consensus-based deadlock.  This would involve encouraging cooperation, rather than confrontation, with countries such as China.\n\n**Wikinews:** Could the G7 summit contribute to post-COVID-19 recovery?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Agreements on global vaccine distribution and the unrestricted trade of medical supplies would be beneficial. However, the political feasibility of such agreements is uncertain.  The inclusion of India and Australia in the expanded G7 raises concerns about creating a bloc potentially antagonistic toward China.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there any ideal trade relationships the UK could emulate?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Many successful trade relationships exist between neighboring countries.  The UK should prioritize closer cooperation with its European neighbors.\n\n**Wikinews:** Should the UK align more closely with the WTO?\n\n**Professor Winters:** The UK should play a leadership role in the WTO, but this should be achieved through quiet diplomacy and cooperation, not through assertive posturing.  A more humble and subtle approach would be more effective.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Any final thoughts on Brexit and UK trade?\n\n**Professor Winters:**  Trade policy requires a long-term, analytical approach. The focus on signing headline-grabbing trade deals overshadows the importance of addressing underlying policy issues and ensuring internal debate before using trade policy to reinforce domestic policies.  A more thoughtful and contextualized approach is needed.", "question": "What is L.

A state government inquiry revealed \"high levels of tension\" within the council, leading to its dismissal and the appointment of administrators in July 2019.  However, a local election, conducted by post from October 5–22, 2021, will restore the council.\n\nWikinews interviewed David Liebelt, an independent candidate for the Coastal-Promontory Ward.  This ward encompasses several towns (names omitted from original text as they were not provided), and elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n**Liebelt:**  I aim to represent all residents of the Coastal Ward and the entire South Gippsland Shire, particularly the \"quiet majority\"—employees, farmers, small business owners, tradespeople, retirees, and tourists.  For too long, we've been represented by individuals with narrow agendas. My focus will be on local community issues, not federal or state government distractions. I'll prioritize efficient resource allocation to ensure the council delivers value for money.\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you think the two-year period of administration has been too long?\n\n**Liebelt:** Yes, the administration has been too long and ineffective.  They haven't adequately listened to the community or addressed its needs. Decisions have contradicted community wishes, and there's been excessive spending on reviews, consultants, and feasibility studies with poor outcomes.\n\n**Wikinews:** The Wilsons Promontory, a major tourist attraction within the Coastal-Promontory ward, has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. What's needed for business recovery?\n\n**Liebelt:**  COVID-19 has affected many tourist attractions beyond the Promontory, which has been prioritized for too long.  The council's $2 million community support package has provided little benefit to small businesses.  We need immediate support for all outdoor community activities businesses want to develop, reducing red tape and innovative approaches instead of relying on bureaucratic compliance checklists.\n\n**Wikinews:** What environmental protection changes would you advocate for?\n\n**Liebelt:** We must recognize farmers as strong environmentalists and support them with rate relief for environmental initiatives. I strongly support habitat corridors to link wildlife communities and enhance biodiversity, advocating for a shire-wide masterplan connecting coastal reserves and ranges.\n\n**Wikinews:** What qualifies you to be a councillor?\n\n**Liebelt:** I have extensive experience in small business management, people management, and community involvement. My education includes economics, finance, small business, climatology, and coastal & fluvial geomorphology. I'm a good listener, patient, and empathetic.  While not all decisions will be popular, they will be made honestly.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight?\n\n**Liebelt:** I'll advocate for better resource allocation to small communities, improving services provided by community centers and health centers, and enhancing services for the elderly to help them remain in their communities.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews RSL Australia for Remembrance Day 2021", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews RSL Australia for Remembrance Day 2021\n\nWikinews reporter J.J. Liu interviewed the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) via email for comment on the 102nd observance of Remembrance Day, commemorating the end of hostilities in World War I (WWI) on November 11, 1918.\n\nInitially called Armistice Day following its first observance in 1919, it was renamed Remembrance Day after World War II to honor the fallen of WWII and subsequent Australian military engagements, according to the RSL website.  In 1997, Governor-General Sir William Deane issued a proclamation urging all Australians to observe a one-minute silence.\n\nThe RSL website notes that 61,630 Australians died during WWI (August 4, 1914 – March 31, 1921), making it the deadliest conflict in Australian history.  From a population of five million, 416,809 Australians enlisted; 155,000 were wounded, and 8,000 died from post-war injuries.\n\nQuestions were answered by RSL Ambassador Pete Rudland, who served in the Australian Defence Force from 1989 to 2017, with deployments to Cambodia (1993), Iraq (1997 & 2003), East Timor (2001), and Afghanistan (2010).  He was injured in a fatal helicopter crash in Afghanistan that claimed four lives.\n\n**Wikinews:** How has Remembrance Day changed in the RSL's history of commemoration?\n\n**Rudland:** Initially, Remembrance Day/Armistice Day impacted two-thirds of the world, profoundly affecting Australia.  Over 60,000 Australians died, and another 156,000 were wounded—a staggering toll from a population of 4,985,569.  The sheer scale of loss, with so many buried in foreign lands, made collective mourning challenging.  The RSL provided a vital space for families to grieve, heal, and share experiences, uniting soldiers from all backgrounds. While modern wars don't inflict the same casualties, the RSL continues to offer support to those affected. The scale of impact has changed, but the core narrative remains constant.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What role should organizations play in Remembrance Day?\n\n**Rudland:** Modern Remembrance Day is a collection of stories—stories of sacrifice. Organizations should preserve and share these stories, ensuring lessons from the past are learned.  As demographics shift, ex-service organizations act as custodians of these memories.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What role should governments play in Remembrance Day?\n\n**Rudland:** Politicians initiate wars, soldiers fight them, and families bear the ultimate cost. Governments must lead on Remembrance Day, acknowledging the sacrifices of soldiers and ensuring their service is respected.  Recognizing days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day strengthens the relationship between the government, soldiers, and the nation.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** 103 years after the 1918 Armistice, why is Remembrance Day important today?  Has it retained its poignancy?\n\n**Rudland:** WWI marked the first time Australians deployed as a unified nation, not just as colonies.  Newly federated, Australians were proud of their nation's domestic and military achievements.  Australia, as part of the Commonwealth, helped defeat the Central Powers in the world's largest war.  The profound human cost was recognized, shaping the nation's direction.  The connection between past and present remains strong, explaining Remembrance Day's enduring poignancy.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What lessons does WWI teach us about veterans' affairs today?\n\n**Rudland:** War is complex, and support must extend beyond hostilities.  Wounded veterans require rehabilitation, and families of the fallen deserve to know their sacrifices were worthwhile—lessons relevant to all conflicts.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why should Remembrance Day be commemorated alongside ANZAC Day (April 25th)?\n\n**Rudland:** ANZAC Day represents triumph over adversity, a cornerstone of Australian culture.  Remembrance Day highlights the immense human cost of WWI and the challenges faced by a young nation finding its place in the world.  Together, they represent the entire Australian journey.", "question": "What significant change occurred to the observance of Remembrance Day after World War II according to the Returned & Services League (RSL)?  \nA) It was first observed in 1919.  \nB) It was renamed to honor casualties from World War II and later conflicts.  \nC) It was declared a national holiday.  \nD) It included a new focus on veterans' affairs."}

The rate hike, widely anticipated by economists and markets (with 21 of 23 economists surveyed by Reuters predicting a 25 basis point increase), comes as New Zealand grapples with the economic fallout of its COVID-19 response.\n\nThe Guardian notes that New Zealand, like other major economies, injected substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus during the pandemic. This, combined with low interest rates and housing shortages, has driven unemployment to record lows and inflation to over a decade highs.  House prices have doubled in the last seven years, making New Zealand the least affordable housing market among OECD nations, according to Reuters.\n\nThe RBNZ cited rising oil prices, increased transport costs, and supply chain disruptions as factors exacerbating near-term inflation, risking more generalized price increases (ABC News).  The bank forecasts the OCR reaching 2.5% by 2023 and even higher by 2024 (Reuters), though other projections are more conservative.  Economist Ben Udy predicts 2% by mid-2022, while Westpac's acting chief economist, Michael Gordon, anticipates a peak of 3% by Q3 2023, including a potential 0.5% rate hike at the February RBNZ meeting (The Guardian).\n\nThis latest increase follows a 25 basis point hike to 0.5% on October 6th – the first in seven years – marking the beginning of the RBNZ's tightening cycle, delayed from August due to the Delta variant and Auckland's lockdown.  Senior market strategist Jason Wong of (name of institution needed) told Reuters at the time that a series of rate hikes was anticipated.\n\nRBNZ Governor Adrian Orr described the 25 basis point increments as a balanced approach to gradually raise the OCR above the neutral rate.  While acknowledging consideration of a 50 basis point hike (Reuters), Orr warned homeowners with high leverage to prepare for higher interest rates.  He defended the stimulus program but acknowledged the resulting surge in household debt.  The RBNZ considers current house prices unsustainable and anticipates a potential correction, despite earlier taxes on property investors failing to cool the market (Reuters).\n\nGlobally, central banks are navigating the unwinding of pandemic stimulus with varying approaches.  The United States' inflation rate recently hit a 31-year high of 6.2%, pressuring Federal Reserve Chair (name needed) to accelerate tapering (Associated Press).  The Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) also faced criticism over projected inflationary pressures (The Guardian, Reuters).  ECB President (name needed) cautioned against premature tightening, arguing it could harm the recovery (Reuters).\n\nConversely, Australia's Reserve Bank (RBA) maintains that interest rate increases are unlikely until 2024 (ABC News). RBA Governor (name needed) stated that current economic data doesn't warrant a rate hike in 2022.  However, several other central banks, including those in Norway, the Czech Republic, and South Korea (with another expected hike today), have already acted more aggressively.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6%, reflecting some investors' expectations of a larger rate hike.  Government bond yields also declined (Reuters).", "question": "What was the new official cash rate (OCR) set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) after the recent policy meeting?  \n\nA) 0.50%  \nB) 0.75%  \nC) 1.00%  \nD) 2.00%"}
