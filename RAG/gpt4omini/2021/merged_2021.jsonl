The investigation is to be led by British lawyer , who is scheduled to replace Bensouda as chief prosecutor on June 16.\n\nBensouda said \"[t]he decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years\".  Bensouda promised a \"principled, non-partisan, approach\" for the case and said the case will be handled \"independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor.\"  The preliminary examination was conducted in December 2019, finding \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including , and the Gaza Strip\".\n\nThe chief prosecutor said the probe will focus on alleged war crime committed since June 13, 2014, a few weeks before the Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip.  Bensouda said the priorities of investigation are to be \"determined in due time\".  She named both Israeli Defense Forces as well as Palestinian militant group Hamas as the potential perpetrators.\n\nPalestine is a member of the ICC since 2015 and has long accused Israel for war crimes.  Israel is not a member of the ICC and claims the court has no jurisdiction over Palestinian Territories because Palestine is not sovereign.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called ICC's decision \"the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy\" and said the court was \"turning a blind eye to Iran, Syria, and the other dictatorships that are committing real war crimes.\"\n\nIn the statement Netanyahu also said: \"Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists in the world who deliberately target civilians, it's our soldiers who are war criminals\".

{"title": "Wales widens smoking ban, includes at hospitals, schools and playgrounds", "content": "Today, Wales extended the prohibition on smoking at hospitals, schools, and playgrounds, with violators to face a 100 fine.  Wales is the first of the UK  to introduce this ban.\n\nThis is in addition to various restrictions on the practice, including a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in place since 2007 and a ban on smoking in cars with children in place since 2015.\n\nThe , governed by left-wing party , said the measure was to discourage adults and children alike from smoking by making it appear less normal, and encourage the already partaking to quit. \n\nTwo hospitals in the country's south have installed a button-activated speaker system to remind people hospitals are smoke-free.  In 2016, a similar mechanism was tried at hospitals across Wales, where an announcement recorded by local school children would play upon pressing a button.\n\nMinister for Mental Health, Wellbeing, and the Welsh Language  said she was \"immensely proud to have brought into force this law\", and \"[t]his legislation will benefit the health of future generations in Wales, as fewer children will be exposed to smoking\".  She concluded, \"[w]e need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\n\nThe government was criticised by many smokers rights groups.  Simon Clark, Director of the  compared the law to \"taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\", saying: \"There is no evidence that smoking in the open air poses a risk to anyone else's health, including children.\"  The director further explained, \"Banning smoking on hospital grounds is particularly unjust because it targets smokers who may be stressed and in need of a comforting cigarette.  Most smokers use their common sense and don't smoke around small children. They don't need politicians telling them how to behave.\"\n\nWikinews contacted Eluned Morgan's office to know more about this ban.\n\n What is the core objective of this law?  If everything works out as you had intended, regarding this law, how would the future of Wales (in terms of smoking) look like?\n\n We are bringing in this legislation to protect people from being exposed to harmful second-hand smoke, help those trying to quit and reduce the chances of children starting smoking.\n\nWe are committed to our longer-term goal of making more of Wales' public spaces smoke-free and helping people to make positive changes to their health and wellbeing.  We intend to progress work to extend the smoking ban to outdoor areas of cafes and restaurants and city and town centres.\n\n How do you respond to the criticism the government is trying to \"micro-manage people's lives\"?\n\n The law is being introduced to protect the public's health, both from harmful second-hand smoke and to support those trying to quit.  We hope to denormalise smoking among children and young people so they are less likely to start in the first place.\n\n Do you think it is an individual informed adult's right to smoke?  Why, or why not?\n\n Smoking is the biggest cause of early preventable death in Wales.  We have brought in this legislation as we need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking and to support people to make positive choices for their health.  We hope that by increasing the number of smoke-free areas it will improve the health of people in Wales, but there will still be places where adults can smoke.\n\n Where should someone smoke, if they so choose?\n\n The smoke-free law only applies in areas set out in the legislation.\n\n Does the current ban on smoking in playgrounds only apply when there are kids present, or should it be during all times?  Can you please elaborate?\n\n All public playgrounds in Wales will be required to be smoke-free all of the time.  Even if there are no children in the public playground, the playground must be smoke-free at all times.  We know that reducing the number of young people taking up smoking saves lives. Therefore, restricting smoking in areas where children and young people go regularly, like public playgrounds and school grounds, will help to make smoking behaviour appear less normal and reduce the chances of children and young people taking up smoking.\n\neo:Kimrujo plivastigis malpermeson je fumado por inkluzivi hospitalojn, lernejojn kaj ludejojn\nes:Gales amplía la prohibición de fumar\npt:País de Gales amplia proibição de fumar", "question": "What is the fine for smoking at hospitals, schools, and playgrounds in Wales under the new law?  \nA) £50  \nB) £100  \nC) £200  \nD) £150"}

B Shiva Parvathi and Rangoli Patil were the locomotive and co-locomotive pilots of the train, covering 139 km to reach the state capital.\n\nMysore Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg told Wikinews only 10% of the employees in the  were women, which constitutes about 650 female employees.  The celebration had started on March 1.\n\nWikinews spoke with Mysore Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg about the ten-day campaign around International Women's Day.  This year's theme of the celebration was \"Each for Equal\", an initiative of Mysore Division.  Speaking of the gender-distribution ratio, Garg said \"we have ten percent only women employees. Out of a total of, say, 6900 [employees], we have around 650. So that is around ten percent.\"\n\nGarg discussed the challenges faced by women working for the Indian Railways.  \"Challenges, I would say, are the same as you find in the society.  For a women to achieve something, is not as easy as it is for a man.  They have to put double the effort, and the recognition comes very late.  And then women are multi-tasking everywhere.  So a lady who comes to work in the office: first sees her house and then she comes [to work] and then again she goes back and she does [household work].  So she is much more pressure, and I find them very sincere.  Despite all the pressure, I find them extremely sincere and dedicated.\"\n\nShe also went on to discuss the remedies.  \"[W]hat is required at large is a change in the society and the mindset, which should begin in each house.  And if we have boys in the house and we have male colleagues, we have to sensitise them more.  And so that, once we have the support of these people and their mindset changes, and that is how we can influence the collective consciousness.\"\n\nAs the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in various countries, people started stocking up various things including toilet paper.  Stores started limiting the number of packages per transaction.\n\nWoolworths and Coles in Australia had initially announced a limit of four-pack of toilet paper, but Coles later declared \"many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery\".  Both store chains later said only one or two packs could be bought in one purchase transaction.\n\nColes ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency while Woolworths ordered extra stock to keep up with the requirements.\n\nRecycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap had announced in early March they had run out of stock.   reported  had been working 24/7 to maintain the supply.\n\nIn March, Wikinews interviewed Iranian chess  , discussing her chess career.\n\nBack in 2017, Dorsa, and her younger brother Borna Derakhshani were banned from representing the Iranian national team.  Dorsa was banned since she did not wear a hijab, an Islamic headscarf, while competing at the  in January 2017.   Under the laws of Islamic Republic of Iran, hijab is a mandatory dress code.  Her brother Borna Deraskhsani was banned for playing against Israeli  (GM)  at the same tournament.\n\nIM Dorsa Derakhshani said she currently studies  at  in the United States and plays for the .\n\nDerakhshani said  were her inspiration.  \"I really liked the three sisters of Polgár, 'specially .  Just because she kept on going and she didn't just want to be the best female chess player.  She was in top 10.  She was one of the first to break the barriers of gender, especially in chess society.\"\n\nSpeaking of the challenges in Iran, Derakhshani said, \"one of the big challenges was that there weren't enough tournaments.  Because in Iran, women are seen as second-class citizens, so, I wasn't allowed, and women weren't allowed to play, in open tournaments.  And there weren't enough women chess players to organise a big event.  And so when I was growing up and I was eight, we started — my parents started to request that okay, she is a good child, she should be able to play in male-based tournaments, basically.  And they weren't even female tournaments, they were just tournaments.  And so when I was eight, and when I was ten, they allowed the children, like the girl childs to play, which was kind of awkward.  And then they came up with more flexible rules, like if you are in the national team, you can play whatever tournament you want, if you win your category.  But still.  It was very .\"\n\nDorsa Derakhshani said she had decided early on she did not want to play for the Iranian Chess Federation.  Derakhshani spent some time in Spain, playing for the  Chess Club.\n\nWhen asked if the Iranian chess players reach out to support her after the federation announced banning her, Derakhshani said, \"Very very few.  And that was something that I expected to be more.  Because all of my high school friends, actually most of my high school, just the class that I had: they reached out and they have a group chat and they were really supportive, my high school friends.  But from the chess players, I think, Iranian Chess players, very few, maybe not even five or ten reached out to show their support which was very shocking to me.\"\n\nSpeaking of her goals, IM Dorsa Derakhshani said, \"I would really like to be in US top five.  And I would also really like to be involved in chess as much as I can.  I do have my  title, and I would really like to be able to teach more kids.  I do have a few students and it seems to be going good, so far.  But I would like to understand better how to fix and help the players.\"\n\nA study published in March examined harm  in  for  — rats not wanting to hurt other members of the same species — and reported which region of the brain was crucial for it.\n\nWikinews interviewed two of the authors of the study, Dr  and Dr Valeria Gazzola.  In the experiment, the researchers trained lab rats to develop a preference for mechanincal levers, which delivered one pellet of .  After the rats had a developed a preference, the researchers placed another lab rat in an adjacent compartment.  This time, when the lever was pressed, an electrical shock was delivered to the other rat, while also delivering a sucrose pellet to the first rat.  Researchers observed rats chose to avoid harming their conspecifics even when two sucrose pellets were delivered.\n\nThe study also showed this behaviour was due to the  (ACC).  The researchers repeated the experiment after subjecting the rat's brain to  and deactivating the ACC.  The active rats in the test group were no longer averse to harming the victim rats, but degree of harm aversion did not drop in the control group rats.\n\nA study published by European Southern Observatory researchers reported the discovery of the closest known black hole from the .  Wikinews interviewed researcher Thomas Rivinius.\n\nAround 1010 ± 195  from the Solar System, the new discovery is located in the  constellation in the  system.  This makes it the first system visible to the naked eye to contain a black hole.  Astronomers started observing the system in 1999, Rivinius told Wikinews.\n\nOriginally thought to be a  of , further examination indicated a third unseen object in the system.  The star closer to the Black Hole orbits the black hole in just 40.333 ± 0.004 days.  This black hole does not have an .  Using the , the researchers estimated the mass of the black hole is at least 4.2 M☉ (; 1 Solar mass = mass of the Sun).\n\nRivinius also said \"the first suggestion that it was a black hole surfaced in 2010\", and the observations were \"made from the \" in Chile.\n\nIn the first of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election, Wikinews interviewed Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman  and podcaster , two individuals the US Constitution Party and US Libertarian Party respectively nominated for vice president at their respective national conventions in May.  Wikinews interviewed a third individual, truck driver , who was selected in May as the running mate for US Green Party presidential frontrunner and  presidential nominee .\n\nMohr, the running mate of Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, discussed the story behind his nomination for vice president, how his political experience complemented Blankenship's business experience, and the challenges and opportunities the COVID-19 pandemic, which Mohr felt overblown, created for the ticket's ability to gain support.   \n\nCohen, the running mate of Libertarian Party presidential nominee , discussed how the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan changed his political views from  to libertarian, how he planned to campaign with Jorgensen in innovative and traditional manners, and how he hoped to gain traction for the campaign with a focus on libertarian issues, viral social media, and getting into the presidential debates. \n\nWalker discussed how she planned to use her political experience to bring people from marginalized communities together, why leftists should vote for her ticket over others, and how she hoped her campaign would unite marginalized communities.\n\nA study published in May conducted by  Dr Naomi Martisius and other researchers concluded Neanderthals living in Europe tens of thousands of years ago were more sophisticated than previously thought.  The now-extinct species used to carefully select bones from a particular animal species to manufacture their bone tools, the research showed.\n\nThe researchers collected bone tools from Abri Peyrony and Pech-de-l’Azé I in France.  The bone tools were just a few centimetres in size and were about 50 thousand years old, Dr Martisius told Wikinews.  Microscopy analysis of these bone tools, made from the ribs of large , called lissoirs (smoothers) suggested Neanderthals used these tools for working animal skin to leathers.  Dr Martisius told Wikinews this was likely due to the physical characteristics of the bovid ribs, which were \"thicker\" and \"stronger\" as compared to the \"thin and flimsy ribs\" of reindeers.\n\nThe study reported the archæological sites had far many reindeer bones, however, Neanderthals selectively used bones of large bovids for this purpose.  For the purpose of this research, the archæologists used a technology called non-destructive Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).  Instead of damaging the bone artefacts in order to discover its origins, the researchers collected  from the plastic containers in which these artefacts were kept.  Collagen is a type of protein.  These bone artefacts were kept in plastic containers: some were kept for about five years, some for just a few months.  During this time, the collagen proteins from bone tools were stuck to the walls of their plastic containers.  The collagen samples collected from the walls of the containers are broken into smaller molecules called  by using a chemical  called .\n\nOne of the advantages of using bovid ribs over reindeer's thin ribs was the bovid ribs would be more resistant to breaking during flexion, Dr Martisius said.  Dr Martisius said such non-destructive ZooMS analysis was previously conducted, but for tools no older than a few centuries. She said such an analysis had never been previously conducted for artefacts so ancient.\n\nIn June, Wikinews spoke to Finnish open-source  developer Perttu Ahola.  About ten years ago, Ahola created Minetest, a  similar to .  Ahola told Wikinews he took it as a challenge to create a game like Minnecraft when it was in its .\n\nMinetest is a free and open-source game, which is free for anyone to download and play.  It is written in the  programming language, and the source code is available on code-hosting site GitHub.  According to Ahola, Minetest attempts to run on older hardware, with limited graphics, but to be accessible to more people: those who have outdated technology, and making it available for no cost.\n\nSpeaking about the development of the game, Ahola said, \"It was developed in a very .  We've never had to throw away any big parts.  Maybe iterative isn't the best word, I mean it was always developed by building on what was previously created.  Actually we've had one big change, although it too was an addition: When we went from version 0.3 to 0.4, Minetest gained its -based  .  It was a really big change in how people thought about and used Minetest.\"\n\nSpeaking about his typical day as the core-developer of the game, Ahola said, \"Currently, as I'm focusing on some other programming projects outside of Minetest, when I have some free time I still check the Minetest  channels and GitHub to see what's going on, and if I have something to say I'll make a comment about it.  Of course I check my emails to see if any automated system has sent me a warning about something and needs fixing, or maybe there's a private message on the forum about some administrative task that needs doing.  I might check some system statistics on the VPS [] running the forum to make sure it's running smoothly and make sure backups look ok.\"\n\nA study reported in March potential signs of formation of an exoplanet around the star  — something never observed before.  Located in the , AB Aurigae is about 520  away from the .  The astronomers observed the  around the star.  The astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's  in Chile to study this system.\n\nWikinews caught up with Anthony Boccaletti, one of the authors of the study, to discuss this findings.\n\nBoccaletti told Wikinews \"AB Aurigae is a star which is more massive than the Sun, but also very very young\".  They observed a protoplanetary disc around the young star.  The potential to-be planet is roughly about 30 astronomical units from the star, which is almost the same distance between the Sun and .\n\nBoccaletti said \"Because we know that the planets are forming when a star is very young; so when it's like one million or five million years old.  And it took about probably a million year for a planet to form.  So it is important to look at very young planet, if you want to understand how the planet forms, you need to look at very young systems.\"\n\nThe researchers used  and  for this study.  Speaking about the type and size of the planet, Boccaletti said, \"It will be a giant planet, really.  Maybe even bigger than Jupiter. Maybe 10 times the mass of Jupiter.  But it couldn't be a planet that is like the Earth.  If it were a planet like the Earth, it wouldn't make this kind of spiral.  The spiral would not be detectable, in that case.  So it's necessarily a very big planet.\"\n\nIn the second of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 US presidential election, Wikinews interviewed retired marine Billy Joe Parker, vice presidential nominee of the US Prohibition Party, historian Darcy Richardson, vice presidential nominee of the  and Reform parties, and educator Tiara Lusk, vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party.\n\nParker was the running mate of Prohibition Party presidential nominee , who, in June, unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the presidential nomination of the Reform Party.  With Wikinews, Parker discussed his decision in \"AD 2005\" to join the Prohibition Party due to him being impressed with the party's standards and membership.  He explained he felt Collins a much better choice for president than the Republican and Democratic nominees and spoke directly to voters, advising them to make a choice benefitting the children of the nation.\n\nRichardson, the running mate of Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, secured the vice presidential nomination of the Reform Party, with De La Fuente as the presidential nominee, at the party's national convention in June.  Richardson discussed with Wikinews, his plan to campaign for the ticket across the nation, within the confines of COVID-19 restrictions.  He compared, unfavorably, President Donald Trump to President  and described the then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as past his prime.  Richardson highlighted the Alliance Party's goal to make the United States into a \"gold medal nation.\"\n\nLusk, who became the first vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty at the party's inaugural national convention held virtually in June, was the running mate of the party's founder and presidential nominee J.R. Myers.  With Wikinews, Lusk discussed how the Life and Liberty Party has less emphasis on Christianity than the US Constitution Party, how Myers' debate performance impressed her and that led her to join his new party, and said the campaign was focused on healing and uniting the nation.\n\nIn August, a  broke in the US city of White Plains, New York, cutting off the water supply to most of the city.  The burst pipe caused a huge crater to form in a major intersection in the heart of the city, flooding the streets. Emergency crews were on the scene to repair the pipes in order to restore water service.  Almost all customers had water restored by the evening of the same day.\n\nWikinews was on the scene around 6:20 pm local time and could observe a large crater in the street caused by the amount of water from the burst pipe.  Crews from the Department of Public Works as well as some the fire department were there. Water was no longer rushing uncontrolled into the street.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 6:30 pm, the city issued a follow-up statement announcing the break had been contained by DPW.  Residents were advised to expect the water to perhaps be \"discolored\" when it initially returned.\n\nIn August, Caloundra defeated  45–24 in their Round 4 Sunshine Coast Rugby Union match which was played at the Grenada Street ground in Wynnum.\n\nCaloundra's half back Jarrod Kidston said, \"Yeah it was a good start from us, probably the best start from us in a while.  Then we just made a couple of mistakes and let them back in the game.  They're a good outfit so they put points on pretty quick.\"\n\nWynnum coach Matt Myers said \"We got back on even and managed to go try for try for a couple [...] [We] let them [have the] momentum [and they were] over the top, they got a roll on\".\n\nIn the third of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 US presidential election, Wikinews interviewed teacher Amar Patel, vice presidential nominee of the , filmmaker John de Graaf, vice presidential nominee of the Bread and Roses Party, and engineer Eric Bodenstab, vice presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America.\n\nPatel, on the ticket with Solidarity Party presidential nominee , secured ballot access in Illinois in July.  With Wikinews, Patel discussed Carroll asking him to join the ticket, how he used Twitter to complement Carroll's use of Facebook to spread the campaign message, and listed all the states, in addition to Illinois, where the ticket had obtained or was in the process of obtaining ballot access.\n\nDe Graaf, on the inaugural ticket with Bread and Roses presidential nominee , secured ballot access in Vermont in July.  With Wikinews, de Graaf described the Bread and Roses Party's focus on quality of life issues, how his background as a documentary filmmaker complemented Segal's academic background, discussed the \"Beauty New Deal\", and emphasized the party's goal of educating the populace and providing a leftist alternative in non-swing states like Vermont.\n\nBodenstab, on the inaugural ticket with Unity Party founder and presidential nominee Bill Hammons, secured ballot access in New Jersey in July.  With Wikinews, Bodenstab explained why his party decided to field a presidential ticket, described his efforts of building grassroots support in places without much personal connection, and basked in the moment of him and Hammons building a political party and running for president as ordinary citizens.\n\nIn the round five of Australian Sunshine Coast Rugby Union, University defeated Maroochydore 22–10.\n\n\"We turned up here knowing we'd be in for a battle [...] They pushed [reigning premiers] Caloundra and they pushed Noosa.  We knew the were looking for a scalp.  To Maroochydore's credit, they've made some big improvements since last season.  I think as the season goes on they'll keep getting better and better, as well\", Brad Tronc, University's coach, said.\n\nMaroochydore assistant coach Ben Radmall said it was a hard and physical match.  \"It was pretty set piece dominated there for the last twenty minutes[...] [It was] a pretty physical game out there this afternoon.  It was a good hit out.  We're sore after that one\", he said.\n\nIn the fourth of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 US presidential election, Wikinews took a deeper look into an August bat attack on Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, highlighted three points of controversy in the American Independent Party's presidential nomination of Rocky De La Fuente for president and entertainer  for vice president at its August convention, and examined questions about the citizenship of Senator Kamala Harris, whom then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected as his running mate in August.\n\nA bat bit Jorgensen on the chin in early August.  Wikinews reached out to Jorgensen's campaign manager and deputy campaign manager who witnessed the attack first hand.  Wikinews recounted the treatment Jorgensen received while on the campaign trail and noted the impact the story had on the visibility of the campaign as it attempted to gain in the polls to qualify for the official presidential debates.\n\nIn mid-August, the American Independent Party, with ballot access in the most populous US state of California, nominated De La Fuente for president and West for vice president.  This created some dissention between De La Fuente and his running mate in all the other states, Darcy Richardson.  Wikinews spoke to Richardson, who felt the American Independent Party was using De La Fuente and West in an attempt to assist the campaign of President Donald Trump.  At the time, West was running for president as the nominee of his creation, the Birthday Party.  Wikinews examined public statements from leaders of the American Independent Party, revealing their goal of helping the Trump campaign.  Additionally, Wikinews uncovered FEC documents showing a series of payments from De La Fuente to the vice-chairman of the American Independent Party in the months leading up to the party's August convention.\n\nIn public statements Wikinews reported, the same aforementioned leaders of American Independent Party, questioned the eligibility of Kamala Harris upon her selection as Biden's running mate, based on the citizenship of her parents at her birth.  Wikinews documented a minority of legal experts, including \"Birther King\" Andy Martin, who agreed in part with the leaders of the party, and highlighted the legal majority that discounted the \"birther\" arguments entirely and likened them to those questioning the citizenship of former president Barack Obama.\n\nWikinews interviewed businessman Don Blankenship, 2020 presidential nominee of the US Constitution Party, about his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his 2020 presidential campaign, his political agenda, and policy positions.\n\nBlankenship named  as the past US president he most admires.  He cited multiple aspects providing him with the experience to perform the duties of the presidency such as: previously dealing with the government, knowing government's flaws, being poor, being rich, serving in federal prison, and defeating the establishment.  He identified his leadership style as rooted in \"truth and conviction.\" \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic restricted his ability to obtain ballot access in many states.  He lamented he would only receive half of the votes anticipated due to pandemic-related limitations, and argued if he had been president during the start of the pandemic he would have quarantined those with symptoms, protected elderly people, and allowed young people to work.\n\nAs president, Blankenship said he would reduce the number of cabinet members and appoint those who previously have not worked in government.  He would choose judges based on their fidelity to the US Constitution and would apply pressure to Congress based on \"common sense\" without drama and hyperbole.  Politically, Blankenship opposed any government action to combat climate change, argued for less intervention in the affairs of other nations and for most US troops abroad to be brought back to the US.  He derided social media censorship, endorsed an end to illegal immigration to the US, and endorsed education equality based on location rather than race.         \n\nIn his final plea to voters, Blankenship quoted the inaugural address of President  as crucial to maintaining the survival of the United States, \"Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nIn October, Wikinews spoke with 2020 Melbourne, Australia  candidate Wayne Tseng about his election campaign.  Tseng runs a firm called eTranslate, which helps software developers to make the software available to the users.\n\nTseng discussed his plans for leading Melbourne, recovering from COVID-19, and \"Democracy 2.0\" to ensure concerns of minorities in the city were also heard.  Tseng also focused on the importance of the multi-culture aspect and talked about making Melbourne the capital of the .  Tseng also explained why he thinks Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030. \n\nAt that time,  was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, the Victorian capital.  Capp was elected as an interim Lord Mayor in mid-2018 after the former Lord Mayor  resigned from his position after sexual assault allegations.\n\nSpeaking of Capp's governance, Tseng said, \"I do appreciate the hard work Sally did to bridge the political divide in a council chamber she inherited.  This year the pandemic has made her work even harder as for any other leaders.  But what she fall short off is to stand up to the State Government (provincial government) which [has] restricted the city ability to take its own decisive action to better protect the city.\"\n\nTseng proposed the plan of \"Re-open, Reset, Reform\".  \"My strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.  There is a comprehensive plan for recovery in all sectors from business to residents. See attached document\", Tseng said.\n\nAlso speaking about the multi-cultural aspects of Melbourne, Tseng said: \"The distribution of indigenous people depends on a lot of factors.  These again due to historical reasons that we can go on forever.  [There] are tens of indigenous tribes across the country.  Sadly some were hunted to extinction in the last century, particularly in Tasmania.  Mak[ing] a location a capital for the First Nations people will be symbolic rather than totally enshrine[d] in law.  Ideally it would be best in the .  But unless I was a mayor there, it may not happen.  So having [it] in Melbourne does allow some symbolic and provide a forum for the different tribes to gather and have open discussions.  The 'capital' can rotate from city to city periodically if other cities allow. But ultimately it will be up to the elders to approve.\"\n\nWikinews interviewed former  trustee Phil Collins, 2020 presidential nominee of the US Prohibition Party, about his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his 2020 presidential campaign, his political agenda, and policy positions.\n\nCollins named  and Ronald Reagan as the past US presidents he most admires. He cited his 21 years of military service including a stop outside Baghdad and his background in government as a township trustee as providing him the experience in leadership to serve as President.  He described his personal leadership style as focused on following the US Constitution.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic restricted his ability to obtain ballot access in many states, namely Tennessee.  Nevertheless, he was able to obtain more ballot access than his party's 2016 ticket and so anticipated receiving more votes.  For the pandemic, he outlined a plan to encourage cooperation among the different US states and find out how the states with fewer infections did so in a televised press conference.\n\nAs president, he said he would nominate a cabinet made up of people who could work with members of his own party as well as the Democratic and Republican parties.  He singled out former   as his choice for .  As for the others, he said he would seek input from fellow Prohibition Party leadership.  For Supreme Court nominations, Collins said he would nominate current federal judges who base their opinions on the US Constitution.  He planned to connect with members on a personal level in order to pass his agenda in Congress.\n\nOn the issues, Collins said he would combat climate change through recommendations from former leaders of the .  He proposed splitting the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh area between Armenia and Azerbaijan to resolve their differences.  To avoid social media censorship, he said he would encourage the people of the US to use alternatives.  As for race relations, Collins proposed more advertising for federal government positions aimed at minorities, and the posting of federal anti-discrimination rules in each federal office.\n\nWikinews interviewed entrepreneur Bill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, about his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his 2020 presidential campaign, his political agenda, and policy positions.\n\nHammons named  as the past US president he most admires.  He cited his experience as the founder and chairman of the Unity Party, his time managing Newsweek magazine, and founding of the site Bill's List as providing him with the experience to be president.  Hammons described his leadership style as centrist, looking to others from all sides for input.\n\nHad he been president at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hammons said he would use the  to produce the supplies to combat the coronavirus, expand testing, use social media to trace those infected, and convert unused hotels as a place to house the quarantined.   Before the pandemic, Hammons explained he campaigned door-to-door but afterwards made use of targeted phone calls and text messages to reach voters.  Despite the pandemic, he predicted growth for the Unity Party.  \n\nHammons planned to fill his cabinet with a \"Team of Rivals\" like that of Abraham Lincoln's administration.  He said he would look at a judge's common sense to determine who to nominate to the Supreme Court and devised a plan to prevent future  with a Constitutional amendment.  For dealing with Congress, Hammons emphasized the use of compromise.\n\nAs for policy matters, for dealing with climate change, Hammons said he would take advice from billionaire Bill Gates,  scientists, and explore the distribution of cooling material into the atmosphere.  He endorsed the use of US peacemakers to resolve the Armenia-Azerbaijan , and argued that Facebook and other social media were doing a good job of striking a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of democracy.  He proposed changing the motto of Black Lives Matter to \"Black Lives Matter Too\" and  to \"Refund the Police\", and the nation could then \"take a sober look at how we can be a more harmonious nation going forward\".\n\nIn October, after reciving a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the  (RIAA), code hosting and sharing website GitHub blocked the public access to , a software which can download videos from the internet via the .\n\nRIAA's DMCA notice alleged the script's purpose of existence was to \"circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube\" and \"reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use\".  youtube-dl has multiple unit tests in its source code, which test whether the software works in different circumstances or not.  One of the tests included the URL of some copyrighted songs.\n\nWikinews spoke with a former maintainer and contributor of the youtube-dl project Philipp Hagemeister about this blocking.  Hagemeister told Wikinews, \"youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, just like any other web browser, from over 1000 different services.  Its uses are varied: It enables video playback on many devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi) where the video services don't work properly, it makes high-quality video playable for people with a bad or no Internet connection, it enables disabled users to use tools to play videos, and it is used for archival and research.\"\n\nGitHub's DMCA repository, where the takedown notice was published for public viewing, was subject to contant vandalism from multiple GitHub users.  One user submitted a ,  the source code of youtube-dl along with the DMCA repository.  This enabled users to view youtube-dl's source code from within the DMCA repository, provided they know the commit id.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation said on Twitter \"Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of a lawful uses. Demanding its removal from Github is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.\"\n\nSoon after the public access to the repository was locked, multiple users started sharing the source code via self-hosted  servers,  sites and via the  leading to a Streisand effect.  Streisand effect is when a measure to censor information causes further spread of that information.\n\nIn the fifth of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 US presidential election, Wikinews reported on the Libertarian Party ticket of Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen achieving ballot access in all 50 states in September, examined the proposal of Unity Party presidential nominee Bill Hammons to prevent future packing of the Supreme Court amid the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and documented the positions of multiple presidential candidates on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict that intensified in September.\n\nThe Jorgensen-Cohen ticket attained ballot access in all 50 US states in early September; noteworthy due to the restrictions placed on petitioning with the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing. Wikinews looked back at past third party and Independent presidential tickets that achieved the same feat. One of those tickets was that of the Libertarian Party in 1996 that included Jorgensen as the running mate for .\n\nIn September, the death of liberal Justice Ginsburg and nomination of conservative Judge  as her replacement led to calls from some Democrats to add more justices.  Wikinews spoke with presidential candidate Hammons, who proposed fixing the number of justices at 13, the number of federal circuit courts, with a constitutional amendment to prevent Court packing.\n\nAs the conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of  increased in September, Wikinews asked Jorgensen,  Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, and Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins for their positions on the matter. While Jorgensen and Blankenship argued the US should remain out of the conflict and let the nations resolve it themselves, Collins proposed the disputed region be split in half.\n\nWikinews interviewed psychology professor Jo Jorgensen, 2020 presidential nominee of the US Libertarian Party, about her background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on her 2020 presidential campaign, her political agenda, and policy positions.\n\nJorgensen named  as the past US president she most admires.  She cited the knowledge, instilled in her from her grandmother who migrated from Denmark, that business and family work better without government interference, as the most important preparation for an individual to have to serve as president.  Jorgensen cited her leadership style as \".\"\n\nIf she were president at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jorgensen says she would have prevented government agencies from blocking access to free market solutions, used the bully pulpit of the presidency to encourage the wearing of masks and social distancing, and put an end to pandemic-related lockdowns.  Because of the pandemic, Jorgensen says her campaign events had limited participants and that the restrictions hampered her campaign ground game.  However, she was able to use social media to reach potential voters.  She acknowledged her lack of name recognition made it difficult initially but was satisfied with her position in opinion polls and felt it was a victory that the major party candidates discussed liberty issues such as lowering taxes, bring US troops back to the US, and suspending the .  She hoped her campaign would be remembered for her pledge to \"make America like one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.\"\n\nFor her cabinet, Jorgensen said she would invite policy analysts from the  and , others who advocate for smaller government, and libertarians who hold elected office as Democrats and Republicans.  She cited the presidential veto as her biggest tool when dealing with Congress, and endorsed smaller budgets, cannabis decriminalization, and reform of criminal law.  Jorgensen said she would pardon all imprisoned for a non-violent drug offenses and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.  As commander-in-chief of the military, she planned to bring home all overseas US troops.\n\nAs for policy matters, Jorgensen called for an end to subsidies to the energy sector, particularly that of fossil fuels, and for an increased focus on nuclear power.  She argued for staying out of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict entirely and that she was more concerned with government censorship than censorship from social media platforms.  As for improving race relations, Jorgensen endorsed criminal justice reform including reforms of police tactics and decriminalization of victimless crimes, and for an end to licensing laws restricting equal opportunity in economics.\n\nWikinews interviewed retired teacher Brian Carroll, 2020 presidential nominee of the American Solidarity Party, about his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his 2020 presidential campaign, his political agenda, and policy positions.\n\nAs a past history teacher, Carroll gave his opinion on many presidents, adding he had recently acquired an appreciation for .  He cited his teaching and experience in raising community awareness as the political experience he needed for the role of president.  Carroll described his leadership style as opposite that of President Trump, which he felt included listening to experts and hiring an organized staff.\n\nFor the COVID-19 pandemic, Carroll said he would have used the guidelines of President Barack Obama and employed the Defense Production Act. He explained that rather than campaigning, the pandemic had kept him at home with his wife, which he considered a blessing.  Personally, he felt the pandemic was less stressful than for others.  However, he expected to perform better in the presidential election than the ticket his party nominated in 2016.\n\nCarroll said he wanted to nominate a cabinet that would work with Congress with an emphasis on bipartisanship.  Specifically, he said he would ask the  and the  for cabinet recommendations.  For the Supreme Court, Carroll wanted judges with opinions more aligned with consumers and workers than corporations.\n\nOn the issue of climate change, Carroll favored less reliance on carbon energy and endorsed  as well as solar, wind, thermal, and carbon capture technologies.  On other issues, Carroll opposed any military intervention in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict but called for diplomatic maneuvers.  He said we should be patient with social media as it is in its teen years, and said that race relations were a high priority and that he agreed with many policy recommendations in the Contract with Black America.\n\nIn his final plea to voters, Carroll argued that while the major parties focus on panic, the Solidarity Party stands for hope.\n\nIn the sixth of six monthly articles chronicling the 2020 US presidential election, Wikinews covered two debates of independent and third party presidential candidates that the  held in October.  Three third party presidential candidates that did not participate in either of those debates provided Wikinews with their final pleas to voters.  Additionally, three political pundits gave their predictions on the ultimate outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Free and Equal Elections Foundation held two debates in October for which Wikinews provided detailed summaries.  Free and Equal's founder and director Christina Tobin moderated both debates.  The first debate featured   Independent presidential candidate , Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins, Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee Brian Carroll, and  presidential nominee .  All of these candidates participated in the second debate except for Blankenship.\n\nWikinews sought out some of the other third party and independent presidential candidates that did not participate in either October debate to obtain a final plea to voters.  Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins, and Unity Party presidential nominee Bill Hammons each provided a statement.  Jorgensen directed her message to disaffected Democrats and Republicans, telling both to \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"  Collins discussed the harmful effects of alcohol and mentioned that his party supports a balanced budget, gun rights, and opposes abortion.  Hammons argued he could be in the running in a close election if he obtained just one electoral vote and asked voters to \"vote their conscience.\"\n\nWikinews sought out election predictions from political blogger Thomas Knapp, senior news analyst of the William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism, former Congressman Tom Tancredo, and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder of Politics1.com.  Whereas Knapp and Gunzburger predicted a victory for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Tancredo predicted President Donald Trump would be re-elected in a landslide victory.\n\nFollowing the resignation of 's MP  for family reasons, the Australian  in Queensland had a by-election.  Sandra Jephcott of the  party was one of the four candidates running for the by-election.  Wikinews spoke with Jephcott about her campaign.\n\nAccording to the party's website, Jephcott is a  and farmer, who has completed a veterinary degree from the University of Queensland, as well as a  at  and a  at .\n\nSandra Jephcott spoke about overdevelopment and corruption as some of her priorities.  \"I believe that the Groom by-election offers voters an opportunity to send a message to the two major parties that we're not happy with business as usual politics — including rampant overdevelopment and systemic political corruption that negatively impacts on the environment.\"  She also spoke about the plans to combat climate change.  \"Net zero or net negative Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (or ideally sooner)\", Jephcott said.\n\nWikinews also interviewed Craig Farquharson, who was the  candidate for the 2020 Groom by-election following John McVeigh's resignation as the MP.\n\nFarquharson told Wikinews, \"What prompted me to run as a candidate in Groom is, because as a small business owner, I could not get my elected MP to talk to me or even to call me back.  I became \"cheesed off\" with elected representatives who are inaccessible to their electorate, and resolved to do something about it. I have pledged that if elected I will be as accessible as possible to voters in my electorate.  After 36 years of being a safe Coalition seat, the electorate is ready for change, and wants the additional attention that a more marginal electorate gets, or alternately another party to represent them.\"\n\nSpaking for the Liberal Democrats, Farquharson said they \"would like to see some of the restrictions relaxed to enable people to take personal responsibility for their own health.  We do not believe recreational drug use should be criminalised — this is harmful to society and funnels money to dangerous gangs via the black market.  We believe that drug abuse is a separate matter to use, and should be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal matter.\"\n\nSpeaking about coal mining and renewable energy sources, Farquharson said: \"While Australia can switch to alternative technologies to generate power and for energy, many undeveloped nations depend on cheap electricity to lift their billions out of poverty. And responding to this demand, providing a better quality of coal would not only be an environmental improvement, for humanity and for alleviation of global poverty, it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nUS-based software company  announced they were shifting their investments from  to a rolling-release of CentOS Stream as an upstream for the development of  (RHEL).  This led to many users expressing their frustration on  (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list.\n\nCentOS has been in existence sincne 2004, providing the freely-licensed RHEL for no cost.  It was absorbed by Red Hat in 2014, and in the process, Red Hat gained the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".  Stream was announced in September 2019, months after IBM acquired Red Hat.\n\nOne of the  team of CentOS team, Pablo Greco, told Wikinews, \"I've been using Stream for most of my things ever since it came out, and I love the idea for it. The only problem is that Stream is being used as an excuse to kill CentOS, and that's the part I hate.\"  CentOS 8's  (EOL) was cut short from 2029 to December 2021, while CentOS 7's EOL is in 2024.  Wikinews spoke to Greco, as well as CentOS project's community manager Rich Bowen, who also works for Red Hat.\n\nGreco told Wikinews CentOS \"used to be rock solid distribution, with almost everything that RHEL has, but without all the hassle or the costs of a RHEL license, and obviously without the main benefit of RHEL which is the support.\"  Bowen said, \"One of the exciting things about the move to CentOS Stream is it's designed to be an actual contributor community, rather than the legacy CentOS Linux that is almost entirely a consumer community.\"\n\nAfter Red Hat's announcement to stop investing in CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer announced  to fill in the void of CentOS.  Kurtzer had started CAOS Linux, which was then succeeded by CentOS when Rocky McGaugh, a developer of CAOS rebuilt the source code of RHEL to provide a monetarily free alternative.\n\n\"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\", Kurtzer said to announce the project.  Kurtzer discussed the origins of CentOS and plans for Rocky Linux in an interview with Wikinews.\n\nSpeaking of Rocky Linux, Kurtzer said the \"goal is to be  compatible with RHEL and provide a long life for enterprise needs.\"  He also said existing CentOS operating systems can be converted to Rocky Linux by executing a single command.  Though no formal date of release has been announced, Kurtzer said, it can be expected \"near the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2 2021\", and both  as well as  will be supported.\n\nThere are about 65 developers working on the CentOS replacement, Kurtzer said.  He also added, \"My commitment to the project is that Rocky will always remain in the best interest of the community and everyone who wishes to be part of the organization, with good intentions, will be welcomed.

For the first question, these were opinion pieces written by him, and for the second, these were press releases from a think tank Stanley is involved in.  Those four links are cited in the external links section.\n\nThe first opinion piece addresses housing, calling for, among other things,  to be restricted to those who have resided in the UK for ten years or more, a 20%  on houses sold to foreigners, and abolishing  relief for \"buy to let\" mortgages.  The second opinion piece addressed a  law passed by the Scottish Parliament, and said it threatened freedoms and \"families['] privacy and security of their homes\".\n\nThe two press releases concerned COVID-19.  The first, published in late January 2020, called for mass flu and  vaccination for high risk groups and the banning of flights to and from China, except medical relief flights.  The second, published on 15 March 2020, called for a number of things, including the closure of the UK border, a ,  for all during the crisis, a guarantee of essential utilities, and national procurement of ventilators.\n\n Why did you decide to run in this by-election?\n\n Unionism is building a Britain that puts our most vulnerable first and helps everyone meet their potential.  As a doctor I believe Monklands A&E will close within five years now the trauma department has been removed.  It must come back. Call centre jobs are vital to Airdrie and I'm appalled Teleperformance is shutting the office and working people from home, even spying on them by treating the home as a workshop.  I have outlined my plans to protect working-at-home rights, to stop COVID[-]19 downgrading working conditions.  Freedom is more important than any idea of independence.  We cannot be independent if we cannot speak freely at home so I oppose the Hate Speech Act.\n\n What are your thoughts on how the coronavirus pandemic has been handled by Westminster?\n\n As the Senior Researcher for the , the UK's oldest conservative think tank[,] I called for a public health on COVID[-]19 in January 2020.  I called for border closures, focusing on high risk patients, and getting Vitamin D sent out to everyone in the UK.  There is not a single health professional in the British Cabinet and their manage has been abysmal, inept, dangerous and an economic disaster[.]\n\n What do you think needs to be done to improve transport services in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency?\n\n The first priority is the urgent repair of roads as around 90% of passenger journeys are by car.  In the name of equality, road repair comes before any further public transport investment.  The Scottish Unionists resolve to be the most car friendly party in the United Kingdom.  The treatment of taxi drivers has been a disgrace and money that was meant for them has been held back by the [Scottish National Party] SNP to ransom them in this election.  The  is the top flight provider of public transport.  We back them 100%[.]\n\n Do you support the idea of a ?\n\n We are the Scottish Unionist Party, so no[.]\n\n Do you think the Conservative government is doing enough to combat climate change?\n\n The Tories rarely approach a topic using evidence and economic sense.  As a technically advanced economy with global soft power the focus must be on the promotion of technological solutions, not energy austerity.  We favour much more nuclear and  in the UK and to use diplomacy to drive up energy efficiency in the USA and pressure Canada away from oil sands which are extremely polluting.  The WTO [World Trade Organization] based order on tariffs predates the divergence in global environmental standards we are seeing.  We oppose any phase out in fossil fuels for cars and will let technology lead us to carbon free fuels in due course[.]\n\n Why did you make the decision to also run for the  in the Holyrood election?\n\n These elections are close in timing but different in nature.  A4U is about maximising the pro-UK vote with a crisp consistent message that voters can follow.  We aim to remove the SNP from government and audit Holyrood.  George Galloway has taken a team approach and invited the skills needed for a true turnaround team.  This is the first stage in encouraging other parties to work together by leaving them to contest constituencies. We have made tactical voting our number one strategy and it is now the main issue of the election.  That achievement is extraordinary in such a short time when canvassing was impossible.\n\n What reason do voters have to give you their vote over a number of other pro-union parties?\n\n As above.  Candidates were invited to form a team around a mission.  Only A4U has sought to cooperate with legacy parties even when we disagree with them on many things, we are the only party in this election that is goal orientated.  That's new and for the establishment it's terrifying.\n\n You left UKIP in 2015 over what you said was racism and bullying.  What led you to the Scottish Unionists?\n\n Elements in UKIP attempted to adopt sectarianism as way to appeal for segments of the Unionist community.  Growing up in  where Catholic and Protestants live together happily this was  to me.  It reflected the divisive goals of the SNP and I have no patience with such cynical indulgent behaviour.  I rejoined the Tories to further Brexit and left when they resorted to tribal blackmail over a second referendum to win a few seats.  The Scottish Unionists are a British party that welcomes people of all religious traditions, always conscious of Britain's Christian heritage.\n\n What is a local issue that you think isn't being addressed that should be?\n\n  is being failed as are so many district general hospitals where politicians want to centralise services and power to serve big cities where the votes are.  Distance matters to emergency care.  It's a matter of life and death.  I've seen it when people take too long to get to A&E because they don't have a car.  For a young mum with children or an elderly couple, a round trip in a taxi of one hour is very expensive night out.  Distance punishes those least mobile.  It's obvious if you think about it.\n\n If you're elected, what's one thing you'd like to change about the law?\n\n I worked with my boss  MEP [Member of the European Parliament] helping a Catholic family in Liverpool trying to save their child  from having life support turned off.  The hospital went as far as banning the child from being treated elsewhere and spent tens of thousands in court fees to this end.  I saw a young doctor, , destroyed by a pernicious GMC [] who used members' fees to pursue her to destroy her.  So I'm going to support both Alfie's Law and [Hadiza]'s Law:\n\nAlfie's Law, No hospital must ever deny the right of any patient, in any condition, to be treated by another willing and able provider.\n[Hadiza]'s Law.

We as a party supported the , but since then have been sceptical of the ongoing Stop-Go approach which didn't suppress the virus and has only served to undermine peoples liberties, and risked causing a prolonged economic depression and negative impact on society.\n\n What do you think needs to be done to improve transport services in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency?\n\n Our primary policy pledge for transport is to nationalise the rail system, and in the first instance to assert greater control over bus services, particularly an increase in funding support for regional and rural bus travel.\n\n Do you support the idea of a ?\n\n No.  The constitution is a reserved matter and the UK Parliament agreed to a referendum which resulted in the decision of the Scottish people to remain in the the United Kingdom.  Any change would need to first be discussed and agreed at Westminster.\n\n Do you think the Conservative government is doing enough to combat climate change?\n\n Environmental issues suffer from too much talk and not enough action under the current (and previous) governments.  Whilst the SDP will honour and comply with our global environmental obligations, we would look to implement sustainable changes by encouraging behavioral changes within industry and society as a whole.\n\n The SNP describes themselves as social democratic.  Where are some primary areas of difference between your party and theirs?\n\n Firstly, we'd disagree that the SNP are social democrats, they're populists.  The SDP are actually social democrats in our every day thinking, beliefs and policies - and not just at election time.  We're also patriotic, and believe in a strong Scotland within a strong United Kingdom for the benefit of all its citizens.\n\n Do you agree with your party's policy that an  should be established?\n\n Yes, I believe this policy can assist in healing many of the divisions we see across the UK, ending the perception of the UK Parliament as an English parliament with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under its rule.  This multi-tiered approach dissolves accountability, fosters a culture of apathy and creates a vacuum where parties like the SNP thrive.\n\n What does  mean to you?\n\n The SDP seeks the common good in Britain's national interest.  We represent neither capital nor labour, not private industry nor the public sector, but only the welfare of the British people and residents of these islands.  We seek a path where all the constituent elements of our society can grow and prosper.  We believe in a Social Market Economy where pro-public sector and pro-market policy can beneficially coexist within a balanced programme – provided each inhabits its correct domain, and neither is allowed to distort our country's economy in the service of ideology.\n\n What is a local issue that you think isn't being addressed that should be?\n\n I have concerns over the long term plans for our sports and leisure facilities in our local towns and communities throughout the constituency.  Many are potentially at risk due to continuing Scottish Government funding cuts to council budgets and access for people of all ages to these facilities to improve our physical and mental health is vital, even more so now to ensure our recovery from Covid[-19].\n\n If you're elected, what's one thing you'd like to change about the law?\n\n I'd support the repeal of the much-maligned SNP Hate Crime and Public Order Act, which threatens to criminalise speech on a range of issues if it is thought to be 'hateful'.  We feel the bill is ambiguous and lacks sufficient safeguards, even after a recent campaign found that 87 per cent of Scots hold free speech to be an 'important right'.  The Hate Crime Bill also raises issues over the erosion of sex-based rights.  Within the SDP Transgender and Biological Sex-based Rights policy, we state that it is our belief that biological sex is real, and pledge to support the use of plain English for discussions of biological sex in health and reproductive care.", "question": "When is the by-election to elect a replacement MP for Airdrie and Shotts scheduled to take place?  \nA) May 6  \nB) May 13  \nC) May 20  \nD) April 30"}

Of them,  Adrian Mizher agreed to answer some questions by phone on March 30 about their campaigns and policies.  The following is the interview with Mr Mizher.\n\nMizher describes himself as a senior loan closer on his  profile at , a -based subsidiary of .  He has lived in  for five years and the  for 16 of the last 24 years.  A  graduate of , he grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and has lived for eight years in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  He endeavours to bring \"a never ending fight for fidelity to the Constitution and promotion of our Conservative values\", speaking to Wikinews on matters ranging from the economy to immigration.\n\nAn Inside Elections poll published on March 18 shows Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, is ahead by 21% followed by Democrat  with 17% and Republican  with 8% with a 4.6%  among 450 likely voters.  The district is considered \"lean Republican\" by Inside Elections and voted 51% in favour of Donald Trump in last year's US presidential election.  This is down from 54% for Trump in 2016's presidential election, the same poll stated.\n\n: Could you please introduce yourself, your history and your background in politics and otherwise?\n\n Well, my name is Adrian Mizher.  I don't have much history in official politics — I've never run for office before — but I have been paying attention to politics my whole life, I have been playing close attention to it, so I feel myself just as knowledgeable as anyone else is on the issues of the day, and the history of the news and politics during my lifetime, like I said I have been paying close attention to.  So, that's pretty much it in terms of the history of politics.  This is my first foray into a[n] official race for either national or local politics.\n\nI graduated college in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in accounting from  in . I have a wife, three children.  I was a history and math teacher for five years after college and then got into banking; have been in banking for the last 16 years. That's it, that's my résumé!\n\n What are, in your opinion, the powers and duties of the ?\n\n Well, as it lists in the Constitution: to carry out the duties that the Constitution lists for Congress to do in , Section 8 and to uphold that Constitution against any invasion both foreign and domestic as the  says.  Primarily, what a representative is supposed to do is carry the power of the purse and make sure that the  is such that fits with its Constitutional limitations, which of course they are certainly not doing and haven't done for quite a long time. \n\n You're running as an independent in a House district controlled by the Republicans since 1983, and currently contested by both major parties as well as the Libertarian Party.  Why do you think Texas will elect an independent this time?\n\n Well, I think if people get to know my viewpoints, they will see that they are very grounded in the Constitution and in our Founding Principles, and they are very conservative at heart: things that the Republican Party should be, but often is not.  We, not necessarily just from this district, but we have elected many Republicans to Congress who, when they get there, don't act so Republican.  So, in this case, because it was a unique situation, I chose to take a label that would be more clear about the message I want to bring: even clearer than the label of 'Republican'.  So, I put down on my application 'Constitution Party', so I would run under the banner of the Constitution Party.  The 's office then informed me, after they have said \"yes, I can put that\" that the Constitution Party, while it is a political party, is not officially registered with the Secretary of State, so they couldn't list me under that name on the ballot, and so my choice at that point was to be listed as an independent, which I took.  So, it's not so much a calculation of \"I think Texas will elect an independent\" in a Republican-controlled district as it was the ability to, like I said, make a clearer messaging on my label rather than just the label \"Republican\", without it being political suicide like it would be in a normal election and without it  away from another Republican any more than it will be completely splintered with all 23 candidates.\n\n What do you think about the governance of the late Ron Wright [...] the election itself was of course called because of his death?\n\n Yes, his untimely passing is very sad.  I thought Ron was an excellent Congressman.  I met Ron several times, had some private conversations with him, and I have to give him great credit for doing everything, as far as I know, that he said in his  he was going to do.  And everything he told me, like I said, in private, that he would be interested in getting done.  He went out and voted the right way, and did the best he could to get that done.  So, I have nothing but good things to say about Congressman Wright — I thought he did a great job for our district and I'm sorry to see that he's gone.\n\n What are some of the most pressing issues you will raise to Congress if elected?\n\n The one I already mentioned, almost to the exclusion of all else, which is to shrink the size of the federal government and the federal budget.  The federal government is far too large, it is far too involved in our everyday lives.  It's far too outside the bounds of its constitutional limitations.  And I fear we are headed towards even worse things to come, and we need to turn that around and bring it back down to the size that it was always intended, and make our local and state governments more important in our lives and the federal government less important.  That's by far the number one issue in for Congressman Mizher.  And that's by far the number one issue that I want to speak about on the campaign trail. \n\nOther issues that are also of importance: election integrity.  Unfortunately, it's always been of course important, but it is all that much more important nowadays after the  that we just went through.  Whether or not that election was \"stolen\", as people say, I really don't know.  I certainly don't have evidence to show that it was, nor have I seen foolproof evidence to show that it wasn't, but the problem is that so many people believe it was.  Whether it was or was not, the fact that many people think it was — that's an issue, and we have to do something to make sure that people have confidence in the elections.  If we don't have that, we don't have anything and, unfortunately, more  will ensue because of that feeling if we don't get a handle on it.  So, that is another hugely important issue that Congressman Mizher wants to speak about and work on. \n\nImmigration is another big issue.   is a problem, and we need to make it easier and simpler and less costly to legally immigrate; we should be welcoming all the immigrants that we can that want to come here, and we should be glad to have them.  And, often the Republican Party does not speak in those words, and they ought to,  because we're so anxious to , as well we should.  But, the best way to stop the flow of illegal immigration is to make our legal immigration system much simpler and more easy to access, as well as, like I said, less costly and less time-consuming.  And, I think most people would choose to legally immigrate if we could make the system better than it currently is. \n\n Your website says both \"we must remain a sovereign nation who is in control of all our borders\" and \"our immigration process should be simple enough that a child can follow it.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n Yeah!  I think it also says on the website, if I can quote myself, that if somebody wants to come here—I certainly believe in the  that's on the : that we do want the world's , and those that were not wanted somewhere else, and they may not have amounted to something somewhere else in the world, but they .  And they can with the freedom and opportunity that our country provides; we want them and we want them to achieve their best and make us better by them coming here, as have waves of immigrants in the past, of which all of us, (), have descended from.  And, we need to continue that pattern where we are welcoming immigrants to come here. \n\nTo elaborate on how to make the process simpler: if they don't have a communicable disease, if they do not have a history of criminal activity, if they're willing to learn English — of course they may or may not know English when they show up at our doorstep — and if they're willing to learn American history — they may or may not know that when they show up at our doorstep — and, down the road are willing to  to our flag and our values and say \"yeah, I'd like to be an American\", then we want them!  If they're not bringing us harm, either through physical disease or criminal behaviour, we want them.  And then, all we ask is that those simple things — learn our language,  while bringing your own culture and its influences to us to improve what we have here in our  — and we want you.  And then, you can be allowed in on a temporary basis to do whatever it is you've stated you've come here to do, and then work your way towards citizenship — and again, I wouldn't make it be that long; I know now people have thrown around 'seven years', '14 years', to me that seems too long!\n\nIf somebody wants to be here and wants to be an immigrant, we want them to be here.  Again, within certain limitations: we can't take everybody, but we certainly should have an annual cap of some kind — I don't have a particular number in mind on what that would be — but I want people to be here who want to be here.\n\n Your website states \"as the , did we must appeal to the Supreme Judge for our \"; \"we must regain the firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence as our Declaration urges us to seek.\"  Could you please elaborate on that?\n\n Well, I think it sort of speaks for itself.  America and its founding is inextricably tied to  and a belief in God and a , if they don't use the word 'God' in the , but in the divine — if you read the writings that they wrote to each other at the time, clearly all of these men had some belief to some extent or another in the supernatural, in the divine, in something , in something — a guiding hand — that we have over us that provides us values and a moral code to which we should aspire. \n\nAnd, I think that America has been throwing that away for at least half a century now, and running as quickly as we can in the opposite direction throughout my lifetime.  Most of the time, I see God and Godly values, especially those of Christianity, if not other religions, trashed and ridiculed and made fun of in popular culture, and I think that has a corrosive effect on our society that I think is very detrimental.  And, I think it is one of, if not the main cause of many of the social ills we see today; is the fact that many people do not have this belief that there is something greater than themselves: something to which they must aspire to.  And therefore we're all a little kingdom unto ourselves  what we believe to be right and wrong, and where we differ it's just going to be the guy with the biggest stick who gets to beat his way onto the other guy.  And, I think that's a very dangerous place to be, and I hope we turn around from that direction and go back to where our roots were in our founding.\n\n How will you handle the  if elected?\n\n How would I handle the vaccine rollout if elected?  Well, I'm not sure that that's Congress' responsibility to decide how to handle the vaccine rollout.  Get as many vaccines out as quickly as we can, and let the states governments and local governments decide how best to distribute them to their population, and pretty much just be out of the way and do what they need to have done. \n\n How will you help the economically-disadvantaged if elected?\n\n I think the best way to help the economically disadvantaged is to put that help as close to them as possible, and to get it out of Washington, D.C.  I think every time Washington D.C. tries to help people, they almost always create more trouble than they solve.  So, those who are economically disadvantaged are going to best be helped by their friends and family and communities and local organisations and charities that are near them and on the ground.  The argument will come back the other way: \"well, what about those who fall through the cracks?\"  Well, that is what local and state government is for.  I don't believe Americans are so callous that they'll let people be starving or destitute on the street who don't want to be.  They will find a way to help their fellow man.\n\nRight now, a lot of people just pass by those on the street we see that are destitute because \"you know what?  I've paid taxes, and the federal government is taking care of that, therefore I've already done my duty\".  But I would like to devolve that back to the localities and to personal responsibility to say, \"You know what?  The homeless in your area, those who are sick in your area and don't have healthcare, those who are poor and need food in your area: they're your responsibility.  And I want you people, the locals to pick those up for, again, friends, family, churches, local communities, charities\" and, if all else fails and a government needs to step in so we don't have those sick and starving, then that should be as local a government as possible because it will provide the best help for that person rather than the big meat  from Washington, D.C. that just has to throw out money in a one-size-fits all sort of solution.  Plus, it will be allowed to require back from the person receiving help certain responses that you would want from this person so that hopefully, they are not continually needing of this help but only on a temporary basis. \n\nAnd, I'm happy to help you out, and here is how we can get on a path where you won't need my help anymore.  That's much more likely to come from local help than it is from a cold and distant help from Washington, D.C.\n\n What are your thoughts on President [Joe] Biden?\n\n [laughs] I think you could probably guess based by what I'm saying!  He's far too much into the left-wing agenda.  You know, I think, like a lot of politicians Joe Biden is doing what he needs to do in order to satisfy the constituency he continues to satisfy to stay in power.  I'm not even sure all the things he's proposing are things Joe Biden really believes are going to work.  I mean, I think that's true of a lot of politicians: I think they propose and promote theories and ideas that they themselves don't even truly believe in oftentimes, but they know that they need to do these things for political expediency.  And, I think his agenda is far too left-wing and unconstitutional, and I don't support it from — almost all of it. \n\n All right, moving onto the complete other side of it, what are your thoughts on the former President [Donald] Trump?\n\n Ah, President Trump!  I think President Trump did a lot of great things for the United States of America.  I give him a lot of credit for much of , although not all of it.  Especially in the Middle East, where he was successful in bringing about peace agreements; I am a strong supporter of his , I thought that was a great and courageous move.  For the most part, I think he did a pretty good job of appointing  to the , although I'm slightly disappointed in all three of his  to the Supreme Court, but certainly better than some that we've had in the past. \n\nI think President Trump gets a lot of credit for de-regulation and cutting of government , which helped the economy quite a bit, and certainly is in line with my philosophy of governance and how things should go.  I'm a bit frustrated with President Trump on two subjects: one, his caustic and divisive nature did not win as many converts as could have, if he had learned how to speak a little better and more politely.  I do like, in fact, the thing I probably like most about him is we finally had a Republican — a big national Republican who was willing to fight the left — most Republicans that I see are spineless cowards and not willing to fight the left and they run cowering into the corner afraid to be called a racist and a bigot and a  and a  and a  and all the other names that leftists like to put on us.   Trump did not run from that and I appreciate that — that he was willing to fight the left, and he stood strong against all of their attacks, especially from the leftist media — I know I'm talking to the media now so pardon me for disparaging you — so I really appreciate that about Donald Trump that he was a fighter and that he was willing to fight for the values that I believe in.\n\nBut, I think he often did it in a[n] overly brash, overly caustic, overly harsh way that wasn't necessary.  And was not able to explain why.  The conservative values that he says he held — in which he governed from for the most part — why those were a better way, and he needs to — any national leader needs to be able to do that.  It's fine to speak to the choir — I could go to a room of Republicans and they'd all applaud [for] everything I've told you so far.  But that doesn't do us very much good unless we can convince independents and Democrats to say \"hey, you know what?  This smaller government thing, this constitutionally-limited government thing, this really is a good idea!  This is actually the best way to help the poor, this is actually the best way to get people healthcare, this is actually the best way to take care of the environment and all the other issues\" that we are often told we don't care about.\n\nAnd last point on President Trump: frustrated quite a bit with his attitude.  He made it difficult to defend him, oftentimes, and that's a frustrating thing because you want to defend the agenda, but then when he does or says some things that are indefensible, it becomes difficult because those two things are so tied together.  And lastly, my biggest criticism of Donald Trump is he did not cut the size of the federal government.  Donald Trump talked a lot about 'better' government: \"I'm going to do this better than Obama\", \"I'm going to do that better than Obama\", \"I'm going to be more efficient\", \"I'm going to cut red tape\": that's great.  But I want smaller government, Mr President.  I want you to cut spending, but he didn't do — he spent more money than Obama did!  And, I have a real problem with that.  That is not conservative.  And, that's often true of a lot of Republicans.  They talk a lot like I do, about  but when they get their hands in the pie, they like to spend as much as anybody else.  And I have a real problem with that.  I think that was the biggest failing of President Trump.\n\n Do you have any remaining thoughts on the ongoing  crisis?\n\n Well yes, I have a lot of thoughts, I mean, as you can tell, I have a lot of thoughts and opinions about everything!  The current border crisis I find interesting — again, both sides like to use this to  the other side with.  When President Trump was in office,  were awful.  Now that President Biden's in office, these aren't kids in cages, they're merely  until we can find some better place for them to be.  But Republicans will say \"hey, when Trump was in office [...] those aren't kids in cages, we have to stop the bleeding\" but now all of a sudden Biden's in office \"look at him he's so cruel\" and I'm very frustrated with the illegal immigration debate because frankly, it's not that difficult to solve.\n\nIt's gonna be a lot like how we decide to let people in or out of our house as a guest.  We check them out: if we think they're safe, we're going to let them in and welcome them in.  If not, then we won't and we need more , we need more case workers, we need more personnel there to deal with these millions coming over.  And then we can enforce the few laws we should have, the very simple process that we should have, we should be able to enforce it very strictly.  And, we're not.  But it's not just Joe Biden's fault, which is what a lot of Republicans would tell you.  Suddenly now this is this huge crisis and before it was not.  That's not true.  Now, it's more of a crisis now because Biden said \"yeah, welcome in, we have open borders\" so of course more are coming, but is the practice really all that different than what President Trump was doing?  And, frankly I don't see the evidence that it is.\n\nAnd, that's bothersome to me: that both sides use the issue, but both sides don't seem to really to want to solve the issue unless the other side  and solves it their way.  Now, that's very bothersome to me.\n\n Regarding the economy, your website states your goal in office will be to \"begin to move us towards a more balanced approach\" because \"our society's foundation and framework are far outside of the needed balance.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n Well, I'm a big fan of  over , which is under heavy attack nowadays: that \"capitalism is bad\".  But I think that there, again, this goes to Republicans not being able to explain our messaging very well.  There are problems with capitalism too, and a much better term for the system that we should have, but don't have, is the .  Because capitalism, the left is, in many ways correct.  It rewards greed, and it rewards  in some ways.  I'm not a big fan of big business either, I do agree they try to keep all the money for themselves and mistreat their workers — I am one of those workers and I've worked for a living my whole life, and they're right.  The employer is absolutely trying to pay you as little as possible and get as much work out of you as possible.  Of course!\n\nAnd the worker is of course trying to get as much money as possible for as little effort as possible.  Naturally.  Now there's nothing wrong with either of those doing that, we just got to understand that's what human nature is.  And so capitalism does reward those with the capital, and therefore the rich are advantaged.  And I have a problem with that.  The government should not give an advantage to the rich.  The government should have a free enterprise — I think that's a much better word for it — point of view where it gives no preference to either.  Here's an example: if somebody comes to my little town in Kennedale, and it's Amazon[.com], and Amazon says \"you know what?  We want to set up a huge plant and we're going to employ 25 thousand people.\"  Well I can promise you that plant will be under construction very, very quickly.  They will get , the red carpet will be rolled out for them, all the regulations will be waived as much as possible and Amazon will be in business as quickly as possible.  But if you or I wanted to start a little coffee shop, it's not that they would tell us \"no\", but we would certainly have to pay for all of the necessary fees.  We would have to go through all of the hoops that are naturally there, and we would be disadvantaged as opposed to Amazon.  I have a problem with that, when the rich guy gets the red carpet rolled out for him and the small guy doesn't, and that's what capitalism does.  And, I think our government needs to take a much more even-handed balanced approach to not providing those preferences, and I think we would have more small- and medium-sized businesses which then would increase , and I'm just not a fan of  and there's a lot of businesses in this country that are too big to fail and are able to easily crowd out the smaller guys.  And I don't like that. \n\n What are your thoughts on the size of the US military?\n\n It's too big.  As far as I know, I would need some justification for why we have to be that big.  Now this is not going to be popular for me amongst Republicans, I'm going to get attacked by the right on that.  But unless I can have some justification for why we are spending more than — again here's a leftist talking point — more than the other nine countries behind us combined — yeah!  I'd like to know why we're doing that too  If we conservatives — if we constitutionalists think that  is a waste of money and 's a waste of money and 's a waste of money and the 's unconstitutional and a waste of money and the 's unconstitutional and a waste of money but  doesn't?  I don't understand that logic.\n\nThe Pentagon wastes a lot of money, just as much as anybody else.  Because the federal government can't do anything well without wasting money — any large enterprise like that naturally; gather that many human beings together trying to do something and there's going to be a waste of energy and money.  The Pentagon needs to have its belt tightened quite a bit, and it needs to justify more for why it has the money it has, rather than just having it.  Now as a Congressman, I wouldn't be in charge like the President is, but I would think the President would want an answer to say \"hey, why are we doing this?  Why do we have soldiers over there?\" 'Cause I can't stand news reports where I hear \"three Americans died in a helicopter crash today in Namibia\" and why are we even having soldiers in Namibia?  And that's a real problem to me, and what a Congressman is able to do about that is to hold the purse-strings until he gets justification from The Pentagon as to why it needs as much money as they want.\n\nSo, your question was the size of the military, right?  Wasn't that your original question.  And the bottom line is it's too big.  It's too big.  It does not need to be that big.  It needs to be smaller than it is, unless we have some justification that can be given to say \"hey, we need this and we need to do that with it\", okay.\n\n What are your thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\n Um, I think it is a big problem, but not for the reasons that, again, you're gonna — I guess this makes me sound more independent every time I say \"both sides\", but it is not for the reasons that leftists are trying to teach us, which is that America's a horrible  -marked place that can never recover from its racist past.  I don't believe that to be true.  Certainly there are elements of racism still around, and in government, and people are not being treated right from time-to-time over the issue of race.  And where that is occurring, it must be shouted loudly and mercilessly stomped out.  I will be the first in line to end any form of racism from anybody anywhere, but I think that that is overused in today's society; the left finds it everywhere!  Racism, racism, racism to the point where it means nothing anymore.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, I think it does crowd out the fact that there are two systems of justice.  There's a system of justice for the haves: if you can hire the better lawyer who can play the game better, you're probably going to have a better chance, and the have-nots, who are not going to get as good a shake in the justice system.  It is unfortunately not as blinded as our  tell us that it is.  Now, this won't make me popular on the left but I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton or , I feel like they're getting away with stuff.  Again, do I have proof of that?  Of course not, I'm reading biased news like everybody else.  My judgement is they're getting away with stuff.  But I am for sure that prominent Republicans get away with stuff too.  Prominent non-political figures get away with stuff.  There are definitely, as John Edwards famously said — somebody whose policies I can't stand but he was correct in this, although not for the reasons he said, — \"there are \"; there are two systems of justice, that's true.\n\nAmerica does have a problem with , much more so than it has a problem with racism.  But because we are so hyper-focused — oftentimes where it doesn't exist — on racism, the classism gets covered up.  So our justice system needs to be more responsive and — like I said with everything else — more localised.  I would love to see a justice system — the example I always use, it's going to get scoffed at by many people,  is , .  And that's a fake TV show and of course reality can't mirror that, but if we could try, that would be the right way to go where justice, is that we call it a 'justice system' but it so often doesn't dispense justice and it operates much more like a legal system rather than a justice system and it dispenses legal opinions. \n\nAnd again, if you're better at playing the game, you're more likely to have a good outcome and it should not be that way.  It needs to be more localised, under more local control where you know your police officer's name who's getting you in trouble, where you know the judge's name who you're going before and he knows your name and he says \"Hey Adrian, what're you in here for?  Oh, okay.\" and he can dispense then actual justice, which is going to be a blend of  and mercy and  tailored to what I need, or what that criminal needs.  So again, that devolving of the power back towards the people, I think that's the better way to do better justice system than we have now.\n\n What are your thoughts on Medicare?\n\n I think it's completely unconstitutional and eventually — I need to stress that word: eventually — it needs to be done away with.  It is not the federal government's responsibility to be providing healthcare or access to healthcare — not actually providing healthcare, providing access to healthcare or healthcare insurance to the poor and those who don't have it.  It is a bad idea to think that the federal government is going to distribute that and do it well.  There are much better ways to provide healthcare.  If a government needs to be providing healthcare to somebody it should be the state government, or even better their local city government who can dispense a form of what we now call Medicare.  But, it's definitely unconstitutional.  There's no way to justify that. \n\nJust because it's unconstitutional doesn't make it a bad idea — there are some things that are unconstitutional that \"yes, yeah you're right Adrian it's not in the Constitution but it's still a good idea\".  This is both unconstitutional and a bad idea.  It is not a good idea for us to pay money to Washington, D.C. so they can turn around and pay it back to us in the form of helping the poor have access to healthcare that they otherwise wouldn't.  So, eventually it needs to be done away with.  We can't go in there guns blazing like a bull in a china closet and just start yanking the rug out from everybody and cutting these programmes off, because you're going to cause more human suffering than you're going to solve.  But it needs to be rolled back, and people need to understand that we are headed the other direction, guys.  You're gonna have to solve your own problems more locally, and think of solutions for yourselves more locally rather than relying on us to do it up in Washington [D.C].\n\n What are your thoughts on the rise in  as a result of the  and recent  in Atlanta?\n\n I'm not sure there is a rise in anti-Asian sentiment, I know the media tells us there is.  Again, like I said before about racism — I don't want to say there's notnot, I certainly can't prove there isn't a rise in anti-Asian sentiment, I'm just not sure that there is.  And, from what I understand — I'm no expert on what happened in Atlanta a couple weeks ago, — but my understanding is that it didn't have anything to do with race.  It happened to be that most of the victims were Asian, but that that was not the intended target, necessarily, of the perpetrator, the criminal.  So, again, I am leaving room for myself to be wrong there, or in many other famous incidents that get reported on the news about racism.  From what I can tell, it does not appear to be a racially-motivated issue.\n\nSo, I will take issue with the question at first.  I am not sure — although I am not-not sure — that there is a rise in anti-Asian sentiment.  This pandemic has been around with us for a year, so you would think we would be hearing more about this anti-Asian sentiment since then, so it seems a little opportunistic now as an issue for certain politicians — mostly on the left — to use to their advantage.  But, if there is anti-Asian sentiment, like any other racist nonsense, it must be stamped out mercilessly.  First we must show that it's true, and then once demonstrated, it has to be ostracised completely from our society.  To judge somebody on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity to me is the most intellectually-vapid, stupid, moronic, nonsensical thing I've ever heard of.  And where that exists, we have to destroy it.\n\n What are your thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China [on March 19, 2021]?\n\n Well, again, I need to know more to really determine.  Reading the media that I enjoy reading because they agree with my point of view, well, he got taken to school and they took him out of the woodshed and embarrassed us, you know.  I don't know, I don't know that that's true, so I need to know more to really have an opinion on his recent talks with China.  I'm nervous — I don't trust that Joe Biden is ready to stand up to China in a way that needs to be done, but these most recent talks, again I don't have enough evidence to have an opinion on it and say \"yeah, he really screwed up\" in this way or that way.  It's more of a feeling of general distrust that he is not going to stand up to China in the way that the United States needs to, because China definitely is our most pressing foreign threat at the moment.\n\n The  of February left millions without power, including of course the 6th district, sometimes for days.  Its damages are estimated at USD 195 billion and 111 [people] are estimated to have been killed.  How will you endeavour to prevent this from happening again if elected?\n\n Well, my house was one of those that was without power and mine is one of the ones with a few thousand dollars worth of damage, so I certainly feel the issue personally.  Although, I was out of town —  — I was out of town when this happened on a long-ago scheduled trip, so  my adult children were here in the house and had to deal with that.  But, my house was definitely affected.\n\nIt is not primarily the federal government's responsibility to solve that problem or to prevent it from happening again.  So, I'm not trying to duck your question, but along with my philosophy of smaller federal government — this is one of the areas where I don't want us looking to our federal officials and say \"what would you do to solve it.\"  Now, what a federal official could do is certainly put pressure on the state officials to solve it and, again, from what I've read — no fully informed expert here — but from what I've read in the media about what happened, we've got quite a few problems: that our power plants are not winterised — naturally, we're in Texas, this doesn't happen very often, — is it really worth wasting the money winterising them or should we just suffer like we did every hundred years when this freak storm comes through.  But what was more bothersome to me is hearing that all of the members, or most, of the members from  [Electric Reliability Council of Texas] were not even citizens of this state! \n\nSo, I have criticisms of the way the state government seems to have things set up.  But I would say primarily it's a state government issue to find out the reasons for and resolve rather than a federal issue.  Because frankly, energy production and distribution, again, is not in the Constitution and there should not be a Department of Energy or a federal role in taking on such things.\n\n What else would set you apart from the Republican Party and other candidates who would also claim to promote \"conservative values\"?\n\n I'm sure we're all going to get asked that: \"eleven of you Republicans, Adrian — who's an independent but, you know promotes himself as a conservative and constitutionalist — so how are you guys all different, you all sound the same and say the same things.\"  I agree, and I'm glad for that.  I don't to distinguish — I don't want to look for ways to say \"hey, let me say it a little bit differently this way so I distinguish myself from them\"; I hope that all twelve of us — as well as the Libertarian, as well as Phil — and, for that matter any of the Democrats, all want to promote constitutionalism and constitutional ways of governance at the federal level.  So, I'm happy that we all sound the same, if indeed we do. \n\nSo, where I may or may not have separated myself in these answers already, I'll leave that to you, but one thing I do believe separates me — and I know all these people personally — but I definitely think I am going to be the loudest and most aggressive voice for our conservative values of anybody in the field, and we need that.  We need somebody not just with the right ideas in their head, but somebody who has the spine and the aggressiveness to tirelessly and  go after it, the way the left does for their values.  We must have that same intensity, we must have that same drive that they do, and I believe I'm able to explain these values to others in a way — like I criticised President Trump for that he could not — I am able to explain this in a way that I believe won't convince everybody, certainly, you never will do that, but will be able to convince many people that the conservative values doesn't equal racism, the conservative values doesn't equal hates the poor, hates minorities, hates women, things the left portrays us as.  We have to fight against that and I think I, and my personality, would both couple the aggressiveness, but also the ability to explain these values to people who may not currently understand them and have a misconception of what conservatism is.\n\n How has COVID-19 affected your campaign?\n\n COVID-19 has not affected my campaign that I can tell.  Now, I have never campaigned without COVID-19 around so I guess I don't have a reference point, but I can't tell an effect that COVID-19 has had on my campaign. \n\n If you aren't elected this time, what are your ambitions for the future?\n\n I think that remains to be seen.  I don't know.\n\n Lighthearted comment before we finish this: which historical figure do you identify with the most, and why?  It is an open-ended question.\n\n I would say my favourite historical — I would say , who is certainly historical, but to me is well beyond historical as my favourite, but that also takes us out of \"light-hearted\" and into a much more serious spiritual place.  So I'll say  is my favourite historical figure, somebody who I have tremendous admiration for.  Working under the difficult circumstances that he did and the growth that he showed in his political life from where he was in the 1850s to right up to ; how he showed growth in his opinions and came to understand — again I believe in divine guidance — things that he previously had not understood.  So, I think Abraham Lincoln would be my favourite although I don't know that I'm a whole lot like Lincoln other than sharing the same values.\n\nSo, I certainly have great admiration for Ronald Reagan as well: that's definitely someone I want to be like.  Speaking of lighthearted, but his lighthearted humour and his ability to connect with people on that level is something I feel I am like and certainly aspire to be.  So I picked two obvious ones.  Yeah, kind of bland, right?  Ask a Republican: \"who do you want to be like?\"  \"Oh, Lincoln and Reagan...\", so yeah.  Sorry that it's so generic.\n\n Any final comments?\n\n Nope!  I'm pretty sure I laid it out, said it all.  If I have a closing statement it's going to be to repeat what I said in the opening.", "question": "What position does Adrian Mizher hold regarding the size of the federal government and its involvement in people's lives?  \n\nA) He believes it should be expanded to better serve citizens.  \nB) He advocates for a smaller government that adheres to constitutional limitations.  \nC) He wants the government to take over healthcare completely.  \nD) He supports increased military funding to strengthen government presence."}

According to his web site, Sturm has a career in \"manufacturing and operations\".  According to his web site's 'civic vitae' section, Sturm was co-chair for the  (Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party), District 62 in 2005 and a member of Veterans for Kerry.\n\nHe was a volunteer special deputy in , Minnesota, a member of the  emergency helpline workgroup for the  (MPD), the 9/11 and  Remembrance Task Force with the  and the racial equity fund with .\n\nAccording to Minneapolis' official website  won the last election in 2017 receiving 44.69% of the vote in the final round of voting.   reported Frey announced his run for re-election January 21.  Sturm registered his candidacy on March 22.\n\n Please introduce yourself: your history and background.\n\n I'm Phil, 40 years old, married, white.  Moved to Minneapolis in 2003 after being honorably discharged from the .  Born in , TN [Tennessee] but grew up in the suburbs in , MN [Minnesota].  Graduated from  in 1998.  Went to  for 2 years, but stopped going after the  to go back to work.  I work in chemicals and manufacturing.  Solidly middle class now.  I volunteered as a  Special Deputy in 2018–2019 to learn more about public safety, emergency management and community service.  I was privileged to serve on the MPD/911 workgroup which studied and recommended pilot programs for alternative  responses other than police.\n\n What made you decide to run for Minneapolis Mayor?\n\n During the rioting in 2020, one night the mayor and  were giving a press conference at 2 am.  We watched online for two or three days as there was no government, no police and no safety.  The governor is on the TV raving like a lunatic about Russian agents and .  I knew then that we were at the mercy of highly credentialed yet fundamentally incompetent people.  This experience solidified in my mind a need and a growing burden to do something about it.  We have been lurching from crisis to crisis at the hands of so-called experts who consistently fail upwards.  And I'm tired of it.\n\n Please elaborate on your military service.\n\n Joined in February of 1999. Went to boot camp in San Diego, CA [California].  Trained as Combat Engineer.  Spent first year in .  Was assigned to  on , NC [North Carolina] ().  Was on leave when 9/11 happened.  We were assigned to the  [Marine Expeditionary Unit] with .  We captured Kandahar  in Dec[ember] 2001, and began patrol and humanitarian operations in the area.  Served under Gen[eral] .  Did a lot of . \n\nWas  in Jan[uary] 2003 as they were working up to invade Iraq.  Was attached to  as lead engineer element for RCT 1 () under Colonel Dowdy.  Gen[eral] Mattis relieved Col Dowdy for going around Al Kut instead of through it. I would've been one of the first into the city and would've probably been killed or injured if we went that route. I was responsible for  engineer assets, bridge capacities and neutralizing weapons caches, explosives and missiles, as we made our way north. I was sent back home soon after we reached Baghdad when everyone thought the war was over and everything was hunky dory. \n\n Why should Minneapolitans vote for you?\n\n People should vote for me if they want to try something other than the carousel of lawyers, professionals and MBAs that consistently produce substandard results, yet live in a world of awards, back patting, compliments and \"success\".  We are all suffering for it.  I'm an empirically minded person with experience in an industry which demands actual results and you can't fake it.  I understand how to lead martial organizations and the values needed to reign in those cultures when they're out of control.  I am ready and willing to make the necessary enemies, and am not concerned primarily with maintaining professional reputations, contacts and networks so I can get a nice cushy non-profit, consulting, or lobbying job somewhere after being mayor.\n\n Your civic  says you resigned from the 9/11 and GWOT Remembrance Task Force [recently].  Why?\n\n I didn't want a political run to distract from the work of the Task Force or bring negative attention to it, and to avoid seeming like I was using it as a campaign point.\n\n Your web site says \"it is a falsehood that police just need good faith political allies to effect change [...] They [the Minneapolis police] do not view themselves as part of the community\".  Could you please elaborate?\n\n We have listened to police chiefs, sheriffs, and unions now for years offer to \"sit down\" and work on reform \"together\".  This is nothing but lies and stalling and media relations.  They have no interest in sitting down with people who aren't cops and submitting to a reform process that isn't led by them.  The ideology of the , the practice of , their  all speak to an insular and autonomous culture operating in the grey zones of society.  Part of the purpose of my campaign is to clarify where things stand, to say things that need saying, and to say those things other professional politicians can't say.\n\n Your web site also lists your promise to \"systematically dismantle the culture of militarism which is prevailing in police today\", adding \"[w]here there is militarism there is racism.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n Given my experience in the Marine Corps, I was interested in our organizational history during the .  I read a work by a social scientist who studied the effect of colonizing and occupying the global south on social trends in general.  This work studied how the Marine Corps occupation of Haiti under  exacerbated racism, produced new stereotypes, and increased chauvinist impulses in society.  It elucidated the contradiction between trying to \"help\" other nations by militarily occupying them, while back at home racism against those people increases as a result of conflict.  We see the same thing today in the aftermath of occupying Iraq and Afghanistan.  We are there ostensibly to \"help\", but in our helping it foments and fosters a militaristic and xenophobic culture back home.\n\nMilitarism is appropriate in military settings.  It is inappropriate outside of the military.  Militarizing the police leads us to the same contradictions we see in global geopolitics: we are there ostensibly to \"help\" people in poor neighborhoods, but the occupying of those neighborhoods simply leads to an increasingly racist culture within the police force and the / cultures which support them.\n\n Your web site mentions a potential shift in tax burdens \"as necessary to address long standing economic disparities, as no cost is too great to achieve justice and equality.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n By providing sales tax relief and other forms of tax relief to oppressed neighborhoods the tax levy burden would automatically shift by default to other areas of the city, with more money and wealth.\n\n On housing, you have voiced support on your web site for \"a tenant right to purchase, pay to quit notice and eviction protections, as well as rent stabilization.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n I support a yearly  based on inflation plus a set percentage (something around 5%).  In light of the pandemic I support efforts to keep people in housing and making landlords whole under some sort of program afforded by federal relief.\n\n What does Minneapolis lack under Mayor Jacob Frey you hope to supplement?\n\n What I will bring is a more down to earth, empirically based, skeptical point of view to a self-reinforcing professional community that lacks insight into their blind spots, failures and limitations.\n\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n\n I supported .\n\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n\n I supported  and voted for [Tim] Walz.\n\n Who did you support in the 2020 United States presidential election, if anyone?\n\n I supported Bernie Sanders and voted for [Joe] Biden.\n\n The  reported in 2019 only 37% of low-income Minnesota students were proficient in maths and reading, and only 67% of African-American students graduated high school, compared to 88% of white students.  How will you address this, if elected?\n\n The most effective thing we can do in concert with the school board is work on stable housing and food security.  There is already work being done in this area between the city and the schools.  Housing policies can more generally support low income and African American communities by reducing instability, uncertainty and the churn of changing schools and always moving and being shuffled around from lease to lease, which negatively impacts student learning and vitality.\n\n According to  Data, the median black family in the  has a median income of $38,178 a year, compared to the median white income of $84,459; Minnesota as a whole has the biggest income inequality of any state.  How will you address this, if elected[?]\n\n We need to continue supporting living wage polices, enforcement of sick and leave time, and promote stable long term housing solutions which really give people a chance to get on top of bills and start saving some.  We should pursue institutional cooperation with  companies and educational organizations willing to sustain technical and trades education to support our manufacturing industries in the area (medical device, semi-conductor, plastics, prototyping, etc.)\n\n How will you handle the vaccine rollout, if elected?\n\nNo answer was provided.\n\n Hennepin County has confirmed over 120,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 1,700 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.

I often identify with people who aren't immediately identified as leaders or successful, but when the shit hits the fan, they outperform their peers.

So, he had 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, and he's only 60 so that's pretty incredible.  He's a highly decorated veteran; , but if you look at his uniform, there's not even a place to put another medal!  Just about anything you could give him from a , he has earned.  He lives in , Texas.  His family ties, his dad's family, goes back six generations, but he says by an accident of birth he was born in California.  So, he graduated from high school in California and went immediately into the military.  And then, when he came out of the military, he became a single father and so he went back to California where his children were.  And went into the National Guard in California and, at the same time he went to work for the US federal service.  So, with the US federal service he was the non-commissioned officer, operations officer, on the back — he wasn't the commander of the plane, but he was the person that was in-command of everybody on the plane with US national service.\n\nSo he had fourteen deputies under him, and then he was supervising people on three different federal agencies.  He basically, I found he'll say \"oh, I was in the military\" and then when I peel it down and I peel it down it's so much more complex.  There is a time he basically went back to California thinking he'd be closer to his kids, but that was during the George Bush years.  And if you remember what happened to people who go into the National Guard during that period of time, he was deported more during that period of time than otherwise.  He was sent to Panama on drug interdiction, he patrolled the  on drug interdiction and he was the operations commander for emergency management with the state of California while he was there.\n\nHe was the senior non-commissioned officer reporting to a  during the , the  riot, earthquakes, forest fires.  He supervised an aviation unit that flew to this big state, you know, surveying it for wars, he was responsible for moving troops and equipment and people and personnel.  And also his team was directly responsible for the security of the governor and the mayor and their staff during the O. J. Simpson and the Rodney King riots.  So, he has an incredibly wide range of experience.\n\nIn his foreign deployments, and he's been deployed all over the world, he was the  in Iraq, and there was a tactical team that was under his command that was looking for the top generals of the Revolutionary Guard, you know, right after Saddam [Hussein] and you know, that kind of stuff.  He was being a provost marshal, it was the equivalent of being the police chief over a city of 50 thousand and a 75 mile (121 kilometre) radius.  So, he's always been the person that was responsible for the people above him and below him.  He's always been the person that they went to to find solutions.  Whatever was needed, he was the one that was supposed to figure out how to get it and how to take care of it, and this is what he continues to do. \n\n What would he consider the powers of the US representative?\n\n The power of the US representative, in his thing, is the ability to deliver for the people what they need.  He thinks that what most people are doing is not really, you know, that's not really; it upsets him to see so many of our representatives representing a very small number of people instead of really looking out for the majority of the people.  He takes very seriously; he decided to run, he'd been thinking about it for a long time but he made up his mind , because he doesn't believe that there are, he believes that there are too many in Congress that don't understand what their oath of office is.  They don't understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution of the United States, not to any one person or a party.\n\nHe knows that there were too many of them up there that are applauding what [Donald] Trump did, and are saying that it was just a demonstration, or it was just a riot.  And he's been in riots; he knows what a riot is and he knows this was an .  He believes very truthfully that one of the greatest powers that we have is the power to vote, and this was an attempt to abridge the right of people to vote.  And so, a person that's in Congress is a representative of the people that have elected them. And that's the power: the people are the power.  We've lost it, it's been lost because of  and  and many things in that area.  And there's many attempts right now to abridge the vote even further.  And so, he really feels like that we have got to regain more of the seats so that we can protect what he and his friends have fought so hard and given so much to give us, you know.\n\nSo, that's, I guess that's about as good of an answer I know I can give for him.  We've been through this stuff so much now, I've almost got to memorise it.\n\n Alright.  He's running as a Democrat in a house district which is controlled by Republicans since...\n\n He is a life-long Democrat, he's been very active in the Democratic Party; he was the chief of staff and the security officer for Dr Shirley McKellar who ran three times against  down in , and he helped to organise East Texas, and he was very much in favour of Hillary Clinton, and so he was working to try to help, you know get out the vote for Hillary during those years that we was working down there.  And he's participated in the state convention and in the .\n\n Alright, well, my question was he's running as a Democrat in a house district which has been controlled by Republicans since 1983, it's being contested by the Republicans and the Libertarians and an independent.  Why do you think Texans would choose a Democrat this time?\n\n This district has been going .  In , we made a turn in that district.  In fact, the  — Tarrant County is the largest part of the district, and it is now purple.  The two smaller, in fact the last three elections the Democrats would have won if it hadn't been for the Republicans in the small rural counties of  and .  He lives in Midlothian, and that's the part of the county that is — Ellis County — that's been turning blue, and he has a lot of support in that part.  And the Democrats that are running are not running against each other; they're running together.  And they're not in there attacking each other, they're basically running together, and so the district has been turning steadily blue.  There's enough people that are, there's been, you know, it's a matter of building infrastructure.  You build political infrastructure year after year after year, and I believe they really began building that political infrastructure in  in that district, and it's been by certain, it's been by candidates that have run and lost, but they have put certain things in place that the next one can deal with.  And so, there's a possibility.  It's not a done deal.\n\nBut this district, in case you remember, this is a district that ; Phil Gramm was a Republican who went to work for — he lost, he ran for Congress as a Republican and lost, he went to work for a Democrat.  Then, he ran as a Democrat and won, and then he immediately went in and partnered with Ronald Reagan to get  passed.  And, he made  mad, and he pulled him off of all of his committees, and he took his marbles and became a Republican, it's been Republican ever since.  Trickle-down economics has not worked in that district.  The district, especially the two rural counties have got poorer and poorer ever since that happened, and one of the things that really caused that is that trickle-down economics and also the GOP  that had no-strings-attached meant that companies no longer invested in employees' education and training.  They no longer had to invest in upgrading their infrastructure, on upgrading their own [...] on investing here in America.  We lost American jobs, and Ellis and Navarro counties are two counties where they really have lost a lot of jobs.  And, there's been a lot of things that have happened in that district: the housing costs have gone up rapidly, they have less access to healthcare.\n\nSo, there's been a real price.  Now, there's also , who was of course Phil Gramm's , and Ron Wright was Joe Barton's chief of staff during a large part of the time that Joe was on the .  And the main thing Joe did was protect the energy companies.  And here in January, we had a very bad , and the protection that had been given to the energy companies really meant that a lot of Texans really lost their life, and many others basically lost, you know, were out in the cold literally; because they didn't force them to winterise, they set up a scheme to where if they didn't produce the energy — if you don't deliver energy you can profiteer and charge much . \n\nSo, some people are waking up on this.  There's also, there are people that are very staunch, this particular race in particular, you have a real divide between those that are all for Donald Trump and those that aren't.  All twelve of the Republicans voted for Donald Trump in November.  There's only one out of the twelve that says he no longer deserves to be the leader of the party because of January 6.  So, you have a real agreement on Trump's policies, and you also have a great many of them that really believe that the insurrection was just right, you know it was just fine and dandy.  There are a lot of people that don't believe that, and so that's basically what we're saying, you know, is that there's a difference in, and there's a difference in ideology, there's a difference in thought. \n\nNow, no one can say that he's anti-law enforcement because he is law enforcement.  No one can say he's anti-military because he is military.  He's not anti-gun; he is in favour of background checks and controls on assault weapons, but you know this is someone that is the very fabric of this nation.  But yet at the same time, he values civil rights; he worked for immigration for a brief period of time but he's flown the entire border.  He's also been down in Central America so he understands what the root causes are.  That's why these people are coming across the border now.  He sees that there's no simple fix and he knows that it's not the policy of the current administration that's causing that.  He knows that these are factors that would have driven them north no matter who was president.\n\nAnd, there are situations that we've got to change.  So I think that there are enough people that these issues resonate with now, that they may have been oblivious to them before January and before the storm in February, but they're not as oblivious as they were before.  I think there's some Republicans that will stay home.  And this is also another different story.  Usually a Congressional race is only in November.  This is a local race.  We have no way of knowing what's going to happen, because most of the people that vote in the primary and in the general election never show up and vote in a local election.  So, it's going to be real interesting to see what happens with this one.  I've worked a lot of elections, but this one is the strangest I've ever come across.\n\nBut basically, if you look at the demographics, the district has been steadily turning blue.\n\n All right.  Moving on to the reason of course that this election was called at all, the death of Mr Ron Wright, what does he feel about his governance — the governance of the late Ron Wright?\n\n Ron Wright was the  in  for a number of years, and at the same time he was the chief of staff of Joe Barton.  So, Ron Wright is basically just a shadow of Joe Barton.  He was only in office one year.  He did not have the opportunity to really make his own mark on that area because, for one thing he was battling cancer, and he was denying COVID-[19] and ended up, you know, sadly dying from COVID-19.  He was doing quite well, from what I understand in battling his cancer, and then he contracted COVID and was dead almost immediately.  But he was very extremist in many areas.  Mr Eddings is a very devout Christian, but he doesn't go around thumping the Bible, he doesn't go around using his religion as a tool.  Ron Wright did.\n\nRon Wright as the, now, I don't know if Mr Eddings would say this, but I would say this, but as the tax collector of Tarrant County he had  put on all the envelopes so when you got your tax notice from Tarrant County you got it and it said ''.   He had that clearly on the side of the vehicles, and I'm a Christian too but I don't think that was the appropriate thing to do in those places.  And it was done in a very area, but also when he was the mayor pro tem of Arlington, he helped to push through a very extreme  programme.  The way they did that is that they came in, and they first of all leased the city's property, the county's property and the school district's property, and they had the flat prod[uction well]s and the  already in all of these neighbourhoods.  And then they came to the people and they said \"oh, if you don't sign the gas contract, we'll take the gas anyway.\"  But, you know, you've already got this industrial waste dump in your neighbourhood. \n\nAnd so Arlington had, by the time he was no longer mayor pro tem, there were over 300 gas wells in the 99 square miles of Arlington.  I used to live there, and I had to leave because I couldn't breathe, the air quality was so bad.  I had watched our former Congressman, a wonderful man: , who was also a Democrat, then Republican, but I have watched him work for years for where we had a good , where you knew when you built a house what was going to be next to you.  And in that one administration, you know, when Ron Wright was there, they managed to — and of course he was basically also working for Joe Barton — to push this through for the energy companies.  And they basically just completely ruined the entire zoning of Arlington.  And, you know, it's made a real problem for homeowners in that area.  \n\nSo, there's a lot of problems with Ron Wright in what he did, and he basically did not do anything for the people.  There wasn't anything that he fought, he voted time and time again against healthcare, and this district has a higher  rate than most .  It has a higher  than most third-world countries: you're more likely to die within a year of giving birth if you're a woman living in Tarrant County than you are if you live in most African countries.  So, he basically is voting against healthcare and voting against , saying that he's pro-life while he's putting in place policies that are causing women and babies to die, and not doing anything about it.  \n\nHe didn't do anything about bringing good jobs to the area, he was so determined to use Joe Barton's vote to protect the  companies that he didn't do anything about — he kept their  in place, and did nothing to subsidise the new industries that could create jobs for people.  And so, these are some of the problems, what he failed to do.  And then, the way he managed to, you know, who his friends were.  And there is a place for — Daryl Eddings is not anti-, he's not anti-energy, he just says, you know, we've got energy companies that have been here for a long time, we don't need to subsidise them.  They're already here.  \n\nWhat we need to do is we need to go in and help the new industries get started so people can have new jobs that are here, and we need to revise our tax code and restore, you know, the top per cent shouldn't have the amount of tax breaks they have.  We have to get a working  again.  He would prefer to see us go back to the policies that were similar to what  had, you know.  Eisenhower put in the  and it opened commerce for the nation.  We've got to put in a really robust Internet system so that people can work at home.  In Ellis and Navarro County, there were lots of people that their kids couldn't study at home because they didn't have the Internet connectivity.  People have trouble working from home because the Internet is so slow.  We've got to get it to where every home in America has reliable connectivity so that we can move into the new way of working and the new way of studying. \n \n\n What are some of the most pressing issues Mr Eddings would raise to Congress if elected?\n\n Healthcare.  Housing — affordable housing.  Healthcare, housing and education.  The cost of healthcare, housing and education has escalated much more rapidly than peoples' paycheques.  We also have to address the national debt; the way we do that is to get people at work, at good-paying jobs.  People say \"oh, $15 \", well he's not just interested in a $15 minimum, he's interested in people who are not working to be able to get a good-paying job.  And then, the ones that are working, to have an opportunity to get the college and the training that they need, so they can qualify for higher-paying jobs.  \n\nSo, if we get people back to work, and then we get people that are underemployed employed better, and have a .  Most people don't have a career ladder anymore.  I'm an old woman and there was a career ladder when I was starting out, but you know, when you create a world like has been created by Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan and those that have followed them, where independent contractors are about the best you can get, that you can get your college degree and you can be one of the best data people in the world but you're competing with people on the other side of the world, and the employers here are hiring them in India, in China, instead of hiring them here in your own community.  We've got to change that.  What we have done with our computer jobs, we're going to have new industry technologies that we haven't even thought of, and they're going to be the jobs that are going to employ the next generation.  We have to make sure that those  and those jobs are here in America. \n\nIf we do the R&D [research and development], we need to get them and have them here in America.  And the only way you do that is by revising the tax code so that it's not an incentive to invest abroad, but there is an incentive to invest here, and to invest in research and development and upgrading technology and employees, you know, in the training and the education of your employees.  These are things that need to be restored to the tax code, and it can be done out of that percentage of tax that has been gained, has been given in these Republican tax cuts recently that have given us such a hard time.  And when we do that, that's going to go ahead and help us rebuild the middle class, and it will help us get over the debt that we're going to have to go into to take care of COVID-19.\n\n Your website states \"Tea Party Republicans have neglected residents\" and \"Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics leaves too many people out in the cold\".  Could you please elaborate?\n\n Quite truthfully.  And a lot of what I was just saying.  Trickle-down economics was originally when Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan basically said \"we're going to start giving tax cuts to industry because if we give a tax cut to industry, then the businesses, their profits will trickle down.\"  But it didn't work that way.  They gave the no-strings-attached tax breaks, and instead industry either — the people that got the tax breaks — either just banked it, and usually , or they invested out shore, instead of investing here.  So, that's where we are.  And in doing that, we lost those jobs.  There were lots of people in Ellis and Navarro counties that had union jobs, they had , they had retirement, they had training, they had healthcare and they knew that they had a job for as long as they did a decent job.  And all those jobs have just gone away.\n\nBut the others didn't come in, you know, they really did not come forward.  Now, Daryl Eddings is a  owner, and so, you know, he's not anti-business.  But he comprehends that we have got to be able to get our American workforce with some level of protection, and the way we have to do that is we have to outfit investment: we have to invest in our own workforce, and people aren't going to do that unless, you know, it's a shame that it's  and wisely, they're not doing it.  But what we've found is we've found a lot more of these businesses have just been sold, you know, off by, you know, somebody buy it and then sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, take all the profit out of the good ones.\n\nThere's nothing left for the people.  A good example is media; a very good example.  I started out in newspaper when I was a young woman, and we never made a lot of money in newspaper, we thought we had a hard time but as I have watched colleagues of mine that work for the  and the  and these others: every time their newspaper gets sold, they get less and less and less.  And also, it's now gotten somewhere they have cut.  There are very few newspapers in the United States that really even have an  team.  And of course, everybody else always, which, the newspapers find out what the background was before they got on the television and they got on the radio, and so it's hurting on almost every level, but that's just one example.\n\nWe've got to get to the point where we have a tax code that encourages people to invest in our companies here, and invest in our workforce here.  And where workers and where companies look up and say \"you know, our workers are valuable.\"  And it used to be that way.  Workers used to be: you wanted to retain your workers, you didn't want to just have them be a contractor and walk away.  And so we've gone over the cheap and it's cost us dearly.  And it was very obvious with COVID.  We didn't have the  in place to be able to have the equipment we needed to take care of our people. \n\nSo, it's a national security issue, it's a jobs issue, it's an economy issue, it's a moral issue and it's not right for the middle class to be the one that's bearing the  of the taxes, and those who are the most wealthy not paying their fair share.  So, you know, and of course, Donald Trump always talked about \"I paid all these taxes\".  Well, he's talking about .  He didn't pay any income taxes, he paid employee taxes: that was the money he collected from the employees out there with only!  [Laughs] It wasn't his paid taxes, you know!  And so they look at it and say \"well, I want the cheque\".\n\nAnd I've been a business owner too.  I know how hard it is to write those cheques when it's time to pay your employee interest.  But your employee taxes, it's not employment taxes, you know; what you collect from your employees you're passing on.  We've got to get to the point where it's not the employees that are bearing the brunt of it.  We need to share it around better, we need to be fair, it needs to be more equitable.  And so this is something that's going to have to be debated, and it's not going to be popular, but it has got to be done.  People have got to stop running away from that, and face it: that we do not have a workable tax code.\n\nAnd there's things that we get in place, and they're myths that have existed in this country about Ronald Reagan that the facts don't back up.  And we need to go back honestly and look at the facts, and see what happened and where it started — and it really started with Ronald Reagan and Phil Gramm right here in US Texas 6, and I would like to see it end in US Texas 6.  And let's have a new beginning.  People will come in and really look at, and it will be better for Democrats, it will be better for Republicans, it will be better. \n\nAnd he's not running just to represent Democrats — he's running to represent people.  He will be there for whoever.  He will be there for whoever.  He's not going to be there patting people on the back if they say that it was an illegal election because it wasn't an illegal election.  Once you have exhausted all of the legal appeals, recounts and you've gone through the courts, then you accept the outcome.  You don't go in and try to  the security officers at the Capitol, because your guy didn't win!  I've been very unhappy many, many, many times when the election results came in, but I never went out and was violent, I never went out and committed treason, you know, I never tried to do a .  That's what we saw happen in January, and it's really time to bring that back, yeah.\n\nWe need people in office that will not be leading tours of the Capitol for people who are planning on coming in and kidnapping the Speaker of the House and the Vice President of the United States, to keep from the certification of votes.  This is the reality, you know.  We have Texas, we have congressmen from Texas that literally led tours the day before that insurrection, and it was a time when the Capitol was supposed to be closed; there were not supposed to be any tours!  The only ones that were on tours were these people that were, you know, yelling with Trump.  And so, we've got to get back and change that around.\n\nThe other thing that's really important is we've got to stop dark money in our elections, we've got to — and this is a very bipartisan area, the  don't like it, but they have done surveys of most of the Republicans, and most of the Republican base said \"we need to know who the millionaires are that are financing our elections; we need the .\"  That's a very bipartisan issue.  He's very much for revoking  and getting dark money out of Congress, out of our elections, and we need to have an independent body, an independent body, not elected officials draw the barriers, the boundaries.  Elected officials picking their voters is not how this was supposed to work, you know.  That's not how we're supposed to be doing it, and so there's some things that need to be done on election reform, and they're reasonable things.\n\nAnd I think in the long run, a lot of Republicans will buy into it.  The people in the glass room, some of them in the office won't because it, you know, it protects them in office.  But we need to get it to where we're really protecting the people, not protecting the ones who are in front of us.  \n\n Your website also [says]: \"I served within the chain of command under the commander-in-chief, but I did not swear an oath to any one man or political party.\"  Could you please elaborate on that?\n\n Okay, there are a lot of people, as of January 6, that are putting Donald Trump — and I mean, this is appalling to see what some of the churches have been doing — they've been putting the  up there like he is some ; and there are members of Congress that, instead of recognising how serious it was, they have been very frightened of going against Trump.  Several of the Republicans have stated that if it had been a , that they would have voted to remove him.  The repercussions, you know, the repercussions on it.  Donald Trump is not to who we swear.  You don't swear a  to the president of the United States.  The commander-in-chief is charged with leading our military, but our military swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  And that's also the oath that the president takes, and that's what Congress takes.\n\nBut instead of looking at what we do to protect the Constitution of the United States, which was to have a peaceful turnover of the government, there were too many of them that continued to say \"this is an illegal election\", \"it was not fair\", you know, and even though the judges by and large were Republican appointees by Donald Trump, they were saying \"oh this isn't fair, some Democrats have done it\", they put out too many lies and they instigated a level of doubt and discord and disharmony that destabilises our country — and actually led to a large number of people, many of whom were law enforcement agents, and many of whom were veterans that stormed the Capitol with a military plan.  It was very clearly executed, this was not spontaneous, it was a plan to go in and forcibly stop the certification of the vote to turnover the presidency to the man who had won the election.  And this is not how it's supposed to work.\n\nEvery one of those people in that building has sworn an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the United States outlines what the process is when we have a question about it, how we answer it, what the process is with the courts.  And when it is settled, which it had been, we peaceably turnover power to the next elected administration.  It always has been that way except under Donald Trump. \n\nDaryl Eddings came back from Iraq in a coma.  He spent eighteen months in a military hospital undergoing multiple surgeries and years of rehab to get to the point where he could work and make a living for his family.  He lost people over there that he cares about who were fighting for this country, and for him to sit there and watch what happened on January 6, and to hear the words that came out of the mouth of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and  and a lot of other elected officials that basically were lies.  He knows what it is to be in countries where there are palace coups.  And to sit here and see this going on in his own country?  Can you imagine what kind of a reaction he has?  Can you imagine how it hits him in the gut?  How he would decide to put his life on the line?\n\nThis is a man that has always been very private.  There were very few photographs of him because he was a , and he worked on drug interdiction, and he knew that there were people that might recognise him from those missions that were not nice people.  And he didn't want them knocking on his door with his family.  And he sat down and talked to his family about it and decided to put his face out there, and put his name out there and run for Congress because his that worried about where our nation is right now.  He's that worried for his neighbours: Democrats and Republicans, independents and Libertarians.\n\n How would Mr Eddings handle the vaccine rollout if elected?\n\n He's very pleased with how President Biden has done it.  The vaccine rollout has been — Donald Trump was good about getting it  on making it, but he did not have in place a real plan to distribute it.  Daryl Eddings, he spent, you know years in emergency management, you know.  He's been working on another Master's [degree] in emergency management, but he would be working very much like what President Biden has been doing.  He'd be working with the scientists, he would be working with the supply chain, he'd be working with the military, he'd be working with the nurses to get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible, and as efficiently as possible.  And that's one thing he's very efficient is when there's something that needs to be done, he knows how to move the people and move the resources and assess the problem and get the job done. \n\nAnd so on that area, he's been much more relieved to see what has happened this year than what we were watching last year.  \n\n How would Mr Eddings help the economically disadvantaged if elected?\n\n Jobs.  Very definitely jobs.  Jobs and access to education, and also expansion of healthcare.  Right here in Texas, the  and the Governor refused to expand  but we're basically paying for other states to have Medicaid!  There's so many things: everybody that has held a private  policy is paying a higher premium because we have so many uninsured people in Texas.  He would be working to, you know, to expand it, to look at the ACA [Affordable Care Act], see what the problems are instead of revoking it like Joe Barton has tried to do; he would basically be working to look at it, to see what the problems are and to find a solution to make it work for as many people as possible — not to eliminate the options for private healthcare, not at all — but yet to give more people an opportunity to.\n\nAlso, he would be looking for ways that people could have an opportunity to buy a home again.  Housing cost is a big problem.  We have too many families that are being pushed out of their housing, and we have too many veterans living under the bridges, and he has worked on veterans' housing with a number of non-profit organisations for years; that's been one of the things that he's worked very heavily on is veterans' housing.  And, he also has been very active on veterans' mental health issues, and so a lot of families are suffering because of mental health issues and they don't have the opportunity to have the  on demand that they need there.  If there's a long waiting list for it, when you get ready for it there's a waiting list, and you know with an addict, somebody that has a  problem, if you don't strike when the striking is hot, if they have to wait then they're not ready to go in and do anything about it.\n\nAnd so that's one of the big problems he'd be working with, very much.  He's done a lot on  and mental health issues and  [post-traumatic stress disorder].  And these are issues that are not Democratic or Republican, they're not black, they're not white: these are problems that, because every time we have a lot of veterans that come home, and then there are a lot of us that are suffering from PTSD that were in military, you know, they are military things; people that have been in  or in different areas of that area have PTSD.  And so, we need a better network, a better social network.\n\nAnd then, we also have to strengthen our retiree social network.  Retired people shouldn't be paying some   out of their Social Security cheque, and when somebody has been working for a company they should be able to take their retirement plan with them.  And what we've allowed is in there are too many cases of corporations declaring bankruptcy to get out of paying the retirement for their employees, and then they leave it to the federal government to take up the slack.  We may need to go with something like what we have for  where there's an insurance: it's an insurance policy instead of a pension plan, and that it goes with the employee wherever they're going, so that after you've worked twenty years if you've worked at five or six or seven different jobs, you still have some .\n\nAnd we have to keep Social Security, you know.  Social Security is a — we can't do it, but the way we do that is by putting in work, you know.  People have to work: them ore we work, the more we pay in, the stronger these systems are.  But as long as our jobs are offshore, as long as employers can just, you know, call you in as an independent contractor and let you go, you know, whenever it suits them and not, you know, not in that area, as long as we have no protection for our employees and there's no investment by the companies into our workforce, we're not going to have the resources we need for people to have the retirement as necessary.  \n\nHouses, jobs, retirement, access to infrastructure, health rights: those are the things that everybody needs.  Those are not Democrat needs, and Republican doesn't.  Those are the things everybody needs, and that is exactly what he is, that's exactly what he'll be working for.  And also, everybody's vote must count, and we need to know that it's counted fairly, and that when that election is over that you can go through the process and you may find out that some of it was wrong and you can correct it, but if you find out that it wasn't wrong, then you just, you know, you just take it on your chin and you just wait for the next election.  That's the American Way, and that's where we need to go back to.\n\n What are his opinions on President Biden?\n\n He is relieved to see the things that President Biden has been doing.  He feels like reversing most of President Trump's executive orders was a good move.  He is pleased to see the calibre of people with experience to accept the mission of the departments they're being appointed to, that'll be his appointees, you know.  Because we found under Trump people that had no credentials whatsoever were appointed, that was mainly , and they were appointed to destroy the departments, not to build them up.  Daryl Eddings believes in good government, not no government.  That doesn't mean that government gets to do everything, you know, but basically we always try to do better.  \n\nWe had a bureaucracy that basically, our civil service was designed so that it didn't, you know, the civil service and the  worked for us; my mother was still in civil service.  I didn't even know she was a Democrat until she was dying, I thought she had voted Republican until she was on her deathbed because she took the Hatch Act so seriously.  [Laughs] She didn't even let her kids know what her partisanship was.  But because a federal employee is supposed to be non-partisan in the way they conduct their business, we had a steady transition, and we also had experts who knew what was going on, was there to continue running things until the next one is in place.  That's been really tattered and shattered, you know, in so many areas.\n\nOne good example is the , you know, the post office department.  There's no for-profit business that's ever going to make profit serving every community in the nation, you know.  No company is going to make a profit serving every community in the nation.  And yet at the same time, they're going out of their way to destroy the United States Postal Office that basically services every community in the nation.  And so, we have to go back in and look at that, so it's good.\n\nHe's for people that are science, data, look at the facts, go with the facts, use your science, use your data, rely on the experts, get the politics out of it and make the decision based off what will work.  That's Daryl Eddings.  Make the decision based on truth, the best information available, verify it and put people in charge that have a background and the expertise to do the job, and who believe that the mission, as is set out in our legislation of that agency, is what they really have a commitment to.  If they don't have a commitment to the mission of that agency, they should not be put in charge of that agency.  And so he sees Biden trying to do that, you know, more so.  And in the last administration, they wouldn't.\n\n Well, we've talked about Mr Biden, so what are Mr Eddings' thoughts on former President Trump?\n\n Oh...he never called him the commander-in-chief, as he was out of the military by the time, he was retired by the time he came in, but he never called him the commander-in-chief, he called him '45' because he never earned his respect.  There was not any reason for Donald Trump to be leading our troops.  Donald Trump was putting too many people at risk on a whim without reading the intelligence briefings, without listening to his generals, without, you know, unless it was an  that was feeding his ego, he had no time for it.  And it was dangerous, it was dangerous.  He's relieved that he's no longer, you know, I mean it's not that he was a Republican, it was that he was a danger, and that he was a danger to this nation, he was a danger to the men and women who are putting their lives on the line to watch out for us.  \n\nAnd also, he violated some of our greatest allies, you know.  The things that he did to our allies was unconscionable, and it wasn't just the ones that were our peacetime allies; he basically betrayed some of our allies when they were, with their lives were in danger and they were literally fighting for their very lives.  And so the betrayals, you know, it's very difficult for a man who has had the kind of life that Daryl Eddings has to watch what happened under Donald Trump, and not be appalled.\n\n What are his thoughts on the ongoing crisis at the Southern border?\n\n Well, he worked for immigration.  And, at the same time he understands, and then he also worked on drug interdiction, so he's flown from the top to the bottom, but he's also been in those countries.  And he knows that it's not what our policy is that is bringing them here.  What's bringing them here is what's happening in their countries.  It's the terror, the crime, the severe poverty and it was bad enough because they're always having hurricanes and disasters, they're just knocking them off the line, but when you get down to it you also have COVID-19 that's on top of it.  But he knows that if someone is terrified, and they believe that they or their children are going to die if they stay in their neighbourhood, they're going to go somewhere else.  And, they're not going to be able to keep them back; they're going to go wherever it is they think that they will be safer — maybe not safe, but safer.\n\nSo he knows that those are situations that — it's a humanitarian problem, but it's going to have to be solved on a multi- attack.  It has to be solved in co-operation with the countries to help the countries counter the drug and the terror and the gang activity.  They also have to be helped in a way that deals with the poverty.  And then, we have to be as humane as we can in receiving those who came.  We had four years of the United States government refusing to process asylum applications in a timely manner.  We were already understaffed before this happened, and then he made that to try to make it as a punishment.  You can't make it as a punishment.\n\nHe also knows that there is no way to put a  up, because he's flown from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico; just the terrain would make it totally impossible.  And besides that, what are you going to do with a fence when you have two oceans on both sides of you, you know.  So you're not going to keep people over.  The higher the fence, they're going to come over.  So, we have to find a way.  But as a law enforcement officer, he really believes we have to be able to allow the people who are here to come out of the shadows, because as long as we have people in the shadows, and they're afraid to co-operate with law enforcement, it's harder to take care of the drug dealers in the , and it's harder to take care of criminals that are preying on them. \n\nAnd as long as a criminal can prey on somebody, and there's somebody there that was a witness or a victim, and they can't co-operate with law enforcement, we're all less safe.  So, we have to do something to give them a chance to have  so they're not afraid of being deported, so that they can co-ordinate with law enforcement here, and he sees that as a real nice thing.  And he did go down to  with ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] when they were under the Trump Administration; he actually went into the courtroom and saw children that were being brought before the court, without an adult.  He saw multiple immigrants, multiple people that were in orange shirts, orange sheets that were teetered together, they will all fly together as a mass thing to be deported, not even having an individual chance before a judge.  He saw things that were not fine, as a criminal justice person, that was not fair, and that were not humane.\n\nAnd what's happening now is very sad, but they're at least trying to take care of these children, they're trying to move them out of those shelters as fast as possible, they're trying to get them, they're trying to speed up the background checks — that's one of the big problems: they have to do background checks on these people that are coming forward to be their guardians, because they're children that have literally ended up being sex trafficking by people who claimed them, so you have to do that.  It's not an instant process, but yet at the same time what you do with those children, and the mental health support that they have while they're in there, you don't go in there and tell them that their parents have deserted them.  You don't lie to the parents and tell them, you know, those things, so we have to be honest, we have to be truthful with the people, we have to do the best job we can do, and our best job isn't good enough, but in the last administration it was cruel!  You know, it wasn't that it wasn't good enough, it was that it violated the  in almost every way.\n\nAnd also, we test them.  You know, they were refusing even to give those kids  under Trump.  We test them, and, you know, we do our best to take care of them, and we try to get them out of our custody as fast as possible, because the more you have together, the higher likelihood of sexual assault, or violence, or harm to one of them.  And so, you have to process them, and get them out as fast as possible, and protect them because, you know, it's just a nightmare.  But yeah, he was very concerned for the children; he's got seven grandchildren of his own, and what he saw as a former  [Immigration and Naturalization Service] person knows that was not how it was supposed to operate.  And it still has a ways to go now, but at least they're trying to do it, instead of trying to do the opposite.\n\n What are his thoughts on the size of the American military?\n\n That's one question that we haven't discussed: about the size of the military.  I can't really give you an answer.  I do know that he believes very much in the military, he believes in the military; it is a peacekeeping operation, he believes that it is beneficial in that it is one of the ways that people who come from poorer families can get an education, can have a chance to buy a house with a reasonable area, you know.  If you live through your military service, you have benefits, but also there's a lot of people that do not survive their military service. \n\nHe doesn't believe that the military should be used for everything, you know.  We have reasons to use the military; we don't use the military just at the whim of the commander-in-chief.  There has to be a valid reason to use the military, and so that's one of the reasons that he trusted Hillary Clinton more than he trusted Donald Trump, you know, on that area.  \n\n What are his thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\n Well, he was an officer, of course.  He believes in it, and he also believes that we have many wonderful law enforcement people, and we have some bad apples.  We have too many racists that are in the, you know.   do not belong in law enforcement.  There are some people that do not have the temperament to be in law enforcement.  And he became a friend of 's mother during the time that she was trying to find out what happened to her daughter, what the real circumstances were of her , and he has looked very closely with her, over the years, that she actually came to Texas in 2018, I guess it was; maybe this was '16, 2018, and volunteered in Dr Shirley McKellar's campaign because of the relationship they established.\n\nHe was very pleased to see the Sandra Bland Act signed into law by Governor [Greg] Abbott.  It does some things that are important; he would like to see the  Act and the Sandra Bland Act, those elements of it be merged and passed nationally.  The Sandra Bland Act has transparency, it has a lot of protection, it has a lot of things in dealing with the mentally ill and drug addiction; very often a jailer would just say they had gone by and checked on them when they didn't, so it calls for electronic monitoring so they have to push the button right there at the cell to show that they have checked on that person.  It basically says that if there's ever a death in custody that you don't get to investigate it yourself, it has to be an independent law enforcement agency to do the investigation.\n\nSo those are the protections.  Then, the George Floyd Act has some others that are important too; now the George Floyd Act basically goes in and says if there is a registry, then we need to have a registry of law enforcement officers that have been discharged because of not following the protocol.  And so that's pretty controversial with it, but he also believes that we have to go in and address; he believes that everyone should be able; he believes in protecting the  rights, obviously, he is a gun owner.  \n\nBut, he believes that there are s, he believes there are military weapons, and weapons that can be modified to be military weapons, that belong on the battlefield, and that  and  should be used for hunting game, not hunting people.  They shouldn't be worn around as a fashion statement into restaurants to intimidate other diners.  We need to be able to have everyone licensed, everyone background-checked, everyone to have training.  And we have to close the loopholes of gun purchases.  There's still going to have the people that are getting a hold of the weapons illegally, but if you take care of that, you can then address the others.  But, law enforcement are designed to shoot to kill if there is a threat: that's their protective life.\n\nHe believes that we have got to stop using our police for everything that we haven't got covered.  They're not supposed to be the box we check when we don't have anything else to do it.  Every  call should not be going to the police.  If it's mental health, drug addiction, we should have people who are trained in mental health and trained in drug addiction do the first call on that.  You might have a police officer with you, but you shouldn't, you know, those tiny areas.  \n\nHe serves on the  Mental Health Advocacy Board; he's an officer on that.  He works as a mentor, he volunteers as a mentor in a one-year programme, it's called the \"Veterans Court\" in Dallas, where you work with someone who has been in drug addiction or mental, you know, has just gotten in trouble with the law, and it's aversion programme, and you have a mentor and you work with that person 24/7 wherever they need them, and he does that.  He works from down in East Texas, they realised that there were thirteen counties that did not have access to in-person psychiatric counselling, and social work counselling.  He worked to see that they got it, and that the VA paid for it, so yeah, he has some real, real concerns with what's happening with the mentally ill, and the people that are falling through the cracks.\n\nHe knows that he's where he's at because people helped him when he came back, you know.  And he sees a lot of veterans that are falling through the cracks, and he's very concerned about that.  And then, there are other people that are falling through the cracks.  And so, law enforcement, you know, law enforcement needs.  And also, he's a black man.  He's got black grandchildren.  He's a law enforcement person; you know, the bias that goes, the more likely you're going to be shot by a police officer if you're mentally ill, or you're a .  Those are things that would concern any father, any grandfather.\n\nAnd yet at the same time, the officers shouldn't have, you know, if an officer is at greater risk of being killed now because of the number of guns that are out there.  How do you know, if you're in a grocery store, and someone comes in with a gun, if they're coming in just because they've got a licence and they're just shopping, or if they're coming in to do something.  We used to be able to know that if somebody came into  with a gun, they didn't have a good purpose, you know.  They can stop them close to do the door.  Now, they're right up on the aisle with you, before you get a chance; they're right up on top of you, able to do a lot of damage.  So, there's a lot more risk to law enforcement right now than there was before, we have to address it on both ways.\n\n What does he feel on Medicare?\n\n Medicare?  The best, most efficiently-managed healthcare delivery in the nation.  It's not perfect, but it is definitely, when you look at the cost of administration for Medicare, it is the lowest of any insurance company, any insurance divider; even military is not as efficiently run as Medicare.  But, he would like to look at possibly a buy-in for people that are 50, to where some people might be able to buy into it; he's not sure, but he thinks that something should be evaluated.  He wants to put on the table of our system, and look at what the flaws are, see where we started with the Affordable Care Act, what we know now are the problems, the inequities, see how we can correct those, and how we can get more people covered, and it is by making Medicare go a little bit longer, or if it's a way of jacking up the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut also, he believes that people should have dental coverage, you know.  That's a way to find a way to make dental coverage affordable.  So, you know, there's a lot of  that's caused because of bad dentistry, and there's a lot of people that can't afford to go to the dentist, and it concerns him that people are working and they can't afford to, you know, they're too poor to go to the dentist when they need to, they're too poor to go to the doctor, they're too poor to get that psychiatric counselling that they need.  And so, the way that we do this is we invest in our people, and that's one of the investments in the people.\n\nWe also have to see how do we pay for it.  And that's the other chance it is not an easy solution.  We have to look at what we can do, and what's reasonable and how do we pay for it.  And those are questions that, instead of fighting over it we need to come to the table and solve, you know.  Really look at them, and debate them, and research them and solve them instead of just asking the book when we're with them.  He's a person that basically looks at it, listens and figures out a way to get it done.  And he's done that since he's left — he's done that when he was in the military, and he's done it since he left the military.  Operation Battle Buddy is an example, because when he was with  — now, there's two organisations: this isn't the , this is the one that does the mentoring, but he founded that organisation.  When he was the CEO of it, they were mentoring 20 thousand vets that had, you know, come through Brooke Military Hospital.\n\nBut he looks at it, he sees a need and he finds a way to get it done: that's what they need down in East Texas with the mental health services, and that's what he's done with some veterans' housing projects in different areas.  So, and that's just as an individual.  And so, as a congressperson I believe that he has the relationship with a number of people in Congress, and they'll look at him and they'll see his heart, and see his skill and see his willingness to solve problems.  You know, you gravitate together: those who are really wanting to find solutions find ways to find solutions, and that's where he'll be; he'll be with the ones that are looking to find the solution.\n\n What are his thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China [on March 19, 2021]?\n\n I don't know, we haven't talked about that.  So that's one, on all these mountains and mountains of things we have not talked about China, other than what's happened with trade.  So, I can't even answer that one.\n\n What are his thoughts, then, on the rise in  as  and recent ?\n\n Oh, it's deplorable.  Hate and discrimination coming against any person is an abomination to him.  He considers one of his proudest moments was when he was on the  with the late honourable .  He does not believe in, you know, I mean if you're Muslim, if you're Asian, if you're LGBT, if you're a woman, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, you're an American, and you should be treated with respect as a human being.  And no one, in this country of any race is responsible for COVID-19.  Nobody here caused it, nobody here brought it over here, you know, there's some people that are responsible for not helping us deal with it in a timely manner, you know, there's some people that dropped the ball on it, but we did not cause it.  And just because of your ethnicity, you know, you definitely should not in that area, so the discrimination in the attacks on them are very troubling.\n\n The power outages of February left millions without power, sometimes for days, including of course, the sixth district.  Its damages are currently estimated at US$195 billion and 111 estimated to have been killed.  How will Mr Eddings prevent this from happening again, should he be elected?\n\n On the federal level: require all energy transmission sites to be listed and winterised.  Without protecting them out on the cheap, you know.  I mean, instead of just keeping them from having to do that, here in Texas, we know that there's a piece of paper.  They can just have them listed of which ones were supposed to get that, and also they did not have the winterisation.  Our pipelines should have been buried deeper, but the pipelines doesn't require it.  So, on a federal level we're probably going to have to go in and put some controls in on a federal level to address these issues, these issues.\n\nAnd also, there has to be some kind of control put in on the profiteering schemes of energy.  Here in Texas, Joe Barton, Greg Abbott and certain legislators have done their very best to protect their big donors at the expense of everybody else, and it's cost people lives.  And you know, now Abbott's trying to deflect from it, you know, he's sent people down to the border, he's tried all kinds of things.  He's done his math bit, all this stuff to deflect from the fact that he really blew it...but he really blew it, and he basically — they sat there and they knew, they knew from 2011 what was going to happen.  They were told in 2011 what they needed to do, and every year in January my electric bill always jumped up even though I didn't use any more electricity.\n\nAnd every Texan has paid through the nose because they have willingly taken compression stations offline so they could get those higher prices in January, and this time it crashed.  And they still got them, you know.  Two and three and sometimes even a thousand per cent higher: that's profiteering, that's schemes, and that has to do with the failure of politicians to look out for the people of Texas.  And the buck rests not just with the  [Public Utility Commission of Texas] and not just when what was left, the buck rests with the Governor, and with certain people who have been in office that have been the real protectors of that sector at all costs.  That sector is an important sector, but they should not be allowed to profiteer at the expense of the Texas citizens.\n\n What sets Mr Eddings apart from other candidates in the Democratic Party; of course, there are multiple running, there are multiple Democrats, multiple Republicans, multiple everyone.  So, what sets him apart?\n\n There are some others that are veterans that are running on the Democrat and Republican sides, but none of them have the width of experience he has.  None of them have the experience in emergency management.  It was really a[n] eye-opener for me during Hurricane Katrina when I realised that I couldn't just call the people that were running the show in Arlington while we were receiving them, because they were locked in a, you know, in a secure area and the public had no access to the telephone in that area.  A state of emergency, which is  is a very serious thing, and most citizens don't understand what happens during that.\n\nHe does, because he has worked states of emergency for years in California, and then the senior operations officer over there, so if something happens in the district and he's in Congress he's going to know what's happening, he's going to be able to put his hands on them, he's going to be able to know who to contact, how to contact them, what to look for, what usually happens where the break-down is, to take care of things: that's the level that he has.  Also, he comes with them.  This is a personal situation: I travelled with him a lot, and he was the security person on our team.  And usually, we never, you know usually, if there was something we wanted it was no problem, but if it was something that had to do with security we always knew that if he nodded or said no that it was no, because he is always looking out for the security of everyone around him.\n\nIf you're in his neighbourhood, he's going to be as concerned about your security as he is going to be about his own wife's security.  That's where he looks at.  He looks at what is going to keep people alive, and at the same time respect their freedom to be the very best that they can be.  That's how he is.   He is the most — I'll tell you, he's a hard candidate to work for, because he's so modest!  You know, I mean he's unlike any politician I've ever worked with because he's not a politician, he is a person that is — he's usually finding solutions and pulling other people together to make them happen, and then he pushes them to the foreground but doesn't take any credit for what he instigated, for what he did.  \n\nHe's not out there to take vows for himself, he's out there to make things better.  He sincerely is out there to make things better.  You know, of course that's coming from somebody who knows him, and I wouldn't be doing this — I would not be doing this if I didn't know him as well as I do, because basically I said \"I'm not doing this again!\"  I've done enough of that, you know, it's time for somebody else to look to own this ship, but yeah, he's just, he's a very rare individual. \n\nAnd also, in the years I have known him I have never once had something the man told me that I couldn't take at face.  He has never even covered up, you know, I mean he might not say anything about it but there's never been one field, one attempt to misdirect anyone I have ever seen in all the years I've known him.  That's not something you come across in these politicians.  I don't know how you put that in the story, but that's just not; he's just not your normal egg, you know.  He's just not normal egg.\n\n How has COVID-19 affected the campaign?\n\n Oh, enormously.  Because for one thing, : usually, you're out meeting people and rubbing hands and all that, and that's practically every interview, every meeting is by , you know, we're just now getting ready to starting with block walking where we're having to, you know, all of that we're trying to, you know, we'll try to get people vaccinated so that they can be out there.  We've done the masks, social distancing and we have Dr McKellar, who is a  [Registered nurse], who was a commander over military units in Iraq, in the Middle East, who has basically set down what our COVID-19 protocols are.\n\nIt makes all the difference in the world on how we did it; it made a big difference in just being able to file.  Usually when you file, you go into different Democratic club meetings and you go to your neighbours, and you get your petition signatures.  Well, when he said he was going to try and do petition signatures in three days during a pandemic, I said \"it couldn't happen\", but he got his veteran buddies out there and they basically collected the, you know 5500 signatures that we needed.  We didn't use them, because we didn't have time to check them out to make sure they were valid, and we still paid the money but to be able to make contact with that many people is astronomical.\n\nSo, we're still doing the things that we can do, and you know, in next week we're going to actually start literature drops instead of, normally you go and you knock on the door, you try to talk to people, we're going to be trying to do literature drops.  Somebody comes out and gets them to talk to them, but they'll be at distance and everybody'll have a mask and, you know, that whole kind of area.  So, it makes it very different.\n\nAnd also, people are hurting, you know. We're dealing with people who are in greater need, even if they have the roof over their head and the money isn't the situation, they've got emotional needs, they've got psychological needs, they've got grieving needs that have gone on.  And so, everyone is in a very different place this year than they were last year.\n\nAnd also, if it were not for COVID, two of the three seats that are coming up this month in Congress would not be having special elections.  One of them in Louisiana was because the congressman took a job in the Biden administration, but the other one is because the  died of COVID-19, and so did Ron Wright.  So, COVID is making the difference politically and opening seats up, and that's not how you plan on running.  It also means that this is the most complex election — we had fifty days to do what normally you do in eighteen months in a congressional race.  And just to file the paperwork and get the checking account to do those kinds of things is astronomical.\n\nAnd also, a candidate usually has months in which to get his one minute, his two minute, his three minute , and to get all, you know all that kind of stuff, and to get the issues, and you did it all at the same time in very accelerated speeds.  And you're running against — there's 23 people on the ballot, who knows what in the world that's going to do, and you can't judge, you can't go back and look at any other election and make a guess about what the turnout's going to be.  Because, even if it was another special election it wouldn't have been a special election between these candidates, you know.  And if it was a congressional race, it wouldn't have been a special election with your local candidate, so it's just a crapshoot, you know, who knows what's going to happen here.\n\nBut we do know this: that whatever we do, we will be building some infrastructure, we'll be identifying some voters, we will be engaging some voters that may not have been engaged, we will be bringing out some folks that voted in 2020 to a local election for a congressional race, and maybe some of these folks will get in the habit of voting in their municipal elections, and we have a difference, you know.  And that may be a good one, because if they get in a habit when they're young, then maybe they'll continue doing that.  So, you know, whatever happens — there's a good side and a difficult side anyway you check it.\n\n If Mr Eddings isn't elected this time, what do you anticipate his ambitions for the future would be?\n\n He's already said that he's running in 2022, you know, if he isn't elected.  In fact, we had a discussion today about his filing his FEC [Federal Election Commission] intention to run, you know, and I put it out to him, you know \"you've already got your checking account, you've already got your ads clean, you've already got a lot of stuff done, and so, you know just go with it.\"  Yeah, his intention is to run in the 20s, he's been thinking about running for a long time, he just hadn't thought about running this year because he didn't know this seat was going to be open.\n\n Light-hearted question to end this: which historical figure would he identify with most and why, or which historical figure do you think he identifies with most and why?\n\n Okay, he says the two that he admires most, and that he would rather fashion himself after would be John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  And that is because they each faced great discrimination, they each persevered and they each opened doors to segments of people that many people thought would never be opened, and basically he said \"if it is necessary, it is not impossible.\"  You can't afford for it to be impossible if it's something people desperately, finally need, and so you continue working for that as long as it takes to take care of it, and those are two conclusive of that, so he looks at that.\n\nThis man hasn't got a misogynistic bone in his body, I mean, it's just incredible, you know.  I've asked him what he thought about Don't ask, don't tell in the military, and he said \"some of the best soldiers I've ever known: men and women were under don't ask don't tell, and it was good for them to be able to  of the covers on that type area.\"  He's not at all, he has no problems with LGBTQ in the military.  And he also truly has no problems with women because he was staunchly behind Hillary Clinton, and he has put the last eight years of his life on hold to try to get Shirly McKellar elected over Louis Gohmert down in East Texas.\n\nSo, he just, you know, he's a rare bird.\n\n Any final comments?\n\n Well, I think I'm pretty well commented!

{"title": "Wikinews discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman after GitHub re-enables public access to youtube-dl", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Wikinews discusses DRM and DMCA with Richard Stallman after GitHub re-enables public access to youtube-dl}}\n\nOn November 16, code-sharing and hosting service GitHub re-enabled the public access to  repository, a software which can download videos from the internet via the .  This move comes after Mitchell Stoltz, a Senior Staff Attorney of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent a letter to GitHub on the behalf of youtube-dl's maintainers.  The repository was previously blocked on October 23,  after GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the  (RIAA).\n\nStarted in July 2008, youtube-dl is a free/libré open source software written in  which can download videos from various websites.  Citing alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code § 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems, RIAA's takedown notice had alleged youtube-dl was intended to circumvent the technological protection measures of streaming services and to redistribute music videos without authorisation.  youtube-dl's source code had a number of  to check if the software works in different circumstances or not.  Some of the test cases included s of some copyrighted songs.\n\nIn the letter to GitHub, EFF's attorney Stoltz said \"This file contains series of automated tests that verify the functionality of youtube-dl for streaming various types of video.  The youtube-dl source code does not, of course, contain copies of these songs or any others [...] the unit tests do not cause a permanent download or distribution of the songs they reference; they merely stream a few seconds of each song to verify the operation of youtube-dl.  Streaming a small portion of a song in a non-permanent fashion to test the operation of an independently created software program is a .\"  The letter stressed  \"youtube-dl does not decrypt video streams that are encrypted with commercial DRM technologies\".\n\nThe URLs to copyrighted songs were removed from the source code on November 16, and replaced with a test video that uploaded on YouTube by Philipp Hagemeister, former maintainer of youtube-dl.  Philipp Hagemeister had previously spoken about the takedown with Wikinews.\n\nyoutube-dl comes with a small  interpreter where it acts as a  would behave while receiving video data from the server.  The script has \"extractors\" for various websites to handle videos from different sources.  \"Any software capable of running JavaScript code can derive the URL of  the  video  stream  and  access  the  stream,  regardless  of  whether  the  software  has  been approved by YouTube\", the letter read.  It borrowed an analogy of  from 's  for explanation: travelers come upon a door that has writing in a foreign language.  When translated, the writing says \"say 'friend' and enter.\"  The  travelers say \"friend\" and the door opens.  As with the writing on that door, YouTube presents instructions on accessing video streams to everyone who comes asking for it.\n\nHours after the public access was restored, Sergey M, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl wrote on GitHub, \"We would like to thank @github for standing up for youtube-dl and making it possible to continue development without dropping any features.  We appreciate [GitHub] for taking potential legal risks in this regard.  We would also like to thank [EFF] and personally [Mitch Stoltz] for invaluable legal help.  We would also like to heartily thank our main website hoster Uberspace who is currently being sued in Germany for hosting our essentially business card website and who have already spent thousands of Euros in their legal defense.\"\n\nHours after GitHub restored the public access to the repository, Stoltz tweeted \"I think of youtube-dl as a successor to the videocassette recorder.  The VCR empowered people to take control of their personal use of free-to-air video, but it had to be saved from the .  The same goes for youtube-dl.  GitHub did the right thing here.\"\n\nyoutube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world.  Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on  are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media.  youtube-dl also lets users download videos from  — a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism.  Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence.  \n\nWhen a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work.  YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.\n\nIn the blog post announcing \"youtube-dl is back\", GitHub said, \"Although we did initially take the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn't mean it can't also be used to access works in non-infringing ways.  We also understood that this project's code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or  videos.\"\n\nGitHub also announced any new 1201 takedown notices will be \"carefully scrutinised by legal experts\" to reject \"unwarranted claims\", and said it will side with software developers if the claims are ambiguous.  The announcement also mentioned GitHub Trust and Safety team would treat developer's  as a \"top priority\".  GitHub also pledged donation of USD 1 million for developer defense fund \"to help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA Section 1201 takedown claims\".\n\nGitHub had blocked public access to many forks of youtube-dl upon receiving the DMCA notice in October.  At that time, Wikinews noted public access was not yet restored for the forked repositories listed in RIAA's copyright notice and was still displays \"Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown\".\n\nDuring the period when GitHub had disabled public access for the repository, Sergey M had been developing youtube-dl and hosting it on , another code-sharing and hosting site.  However, since GitHub has restored public access of youtube-dl, Sergey M has made the GitLab repository private.\n\nAfter this, Wikinews reached out to Richard Stallman, the founder of Free Software Foundation, who has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now, to discuss the harms of DRM and DMCA 1201.\n\n What is DRM and whose rights [is] the DRM trying to protect?\n\n Well, DRM as I consider it, stands for digital restrictions management.  It stands for system functionalities designed to restrict users in their use of copies of works.  It's an injustice.  It is a system of giving, generally, the more powerful additional power over everyone else.  They [who implement DRM] like to say that this is a matter of protecting rights, but it's really a matter of protecting power.  That power is an injustice and it should not exist.\n\n What do you think of the Recording Industries Association of America's DMCA take down notice against youtube-dl?\n\n Oh.  Well it was, as I understand it, it was entirely a distortion of the law.  And the Electronic Frontier Foundation explained why that was so.  And I believe that's why GitHub put it back up again.  But I'm more concerned with the morality of it than the legality of it.  And basically it was a system\nof oppression.  But that's what the DMCA was mainly there to achieve: Make it easier to repress.\n\n Why was the DMCA introduced?\n\n Well of course I don't know the motives.  I can only try to guess.  But in general, the bad things in the DMCA give more power to publishing companies and secondarily occasionally to authors and artists to stop people from sharing.  Now that was visible here it was to stop people from sharing youtube-dl.  But the DRM portions of the DMCA were designed to stop people from breaking the digital handcuffs that companies place on them.\n\nSo before 1998, companies tried implementing DRM and people who didn't like being handcuffed by DRM implemented ways to break the handcuffs.  The DRM[...] the DMCA made that much more difficult and it's been followed by hardware designed to restrict the people who use it — the people who supposedly buy it — are forbidden to change the parts of it that are designed to restrict them.\n\n Is the existence of DRM necessary for the DMCA to serve its purpose?\n\n Well, if the purpose is to repress, then yes, the DMCA; a part of the DMCA: because the DMCA says many different things.  So there are two parts of the DMCA that are pertinent here.  There's the part that sets up the takedown system and then there's a part about DRM and forbidding the distribution of any equipment to break DRM.  So you you better say which one you mean because there's so much else in the DMCA.\n\nThe large goal of the DMCA is basically to stop people from sharing.  And both of those parts of the DMCA serve the purpose of stopping people from sharing.  I believe sharing copies of published works should be lawful and any law designed to stop that — any law against that — is an attack on society.\n\nSo if the goal is to to divide people and stop them from sharing, well DRM certainly contributes to that goal.\n\n Is the DRM really harmful for an independent society — a society which is not controlled by a select few companies.\n\n Oh, well DRM tends to increase the control of certain areas of society by companies, and especially large companies.  You see, a truly effective DRM scheme typically involves  getting everyone to follow the same standard to restrict people so there are no exceptions.  They need something like a monopoly.   If there were effective competition — competition between systems and practices that are\ndiverse — then people would find ways to get copies without DRM.  But what happens instead is a DRM conspiracy is set up whereby all the publishers start using — although they're supposedly competing and may in fact be competing in some other sense — in regard to their use of DRM, they're all the same.  So just about everyone publishing recorded videos at one point switched to DVDs.  The DVDs were designed to have DRM.  It's all the same DRM system.  And they were all basically the same player system.\n\nAnd it means that basically competition does people no good.  You can't find a publisher that's publishing the same things but without DRM: they're all restricting you the same.  So if you are completely firm in your hatred of DRM like me you say well I just won't buy any such thing.  But if you're not so firm you'll probably surrender and go along with the restrictions of the system that they've switched to, which at that time meant DVDs.  And then, because people had found ways to break the DRM of DVDs, another sort of monopolistic system for DRM was designed and that was .  And you'll notice that all sorts of video publishing companies started publishing on Blu-ray discs.  Well that was one single technical standard with the same DRM.  And they all used the same DRM implementing disc players for Blu-ray discs.  So they have a chance of success when they avoid competition.  If there were enough competition, some publishers might start saying, \"Hey we'll publish without the DRM.\"   My understanding is, you can't write a Blu-ray disc that doesn't have DRM.  I've been told you can't make and sell Blu-ray discs that anyone can copy.  That was one example of a change for the worst compared with DVDs.  You can write DVDs that don't implement the DRM.\n\n What are some of the ways DRM mistreats the users without them actually knowing about it?\n\n Well, when DRM mistreats you, you'll notice.  You know, if you can't copy the contents into a file on your disk you'll notice.  So there are many malicious things that programs can do to users without users knowing for instance spying on users.  It could have a .  And unless you notice the use of the back door, you can't tell.  But DRM is one thing that you can tell.\n\n How according to you should the laws concerning  should be applied?\n\n I'm afraid that question is fundamentally confused by use of the vague over-generalisation \"intellectual property\".  Are you talking about ?\n\n No, I'm talking law specifically for Intellectual Property Protection.\n\n Sorry, you don't understand.  The term \"intellectual property\" is applied to many different kinds of laws.  For instance, patent laws.  When you ask that question whether you know it or not, you're asking about patent laws.  That term is also commonly applied to trade secrecy.  So whether you know it or not, your question is asking about  law.  And it's also applied to , which really just you know those are just names.  And the trademark law just says what that you can register a trademark and then other people can't call their products by that name.  So whether you knew it or not your question was asking about those laws too.  There are also plant variety monopolies, which are not the same as patents, and you were asking about those laws too.  And there is also copyright law.  So whether you knew it or not, you were asking about copyright law.  And there are others I don't even know what all of them are.  Because there's so many and they're all different.  And you were asking about all of those laws at once because you said \"intellectual property\".\n\nI recognised about 20 years ago that that term \"intellectual property\" reliably causes confusion because it asks about so many different laws at once and these laws are totally different; they apply to different areas; they have different purposes.  They're designed to achieve different things but that term \"intellectual property\" treats them as if they were all minor variations of the same thing and they're not.\n\nSo every time you use that term, you're causing yourself to be confused and other people who think your question or statement is meaningful will get confused too.  So I decided to reject that term completely because I want people to understand the differences between these various laws and they can't understand that until they realize that these laws are different.\n\nCan you try to make your question specific enough that I could answer it?\n\n There are a lot of complaints which try to hide behind these IP laws in order to protect the software. \n\n They hide behind the term \"intellectual property\" to prevent it from becoming clear which law they're talking about and what the issue is in the case.  But actually to speak of \"protecting software\"  there's another sneaky point there.  What does it mean to \"protect software\"?  Prevent it from being destroyed?  Prevent it from being erased?  Protect normally means — to something means — to stop it from being destroyed or damaged or ruined.  So for instance, if somebody threatens to break a DVD, well a DVD of software, and you \"stopped\" the person from destroying the disk, that would be protecting software, right?   That's protecting software by the usual meaning of the word \"protect\".\n\nWhen in that kind of question when they say protect, it's bogus.  So I would say to them \"What do you mean by that?  What exactly is the thing you're trying to stop?\"  I would refuse to take up the intentionally confusing terminology like protect software.  I would insist on getting a concrete description of what you're trying to do.  And then I could give a concrete response do you want to give a concrete description?  Of course you're quoting the others, you're not saying that this is your goal.  You're talking about others who say that this is their goal.  And if they're speaking gobbledygook, well you can't tell what they really mean.  I'm saying that when they use that terminology they are basically confusing people.\n\nIt's gobbledygook.  It's not a real question.  And I would refuse to try to engage with their gobbledygook.  I talk about concrete questions that I can describe like should anyone be able to stop you from making a copy of something.  And if you want we can make it more concrete than that but you'll have to say which concrete case you mean.  The point is I don't believe that anyone should have the power to stop you from making a copy to give to your friend or to somebody you just met.  And if somebody wants to try to argue for that we should give that power, well the onus is on per to demonstrate why person should have that power.\n\n A person who paid for a tool owns it and is used to modify as they wish, for example you do not like the color of your chair, paint it if your car's tire is flat, change it or ask a mechanic to help you with that, except for cases where there is a computer and usually a software involved.\n\n Yeah.  Well I think you should have the same freedom to change the software.  And that relates to the issue of free  or  software.  I have fought for free software because I believe all users who are running programs should have the freedom to change those programs or get someone else to help change them.  And that's why I've developed free programs and released them to give other people that freedom.  And that's why I refuse to run non-free programs because they subjugate their users by stopping the users from changing those programs.  It means that the users don't have control of their own computing.  I consider that unacceptable so I don't accept it.  I simply say I won't use that non-free software, take it away.\n\n But why is computer software treated differently than other tools?  For example, if we take case of John Deere tractors.\n\n Oh well, morally, it shouldn't be.  Morally, all software should be free.  Users should always get the source code and they should be able to change it and publish modified versions so that others can get the benefit of their changes.\n\nNow, I can tell you practically speaking why it is not treated the same way.  It's because software was treated as a kind of written work.  Written works were covered by copyright law.  They generally were not tools of any sort, you looked at them.  You didn't pick up a written work and turn something with it.  Right it's not a tool in the same sense as a screwdriver is.  And physical structures were treated legally different from collections of text which is what a program is.  And so carrying forward those two existing practices, they ended up saying that programs were copyrighted and at this point the lobbying of the companies, some of which were already large in the 1980s, was enough to cause copyright law in the US to be interpreted in rather strange ways for software.  For instance, companies started saying: this program is copyrighted and it's a trade secret.  Now it used to be that copyright applied to published works and anything that's a secret is not published.  If it were published it wouldn't be a secret anymore.  But the companies lobbied and they were allowed to have it both ways.  They could say the source code is a secret and the compiled executable is published.  And so they could have the benefit of copyright law and trade secret law for the same work at the same time.\n\nNow, if the people writing the laws had been thinking based on what is in the public interest, they might have said that's absurd but they were thinking about \"how can I please these companies that will give me a job later.  You know, once I'm not in office anymore, I want to get paid by companies\".  So they did things to please the companies which probably told them, \"We'll have work for you later\".  That system is known as the revolving door between business and government and it's fundamentally a form of corruption, even though it's not necessarily illegal.  But morally speaking it's corruption.\n\nSo what we ended up with, well, so we ended up with software that was copyrighted and the source code was secret and thus the company had two ways to restrict the users of that program.  One was they couldn't get the source code so they couldn't change it really except by patching the binary and that's hard to do: it's hard to make a very big change by patching the binary.  And at the same time it was copyrighted so they were forbidden to redistribute it.  And if they so if they managed to patch the binary they were not allowed to share that with anybody else.  And so the users were helplessly under the power of that company.  That was the situation in the early 80s which led me to develop free software and start the free software movement.  And meanwhile non-free software led to DRM.  You see, in order for a program that's intended to restrict users to succeed in restricting users, it has to be secret.  Or else there has to be something that stops the users from changing it, and stops them in some other way.  Because, you know, if someone puts some shackles on you and you can then change the shape of the shackles so you can take them off your feet, they're not really effective shackles, are they?\n\n You see this is rather odd that a car manufacturer never stops the users from opening the bonnet and expect what is underneath or even change it.\n\n Well yes, actually with software they do exactly that.  And that's basically what John Deere is doing with the tractors.  Because now there are computers in the car or the tractor and the computers are running software.  The software is an important part of the car or the tractor and that's what the supposed owner can't change.  So when you see that, you get to see the evil of non-free software and I don't think they should be allowed to sell cars with non-free software in them.  I think that they should be required to make the software free so users can change the programs.\n\n What changes to the current system do you propose?\n\n Well, that's rather complicated.  [T]he changes I propose in laws and the system of distributing for the legal system for publication.  Basically I think all software should be free.  Free as is in freedom of course.  I don't mind if you charge money for a copy but the software that you distribute should always respect users freedom.  However, I am against making it a crime to distribute a non-free program, simply because criminalising such things tends to fail to achieve its goal.  I mean, look at for instance dangerous drugs, that it's a crime to sell but people just break those laws massively and meanwhile in the US hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more than a million are in prison for breaking those laws and yet people are still doing it in tremendous quantities.  So that's the only reason I wouldn't want to make it a crime to distribute non-free software.  But it shouldn't happen.  For other kinds of works, however, we have to look at copyright and I would say that works that are meant to serve a practical purpose, such as textbooks, for instance, or reference works, they should all be free as in freedom also.  However, for other kinds of works, such as artistic works and works of testimony, it's okay for those works to be copyrighted.  But people should at least be allowed to non-commercially redistribute exact copies.  So you should be allowed to be a good member of your community, which includes among other things making copies and sharing them.\n\nNow, if you have a copy of something and your friend says, \"hey could I have a copy of that?\", of course you will want to share a copy that's the friendly thing to do.\n\n What do you think of DRM actively trying to stop the right to repair?\n\n Well, the right to repair is basically a small part of the freedom that free software gives.  So of course I support the right to repair and anything that works against it is wrong.  But I would go much further in the right to repair.  I would say the software in your car, your tractor or your radio or whatever it might be should be free software.  And that basically, that provides the right to repair because it means that the users of the product can study how it works and they can extract the knowledge needed to do the repairs and share that knowledge, you know write it down, publish it and that way all the users of the product will be able to repair it.\n\n What do you think of the companies today leasing their products or services as per the EULA and abusing DMCA and DRM to prevent the consumers from having control of the things they own?\n\n [L]easing a product; if a company leases a product to you then you don't own it, however I would say that if you have the possession of the product for the long term, that's enough reason why the software in it should be free.  So you should be free to change that software.  Of course, maybe someday you terminate the lease and you return the product and they probably will restore the standard software inside it before they lease it to someone else.\n\n When I say product/services I meant the so-called software-as-a-service.\n\n Oh, software-as-a-service — it's too vague a term to mean anything.  It's of interest perhaps to  businesses for thinking about their strategies, but in terms of how they're treating customers it's too vague, it doesn't mean anything.\n\n I could call it service-as-a-software-substitute.\n\n Oh that's different, you see, though.  That is a much more specific term.  It doesn't cover as many different cases and that's why I use it because it's more specific, it's narrow enough that I can say something coherent about it.  I can't really say anything about \"software-as-a-service\" because it's too broad, it's too varied.  Service-as-a-software-substitute I can say something about because it is less varied.  It means that the service consists of running a certain program for you.  And my response is don't let someone else run it for you, run it yourself.  If it's a free program and you run it yourself, you have control over it and that's the way it should be.  If it's a free program, but you pay someone else to run it for you, then you don't really get control over what that program is doing, because it's running in a someone else's computer.\n\nOf course, if it's a non-free program then even if you run it yourself you don't really have control.  You don't have control over what it does, but you have more control if you were running it than if someone else is running it.\n\n So what do you mean when you say you own a copy of a software?\n\n Well, with free software, when you get a copy, you own it the same way you could own a chair.  You buy a chair you own it.  With a free software you buy a copy you own it.  But with, say consider, for instance, some software package you might think that you're buying a copy, but the company will say you don't own it, you just have a license to run it under limited terms.  Well I think that is mistreatment of the public.  That's part of the reason why I won't ever use that software.\n\n [T]alking about software, what are the set of rights an owner of a software must have?\n\n What do you mean by owner of a program?  Do you mean the developer, do you mean a user?\n\n Anybody who bought the software.\n\n Okay, so first of all, well, I would say since we're talking about the user of a program, that software should be free.  And that means that the user, any user, gets the four essential freedoms: Freedom zero is the freedom to run the program however you wish for whatever purpose you have in mind.  Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code of that program so they've got to give you the source and then change it so it functions the way you wish.  Freedom two is the freedom to make exact copies and then give or sell them to others and freedom 3 is the freedom to make copies of your modified versions and give or sell them to others.\n\n You talk about reselling.  Now it is completely okay if I had to resell a vehicle.  But in case, if it came with a software, let's take example of Tesla.\n\n Oh well please be careful.  You're using the term resell which is not a term I used.  What I said is the freedom to make copies and then give the or sell those copies to others.  Now that's not reselling in the usual sense of that word.  Because what I'm talking about involves making more copies.  With a free program, you have the right to copy it and give or sell the copies.  You also have with a free program you have the right to change the code and then copy that and give or sell copies.\n\nSo this is a rather firm stand.  It's not the same thing as you bought a car and you sell the same car to somebody else.\n\n Should that right also be protected for the free software.  If I get a copy of the software, should I be allowed to give that copy to someone else permanently?  Let's say I bought it on a DVD and I would give that DVD to someone else, me not having the copy at all.\n\n Well, that I expect is lawful nowadays although there are some that will try to make you sign a contract and won't let users get copies without that.  And that is an additional level of oppression.  But I'm going far beyond that.  I'm not just saying you should be allowed to resell the same copy.  I'm saying you should have the freedom to copy it to, make more copies.\n\n So while we are speaking about selling the exact the copy itself now consider this the Amazon Kindle.  It comes with the account tied to the Amazon account.  If I were to give it to someone else the books would not transfer.\n\n Well, that's one of the injustices of DRM.  This is one of the reasons I would never use an Amazon eBook, and I never have.  No company should know what books you have.  No company should be able to stop you from giving those books or selling those books to someone else.  And if the book is digital, that means it is possible to copy it so no company should be able to stop you from non-commercially copying and redistributing those books.  If you have a book and I would like a copy of it and you wish to copy it, you should be allowed to copy it for me.  You shouldn't have to, but if you feel like to, you know it might be a lot of trouble and you'd say \"I'm sorry, I'm too busy\", but if you want to do it and suppose it's easy, then you should be allowed to do it.  So I'm not just against the specific method, which is DRM, I'm against the goal that [it] is ostensibly meant to achieve — that goal shouldn't be achieved by anything.  People should be free to share.\n\n Why do you think the EULA exists?\n\n Oh, well you mean why do companies impose EULAs on programs.  Well they want to restrict people.  They're trying to subjugate users.  They have many ways of doing that.  I have never agreed to any EULA.\n\n You know the analogy that I prefer for DRM is think of a car that you just purchased.  The seller tells you that 'if it breaks down, come bring it to me and I'll fix it for you'.  One day you realise that it's not working.  Turns out the exhaust pipe has some blockage in it and if you try to fix that now the seller tells you, \"just because you did that now not only I'm not going to fix if the car breaks down I won't even let others fix it for you\".\n\n I would say I don't think they are similar.  They're not really analogous.  I would say that restriction on a car is comparable to the restrictions on proprietary software regardless of DRM.  You know any non-free program because typically it's impossible for you to fix it because they don't give you the source code.  Even if you are an authorised user, you can't have the source code for most non-free programs.  The source code's not released at all.  So you can't fix it yourself.  Now these various situations they're related but they're not closely analogous.  They're not the same thing going on in these different fields.  They're often somewhat different and both evil but not in exactly the same way.\n\n How has the software distribution changed over the decade specifically in the rights that the users had?\n\n Well, non-free software started to exist in the 1960s at least maybe in the 1950s.  But in the 1970s free software almost ceased to exist — all the software with small exceptions was proprietary, non-free.  And it was in the 1980s that I launched the attempt to re-establish free software and to liberate users.\n\n What are the problems with the DMCA 1201 which is circumvention of copyright protection [measures]?\n\n Well that basically the worst part of that is the complete prohibition on distributing things that — tools that can break DRM.  So for instance, anything that could access the video on a DVD or a BluRay disc is forbidden unless some company gives permission for it.  I'm not sure which company is allowed to give permission for it.  But basically you can't get permission for that so it has to be an underground device, one that is circulated without permission — a forbidden tool.\n\n What are the modifications that you would propose for the DMCA laws regarding anti-circumvention?\n\n I would eliminate them entirely.  I might make — I might go further, yeah, I would go further and say that making or selling or leasing or importing what is it making, importing, selling, or leasing any product with DRM is a crime.\n\n Is the Free Software Foundation, SF Conservancy and the Electronic Frontier Foundation aware of and working with any senator to sponsor a bill [for these changes]?\n\n I don't know what those other organisations are doing.  I don't think the Free Software Foundation has contacts so high in government.  You know, opposition to anti-circumvention existed around 20 years ago but it mostly got crushed what happens is most people will not continue to oppose the law once it has existed for some number of years.  It's too easy for people to say \"well we lost that one, now what battle are we gonna fight?\"  But people like me, we never give up.\n\nDRM is evil and since I will never accept a copy of anything with the DRM, I have to fight against DRM.\n\n What are some of the ways a digital publisher can sell copyrighted works...?\n\n The words you are using, I will not accept.  I'm not going to answer that question because to do it I would have to accept the concept of piracy and the concept of protected and I will not.  I refuse to use them.  When people, when they say piracy what they mean is sharing.  It's a smear term to insult people who share.  I will not smear sharing.  I think sharing is good and stopping people from sharing is evil.  Now I when they say protected, what they really mean is restricting.  And I think that's bad.  However I am in favor of supporting artists better.  The existing system changes so as to support artists less and less.  Now this has become a scandal in the field of music as the streaming disservices pay musicians so little when streaming their music that the musicians are basically going broke.  What this shows by the way is the hypocrisy of the copyright system which ostensibly exists to support the artists.  But in fact it supports businesses that screw the artists.\n\nWell, instead of trying to fix that system I say let's replace it and in the article in the page I told you about — copyright versus community, I propose two different two alternative systems to support artists.  So take a look at it.\n\n How should artists and publishers who sell their art (music, artwork, literature) in a digital form sell it without imposing DRM, without worrying about one individual paying for it, an redistributing it to a larger audience, non-commercially?\n\n You must accept that people will do this, because it would be wrong to try to stop them.\n\n How do you think the browsers are affected by implemented by w3c allowing EMEs [Encrypted Media Extensions] to exist?\n\n You mean allowing DRM in browser?  Well, basically what that means is free browsers cannot support the entire web standards.  The DRM is something that only non-free browsers can do.  So you have to decide do you want freedom or do you want to surrender to DRM and access the DRM covered works.  For me the choice is clear.  I won't accept a copy of a DRM infected work.  But the danger is that is will we be able to keep free browsers going at all.\n\n I believe in the announcements Mozilla mentioned how they had to choose between either supporting DRM or otherwise giving up on their[...]\n\n Yeah, well that's basically that's how these schemes are set up.  Most users don't understand freedom.  They have superficial short-term desires.  They want to get copies.  So if a conspiracy of publishers — and that's effectively what it was all, people don't like to think of it that way — if a conspiracy of publishers says \"we're all going to publish using this scheme to restrict you, so if you want to get anything from of the kind of work that we publish DRM will be your only way\", people will say all right we'll accept the DRM.  And then they push browser developers like Firefox and stores and so on into handling the DRM subjugated tools and products except for people like me who say, \"No thanks, I don't want any of those at all ever\".\n\n Was the  rather too late to prevent [damages of DRM]?\n\n I'm afraid so.  I'm afraid so.  Although of course, we don't know what would have happened if history had been different.  You can only speculate about that.\n\n Is there any scenario where DRM is morally justifiable?\n\n Not that I can imagine.  The users should be, first of all DRM means non-free software designed to stop people from doing things with copies of published works.  I don't think users should be stopped from copying and changing and sharing published works.  For art, they don't have to.  I don't think users have to be permitted to distribute modified versions.  But they must be permitted to non-commercially share copies and DRM always prohibits that.\n\n Are you aware of  and  that are used to install applications [on GNU/Linux]?\n\n I've heard of it and I know that they can be used to install non-free software which of course it's foolish to do.  You shouldn't trust a non-free program.  But yes you can install non-free software.  That has always been true and the reason is with free software ultimately you can do whatever you want.  There's no way to stop you.  So a free operating system always permits you to install non-free programs.\n\n The applications, which would otherwise be available in the distribution repository.  Now, the software developers are just moving towards...\n\n That's a bad thing.  That's a bad thing.  It's a foolish thing.  It's hard to trust these snaps and flatpaks.  And not only that, but those platforms distribute non-free software, so it's a bad idea to point to them at all.  And in addition, it means that there aren't multiple --  you know with with distributions, as distributions package a program they will look at the program and thus they can fix things, if they see anything bad they can change it.  And thus, this is part of how users collectively maintain their control.  I've never installed a snap or a flatpak.  And I don't think I want to.  I wouldn't.  I don't trust it.  How do I know whether that flatpak includes some non-free software.  How could I check?  I don't think they're designed to let people check.  They're not designed for anyone to be able to build the program.  As far as I know, I could be mistaken but if all everybody does is just install the binaries, in the flatpak.  Nobody's building it, how does anybody know if the complete source is available.", "question": "On November 16, which organization influenced GitHub's decision to restore public access to the youtube-dl repository?  \nA) Free Software Foundation  \nB) Electronic Frontier Foundation  \nC) Recording Industry Association of America  \nD) Creative Commons"}

{"title": "130 countries at OECD summit agree to back global corporate tax rate", "content": "On Thursday, 130 of the 139 countries and jurisdictions participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) summit on taxation agreed to support an overhaul to the international taxation system that would introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate, committing most of the world's economies to a two-pillar \"solution\".\n\nThe states which agreed to the plan's key components included regional divisions such as Gibraltar, Hong Kong and Montserrat, tax havens according to the Associated Press (AP) Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and all  (G20) countries, according to an OECD list, but not Barbados, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Kenya, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.  Peru also abstained, but due to its lack of government, reported The Guardian.\n\nThose that have signed represent over 90% of global  (GDP).  A press release by the OECD called the framework the result of \"negotiations coordinated by the OECD for much of the last decade\" and criticises the \"century-old international tax system\" for being \"no longer fit for purpose\".  The plan was backed by United States president Joe Biden according to multiple sources, and comes after a similar  deal on international taxation agreed on June 5.\n\nThe plan, officially the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\", adopted a pillared approach.  An implementation plan is to be finalised by October.\n\nIf implemented, the first would force multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover exceeding €20 billion and profitability above 10% to reallocate tax on over USD100 billion in profit from their home markets to each market jurisdiction it derived at least one million or 250 thousand euros from, depending on its GDP.  An OECD statement confirmed the threshold for affected MNEs under pillar one may change to those exceeding ten billion euros in turnover, dependent on the results of a review to be conducted in seven years' time.\n\nThe second pillar consists of two \"Global anti-Base Erosion Rules\" allocating top-up tax of a minimum of 15%, and one treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule\" to be made effective in 2023.\n\nThe effects of both pillars, though dependent on the plan's final framework, was estimated by the OECD to increase global corporate income tax (CIT) reserves by between 1.9 and 3.2%, or 50 and 80 billion USD.  If including the existing US tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the growth of CIT reserves would be between 2.3 and 4%, or 56 and 102 billion USD.  This would also protect against tax avoidance practices the OECD says costs countries between 100 and 240 billion USD in lost revenue per year, according to the AP.\n\nThe OECD also projects a \"relatively small\" negative effect on investment and activity equivalent to 0.1% of GDP in the medium- to long-term.   Other concerns cited include the potential governments may lose the ability to use tax incentives for policy objectives, as well as the cost of ensuring compliance. \n\nCountries opposed include Hungary and Ireland who have, according to , sought lower rates to attract , and have, in addition to Estonia according to the BBC, at least some corporate rates below the proposed floor of 15%.  The Irish and Hungarian headline corporate rates stand at 12.5 and 9%, respectively, according to The Guardian, with Ireland standing to lose over two billion euros in the next four years according to  (RTÉ).  A  tax summary mentions a tax exemption on undistributed corporate funds in Estonia, in addition to instances where a 14% rate is applicable.\n\nOECD secretary general  said in the press release \"this historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere\", adding while it \"does not eliminate tax competition [...] it does set multilaterally agreed limitations\".\n\nBiden said the deal means the world is in \"striking distance of full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom\", which US treasury secretary  described as a race \"no nation\" has won, according to The Guardian.  Finance minister for France  called it the \"most important international tax agreement in a century\", according to the BBC.\n\nAccording to RTÉ, finance minister for Ireland  said while he \"expressed Ireland's reservation\", he remains \"committed to the process\" and assures the global community \"Ireland will continue to play our part in reaching a comprehensive and, indeed, historic agreement\".  According to Reuters, on June 9, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán called the proposal \"absurd\", and insisted the country's low rates \"is not meant to attract certain companies to declare their taxes here\", nor makes it \"a tax haven\".\n\n, Italy is to host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at a \"G20 High-Level Tax Symposium\" on July 9, according to the Italian .\n\nes:130 países de la OCDE acuerdan respaldar la tasa impositiva corporativa global", "question": "What is the minimum corporate tax rate proposed by the OECD plan that 130 of the 139 participating countries agreed to?  \n\nA) 10%  \nB) 12.5%  \nC) 15%  \nD) 20%"}

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then. However, South Gippsland's council is scheduled to be restored with an election to be held via post from October 5-22, 2021.\n\nWikinews interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, Sue Plowright. She is an independent contesting the Coastal-Promontory ward, which covers towns such as , , , , , and . The Coastal-Promontory Ward elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n I have four initial priorities to achieve in the three years the new Council will serve. The first is to contribute my ethical governance skills and knowledge to build a trusted and dynamic Council that is widely recognised for applying due process and being diligently accountable. South Gippslanders deserve a Council that acts with dignity and respect for the people and democratic processes. Achieving widespread recognition for very good governance practices, will, among other gains, enable Council to better attract funding, public, private and philanthropic, to resource opportunities such as community power projects, widespread shifts to regenerative farming, ensuring tourism is sustainable and sustainably supported and adequate community services care for the people of the Shire.\n\nSecondly, turning climate change into exciting opportunities rather than a divisive issue is a key goal I want to achieve. At a minimum, all councils have a legal obligation to tackle climate change as per the Local Government Act 2020, but the situation is urgent and so minimal responses are not enough but organisations like  are a great role model - they’ve been working bit by bit for example to fence off and revegetate rivers flowing into  for 20 years or more through providing information, incentives and value adding for farmers and landowners.\n\nThe leadership of a switched on and dedicated Council can play a similar role, by connecting and enhancing all the small projects and initiatives that locals are already doing like the shared power project at . As a first action therefore, I will support a declaration of a climate emergency, accompanied by development of a community-led action plan that is then resourced in subsequent budgets, strategic plans and works to support and increase individuals and community initiatives.\n\nMy third priority is support for a full time youth officer/coordinator position in Council in order to facilitate a strong network of young people, services and volunteers to create spaces and events for young people, because I see shires like nearby Wellington Shire providing so many more opportunities. And fourthly, I’m working with a group we’re calling Mayday Projects to better utilise existing properties in the area to help alleviate the affordable housing emergency that we, along with many regional areas, are facing. I provide more detail about these two projects in question 6.\n\nIn summary, there are of course so many aspects to life in South Gippsland councillors will need to consider and address, thus a councillor’s approach to decision making is important. My own golden rules are to seek out diverse perspectives though listening and talking to a wide range of community members and experts; thoroughly prepare for meetings through diligently reading briefings, research reports and doing my own research; being prepared to consider new possibilities; and work to enhance existing initiatives and good will by making connections.\n\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n\n From my position as a new observer of the Council when I moved to live full time in Toora in 2016, it became clear by 2019 that a circuit breaker was required. In the end, with so many resignations and countbacks the Council make up no longer reflected the choices of the people at the 2016 election, while acrimony and dysfunction appeared to overshadow any initiatives that were achieved. I think democratic elections are always a priority over any other model or arrangement of governance and so I do think elections in 2020 along with the majority of Councils in Victoria would have been desirable. However, the two years has given South Gippslanders time to rethink and reinvigorate how we do democracy and I lend my support to this important cause through standing myself and encouraging diverse others to do so also.\n\n , which takes up the majority of Coastal-Promontory ward's land area, attracts a significant amount of tourists on a yearly basis. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown, there has been a large impact on local businesses. What do you think needs to be done to help business recover?\n\n Businesses facing the COVID pandemic are like a batsman/woman facing an incoming bouncer in cricket. Some have been able to put bat to ball and belt out a six and are thriving in the new circumstances, while for others the ball has bounced awkwardly. I'm a sole trader, having started my own educational consultancy practice in mid-2019. By the end of that year I was getting excited about what I could achieve with some interesting work in schools coming my way. But just when I was about to get cracking after the summer holidays in Term 1 2020, the first COVID lockdown hit, and the rest as they say, is history. I was not in a position to 'pivot' online as I did not yet have the recognition and networks required to shift from face to face professional development delivery to online.\n\nIt was demoralising but I’m not alone, many businesses relying on tourism for example have copped a difficult bouncer too. Business recovery strategies will therefore necessarily need to be diverse and targeted, because one size will not fit all. Some might benefit from working through a reinventing process where they’re supported through mentoring or education strategies such as a Deloittes COVID-19 recovery workbook that suggests business owners reflect, restart and revitalise. Some might benefit from re-establishment or revitalisation of traders associations and Chambers of Commerce where the focus is on a whole-of-town or district strategy. Others might benefit from provision of training and retraining opportunities, which might require lobbying  providers and state government to provide appropriate courses. Multiple efforts and strategies will be required to recover, reinvent and revitalise adversely impacted businesses.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n There are so many issues around environmental protection that both need to be tackled and can also offer opportunities for farmers, communities, individuals and the beautiful South Gippsland environment. Environmental protection is a delicate balance between carrot and stick approaches. As an educator, I favour the first approach but of course regulations and legislation with ‘teeth’ are also required. In relation to the carrot approach though, one of the reforms required is to address the short term nature, and very often narrow focus, of funding for environmental projects.\n\nMany are funded for a year or two but it takes a tree much longer to grow than that and much longer to eradicate weeds and pest animals such as rabbits. Individuals and organisations end up spending hours hunting for funding sources and writing detailed and exacting submissions with no guarantee of a result. Then reporting and aquittal requirements don’t always respond to circumstances - such as COVID lockdowns. A whole of government and systematic review of how projects are identified, supported and funded to recognise the long term nature of environmental protection projects is required, and a dynamic Council can play a role in achieving that.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n Councils are often associated with rates, roads and rubbish. Education is often said to be the three r’s of reading, (w)riting, and ‘rithmetic. So as an educator who wants to be elected to Council, I propose I have three qualifications for being a councillor: experience, expertise, and energy.\n\nIn terms of experience, I have 35+ years experience as a manager, leader, educator and administrator in a wide range of organisations, including a Shire Council as a Social Planner where I started a Youth Council and a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Group. I’ve been a senior project officer in the , as it was called when I was there and managed a large team in a faculty of education in a large Victorian university.\n\nIn terms of expertise, I have a PhD in democracy, governance and education that adds extensive and in-depth knowledge to my experiences, that I think is very important for a new Council starting afresh after administrators. I also bring energy and commitment to community as demonstrated by my involvement and leadership in many community service activities. For example I co-founded and still run Corner Inlet Youth Council and co-founded and help run Mayday Projects, a group that works on practical projects and advocacy at levels of government to increase women’s safety.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n I have two particular projects to highlight and advocate for, among many. The first is opportunities for young people. South Gippsland Shire Council doesn’t have a dedicated youth officer or coordinator and I have joined with others to previously submit that a full time position be created through the latest Council budget consultation process.\n\nWe were unsuccessful but young people need to be a high priority, always, but never more so given the COVID lockdowns, which is severely restricting their opportunities to develop socially and emotionally and just have the fun that young people should have. As soon as we can, we as a society and community need to make quick opportunities for our young folk to catch up on all the fun they’re missing out on. There are several mental health support and education strategies in place which is important, but so is having a good time.\n\nA second project is finding a practical model for fixing and kitting out some of the empty properties around small towns and on farms etc. There is a housing affordability and availability emergency in many regional areas, including South Gippsland. SGSC is developing proposals to the State Government’s Big Build initiative and I fully support that. In the meantime as a founding member of Mayday Projects smaller, targeted and tailored projects to the needs of particular people and families and landlords could also make an impact through the cumulative effect of multiple small projects. This could also reduce the environmental impact that large new developments tend to create unless very carefully designed.\n\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n\n I began campaigning just before the latest regional Victoria lockdown. Restrictions were in place so I was busy having lots of coffee catch ups in cafes around Coastal Promontory Ward and indeed around the shire. I was also having a crash course in social media, which is just as well given this current lockdown looks like it might last for much, if not all, of the campaign.\n\nI have a campaign website and Facebook page and am slowly building up followers, but I do struggle as usually my daughters would help me but they’re in Melbourne and very busy with home schooling, study, etc etc and I don’t want to add more work to their to do lists. I’m increasing the number of local groups I follow on Facebook, which helps me learn what’s happening and what people are talking about.\n\nI’m running open Zoom meet and greets on Mondays at 12 noon and 8pm. In addition, I’m arranging many Zoom meet and greets with groups of friends, neighbours, interest groups, community groups, organisations, businesses etc. to hear a diverse range of ideas, wish lists and concerns. I have freely provided my phone number to anyone and everyone and a few people are taking the opportunity to call me, as well as contact me via my website and Facebook page.\n\n Have you ever run for a political office prior to your current candidacy for council?\n\n I have run for political office twice prior to my current candidacy for Coastal Promontory Ward in the South Gippsland Shire Council elections of 2021. In 2008 I ran for Sandridge Ward of  Council elections, and in 2010 I ran for the  - it’s had a name and boundary change since then. In both of these instances I ran for the , but I resigned from that party in early 2012 because while doing my PhD in democracy, I developed a strong conviction that independent thinking and community voice should drive democracy rather than party loyalties. Thus, I’m now a very dedicated independent, committed to working closely with communities, other councillors, the CEO, other Councils and levels of government in order to respond to, and represent, the people of South Gippsland.\n\n ", "question": "What was one of Sue Plowright's initial priorities as a candidate for the South Gippsland Shire Council?\n\nA) Promoting tourism as the primary economic driver  \nB) Supporting renewable energy projects  \nC) Establishing a full-time youth officer position  \nD) Increasing funding for agricultural initiatives"}

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then. However, South Gippsland's council is scheduled to be restored with an election to be held via post from October 5-22, 2021.\n\nWikinews interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, Mat Morgan. He is running as a candidate in the Coastal-Promontory Ward, and is endorsed by the . The Coastal-Promontory ward covers towns such as , , , , , and , and elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n As a South Gippsland Shire councillor, my priorities will be: \n1) Declare a climate emergency and forming a community-led climate action plan to address climate change, reduce emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n2) Deliver the quality services that care for our community's health and wellbeing, while rebuilding small businesses and supporting local arts and tourism.\n3) Protect our natural environment.\n4) Address gendered violence along with all forms of discrimination and promote respect and equality for all.\n\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since the 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n\n The two years without a democratically elected body has been far from ideal as were the operations of the dismissed council. I think South Gippsland is more than ready for a fresh start and to have some new faces sitting at the table.\n\n , which takes up the majority of Coastal-Promontory ward's land area, attracts a significant amount of tourists on a yearly basis. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown, there has been a large impact on local businesses. What do you think needs to be done to help business recovery?\n\n Businesses in the tourism sector have suffered inevitably and continue to in times of COVID. What we need to ensure; is that when we do open up again, we do it better than ever. We need more camping spots to bring people here, and we need more things to see and do, in order to keep them in this beautiful part of the world. Let's put live music back in our cafes and bars, let's bring more attention to our incredible food and wine, there's so much to do including protecting the  from ecological decline.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n I'd like to see a climate emergency declaration and subsequent action plan. This has been achieved with overwhelming support by our neighbours in Bass Coast, and can be tailored to the needs of South Gippsland. 's Prom Area Climate Action and their sister group Just Transition have already drafted a plan and are looking for some genuine leadership on grass roots climate action. I can bring that leadership, not just write about climate action on my advertising material.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n Our council should be representative of South Gippsland's residents. I don’t know when the last time someone my age had a seat at this table, but I can promise you that a certain age and wealth bracket has been over represented for a long time, I live and work in this community, I study politics and philosophy and I want to represent the people of my ward, not vested interests.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n There are many fantastic initiatives already, from the  composter, to our 24/7 library in Foster. I'd like to advocate for more accessibility, from more footpaths and bike trails, to sealing Mt Best Road and others. I'd also like to advocate for more shelter belts and wildlife corridors away from roads; this will reduce the animal population density on the side of our rural highways.\n\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n\n I'm lucky to have been working as a barista in Foster and we have managed to stay open through most of these lockdowns. So I have been enjoying hearing what people are looking forward to from their newly elected council reps. For those who don't drink coffee, I am posting every day on my Facebook page which can be found at: @MatMorganGreens.\n\n Why did you choose to run as a Greens candidate for local council?\n\n I am endorsed by the Greens and generally support their policies, though there are no specific local council Greens policies. They are helping me fundraise and run my campaign as I don't have endless financial resources like some other councillors (unfortunately). Also, many council candidates are often endorsed by political parties though choose not to disclose it.

Cousin is endorsed by the , and is contesting the Tarwin Valley ward, which elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council, and includes the towns of  and .\n\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n I care about South Gippsland and local democracy and want to see our community, economy and environment thrive and be far more resilient. South Gippsland deserves a Council that listens and engages the community and is wise in using and developing the community's resources. It deserves councilors who work together for the whole community's benefit. So, I'm making a commitment to Tarwin Valley and South Gippsland if I'm elected to work hard to:\n\n1. Restore community confidence in local government, focusing on openness, participation, and ethical behaviour.  \n\n2. Increase community involvement in Council's policies, plans and strategies to deal with climate change and public health, economic and environmental challenges.\n\n3. Find better ways of managing Council's business to improve rate fairness and standards accountability and service.\n\n4. Provide leadership and advocacy to improve our country, economy, and community wellbeing.\n\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n\n The Administrators virtually closed-off public participation and engagement in Council decision making. Councillors play an important role in listening to residents and ratepayers, bringing their concerns to Council and the CEO for resolution. Three Melbourne-based Commissioners just can’t perform the roles and duties of 9 elected councillors. The Administrators have made long term decisions on many things, including tourism and economic development plans and the Council Plan that really should have been formulated with community direction and widespread collaboration and participation. Many who made submissions on these plans didn’t get a response to their issues. Other important Council plans need urgent refresh including the Health and Wellbeing Plan which is now out of date. Priority should be given to refreshing these plans to help our community towards a better future.\n\n Since 1993, South Gippsland has not had a passenger railway service, when the  service to Leongatha was closed. Do you think that these services should be brought back, and why/why not?\n\n It's difficult to reinstate V/Line rail services now the railway corridor has been converted into the . The Leongatha to  section is increasingly popular for locals tourists; and the  to Leongatha section is now being constructed. One of my wish projects is to ensure this trail is continuous and passes safely through Leongatha.\n\nIn the last Council, Andrew McEwan was Council's nominee on the Regional Transport Forum, which collated residents’ public transport needs. Our community is very supportive of improved public transport within the Shire's townships, between the Shire's and other regional centres - especially the Latrobe Valley where a lot of people work. Some said the services to and from Melbourne were ok. What people mostly asked for was better timetabling and more stop off and pick up points on all routes with the possibility of feeder mini-buses linking in to key drop off points were needed to provide finer grain transport services. The  itself is generating further demand for public transport to return walkers and riders back-to-their starting points.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n The Local Government Act requires Council to promote action on climate change. Council has already started this. Faced with more frequent natural events and disasters we need to fast-track a community-based response to climate change and biodiversity loss. Initiatives to improve community resilience will help manage the impacts on Council roads and services and reduce business and resident disruptions to energy, water and transport networks. \n\nCouncil already does some fine collaborative work in natural disaster preparedness, and this should continue, engaging farmers, and community organisations as well to increase resilience and improve our disaster preparedness.\n\nNature's beauty is a cornerstone of South Gippsland's tourism - our native forests, rolling hills and coastlines. Look closer you'll see landscapes on both public and private land that need regeneration and native flora and fauna need protection. Council can play a role in this, principally through collaboration and advocacy. Agencies working together, joining the dots, can achieve a lot more than working alone. For example, to better fulfil obligations under the Catchment and Land Protection Act and Planning Scheme I'd like to see Council improve the way it works with landcare groups, the CMA and other water authorities. \n\nWe need to take a shire-wide look at ways to improve roads and roadside safety rather than the piecemeal approach to works that creates more problems than they solve. Through regional collaboration with government agencies and the private sector Council can set out a Transport Plan for heavy vehicles and other traffic, road and intersection upgrades and public transport. Again, collaboration and advocacy are the key.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n I have a mix of skills and experience which give me a great grounding to be a local councillor. I'm qualified in urban and regional planning and I've worked in local government across three states. My approach to planning focuses on problem solving, advocacy and community engagement. My knowledge of Victoria's planning system means I can respond capably to planning matters that come to Council for a decision. My strategic skills mean I can take a holistic, fact-based approach to the issues that come before Council.\n\nI have a degree in public administration, and experience at senior levels in Victorian and Commonwealth governments, so I know how governments work, the separation of powers and the laws that govern Council. With this knowledge comes a close adherence to ethical behaviour.\n\nI grew up on a dairy farm in Gippsland and have strong connections to many of the Shire's food producers and farmers.  More recently I've focused on natural resource management, water governance, regenerative agriculture, and biodiversity conservation, so I know the whole of the Shire quite well, and some of the nuts and bolts of South Gippsland's economy.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n For the last four years, I've been volunteering with the Mirboo North district community to help preserve our native forests. A beautiful citizen-science report will soon been released on the rich biodiversity of the Mirboo North State Forest, which plays a big role in community wellbeing and water supply, attracts many visitors which many of the businesses in the Tarwin Valley rely on.\n\nI'd like to see rail trails, continuous and promoted as a unique tourism experience which invites visitors and residents alike to experience the fine foods grown and produced here, visit our towns and natural areas and take advantage of the array of bed and breakfast and health retreats and cultural events.\n\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n\n Early last year, I coordinated Mirboo North and district's fantastic community response to the bushfires to help East Gippsland's remote communities. As a food producer I keep in contact with a lot of small traders and customers across the Shire and region. I love talking with people at farmers markets. During the lockdowns, I'm taking to social media to reach out. I've kept up with people engaged in regenerative agriculture and climate change via zoom and the occasional meeting during breaks in lockdown. But now that we can move around more freely, I'm to getting back to driving to each local area in the ward and having great face to face discussions. We all need social contact.\n\n Why did you choose to run as a Greens candidate for local council?\n\n In 2016, I became very concerned about the overuse of toxic chemicals in Council's day-to-day operations and was unhappy with the dismissive way my concerns were treated by Council. I felt Council could make some basic changes to improve customer and community responsiveness, so I threw my hat in the ring for the 2016 election as an independent candidate for South Gippsland Council. I had a good community response, but not enough to take a seat on Council at that time.\n\nAs a farmer and food producer who cares for the environment, I found most political parties were very slow to act, or worse, denying the existence of the huge issues I saw threatening our wellbeing and existence, which left me deeply unsatisfied. I joined the Greens because I found they have many values that I agree with and positive proposals to deal with the big issues I'm concerned about; and they and are open to new ideas and continuous learning, all of which appealed to me. I see myself now as a Country Green, grounded in agriculture, our environment, and the South Gippsland community. I'm ready to listen, to learn, and to focus on practical action to make a positive difference to our community and planet.\n\nAfter joining the Greens, in October 2018 I was elected by countback to Council after a sitting Councillor resigned. I did the right thing and openly declared my political affiliation. While people generally believe that local government is not party political, in my experience most councillors don't openly declare their political affiliations even though they have one. The laws governing being a councillor are clear about declaring personal interests and conflicts of interest. This transparency and honesty to the public is vital, and in my view extends to party political affiliations too.\n\n \n \n ", "question": "What is one of Rosemary Cousin's primary goals if elected as a councillor for the South Gippsland Shire Council?\n\nA) To privatize all public transport services  \nB) To restore community confidence in local government  \nC) To eliminate all forms of local government  \nD) To reduce the number of councillors to three"}

I hope to clean up politics, ban corporate donations including developer influences in politics so that politics is based on grassroots democracy and actually works for the people.\n\n How has the recent  effected your campaign and how you've reached out to voters?\n\n This election was called during the lockdown within a very short timeframe, very difficult compliance issues regarding new  city council rules such as having to register signs placed on people's private lawns, and yet both the major parties were out campaigning before the election was called, with the LNP even sending out letters to every household asking them to register for postal voting before anyone knew the dates for the commencement of postal voting for this election.  This made for an unfair election timeframe for smaller parties as there was a lack of transparency of the rules, which suited those already in power.  As for living, working and voting in a covid[-19]-safe environment? This is not a problem.  We are able to vote in a covid[-19]-safe environment and democracy is still important.\n\n What local issues in the Stretton area would you like to see addressed?\n\n Stretton is the most multicultural electorate in Queensland and we need to address that in this electorate with appropriate services identified by the constituents.  We need fully funded health care and education that is fully inclusive of everyone in this electorate.  Our area also needs a more reliable (and free!) public transport system and lower electricity costs through the use of renewable energy.  Domestic Violence is an issue, housing affordability is an issue, a shortage of rental houses in this area is an issue - but I think the main issue on everyone's minds at the moment is Covid[-19] and the vaccine rollout.  I believe more local, multi-lingual health hubs that are bulk billed, can help with vaccine hesitancy and help get us through this pandemic.  This will avoid more closures of our local cafes, restaurants, gyms, beauty services, musicians and our tattoo artists who are also running small businesses.\n\n Could you explain to me your thoughts on the recent voluntary assisted dying legislation passed by the government?\n\n My personal thoughts on this legislation are that after working in health care for 20 years and assisting people through end-of-life decisions, I can appreciate that this legislation could be beneficial for someone who wants to advocate for themselves and choose how and when the end of their life is to be - to have control over those decisions.  I am also a person who is disabled and therefore, I understand the fear that this legislation brings with it and I understand that some members of the community would be deeply troubled by this legislation; for religious reasons or otherwise.  I believe that religion should be kept separate from our legislation and therefore, my decision to support the legislation is based on science, human rights and personal autonomy.\n\n What are your thoughts on  's decision to travel to the Tokyo Olympics in support of Brisbane's  bid?\n\n I've been following discussions from community members and it doesn't seem like people in the community are happy with the Premier travelling to Tokyo at this time, considering many community members have been separated from their overseas family members for so long now.  It seems like such a contradiction that those in power or elite sport or corporates or the wealthy are able to come and go out of the country whenever they like but there are different rules for the working class.  I can understand why my community is upset.  Everyone has also been made to pivot to online meetings during Covid[-19] too.  However, I can also understand that the Olympics 2032 may be seen by some as a good opportunity for Brisbane and Queensland.  It's important to note that the  were touted as economically benefic[i]al as well, but the forecast benefits were not actually realised and there was a massive disruption for local residents.\n\n Businesses, as of 9 July, are mandated to make customers register their visits using the Check In Queensland app. What do you think about this decision by the state government?\n\n As a public health professional, I understand that logging every location we attend is important at the moment to assist contact tracing.  I also understand that my community is frustrated by what they perceive as an invasion of their privacy.  The rules around how the data is used need to be strengthened to ensure situations like those that have happened where the police accessed this information cannot happen again.

However, the average wait time of just under eleven weeks has been steadily declining since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove total admissions to hospital down, according to The Guardian.\n\nTotal admissions for surgery and normal treatment have increased fourfold to nearly pre-pandemic levels from 54,550 last year to 242,064 in May, according to Sky News.  In May 2019, there were 295,881 admissions for routine treatment.\n\nThe rise in demand is primarily due to a surge in non-COVID-related admissions: over two million people visited the  (A&E) last month, for example, in the busiest ever June.  A blog post published Wednesday by the  warned increasing demand in urgent, non-COVID-related healthcare in both children and adults are \"putting severe and unprecedented strain on the urgent care system, with unsustainable numbers of people now visiting A&E, seeing their  [general practitioners] and calling ambulances.\"\n\nWait times are trending downward, according to Sky News.  Between April and May, the number of people waiting over 52 weeks for treatment fell by 50 thousand, though still thirteen times higher than last year.  Patients waiting over eighteen weeks dropped by 83 thousand in the same time, \"for the first time this year\", according to NHS medical director .  However, the percent of those who received treatment within eighteen weeks, 67%, remained below the NHS standard of 92%, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe average wait time for elective care of 10.8 weeks was down 29% from May last year, according to the NHS Confederation's chief executive Matthew Taylor. In a blog post on the  organisation's web site he remarked the \"treatment backlog of 5.3 million patients\" nonetheless \"show[s] that while waiting lists are still rising, more people are coming forward for care, which is encouraging, as this is exactly what the NHS is there for.\"\n\nTaylor went on to say \"our urgent care system [is] running a winter-like service in the middle of summer\", adding \"we must go into this next phase with our eyes wide open, and acknowledge much of the care the NHS can provide to patients is likely to be disrupted further, including in the community.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported other issues, including that nearly 25% of patients in A&E waited over four hours to be seen.  Only 75% of cancer patients were seen within two weeks of cancer screening, below a target of 90%, or a GP's urgent referral, below a target of 85%.  An October analysis by   estimates from the year before, 50 thousand fewer people were diagnosed with cancer, a backlog it warned could grow by four thousand missed diagnoses per month to over 100 thousand this October, and urgent referral activity in England for August was 11% behind 2019 levels. \n\nThe NHS has said it budgeted one billion  on restoring services and clearing the waiting list, according to The Guardian.\n\n32,551 new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom were reported on Thursday and another 35 attributable deaths, according to Sky News, up over four thousand from the week before, and the highest since the week of January 27 .

The law is set to take effect in 2024.\n\nThe bill says that \"a retail department store that offers childcare items or toys for sale shall maintain a gender neutral section or area, to be labeled at the discretion of the retailer, in which a reasonable selection of the items and toys for children that it sells shall be displayed, regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.\" Boy and girl sections are not prohibited, but a common section alongside them is required. While the original version included clothing, during  proceedings that part was removed from the text.\n\nNon-compliance calls for a US$250 civil penalty for a first case, and US$500 for subsequent violations. Courts could order the violator to pay court costs and attorney's fees. \n\nAssembly members  and , both members of the Democratic Party, introduced the bill into the , the lower house of the state's legislature. AB-1084 was amended by both houses, then passed the Assembly in a 49-16 vote on September 2 before being sent to the governor's desk for approval.\n\nSpeaking about the bill, Low said, \"Part of it is to make sure if you're a young girl that you can find a police car, fire truck, a periodic table or a dinosaur. And then similarly, if you're a boy, if you're more artistic and want to play with glitter, why not? Why should you feel the stigma of saying, 'Oh, this should be shamed', and going to a different location?\"\n\nOn July 25, Garcia noted in a Facebook post, \"As a math teacher I saw 1st hand how playtime creates the building blocks for attaining spatial awareness that’s important for studying geometry, unfortunately these toys are often labeled as boy toys. Removing the gender identity from these toys will hopefully lead to more boys & girls entering  fields.\"\n\nThe bill was opposed by members of the Republican Party: Republican state Senator  said, \"I don't think parents need the government to step in and tell them how they should shop for their children\". In opposition of the bill, the Capitol Resource Institute argued that \"it is not the business of the government to instruct retail stores how they should display and market their merchandise.\" \n\nOn April 6, during a public hearing before the Business and Professions Committee of the Assembly, Greg Burt of the California Family Council called AB-1084 \"impossible to comply with\" as it does not define the intended meaning of \"reasonable amount\" and \"a bill like this opens the door to a never-ending number of complaints from activist groups who don’t like the way stores are marketing their products to one sex or another\".\n\nAssembly Bill 2826, introduced to the Assembly by Low in 2020, which targeted a similar goal, died in the Legislature.\n\nRetail corporation , with 1915 stores in the United States, dropped traditional toy section labeling in 2015. \"In fact it would be more difficult to find a large retailer today that segregates toys by gender\", noted the Southwest California Legislative Council, an opponent of the bill.\n\nhu:incubator:Wn/hu/A nagyobb kaliforniai áruházak 2024-től kötelesek a játékokat nemsemleges módon is forgalmazni", "question": "What is the primary requirement of Assembly Bill 1084 (AB-1084) signed by Gavin Newsom?  \n\nA) Retailers must eliminate all toy sections.  \nB) Retailers must maintain a gender-neutral area for childcare products and toys.  \nC) Retailers must only sell toys for boys.  \nD) Retailers must display only traditional gender-marketed toys."}

Connop has previously stood for both the  (ALP) and the CLP. He pleaded guilty to perjury in 2018 after inaccurately claiming on his website that his legal expertise covered work, health, and safety law.\n\n Why do you want to represent Daly?\n\n The people of Daly have raised issues close to their hearts and they’ve been ignored and sold out by the ALP and CLP governments.

Genuine collaboration is needed to put forward all the diverse voices of the Daly to the government.\n\n You've run in many previous elections, including a 2008 run here in Daly as a Country Liberal candidate.

What are your thoughts on how the vaccine rollout is progressing in regards to Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory?\n\n Indigenous people have been eligible since the beginning of the year, so it's disappointing to see such low vaccination rates in remote communities. Everyone who wants to be vaccinated should have access to it; the government needs to do better.\n\n What experience have you had within your community that qualify you to be an MP?\n\n I have 27 years of experience in federal and state public service as well as decades of experience as a lawyer.

The previous Member,  of the  (CLP), resigned in August. Daly covers communities near , as well as more remote places such as  and .\n\nVia email, Wikinews interviewed Rebecca Jennings, who is standing in the Daly by-election as an independent candidate. Jennings previously contested the  as a candidate for the  party. She ran in the , and received 242 votes (5.6% of the vote).\n\n Why do you want to represent Daly?\n\n I am a born and raised Territorian who grew up in Darwin's rural area, attending the local schools, and I’ve represented and been actively involved in the community through sport, youth advocacy and local issues for many years. I have been very lucky to work right across the entire Daly region, from Timber Creek through to  and everything in between. We need a stronger and independent regional voice, someone who is willing to speak up, isn't afraid of challenging the status quo and someone who has lived and breathed the Daly region. I believe I can provide a strong and informed local voice for Daly.\n\n Daly covers a mix of more urban suburbs on Darwin's outskirts and more rural and remote communities such as Timber Creek and Wadeye. How would you, as the MP for Daly, balance these interests?\n\n The Daly is a mix of rural, regional and remote areas, as well as small towns scattered throughout as service areas. All are unique and need adequate attention; we have seen many regions neglected in the past and during campaigning many constituents have stated that previous members were never present in their communities and contacting them was extremely difficult. Being present, knowing your constituents and being readily available in a multitude of ways, be it print, phone, social media or regular forums, will give you the upper hand to make informed decisions about what to prioritise to ensure no community goes without.\n\n Have you ever run for an election before?\n\n I have – I ran with Territory Alliance in 2020 for the seat of Fannie Bay as I lived in Darwin at the time and was deeply disgruntled with a few things in the local area. It was an excellent opportunity to dip my feet into politics in the  and the team were so supportive I couldn't fault them.\n\n At the moment, in New South Wales, we are seeing a COVID-19 outbreak in the remote town of , which is majority . What are your thoughts on how the vaccine rollout is progressing in regards to Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory?\n\n The vaccine rollout has been slow in part due to the remoteness of our communities and people not wanting to have the COVID vaccine; which I agree that people should have the full autonomy to choose what happens to their bodies, but if you are at risk or want to protect your family and community, it would be good to see the vaccine uptake increase. It's unfortunate that Wilcannia has experienced these problems, but overcrowding and the general disadvantage in healthcare we see in Aboriginal communities across Australia makes any community susceptible to an outbreak.\n\n What experience have you had within your community that qualify you to be an MP?\n\n I've worked across government agencies, not for profit organisations and the private sector, including event management and hospitality. I have also represented on numerous community committees, including local sporting committees, youth committees and women advisory committees in the NT. Understanding a variety of industries, government processes, legislation and community-driven projects I believe is necessary for standing as a MP (or MLA in the NT). In addition to the professional qualities, someone who has lived, worked and understands the region is more suitable to stand as a spokesperson for their community; someone with local knowledge and real passion to drive progress in a sustainable way.\n\n How have you been running your campaign as an independent?\n\n My messaging has been concise, local and achievable making it easy to get my voice across via social media (Facebook and ) as well as local radio and podcasts. Social media has been the best tool in this day, but face-to-face stalls at markets and local shops are always received well by the community and gives people the opportunity to discuss things with you. If there were more lead-up time prior to the election it would have been ideal to do online Q&As to allow people from the remote areas (and in a time of COVID) to meet their candidate in a 'public' forum.\n\n How do you think the delivery of health services could be improved in the Northern Territory?\n\n Connectivity has been a continual theme throughout my campaign, we need to be able to connect people to remote service health hubs, whether that be via public bus services, better roads, roaming health care or even investing in the technology to talk to health practitioners via videolink for non-urgent appointments. This would reduce the reactivity in the healthcare sector as people would be able to regularly access providers.\n\n What are your thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\n This is a complicated and multi-faceted issue, one of which I don't have all the answers, but what I am frustrated about is the lack of alternative sentencing arrangements and incarceration for crimes that might be better suited to non-jailable sentences, such as community service.\n\n How are you funding your campaign?\n\n I am self-funding the campaign and have needed to be strategic with my spending. I luckily have had strong support from family, friends and volunteers who have given their time (the most precious resource in a campaign), but it would have been easier having sponsors and been able to receive donations like the bigger parties.\n\n What's one key law reform you'd like to pursue as an MP?\n\n As an independent it can be tricky to pass private member bills, but some big reforms I would like to see passed in my lifetime include, reinstating the euthanasia law, legalizing cannabis, decriminalising other drugs, strengthening the environmental protection legislation and removing floor pricing from alcohol sales (as it only benefits the suppliers and bottle shops). But I think one of the key reforms I would love to action immediately is strengthening of the Water Act to protect our waterways and water sources; we would need to see appropriate penalties for illegal extraction and a tightened control on licensing to reduce overuse.

I was a student-athlete (Tennis) and musician (Saxophone).  I went to college at the University of Notre Dame, in  [Indiana], where I studied Finance.

I received my passing bar exam results on April 20th, 2021 and I am now licensed to deal blackjack, which I plan to do part time at night while growing my solo law practice based in downtown Cleveland.\n\n What made you decide to run for Mayor of Cleveland?\n\n I love my home, the city of Cleveland, and I believe it is a great place with amazing Neighbors.  In the future, I believe Cleveland will be recognized as the best place to live in the United States. However, living here today, we are confronted with the reality that our city government suffers from poor leadership.  The consequences are severe: rampant crime, litter and blight, poorly maintained streets, ineffective schools, and waste are just a few of the ways our Neighbors suffer from poor government leadership[.] Rather than just complain about it, I decided to run for mayor with a goal of improving leadership in city government and provision of city services to our people.\n\n What are some of the reasons Clevelanders should vote for you?\n\n I am a leader, not a politician, and a true change candidate.  I am committed to service above self, and I am not looking to use the office of mayor as a stepping stone to greater power or more money.  I will finally hold municipal departments accountable for effectively serving the city.\n\n Please elaborate on your service in the US military.\n\n I joined the Army ROTC after my second year at the University of Notre Dame, and earned a commission from the President on the day I graduated in 2013.

Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.  And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all.\"  The good leader, as I have witnessed in the military, is a servant of the mission and the team. He does not lord his position over his charges but instead seeks to assume their burdens to whatever extent is possible and prudent.\n\n What are some of the things you would do as Cleveland Mayor?\n\n Reform and empower the Division of Police to protect our Neighbors; demand adequacy and discipline in our public schoolhouses; take the initiative to clean up litter, graffiti, and abandoned structures; and hold personnel in city departments accountable to Clevelanders for competent service.\n\n You mention disciplining government and cutting waste.  Could you please elaborate?\n\n [Kostendt had provided a link along with this answer, which is mentioned in the External links section.]\n\nMs. [Rachel] Dissell's reporting sheds light on undisciplined conduct in our city government, in this case the health department.  The Editor's Note further demonstrates lack of accountability and transparency in our city government.\n\nDepartments of the Cleveland city government struggle to respond to  [Freedom of Information Act] requests from media in a timely manner, struggle to organize efficient street clearing in winter, struggle to facilitate/approve much-needed community togetherness events proposed by motivated Neighbors, etc.  I would change this.  In terms of waste, the Mayor has 27 executive or special assistants according to the 2019 budget, one of whom is now facing rape charges.  I believe I could do more with less.\n\n In one of your essays on your web site, this one titled 'Urban Blight', you wrote \"[r]ehabilitating the lands of our city, including destruction of abandoned and neglected properties [...] starts with doing the work to get it cleaned up\".  Could you please elaborate?\n\n Cutting grass, removing debris, and deconstructing a home is work that anybody could do, given time and instruction on safe procedure.  Building a home is work that layman volunteers often do, such as with .  The city should take the lead on finding people motivated to do the work, finding a contractor willing to provide them the instruction, and executing.  Blighted structures are not only an eyesore, but costly in terms of property value and taxes, and dangerous havens for criminal activity.\n\n In one of your essays on your web site, this one titled [\"]The In-Crowd of Cleveland 'Politics'\", you wrote \"when you vote, you can vote somebody in the in-crowd, or you can vote for me.\"  Could you please elaborate on your thoughts regarding Cleveland's \"in-crowd\"?\n\nNo answer was provided.\n\n You wrote in your essay \"Climate Change\": \"climate change is of no consequence to our city, and I consider it an enormous distraction and waste of potentially productive time.\"  Could you please elaborate?\n\n The climate in Cleveland is awful -- high of 51 [] today on May 11th.  In this day and age, people are largely free to choose what climate they live and work in, and they largely choose climates that are warmer.  Cleveland's low average temperatures are a significant hindrance to our growth and prosperity.  Change would be a great thing, potentially leading to shorter and milder winters.  At the extremes, extreme heat is less deadly and less destructive than our extreme cold.  I spent June and July in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where temperatures linger above 100 [] in the midnight darkness, and human life is doing just fine there.  Cleveland is in no danger of getting that hot.  The benefits of warmer temperatures, less snow, and less ice dramatically outweigh the supposed risks to our city of extreme heat or tornadic/hurricane activity that are associated with climate change.  Larger population centers that have been preying on Cleveland's population for decades are in much greater danger from the effects of warmer temperatures and rising sea levels, so climate change would be very likely to reverse those trends and improve the fortunes of our own city (admittedly at the tragic expense of other American communities).\n\n What does Cleveland lack under Mayor Frank Johnson you hope to supplement?\n\n Energetic leadership of the municipal staff, and a culture of accountability that guides all city departments.\n\n Who did you support in the 2017 Cleveland mayoral election, if anyone?\n\n Mayor Frank Jackson, reluctantly[.]\n\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n\n Governor Mike DeWine (who it may be worth noting is my commander-in-chief) and Lt. [Lieutenant] Governor [.]\n\n Who did you support in the 2020 United States presidential election, if anyone?\n\n Mr.  and Ms. Michelle Tidball[.]\n\n Cleveland was ranked in 2019 by the US Census Bureau worst in child poverty, second-worst for working-age adults and third in older-adult poverty among the largest US cities.  How will you address this, if elected?\n\n By investing in our Neighbors, our children, and our future, we can drive a positive feedback loop of investment and productivity in our neighborhoods. Cleveland is shrinking, and so is our customer base and our tax base.  By securing the streets from crime, improving schools to make Cleveland an attractive place to raise a family, cleaning up our shared spaces, and fixing lackluster provision of city services, City Hall can reverse population decline and make Cleveland an attractive place to invest in businesses, property, workers, and a bright economic future.  Education and future-oriented investment are the \"leading indicators\" of economic self-sufficiency.\n\n Cuyahoga County, which Cleveland is in, has recorded over 110,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 2,100 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Professor Gigi Foster about pandemic control in Australia", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Wikinews interviews Professor Gigi Foster about pandemic control in Australia}}\nOn July 22, Wikinews interviewed Professor Gigi Foster of School of Economics at the , Sydney, Australia about measures that the government took to stop the spread of COVID-19, a virus that caused what the World Health Organization declared a pandemic last year.\n\nProfessor Foster is on faculty with the School of Economics at the University of New South Wales.  She wrote an Op-Ed in the Sydney Morning Herald, arguing for a case against the so-called \"lockdowns\" - measures which the state governments in Australia were implementing to stop the spread of COVID-19.  These measures included things like limiting the size of gatherings, directing certain business types such as gyms to close or operate at reduced capacity, limiting where people may travel and restricting residents to only leaving their home if they have a reasonable excuse to do so.\n\nIn New South Wales, these restrictions were implemented as Public Health Orders, signed by , the Minister for Health and Medical Research.  Mr Brad Hazzard has authority make these Orders under the  2010, section 7.\n\nWikinews reached out to Professor Gigi Foster, asking for comment.\n\nThe interview was conducted amid an outbreak of COVID-19 in New South Wales, that has resulted in an increase of restrictions from June 26.  At the day of interview, residents were legally allowed to go outdoors only for essential shopping, medical care, and exercise, in groups of no more than two people unless of a common household.  On July 28, authorities extended these restrictions until the end of August.\n\nThe current outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta strain started from 'patient zero', reportedly a driver, which includes transporting international flight crew, as  wrote on June 16.  A week later, on June 24, the driver commented that he thought that he caught the virus from a local cafe, where another patron was visibly unwell.\n\n  has said that \"our mission is to allow our citizens to live as safely and freely as possible\", having announced that only authorized workers -- people whose occupation is essential -- could leave home in selected higher risk regions in south-west of Sydney until July 30.\n\nWork of the construction industry has been stopped for several days, and resumed this week with requirement that the construction workers get tested for COVID-19 regularly.\n\n What is your involvement in the Australian society, such as politics, or university teaching or research, today?  Can you explain your role?\n\n I'm a professor with the School of Economics at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia.  At the moment I am also serving as the Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School of Economics.  I have a continuing research and teaching contract and have been with UNSW since 2009, when I came as a senior lecturer, in a lateral move from the University of South Australia.\n\nRelative to many professors, I engage a lot with the community and media on economic policy matters of the day.  I also cofounded and co-run the Consortium for Inclusive Economics Education, housed within the UNSW Business School.\n\nI could go on about details but that gives you an overarching idea I think - any specific questions?\n\n Looking at a piece that Joel Carrett wrote recently in , I have a few questions.  Firstly, 'living with the virus' as suggested seems worse than completely eliminating it and bringing the number of cases to complete zero.  Is that a correct interpretation?  Could you please elucidate further?\n\n \"living with the virus\" is inevitable, given what we now know about it.  One big reason for this inevitability is that the virus was pass to animals, like domestic companion animals, mink, and so on.  This means it is simply implausible for us to eliminate it from our world.\n\n It would seem to me that in Australia, elimination, at least among humans, is the preferred strategy, with the only new cases coming from overseas, normally.  Do you consider that is the most optimal solution and if so, why?  Are you familiar with cases of transmission to or from animals here?\n\n  The rates of death from covid-19 for young people are in the same order of magnitude as seasonal flu - contra the mainstream media's portrayal - and we now have a toolbox full of ways to fight symptoms and lethality of the virus, including ivermectin, vaccines, and so on - which if deployed optimally will significantly reduce the danger that even our more vulnerable people face from the virus.\n\nYour comment also ignores the dangers and costs associated with continuing to focus uniquely on covid, while ignoring everything else that improves, prolongs, and strengthens human life.\n\nI would also mention that as the virus has been mutating - particularly into this new Delta variant - it seems to be becoming less lethal.  This is yet another reason why the portrayal in the media, and the neglect of everything else that matters for human life and livelihoods, are inappropriate.\n\nIn relation to the fantasy world of keeping ourselves blocked off from the rest of humanity forever, first I'd say that we already have the virus here, so the elimination ship has sailed - and second, that shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world indefinitely will lead inevitably to a decline in living standards, happiness, innovation, productivity, and cross-cultural understanding with Australia, something that I would not wish on my worst enemy's country, much less on Australia, a country I love so much.\n\n What would you ideally like to see tomorrow, if you were in control?  Increased availability of vaccines?  Have you found some of the mainstream media narrative coercive or invasive to privacy?  If so, who is atfrom your perspective,  fault for that and how to best remedy that?\n\n If I were queen (which I hope I never am - monarchy is a worse form of government than democracy, because power corrupts - as we are seeing right now amongst Australian politicians!) I would (1) make the vaccine available to anyone in vulnerable groups who wants it; (2) change the message to \"We've got this virus's number; we know how to fight it; everyone, get back to life; (3) buy and disseminate ivermectin, and start randomised controlled trials of it and other potential treatments/preventative approaches to covid; and (4) open the borders and pledge to the Australian people that no domestic border closures, lockdowns, or other mandated restrictions of movements or activities will be put in place in the name of COVID-19.\n\nI would also start the process of reforming our institutions to protect the country the next time a situation like this emerges.  I have several suggestions for that, which are contained in my forthcoming book, The Great Covid Panic.\n\nIn terms of your question about coercion, yes, some of the messaging around the vaccine has been manipulative, misleading, and coercive.  Whether to get a vaccine should be a question for consideration by a patient and his or her GP - not a question to be decided by politicians, employers, or anyone else.  From my reading, vaccinating the healthy young against COVID-19 with the vaccines we presently have available is likely to be worse for them, in expectation, than not vaccinating them and risking their exposure to the disease itself.\n\n When is the book planned to be released?\n\n [The] book should be available in about two months.\n\n In your piece at Sydney Morning Herald you discuss shelter in place orders and their effect on excessive deaths.  One remark that relates to Australia: \"The only countries in which they observed a fall in the trajectory of excess deaths were Australia, New Zealand and Malta.  “All three countries are islands,” they reported.  “In every other country, we observe either no visual change in excess deaths or increases in excess deaths.”\" How would you comment?  Why is there such a correlation for an island country?\n\n In the island countries that form exceptions in that recent piece of research, covid deaths are so minimal that they don't move the needle on excess deaths one way or the other.\n\n Do travel restrictions like 'do not go further than 10kms from home' helpful or not, in your view?  And why?  What is the logic behind 10, as compared to, say 9, or 11 kms?\n\n The reason for the decline in excess deaths in the initial weeks following the imposition of a shelter-in-place order in the island countries is that people stop using their cars as much (so, fewer traffic accidents), they stop having elective surgeries (which in the short run saves lives, as some such surgeries do end in death, sadly), and because they don't go to the bars and generally out and about, and accidentally kill each other.  It has nothing to do with COVID-19.\n\nThe travel restrictions are an absolute nonsense from a human wellbeing perspective.\n\n From your view, how effective [were] the measures about limiting size of gatherings; closing some popular venues such as cinemas; social distancing and face masks requirements?\n\n More than anything, what they show you is the degree to which the way we are being governed at the moment stems from politicians' instinct to try to \"control\" and thereby achieve success - rather than looking at the data, facing reality, and trusting people to help each other and protect each other as best they can.  Since the start of this whole period in history, in March 2020, I have advocated for targeted protection of vulnerable populations - and I still do.  This means the targeted use of social distancing, sensible hygiene, etc., when vulnerable people are involved.\n\nFor the vast majority of people under 50 years old without health problems, this virus is the least of their worries.\n\nSo I do not support blanket restrictions on movement, gatherings, masking, etc.\n\n Do you have any comment on the number of people and conditions in which citizens have been required to self-isolate as per the contact tracing instructions?\n\n Contact tracing as a general principle seems to me unlikely to pass a cost-benefit test (which by the way is what the blanket lockdown policies should have had to pass, and never did, before being implemented).  It's extremely expensive, and you just don't gain that much useful information that actually ends up saving lives or reducing suffering - which are the only things that matter.  I can see a role for very careful staff rostering, testing (with reliable tests), etc in and around aged care homes, etc.  Again, not for the whole population.\n\n Does that seem counter intuitive to someone who says 'but Jane visited a bar, and knowing the four other people there and asking them to isolate and get tested would help'?  How can this narrative be disputed?  With Jane being [infectious], as per a test on a next day\n\n If Jane and the others who decided to visit the bar were informed of the risks (which, if they are young and healthy, are low), then the government has no business interfering in their choice to go to the bar.  Cases in healthy young people are arguably a good thing, as they allow the development of natural immunity - which is just as effective if not more effective than the immunity conferred by vaccines.\n\n If the current restrictions appear to be poorly thought through, how would you suggest to challenge them?  Who - public, businesses, or someone else - can help, and how?\n\n Will we ever possibly lose a young person with COVID-19?  Yes, of course, we may.  Just as we lose a few young people with influenza, pneumonia, etc, every year.  But the relative risks for young people particularly from keeping our societies locked up are just massive.  Mental health problems, economic hardship, relationship problems, disruption to schooling and training, lack of celebrations of important life milestones... It is heart-breaking.\n\nIt is also heart-breaking for the older people we have isolated away from their families, to while away their final years alone.  The vulnerable need to be offered the vaccine, to have full information and access to prophylaxis and treatment options, and then to rejoin their communities and have as much visitation from their friends and families as they wish.  They need it.  Social interaction literally saves lives.  We are a social species and we ignore our social needs at our peril.\n\nIn terms of how to challenge the current policies, I am trying everything I can from my platform as an independent academic - I am writing, speaking on TV and radio, doing podcasts, etc.  I also resist by not wearing a mask, and openly hugging people in public.  We need, individually and as businesses, to show that we will not comply with these mad, destructive policies.  If we love our country and want our way of life back, we will have to take it back by actively resisting the poor governance we are getting at the moment.\n\n Do you have anything important to add?\n\nPerhaps to say that the way eventually out of this mess, if Australians do not resist now, is that the rest of the world will get on with their lives and eventually we will get jealous enough that we will start demanding the same freedoms that we see others having elsewhere.  So it's just a matter of when the pressure will become great enough to force the politicians' hands.\n\n One more question.. I've found none political activity going on in this direction..  the closest I could find is https://www.ldp.org.au/freedomday and it is ridiculous, some people dismiss it as a daft proposal.\n\n I looked at that petition.  It looks sensible to me.  What's not to like?  I mean the idea of \"Freedom Day\" wouldn't have been my first pick as a vehicle - since that implies that we don't have freedom every day (which we should in a democracy like Australia).\n\n It is easy to misinterpret, a common reaction from a few people is \"what they should be lobbying for is to get everyone on the vaccination programme, only then is there a hope of getting rid of the lockdowns or extremely focused and limited lockdowns\".\n\n  Hm interesting, well that tells me that they have been brainwashed into accepting the narrative that we indeed need to earn our freedoms, by getting vaccinated (and maybe doing other things too).  That is not the right mental model.  We do not have to earn our freedoms.  We have them and simply need to empower ourselves to use them.  Also, the idea (again) that someone other than a patient and his or her GP should be dictating that someone gets the vaccine is quite scary really.  Do we really countenance having health decisions made for us by our governments?\n\n Alright, thanks for your time!\n\n   Ok bye :)\n\n \n\n ]", "question": "What is Professor Gigi Foster's position at the University of New South Wales? \n\nA) Minister for Health and Medical Research  \nB) Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School of Economics  \nC) Head of the Department of Public Health  \nD) Chief Economist of Australia"}

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then.

We must find creative, practical ways to decarbonise our region, to support biodiversity and the many local businesses that rely on our natural environment.\n Advocate for fair housing.

After the elected council was dismissed, it was appropriate to appoint administrators without connections to our Shire. However, in my view, the administrators should have been able to get their job done and new elections organised within a year, not the two years it has taken.

What do you think needs to be done to help business recovery?\n\n Ways our Shire can support small businesses recover are:\n Promoting our region as a tourist destination and providing a public transport system linking the  service from Melbourne with Wilson's Promontory National Park.\n Assisting business groups that are seeking funding from sources outside the Shire (e.g. State and Federal funding opportunities) with grant writing.\n Streamlining planning approvals and expanding services to support our increasing resident population.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n \n Short and long-term environmental & biodiversity effects should be considered a priority in all aspects of planning.\n Funding with the long-term in view, including working with neighbouring shires to attract Federal & State funding.\n Establishment of biolinks between existing wildlife habitats (e.g. completing the Lyrebird Link to connect  Coastal Park with the ).\n Protecting and supporting the Strzelecki koala population, the most genetically diverse koalas in Victoria. These koalas are found from the Strzelecki Ranges through the Shire to the coast.\n A moratorium on native forest logging in our Shire, with a plan to support the transition of existing workers in these industries to other jobs, such as in infrastructure, tourism or fire management.\n Protecting and restoring the seagrass beds, intertidal marshes and mangroves along our coast. These ecosystems are fish nurseries for recreational fishers, rich sources of biodiversity and effective carbon capture ecosystems.\n Rate discounts or rebates for landholders participating in specific conservation programs, such as putting areas of habitat under conservation covenants.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n I have lived in South Gippsland for three decades, moving here with a young family in the 1990s. I currently teach at Fish Creek  and have worked in most of the schools in Coastal Promontory Ward over the past 25 years. I have experience with mixed ability education and have been a carer for young people with disabilities.\n\nMy community involvement has been with an arts and environment focus. As an active member of  Coast Arts, I have been involved in organising wide-ranging community arts events such as The Prom Coast Festival, The Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival, The Great Southern Portrait Prize and the HorseArtsAnzac project. I am also an active member of Landcare and Friends of the Prom.  \n\nMy community involvement and work have all involved respect, goodwill, listening, creative thinking, collaboration and bringing together people of diverse backgrounds and views to produce a mutually worthwhile outcome. I will work with integrity and respect for a better future for all of South Gippsland.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n Public transport to connect the Prom with V-Line services.\n Completion of the Lyrebird Link between Cape Liptrap Coastal Park & the Strzelecki Ranges, to secure our lyrebirds and unique Strzelecki koalas.\n Sewerage for Fish Creek.\n 'Putting the Fish back into Fish Creek' project to clean up the Fish Creek water catchment.\n Watch for Wildlife signage on roads.\n\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n\n It has been a challenge to connect with voters during lockdown! Some of the strategies I am using are:\n Facebook: AndaBanikosIndependent\n Website: andabanikosindependent.org\n Articles in our local newspapers.\n Emails, phone calls and Zooms with existing contacts and as many representatives of community groups as possible.\n Participation in online candidate forums.\n\n Have you ever run for a political office prior to your current candidacy for council?\n\n I have never before run for political office, but am a strong supporter of the democratic process and have worked for the AEC and VEC as an electoral officer. I have no political affiliations or vested business interests in our Shire. I decided to run for Council because I care about our community and environment and can see unavoidable changes and threats posed by climate change. I can also see the opportunities offered by new technologies and creative communities to make South Gippsland more resilient and productive.\n\n \n ", "question": "What issue does Anda Banikos believe should be prioritized in planning for South Gippsland? \n\nA) Increasing tourist visits  \nB) Long-term environmental and biodiversity effects  \nC) Enhancing public transport options  \nD) Expanding housing developments"}

Filipchenko answered some questions about his policies and campaign during a phone interview.\n\nFilipchenko, registered on the  as Vitaly A. Filipchenko, is the first Russian candidate for New York City mayor, being born in Tomsk, Siberia in 1973, according to news agency .  He has since naturalised as a United States citizen.  According to the web site, Filipchenko has been educated in road construction and maintenance and owns a moving services company; he describes himself on his web site as a \"small business owner\".  On his web site's platform page, he says that \"[m]y English may not be perfect - but my platform is.\"\n\nIncumbent Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio, who won re-election in the  by 66.5%, cannot run for a third term under term limits.  As of April 28, 22 candidates are currently running, the majority of whom are also Democrats.  Ahead of the June Democratic primary for New York City mayor, a poll conducted May 23 and 24 by  and  of 12 Democratic candidates with a margin of error of 3.2 per cent has former commissioner for the   and Borough President of   leading with 21.1% and 20.1%, respectively.\n\n Please introduce yourself, your history and your background, first.\n\n Okay.  My name is Vitaly Filipchenko, I am an independent candidate for New York City mayor.\n\n What was it like growing up under  and the ?\n\n So, really interesting.  Like, basically, if you give a child a little bit more interest and a chance to be, how do I put it, in ; it's like you give a child the stock market.  Giving that kind of information: what this mean, what this is, what this for?  That time was like that.\n\n What made you decide to run for New York City mayor?\n\n I have [not seen] an honest mayor before, trying to see how [immigrants get] marginalised, because all this big money.  Doesn't matter where you have it: from Democrats, from Republicans.  They just followed that money.  And all these big politician people?  Its only interest: money, not real problem[s] from the people.  They doesn't matter, Democrats, Republicans, they just making money.  It's a money machine, for politician['s] gains.\n\n According to , you're the first Russian candidate for New York City mayor.  Do you think that will help you among the immigrant population in the city?\n\n Not really, because people [are] so afraid.  We didn't see the real democracy in New York.  Everyone can speak up for democracy, but half of them [are] not registering to vote, half of them, they [do] not believe anymore in politicians — doesn't matter who you are — and a lot of people, just like, they don't care, you know?  They can talk too much, but they['re] not doing anything.\n\n Why should New Yorkers vote for you?\n\n Because I'm a basic, basically like [the] whole history of, like, : I came from nothing, and became a self-[made] businessman, I became [a] hardworking person.  And anyone from any kind of country, anyone from any kind of community, they can see [me] reflecting themself, themselves, because they're working really hard.  I'm not standing behind any kind of big corporation, I'm not standing behind any kind of money.  I'm just a regular guy.  I want to be honest, I want to make a real democracy progress.\n\nLots of people, they just get tons of money, and they don't care.  They not, really don't care.  They don't have experience [with] what we have a problem in New York.  I represent small business owners, I represent immigrants, I represent people who will struggle in this pandemic.  Other candidates?  They do not represent anyone.  They just represent themselves.  They are one per cent [of the] rich people.  They never have problems, because rich people make more money on this problem.  Other population[s], like office employee[s], who've been working in an office in a pandemic, who['re] still working from home, and making more than 100 thousand, and it's working at home!  They just [do] not see [the] problem, what's exactly, what's going on right now.  They just keep working!\n\nI represent essential business who are really working outside, who are really working with the streets, working with the people who are exactly doing the job for the people.  Like, most of them, these employees, this is a high-level money, they['re] just still working from home, and still making [the] same amount [of] money.  We, we [are] struggling, because we got big problem[s] with our business: a lot of business[es] get shut down, a lot of business[es] get closed like restaurants, deliveries.  And a small business owners, it's like really struggling, and in New York, [the] Mayor has done nothing for this.  It's also a horrible person.\n\n You've criticised to Sputnik News that \"if we look at other states, warm Florida, Georgia, their state budgets are not even ten times but 20, 50 times smaller than New York's. And their roads are better.\"  Could you elaborate on that?\n\n Oh, it's simple.  I'm [a] civil engineer.  I got a[n] engineering degree for building roads: highway roads, and you can see how the difference [in the] state[s] of New York, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina.  In Florida, they got a budget [of] USD4 billion, and the roads are so much better.  In New York state, you got like [a] 190 billion budget in the state, and it got ten times worse, because I can see what they're doing right now.  They just manipulate the budget.\n\nThey're doing one road, and [it's] suppose[d to be] if you do a good job, you can repair this road after ten years.  But if you do repairs after like one or two years, they just  budget, they're just like, obviously they're stealing money.  If you're doing the same repair after two years, it's obviously \"oh you're stupid, you don't know what you're doing?\"  They're just a regular: sit, then try to steal the money from the budget.  It's called corruption.\n\nAnd I see all these roads, in New York, I'm not looking from just [the] perspective of like [a] simple idiot who doesn't know how to build the roads — I'm professional, I know how to build the roads — and I saw [in] 2019, on a Brooklyn expressway, there was building [of] two , it's like 500 feet, building completely new, for six months, and a  did not match by like eight inches.  They tried to connect to ramp to the main Brooklyn express; the level didn't match [by] like eight inches.  They just demolish everything, and start building again from over.\n\nIt's like, \"Excuse me.  You just spent [the] whole budget, and doing [it] again, what does this mean?\"  It's like, you engineered, your  was non-effectual, or what's wrong?  And when I was spoke with other people, it's not only one example in New York.  A lot of examples, a lot of—because I'm living in Manhattan, I can see repairing the roads like [the] first time again.  They did repair two years ago, and they just repair it again.  It's like, \"Excuse me.  Why [do] you waste a lot of money?  And the quality with doing this repair, is, like, horrible!\"\n\nWe do have , , for eight years, and she's done [a] horrible job.  Horrible.  I'm a driver.  I'm driving every day [in] like a regular car, like a truck.  And I know..., ,  — Manhattan, Bronx,  — all this road: horrible.  Nothing just like  repair; in [the] condition [of] who do[es] this job, I don't know who signs in contracts.  Was this like a construction company, they do not have experience, or they're just like not qualif[ied] for this job.\n\nAnd more important: if you['re] Department of Transportation, you have to sign [an] agreement.  If you're doing a bad job, you have to repair.  Because, how are you going to get paid for [a] bad job?  If you do a new job for interview[ing] me, and it's like probably, your boss gonna like \"oh, we're not going to pay you because it does nothing.\"  Same thing.  This person, Department of Transportation, Polly Trottenberg, they got moved up in Washington DC at a high position.  It's like, that's a horrible job in New York, are you guys in DC completely idiots to hire this person, or something is corrupt.  Same thing with the Mayor.\n\nAnd if you start pointing each one corner in New York, you will be surprised.  Like, for example, all these candidates who are running like \"I have experience, I built so many \", they didn't do anything, you just negotiated with  when you change the  from like twenty-story building to forty-story building and asking \"give me ten, twenty apartments\" and they give you ten, twenty apartments for low-income because you're not building anything!  For eight years in New York, low-income NYCHA [] didn't build nothing, it's still like negotiators with landlords.\n\nIn my position, I travel like New York City, we can build a lot of buildings, for high-quality luxury buildings, can sell it.  And all this profit go back to New York budget.  We say we can build, like NYCHA building, but actually residents can be like , they['re] allowed to decide where the budget has to go, not like, for example, New York City to decide \"well, we have to pay that whole buildings.\"  I don't think they need any kind of painting, they have to just repair like [the] plumbing system, the electric system, and the people are in NYCHA who like co-op can decide it: \"okay, we need this first and then this second.\"  And a lot of  did not do many more after [the] 50s-60s.\n\nI want to build this Mitchell-Lama loan, same thing.  We didn't have a clinic who wants New York City, because if you build new clinics, if you create a lot of construction job[s] to build, because the city was doing—they just hired a little company with a high-quality payroll and have wasted money again!  If you just hire New York City employers to create the New York City jobs, and start building, like, New York City clinics.  You can hire a professional physician, all these doctors.  It's when we create more jobs, and all these jobs are going to be get paid for New York.  It's a simple way: stop wasting money for all these big billionaires; you just put a lot of infrastructure money to these billionaires!  We can do that for citizens' sel[ves], to help oursel[ves].  That's my policy.\n\nJust like, I'm doing this from my view, because I'm living every day, one more day on the street, with these problems on the street.  I understand what's going on.  Most of New Yorkers just see something wrong, it's like \"oh, I don't know what's happened, I don't like it\".  But they never focus  what's the problem.  What's exactly the base of the problem.\n\n Your web site has said \"I do not want to  - but retrain.\"  Could you please elaborate on that?\n\n Oh, simple way!  You have information about, like, what's going on right now in New York.  A lot of, it's called '', but if you be [specific], what does [it] mean, 'hate'?  It mean[s], hate Asian; it's mean[t] for the basic information.  What they say 'hate crime', it mean[s] Asian people hate Asian people, but it's not.  Right now in New York City, most of 90 per cent [of] black people are completely destroying Asian people, and it's mean[ing] it's not 'hate crime', it's actually a racist crime.  I have to be specific, and I have to call [a] specific name [for] what's going on, and they try to cover this and for this to know it's just 'hate crime'.\n\nNot possible, 'hate crime'.  It's a completely racist crime!  Because most of them, who [are] doing this act, it was like a different ethnicity [of] people.  It's a, obviously, race crime.  And to find out with this problem, you have to put more officers to work, [it] means you have to pay overtime, and to pay more officers, for example, if you go every day and there's, say, like ten thousand officer[s], you have to put in fifteen thousand, because you have to be undercover, you have to be [taking] more shift[s], you have to be [spending] more time on the job to stop this crime.\n\nIf you want to defund police, how are you going to stop the crime?  It's like : we want to defund police, but we need more security on the streets.  That doesn't work.  And I say it's like \"no, it's not defund police, you have to retrain.\"  Because in my opinion, [a] bad person has to be in a bad place; a good person has to be in a good place.  It doesn't matter if police officer, or just regular citizen.  If you do something wrong, you deserve to be in the wrong place.  Same thing with police!  If you're not deserv[ing] to be a good officer, excuse me, we have to fire you.  I have to get trained-better police officers; it's better quality.\n\n[In] most of [the] states, for example Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, District [of] Columbia, a police officer has to pass [a] physical exam every six months.  For example, you have to run in 1.7 miles on the time.  If you look at the New York police officer?  Obviously, after three years, in  [officers], I can see half of them cannot run.  It means they [are] not physically trained for this job.  And if you can see, I'm not gonna blame.  I want to say the systems are really bad.  And if you try to stop any kind of crime, you have to be physically prepared.  And what [do] police officers do?  They start shooting.  Because they're afraid!  They're not physically prepared for any kind of physical violation.  They cannot prepare any kind of physical fight: , boxing, , because they don't have experience.\n\nIf a person [is] really sick, what's he gonna do, if they have a power?  Just going to shoot you.  Simple answers.  And I saw a lot of New York police: overweight, and not ready for any kind of physical activity.  That's a big problem.  New York State, they['re] screaming \"we Democrats, we['re] for democracy\", not actually, not guys.  You['re] just hypocrites.  They try to blame everyone except themselves.\n\n How do you plan to, in your words, \"support small businesses with rent law changes\"?\n\n Oh, I told everybody.  When it was a[n] epidemic—COVID-19 problems, I told everybody [a] simple way, because I was trying to volunteer [for] : it's a food distribution from the city from volunteers, from donors who, like, small business owners that needed the food.  Now obviously food bank[s]: not bad, not bad, but again, it's a canned food, not a lot of good food.  And, in my opinion, back in the time, [the] city can make a contract with all small business restaurants.  Together, for example, for one period [of] time, from like 8am to 10pm, [the] city will pay money for, like, breakfast or lunchtime for homeless people, who lost a job or [have] low-income.  People can get [a] normal meal, and in [the] late time, all these restaurant[s] can [be] working like regular restaurants, and you can make your profit and money.\n\nBecause you can see a lot of businesses were shut down, because they can't survive.  In my opinion, it's completely mismanagement with small businesses.  We just can sign the contract.  First of all, we can help these people who really struggle with food; they can get a good-quality food.  It's like what all deserves.\n\n How do you plan to, in your words, \"Build back a greener, fairer city\"?\n\n First of all, you should notice [the] city's like a cement jungle: a lot of , a lot of cement.  And again, if you notice, we do a lot of bus lane and bike lane, and a lot of people know it's really toxic paint.   When you do this painting, you can make it worse for [the] environment.  And most important, when you're planning bike lanes, bus lanes not correctly, you create your traffic contractions.  When you create your traffic contractions, what's happening?  A lot of  coming from the cars, a lot is  and it's going to be worse.\n\nPeople say like \"oh, we got the bikes, that's safe\".  No, because we still have stores, we still have deliveries, we still have truck[s that] have to deliver with food, have to deliver it [with] any kind of supplies, material, but where's he going to park?  That's no way to find the parking.  That's really [going to] have to , triple park, and blocking in the street, and it cause[s] congestion.  And the people still like to stop because they have to deliver, they have to support small business.  But city can't violation, one, second, well, it's a big traffic, sort of with conjunction with oxycarbonite.  This means there was planning completely not, how would [I] say in really nice way...completely stupid.\n\nBecause I see all this planning was like, they created, okay, for example, if you notice a lot of parking spots for trucks, for cars, for deliveries, it was [a] parking zone.  But, because restaurant[s were] struggling, they put in extra seats from the parking spots.  It means they took all the parking spots for cars, but the cars have to deliver the food, and they have to plan, where they have to park?  Nowhere.  It's deteriorated worse and worse, this was planning completely stupid.  If you plan in [a] correct way it deserves, like different countries Norway, like British, you can see exactly how the location [of] the parking spot.  How [it's] allocated all this green zone.\n\nIf you put in a lot of bushes, if you plant in a lot of green trees, and then you make it a better environment.  If you create it like [a] sidewalk over the road, nothing across the road like a lot of China, Korea and Japan, they created  over the road.  It's like small parks, each one  is like [a] tiny park with the trees, with benches, and it's [safe]!  People can cross over the road, and they have to cross the road, they go over the path, there's a small—tiny parks, it's a great idea [that] already exists in China, and in different countries.\n\nAnd I was planning the same thing to create in New York City but again, all these candidates [are] screaming \"I'm going to put in four billion dollars on the parks\", \"I'm going to put ten billion over that\", guys.  You just drop the name and numbers.  You never offered any kind of specific job.  Like for example, I live in New York City, Manhattan, where you have .  And now Mayor put it in the budget 1.2 billion dollars to renovating the park.  But [the] park is functional.  It exists, and I'm running every Sunday there.  It's working really good, but you want to do the repair, idiot.  There really exists this park, you have to create a different one which does not exist and will, like for example Bronx, Queens, they need more parks for people.  Why focus all big money for little Manhattan?\n\nAnd to figure out exactly where is the problem, where the problem is actually that we have the big .  Then you have to create a park in that area.  Over here, what they're doing is just try to create it, like, new park, and new park is bad, and they see like all this rail and space to high landlords, therefore the price skyrocket[s].  Because he got a better park, he got more trains.  Same with Andrew Cuomo.  He tried to create a more normal train station.  We already have enough train stations.  Like family, four years ago they built four extra stuff for , they spent four billion dollars.  For four billion dollars, you can buy  with the 20 thousand apartments for [the] same price.  20 thousand apartment[s], you can put all these people who [need] a low-income property.  To pay it all, it's a lot of apartments.\n\nAnd I see all this planning, what's going on in New York, it's just like it's a waste of money.  They['re] pretending we need to build train station, of course we do, but we've have to look with the needs first.\n\n Why have you decided to run as an independent candidate?\n\n Because the problem is that Democrats and Republicans: they just, most of them, they say they're for people.  But actually they're not for people, they're just for money.  Because if you['re] like, for example, , for example.  \"I want to help the people\".  Dude, you already got your business, you're getting millions dollars, you already spent like a hundred million dollars when you're  in the United States, now you're running for mayor.  Dude, you already got power, you got business, you can help them as anyone else.\n\nI don't have a power, I just to be like speak out from the people who really deserves the help.  Because I'm living in this problem, and as you guys are not living the problem!  Because they're just looking above us, because they have [a] different style [of] life, they own the apartments, they own the houses, they got assets of millions of dollars.  I'm just a regular guy!  I can speak up for everybody.  That's my main form because I try to help people, because I know the problem.  I'm living the shoot with these people.\n\n What has [current mayor] Bill de Blasio not done that you would like to do instead?\n\n Oh first of all, he completely screwed the city.  If you remember back with COVID-19 became; he said like \"okay, guys, I give you free bus rides\" instead [of] say[ing] like \"no, no bus rides, no any kind of train\", and if I was the mayor I can say \"you know, people, you can use the bikes, like whatever  for free, Citi pay [to use], if you guys drive in the car, you have to work\", like for example I was talking [to] a lot of nurses and doctors.  Do you know how many  they got through  because they have to work, they can't find the parking spot and again paying a lot of money.\n\nAs for me, if you drive a new car, you got a big distance from anybody else.  It's [the virus] is not spreading out.  But back in the time, de Blasio said like \"okay guys, everyone in the  [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] is essential business\".  But bacteria don't care [about] essentially; you're not essential, you just spread disease.  And instead he said like \"all these busses [are] free in New York.\"  Really, and all that mentality for people, free bus can get more riders in the bus, and he obviously just spread[s] more and more COVID-19.  That's a big problem.\n\nAnd if you want to do essential business, okay, I understand!  Some people [don't] have a car, some people—like for example, do you know many nurses live in , they have to drive their car?  A lot, a lot!  And if you try to create, you have to do, for example, like China, Korea or Russia.  What['ve] they done?  They created more jobs, they put a person who was working on a station to check your temperature, and if you see the high fevers like, if you necessarily have to go back home, you cannot spread the fever.  That's how they created the job, and that is how they stop the spread.\n\nBecause I remember back, I would always wake up six in the morning, I walk in flat six stor[ies], and I see [it] packed: whole train, whole bus, was packed.  Even right now, even two months, five months, six months, because I wake up, I'm working to go work by the train, by the bus.  And I see it's completely packed.\n\nIf you want to do a better job, you can send to people who can do like, you know, like cashiers, or like managers of like , like excuse me guys, in this wagon: 20 people, next wagon please, 20 people.  To get the distance.  Back in the time, why this was so horrible, COVID-19 struck in New York with people spreading through the empty [space] in their busses because nobody came [at] a distance.  That was bad, bad, horrible, it was [a] bad job for a mayor, and bad job for Governor Cuomo.  Both of them did a horrible job.\n\n Who did you support in the 2017 New York City mayoral election, if anyone?\n\n: 2017?  One time I think...2017...'17 I don't remember, but the  [when] de Blasio came, I was supporting him, I didn't know him better, and obviously it was my big mistake.  I was thinking \"okay, nice family, good guy\", I was then from his house.  Then later [by a] couple months, I was like \"nope!  Same, same corruption.\"\n\nBecause you know, some people, they pretend, it won't help.  But when you get more information—because most of them, you can see information [for] any kind of candidate because they got more money, so they can post themselves but from better sides.  But like for example, like immigrants like me, they get marginalised.  Because why do I have to put \"simple guy\" to be a mayor?  Because [the] one per cent in New York City, they never get to problem, because rich people want to say in New York, they feel good.  All these guys who is represent[ing] New Yorkers, they [are] the one per cent.  You got [a] high-payroll job, got tons of money.  Guys, you don't know the problem, how do you know it helps the poor person, if you never live in his shoes?\n\nThat's a big problem.  Because I came here in this country.  Tourist visa.  Overstayed, not legal.  [I] was afraid to get kicked out by  [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].  Then I , and [got] s, then I got , then I got my company.  I run [a] moving business for ten years.  Every day working hard, every day on the street I know what's going on, what kind of problem.\n\nThis was my main idea because I know the problems.  I'm not conceived from any kind of paper, or statistic, or anywhere in [a] computer.  No, I really live this problem.  Other guys?  They try to pretend to be living the problem.  But you never know the problem.  How do you [be] like a person who's struggling for food, trying to listen for .  Since right now, same thing. \n\n Who did you support in the , so, the one for governor, basically?\n\n: No, I did not support anyone. \n\n Who did you support in the 2020 presidential election, if anyone?\n\n: Secret information, private information. \n\n You lived in Russia, so, who did you support in the , if anyone, if you want to say?\n\n: I [did] not vote that time. \n\n Well yes, but did you support anyone, any one candidate?\n\n: I cannot tell all the full information, because it can be really bad for my family because they're still in Russia. \n\n New York City has been notorious for being one of the heaviest-affected cities at the start of the pandemic, and still the city has over 930 thousand total reported cases of COVID-19 [and] over [32] thousand deaths.  How will you address this, if elected?\n\n: Okay, first of all, you have to give the full information.  If you remember Dr , he said \"oh, we don't have enough  [personal protective equipment], we don't enough supplies, oh, guys, don't use your , we need  for all these nurses.\"  It's a big mistake, big mistake.  When he opens his mouth, people [are] like \"okay, we don't have to\", and it was really ridiculously spreading out.  Because if you get a high position, even open your mouth, you have to think about twice, but he did not think about.\n\nBecause I spoke [to] a lot of Russian doctors, American doctors, skilled professionals; because if you do any kind of procedure, you have to put it in mask.  You go to your patient, you write it down: information, you check this person, then you get out from the room.  You take it (mask) off, and throw [it] away because [it's] already hazard material.  You cannot go, with this mask, in a different room.\n\nAnd back in the time, they didn't give you full information: how to operate it, what they have to do; because a lot of people [don't] know to put it, gloves, how taking off this gloves.  Because when I was an auxiliary, I was training for CPI, and they explained how to use the mask, how [to] use the , how taking off this gloves.  But this high-quality position person got access for TV, never [gave] you free classes [to] explain how this work[s], how to use your mask because I will see on the street people holding the cell phone, , put it in the—second, , put it in the pocket, and still using gloves.  Guys, you cannot touch this stuff in the gloves and put it in the pocket because when you're coming back home, you pull it out [of] your wallet without gloves, and all this bacteria going to spread it out.\n\nAnother big problem: most of the foreign countries, they did sanitise the street.  They did [it] using, like,  light, they've been using special spray[s] on the street because when you walk, where usually goes the virus?  It's on the ground.  And you step in your shoe, whatever you got the mask, whatever you got any kind of gloves, you're going to bring them home in your shoes.  But other countries, they're doing better because they did  the stret.  New York City [has] done nothing because they['re] like \"oh, we want to put more money over there, over there\", but it didn't do exactly the job what it needs.\n\nEven they started disinfecting [the] MT[A] after six, seven months later, is it like, ridiculously stupid? \n\n How will you help racial and ethnic minorities, if elected?\n\n: Again, I will tell it a simple way.  All these people who [are] working really hard, deserve the better expectation for benefits, for any kind of credits, for any kind, like, loan, because right now, you can see all these big businesses get a lot of loans, regardless like , but regular people who [are] working really hard, who [love] their jobs, they don't have anything!\n\nFor my opinion, I would like to create a lot of extra classes: re-qualification, because if you created more s, for example, [in the] community, we have to grow a lot of trees and bushes and small  to get organic food, to teach the kids.  Because I grew up in Russia, everybody knows because everybody [has] a  when we grow, like, all these vegetables or just fruits, and we learned how to do this.  American kids [don't] know because they don't have a lot of programmes, and if you created everything back to community, to school, to give them gardens, to colleges, to any kind [of] big—for example, like... \n\nAnd you can't see it, you got a big square roof, and you can plant the garden over there.  Any kind of building can create a small garden with that.  You can create it, more oxygen with all this green, because it's a simple, it's a biological process.  You have to put [in] more green, and if you create it to start back to community, that will be co-operation.  You can help all these people who really struggle: any kind of minority, any who's struggling for new job, we can [create] the job. Stop giving away money in jobs for big corporations; [they] already have enough money.\n\nYou have to focus on ethnicity, on the people who lost [their] job.  Don't forget: New York City still [has] .  Try to get a job: if you're wrong, you can get a job!  If you['re] getting over 50, no way!  That's a big problem.  It doesn't matter who you are: Russian, Asian, from Africa; if you're over 50, [it's] really difficult.  And if you['re] an immigrant, no, harder, because we['ve] got [a] .  And then, they['re] looking at nothing but like \"oh, you can't speak English.\"  Yes we can, but we got accents.\"  Doesn't matter.\n\nWe saw people coming from different countries, got two or three education[s], two or three colleges.  But you know, in America, if you['re] someone [that's] got [an] accent, already it's like \"foreigner.\"  I know some people who told me on the street \"go back to your country.\"  Doesn't matter, but I'm still here because I love this country. \n\n Data collected by CBS News finds homeless New Yorkers are two to three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population, and homeless students graduate at a sixteen per cent lower rate.  88 per cent of individuals facing homelessness in New York City are black or .  How will you address the homelessness crisis, if elected?\n\n: Okay first of all, again, they try to—\"oh, we got a lot of homeless people\", yes, I know.  But, for example, you have to start from basic.  Each one person who is on the street homeless [is] because they lost their job.  It's like thirty per cent: thirty per cent are getting drugs, thirty per cent have got some kind of issue previously.  For me, that's what I said: we have to create new jobs.\n\nWe have to participate each one person who loves their job, retrain and give one more chance to get a new job.  That's why my plan to build new houses using people for the city, that's when I created [for the] city: more jobs.  Because you're going to get more salary, you're going [to] get more insurance and they get medicine.  That's when I'm planning to build medical buildings and, as they build on by city, it's like if you created more jobs, all these people from the homeless, they can get retrained.\n\nMost important for me: all these college students who [are] in New York, people try to—\"oh, I'm going to give you for free college tuition, blah blah blah\", even Biden said that, but we have zero.  For me, honestly, I'm not going [to] promise any kind [of] free college but, I got a guarantee: if you go to , you're going to guarantee to have a job in New York City because [the] city gonna create a lot of jobs, and [it's] gonna be enough for everyone.\n\nIt's like with : [he] created more jobs with more money, exactly in all the cit[ies] in all the state[s], not only for people who gives this opportunity to live [a] good life, not for big corporation[s], because big corporation[s] already got enough money, why [do] they have to sign this big corporation contract if I keep creating a lot of small jobs?  Focus on the people, not on the big money. \n\n How will you handle the  rollout?\n\n: Okay, simple way.  I grew up in Russia.  Each one person in Russia know[s] vaccine is good.  What we['re] having right now, it's a .  People like \"oh, I represent whatever, what it's called, I will beat SARS, let's do this, I represent this ethnicity, let's do that,\" this is the simple way: you have to give the classes.  Some kind of classes' information: how [does] vaccine work, it's what's better, what's worse.\n\nBecause right now, people, most of people [don't] have education and they're thinking like \"vaccine is so stupid\", but if you created some kind of classes.  And again, if you created classes, you created the job: who is going to be training on these classes, who gives this—provides this information for community.  I mean, we already solved two problems: we created more jobs to give better education for communities.\n\nBecause right now, people, they don't care: \"oh, government always gonna lie to us.\"  And if you created this information in classes, people can believe it, what's going on.  And you have to give some kind of example, not just say \"we have to be vaccinated.\"  If you show how it's work, what is the problem and how does it solve this problem.  It's when you give information, and the people will decide better because they got better information.  Right now, we don't have any kind of information.  Why [do] they have to get this information from the governments who don't care about me?  They just offered me to put it, vaccine, but didn't explain in [a] simple way for simple people. \n\n If you couldn't vote for yourself, who would you vote for?\n\n: I don't know, probably someone who is like similar like me, who is [an] immigrant, who understands the problem, who did in my shoes, because I cannot vote anyone else who['s] just like \"I'm going to support black and blah, brown community, blah blah blah.\"  It's a bullshit.  I want to know who person who will struggle is, because most of them, like, they get tons of money, you know, and they have alternative: if you're not gonna win, you['re] still in [a] comfortable life, with a comfortable payroll, with a comfortable community.  I need a person like me who can use it; it means like he's got only one chance to help [the] community.\n\nThat's more important for me.  If you're looking back like  President, he was starting from an axe-man, the chuck in the woods, then he became like postmaster, delivering the mail for [the] community, and he would talk to each one person when delivering the mail.\n\nYou have, you know, like most of these candidates, they just doing; promote themselves.  They're not really believe in our needs for people who [are] really struggling.  Because I represent like immigrants, I'm represent[ing] small business owners, I'm represent[ing] like part of police, I'm represent[ing] part of MTA because I've been in one's infrastructure, and it's always a problem.  Because I have overview in which one solution.  And other candidate[s], to be honest, they['re] dropping the cool name or any kind of programme: \"you can see with my web site one hop and step for each one day what I'm gonna do.\"  Excuse me, I want to hear you right now, simple explanation.\n\nBecause people want to know how.  And when.  Because I want to see the numbers.  Because I want to know exactly how it's work, because I'm a simple guy, I'm not going to be playing like someone cannot calculate it, because I'm [an] engineer, I know how to calculate, how [to] measure it, how created this stuff.  That's what was studied in college. \n\n What are some reasons people might not vote for you?\n\n: Some reasons?  I don't know, probably my accent.  We still have a lot of racists in New York state, we still have a lot of arrogance.  Every time I go to collect the signature[s], a lot of Democrats, they said like \"oh, [al]ready [chose] one.\"  That's like excuse me, I must get to sign my petition.  It's a petition, you just give me chance[s].\n\nIn the basic democracy, everybody get[s] the same chance to speak up, explain what they're doing, have opportunities to be on the ballot.  And these arrogant Democrats, it's like \"already [chose] one, I don't want to vote for you.\"  You're not voting for new—simple explanation.  You don't know the rules.  You're ready not to represent democracy, democracy exactly are opposite.  You have to give the chance for everybody, you have to help everyone, that's how it works because democracy, when you get a process discussion, when you get across in a debate, it's coming [up with] a real, true solution.  That's how democracies work.\n\nThat's always really surprising New York.  A lot of people?  \"I don't know, I love this guy, I love this guy.\"  Excuse me!  If you want to get real democracy, you have to give chance[s] for everybody, when they coming time to debate, discuss, you can figure out who is better.  Because if someone got money, okay, what is about money?  Everybody who's [a] successful businessman I'm going to ask a simple question: \"are your employee[s] union[ised] or not?\"  That's it!  Because big corporations never want to have the union guys, because union guys can be protected by government.  That's my answer.\n\nObviously, all this who's running, they don't care, they just care [about] themself.  And if you see how [many] contributions they have I suggest it's lying, you know what contributions: you have to match one to eight?  And all these candidates got like one million, got contribution from city five million, another one got like half million, got contribution three million.  Guys, you still have money, who need[s] it?\n\nBecause all this money for taxpayers who really suffer right now, who need a day, who loves the job, who cannot pay rent, you guys promised to help it and then taking this money from mentioned five, ten contributions and spend it for advertising millions?  I think it's hypocrisy.  Who try to promise our poor people, and spend money for advertising.  Is it hypocrisy? \n\n Which person from history do you identi-\n\n: Lincoln.  It's the best, my, president. \n\n Anything else you would like to say, then?\n\n: You're going to put in information, I'm going to say simple way: I'm a, like, regular guy, from New Yorkers.  I just wanna ask if someone wanna help me with volunteers, collect the signatures for petition, please be really welcome, because you can find my web site vitalyformayor.com; f-o-r mayor.com.  Because if you believe it, we can win.  Because simple people like me with our more important power, our votes, we can change a lot of things.\n\nBecause other people, other candidates, they just buy people who collect the signature.  I'm not buying, because I don't have any money, I'm not behind any kind of big corporation, I just do it by myself.  If someone's interested and believe me, they can contact me on my web site, through my e-mail, office @ vitalyformayor.com, and please, if you can help, we can win.

It shares the \"liberal\"  with Australia's governing Liberal Party, who called the New Liberals a \"cynical attempt to piggyback\" on their own name, even presenting a survey from Crosby Textor of over 2000 voters that claimed over two-thirds of voters could percieve a connection between the parties, in an attempt to prevent the party's registration.  Ultimately, the  decided that, on balance, the name of the New Liberals was \"sufficiently visually and aurally distinct\" from the Liberal Party's name, and registered the party.\n\nWikinews spoke with the New Liberals' party leader Victor Kline via email about the plans of the New Liberals and their policies and values.\n\n One of your party's key slogans, as seen on your website, is that you're economically responsible and socially progressive.  Could you explain to me more of what this means?\n Economically responsible means that we look to what economics can achieve for society unlike many who see economics as some sort of God which must be served.  So our economics will be used to get the three million people who live below the poverty line above that line and in the process of getting them into employment, stimulate small and large business alike.  Socially progressive is really the other side of the same coin, in that we want to achieve a just, balanced society where everyone has equality of opportunity and a strong purpose.  And you can see that that social progressiveness is underwritten by our economic responsibility[.]\n\n Why is it that your party decided to call yourselves the New Liberals, given there's already a Liberal Party?\n\n The current Liberal Party of Australia has abandoned all  and is actually an ultra- party.  Indeed we are suing them through the  for misrepresentation and fraud by continuing to use the word 'liberal' in their name, and if we are successful, they will be deregistered as a political party.  We are a real liberal party as that is understood around the world and has been for two hundred years, to mean a party which believes in equality of opportunity, compassion and justice, plus freedom of the individual but with a strong place for government to ensure that in exercising that freedom, the individual doesn't impinge on the freedom of others.\n\n Lately, the issue of a  family in immigration detention has been a topic of debate.  The  has been held in immigration detention for 2018 after their request for protection was rejected, after 5 years of living in the Queensland town of .  They've now been reunited in Perth, where four year old Tharnicaa is being treated after a serious blood infection.  What are your thoughts on this case, and on immigration law more broadly?\n\n We believe that the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers over the last 30 years has been nothing short of a national shame, which will be looked back on with the same sort of horror people have when they look back on slavery.  We intend to totally reform the system including, first and foremost, the abolition of mandatory detention of asylum seekers.\n\n Why did you decide to join the New Liberals?\n\n I was actually one of the four founders of the New Liberals.  The party was founded because we felt that the major parties had both moved so far to the right that there was no-one to represent the majority of the people, and that our civil liberties were under such threat that our democracy was at risk of imploding into an authoritarian regime.\n\n According to your website, your party has so far chosen 17 candidates for the next federal election.  How did you come to select them?\n\n We actually have quite a few more candidates but who are yet to go on the website.  We were looking for people who were smart,  and with a strong moral compass, and who have real world experience unlike 80% of the current political class who have not worked outside of politics or the unions.\n\n What do you think about how the federal government has handled the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n If it had been up to the federal government, we would have run an open borders, open business policy akin to what was done in the USA with consequent massive loss of life.  We were saved from this by the fortitude of the State governments.\n\n Could you give me a political issue that you think isn't getting enough attention?  What would the New Liberals do about this issue?\n\n There is massive corruption at the federal level, and the media does not focus nearly enough on that.  We will create an ICAC [Independent Commission Against Corruption] with teeth, meaning a body which will have the power to investigate and charge, politicians, judges and bureaucrats who have been corrupt, in dereliction of their duty or who have abused their power.  And there will be a separate court which will have the power to try and convict such people and sentence them to terms of imprisonment[.]\n\n What's a key way in which the New Liberals differentiate themselves from other parties?\n\n We are unlike every other party in almost every way, but the key would be our economic policy which enables us to invest in the nation via putting people back to work.  This will be done through our  Scheme which would enable anyone who wants a job to have one, and at a good  – a job which suits their skills and interests, and if there is no such job available they will be trained for appropriate work and paid a full wage whilst training.\n\n One of the 10 values in your charter of core values is \"to promote Australia's environmental health by acknowledging that care for the environment and good business practice are complementary, not mutually exclusive\".  Could you elaborate on what this would involve?\n\n So for example a government can invest in renewable energies, which is both good business practice and helpful for the environment.\n\n How would you describe your style of leadership?\n\n I have one main desire, to tell the truth at all times no matter what the consequences, and to answer the questions I am asked.  I believe that inspires or should inspire confidence in a leader.  I also want to always have the courage to call out the wrongs in the world, and to not be afraid to name those who are responsible and say why.  The flip side of that is that I hope always to have the courage to admit when I have been mistaken.", "question": "What was the primary reason for the formation of the New Liberals party, according to Victor Kline? \n\nA) To support the governing Liberal Party   \nB) To represent the majority of people and protect civil liberties  \nC) To align with right-wing policies  \nD) To endorse open borders immigration"}

Liu spoke with  (TUD) senior lecturer at the School of Surveying & Construction Management, Dr Lorcan Sirr on Friday regarding the supply of housing in the Republic of Ireland and relevant parallels across the rest of Europe, as well as recent developments by the government and private sector that are causing a rise in rents and home prices in the Irish  market.\n\nDr Sirr is a regular contributor to  and has provided commentary to Irish radio station , national broadcaster  (RTÉ) and various other publications.

He received his  in estate management at the , United Kingdom, and  in urban design and  in town planning at the .  He has a second master's in literature from KU Leuven, Belgium, and speaks .\n\n By most measures, Ireland is a far wealthier country than it was decades ago, yet the cost of rent and owning one's own home has been steadily on the rise.  A Q1 Daft.ie price report found the average monthly rent in Ireland is up to EUR1443.  Broadly speaking, to what do you attribute this to?\n\n One of the main reasons for rents rising significantly over the last decade has been the increased use of the rental sector for .  So, social housing is typically housing that's provided by the state for people that can't afford their own housing.  And traditionally what has happened is that the state builds houses for people who need housing.  And increasingly, they've not been doing that, but instead they've been placing families who need housing into the rental sector.\n\nSo, what they're doing there is, they're putting a lot more demand into the rental sector, constraining supply, and then rents are going up.  So, if we got rid of the government's practice of using the private rental sector for state housing or for social housing, you would find that there's a lot more supply available, and that is a huge driver of rents.\n\nThe other driver of rents, of course, has been that, about four years ago, the government introduced a new system whereby rents could be increased annually up to a maximum of 4%, but of course when you introduce a maximum, the maximum quickly becomes the target.  So, every landlord just increase[s] their rent by 4% every year.  So over a number of years 4% on 4% on 4% on 4% adds up to significant rental increases.\n\n Now, you're saying, 'the 4% the 4% the 4%', I know the [government] opposition,  and , even before the [COVID-19] pandemic, they've been advocating for a temporary, I believe, ban on rent increases, or just a rent-freeze overall.  Do you think that would help the situation?\n\n It depends on what you mean by 'the situation'.  It would help tenants, without a doubt, it would help tenants , because suddenly they'd have a rent-freeze and their rents would be stuck where they are.\n\nWhether it would benefit the sector overall is a different thing—whether it's constitutional is a third thing—but, so, it would benefit tenants.  Would it benefit the system overall?  If landlords aren't able to make a return on their rents, there is an increased chance that the landlords will leave the sector.  Now, the house is still there, but the house will go for home ownership or for something else.  So, you know, at a more [economic]-level, maybe that wouldn't be the best thing to happen.\n\nAnd the third issue is that constitutionally there has been a court case in 1982, Blake [v.] the , which said that rent-freezes, per se, are unconstitutional.  So, you're beginning to trickle in legal ground by doing something like that.  Having said that, what they've brought in—it happened today, actually; [it] comes into effect today—is rents are now linked to the ; basically .  And that happens, today.\n\n Daft.ie relates the COVID-19 pandemic to the situational cession of construction activity and the second-hand market.  Do you expect these variables to change in the coming weeks and months?\n\n Funnily enough, last year, you know, we had built 21 thousand houses in 2019, and we kind of thought that last year, because of COVID[-19], we might get 12 or 13 thousand houses: these are really small numbers, like.  But we got 20 thousand houses, I think 20 thousand houses in the last year, which was really surprising, it was nearly the same as the year before.  So, COVID[-19] didn't really stop that much housebuilding activity.  It didn't really have the change, the impact that we thought it was going to have.\n\nYeah, the construction industry are quite [fortunate] that construction sites [are] open-air, should be allowed to be open and remain open, and they kind of won their case a lot of the time.  But, the other thing is like, do we expect these variables to change in the next months?  I don't think we'll ever see.  You have a lot of people out there who say we need 33 thousand houses a year, 48 thousand houses a year, whatever, all that numbers.\n\nThe market isn't going to supply more houses than it can sell, and over the last four or five years it has been selling the same number of houses every year: about seven or eight thousand houses.  Out of the 20 thousand houses, only about seven or eight thousand come on the market for sale for ordinary people.  And that's about right, that's about the level where prices are stabilising, at seven or eight [thousand].  If they build any more houses, sales prices will fall because they've increased the supply.  And so, I think builders are quite clever and that, no matter what happens with COVID[-19], right, I still think we're only going to churn out 20, 22, 24 thousand houses every year.  Because if they churn out any more than that, they're going to oversupply the market — and negatively impact the sales price.  So they're very clever about maintaining, drip-feeding the market like that.\n\n Speaking of the prices, residential property prices rose by 4.5% the year to April, in a range from 0.5% in apartments in Dublin to 8.5% in houses on the border with the North [of Ireland; Northern Ireland], according to the .  Do you expect this to change as post-pandemic consumer price inflation—European harmonised inflation—eases more broadly?\n\n Well, you've got to remember the places like ,  and  that you're referring to now with the 8.5%, they are starting from a really low base.  So 8.5% is coming from something very low, so it's 8.5% of something low anyway, so [in] those areas, 8.5% doesn't scare me at all.  It's more in the large cities, or, we don't really have large cities, but in the cities, our price rise is moderating.\n\nAnd the interesting thing that's driving the sales prices outside Dublin is COVID[-19], and the idea that a lot of people have decided that, \"instead of living in a city, and now that we can , I'm going to move back to [the] Border, Midlands, wherever I'm from originally where I can buy or get free land and buy a big house that I could never buy or build in Dublin, blah blah blah, and do that\".  And that's driving prices, with the people moving to other areas.\n\nHow long that will last is the other question.  I don't know: I think a lot of employers will want a return at some stage, but I think we haven't fully thought out this idea [of] working from home, I think we're only [in the] very early stages of it.  So I'm not sure of those price rises will sustain themselves over the next few years.  I think there could be a moment of excitement at the moment, where people are going: \"oh great, I can get out of the city, I can buy a cheaper house back in the countryside, and I'll do that\", but, you know, pretty soon I think people will realise they want to be back in the city, or the excitement will wear off of that, and only a certain number of people do that, and the rest of the people stay in the cities.\n\n What are your thoughts on the government's Rebuild[ing] Ireland initiative?\n\n Rebuilding Ireland was the government policy from 2016 until this year, actually, last month.  So it's finished now, it failed.  It had five main pillars, like reusing stock, ending homelessness, all that stuff.  It failed on all the pillars.  It didn't hit any of its targets, and one of the problems with it was that it was very simplistic in many ways, and very much driven by quantity over quality.  So, it was all about numerical targets, and it didn't matter if the houses that were built under these numerical targets were connected with public transport, they had local infrastructure, they had services et cetera, et cetera.  That didn't matter, that was secondary; the most important part was to get numbers of houses up, you know, get those numbers, hit those targets.\n\nSo, very simplistic.  We're [a] first-world country, we're quite a wealthy country.  We should be doing better planning than, you know, the target is 25 thousand houses a year, let's hit 25 thousand, and it doesn't matter if they're not serviced by public transport, it doesn't matter if they're not sustainable development, it doesn't matter if they're in areas where they're not needed.  You know, it was very much targets-driven, which is why it failed.\n\nSo, it failed on all their targets.  So, you know, you need it better.  We have a national planning policy that's telling us to do one thing in a kind of more correct, best-practice way, and then you have a Rebuilding Ireland housing strategy that's telling us to throw up houses everywhere as quickly as we can, and the two things do not compute, they're not compatible, you know.  So we ended up with this mess, you know, as always.\n\n So you're saying that the numerical strategy is not the best approach.  I don't know if you've had the chance to read this, but [on] 14 July the government published its Summer Economic Statement and it's included a promise for a Housing for All strategy that's \"designed to boost housing outputs\".  So, what do you think is most crucial in pursuing that aim, if not strictly numerical?\n\n There's no point in building houses if it means that people are living far away from employment, for example, because you're building houses, but yet you're creating other pressures on traffic and congestion and forced car ownership and a whole lot of other issues.  So, you know, it's not about the numbers, and in any event, one of the problems with these strategies is that it's one thing to have a numerical target if I have control over the numbers that are going to be delivered, because I am the state.\n\nThe problem with the Irish state is that it relies nearly entirely on the private market to deliver its housing output targets.  You can't control the free market, you know, the market will do what it wants to do, so even though we might need 30, 40, 50 thousand houses a year, if the market decides that 20 thousand houses is the optimal level, that's all they're gonna build.  And the state can't force them to build 40 thousand, so one of the problems with Rebuilding Ireland and having a targets-driven system is that targets are fine if you are in control of the delivery of the targets, but targets are pointless if you're relying on someone else to deliver those targets for you.  And that was where we went wrong with that.\n\nSo I think, with the new Housing for All strategy, I haven't seen it, and I know there's arguments in the government about how much money should be allocated towards it, but I mean really, if it's going to achieve what it wants to achieve, the state needs to take far more control over the delivery of housing.  Because if you don't have control over it, you lose control over quality, you lose control over costs, you lose control over timing, and by relying on the market, these are all lessons that we know from 20 years ago, but we're a bit dumb in that we don't, kind of, learn the lessons that we should be learning.\n\nSo we're back again relying on the market, and then, you know, you just lose control over everything.\n\n What would you recommend the government do then, for its Housing for All strategy?  It hasn't been published yet, but what would you personally think would be best, just in trying to solve [through] the strategy? \n\n Yeah, I think we already have a lot of lands and we already have a lot of vacant housing in Ireland.  We have an incredibly high rate of vacant housing, and the government seems to be reluctant to tackle either land that we have — a lot of land owned by the state itself, not even private land — and the reuse of existing housing.  Like, we don't even tax people who leave properties empty, for example.  I could leave my house in Dublin for ten years and nobody would tax me, nobody would say anything to me.  And that's crazy, you know, when you have a housing shortage, like how could you let people leave their houses empty in a housing shortage?  But we do!  We can, in Ireland.  There's no way to, kind of, penalise people for doing that.\n\nAnd we don't charge  really, we don't charge a meaningful property tax.  So we're very reluctant to interfere with people's ownership of property and people's usage of property.  So, we have land, and we have a lot of empty housing.  I think really what has been happening over the last ten years is an increased centralisation over the control of the delivery of housing, so in other words, taking away power from local government—we have very weak local government anyway, like councils and town councils—and bringing it back to a centralised government department.\n\nReally, what needs to happen is responsibility for the delivery of housing needs to go back to a local level, and put responsibility on councillors and mayors and people like that to deliver housing, not having it done from a central office up in Dublin.\n\n What are your thoughts on the Affordable Housing Bill [2021], which was defended by the  Minister [for] Housing[, Local Government and Heritage]  as \"empowering local authorities to deliver affordable homes [for] purchase on their own lands\"?\n\n Yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's doing the opposite of what I was talking about, like.  So I'm, you know, saying \"give more power back to councils\", and at the same time the Minister is taking power away from councils on the disposal of land.  He's, you know, forcing councils to give up good land they have zoned for housing to a centralised body, and really it's the opposite that needs to happen.\n\nA lot of the affordable housing stuff still brings in the private sector.  And when you're bringing in the private sector you're bringing in profit, and the more you bring in, the less affordable the housing becomes, because the private sector has to make a profit, that's understandable.  Well, unless you're kind of willing to do it yourself, then you need to use the private sector and the affordability comes out the window.  So really, what the government's been urged to do by opposition and even by its own internal members is to borrow, at a time like now when money is quite cheap to borrow, to borrow more money and build housing ourselves, and forget the private sector.  Let the private sector look after the private sector, and let the state look after the state.\n\nBut we've mixed up the two for so many years now that we're finding it hard to disentangle ourselves from our reliance on the state.\n\n The Residential Tenancies Act [2021] which, as you said, comes into effect today, it ensures that the rent pressure zones can increase with the consumer prices.  It has been challenged by the opposition obviously, just because they think that it's unfair on tenants, and that sort of thing.  What are your thoughts?\n\n Well actually, a lot of the opposition people were in favour, I know Sinn Féin were very much in favour of an inflation rate-related rent change system.  I mean, I think it's better than the current system: when you set an upper limit, a ceiling, of what rents can go, so in our case it was 4%, that just becomes a target for landlords.  So landlords go, \"well, the most I can increase it by is 4%, so I'm just going to increase it to 4%\", and everybody does, and then rents go up, and suddenly that's the market rent, so the next year you can increase your rent by another 4%, and the rents all go up and up by 4%.\n\nLook, when you have an inflation one, at least it's more broadly related to your expenditure on everything, and it should take some of the sting.  Now, having said that, inflation has been rising over the last few years, so what I would have liked to have seen would have been inflation, related as it is as of today, inflation-related rent increases, but with a cap of, say, two-and-a-half or three per cent on it.  I would have liked to see that, because if inflation does take off, and say we get 6% inflation, then we're in a worse position than we were before when it was only 4%.\n\nBut in principle, I think I would be supportive of inflation[-related] rent increases.  And I think most of the opposition would be too.\n\n You wrote in  on 24 July, 2016 on the obsolete housing rate \"[h]ousing policy deserves a better evidential basis.\"  Could you speak more to this?\n\n What I meant with that was, for a start, we didn't know how many houses we were counting every year.  We're very bad at data, so we didn't know how many houses we were building every year, we couldn't count them.  We didn't really know how many empty houses we had, and we didn't know [of] how many obsolete houses.  So, obsolete.  So, we have houses that we live in, we have empty houses like vacant houses, so, I'm away on holidays and my house in Dublin at the moment is empty, that's a vacant house, and then we have obsolete houses.\n\nSo, obsolete houses are houses that are, effectively, uninhabitable.  Houses that we have let fall into a huge state of disrepair, so that nobody can live in them: so there's no water, no electricity.  It's just, you know, windows, no rooms, whatever.  And we have a huge problem with that.  Our rate of obsolescence is about four times the international norm, so we're letting an awful lot of buildings that could be potentially reused go un-reusable, if you know what I mean.\n\nWe're letting them fall down.  [The computer is moved to the outside of his building.]  You see this building here?  That is part of an old farm, and that was a building that was almost obsolete, and the people spent some, borrowed some money and refurbished it, and now they rent it out on  or whatever.  [The computer is brought back inside.]  And that's the way to do it, like.  It's a perfectly good building, it's a beautiful building.  It's huge and it's really nice and it's really well-done, and, like, we have thousands of houses every year that we let fall into a state that they can't be reused.  And we didn't know how many we were doing it [to].\n\nSo, in other words, we have a potential stock of housing that we're just letting rot and letting fall away, and that's what I was talking about in The Sunday Times, that we need to capture that data about how many houses that we're letting fall obsolete, and get a strategy to reuse them, and to, kind of, bring them back to life.  Because not everybody wants a new building, and you can't rely on builders to build every new building, you know, all the new buildings we need.  So, we also need to sort of capitalise on our existing housing stock.\n\n And who do you think should be held responsible for fixing these dilapidated buildings?  Do you think it should be the private sector and the private people or the local government or the national government?\n\n I think it's not really a kind of a punishment exercise, if you know what I mean.  I think this is probably a situation where a lot of people will have, say, you know, an example, this area I'm in, there's a farm next door and they own this building.  Maybe they didn't have the money, maybe some farmers, maybe some people who own obsolete or derelict buildings don't have the money to do it.  So I think there should be probably a process whereby we can give them a grant, and help them bring the buildings back to use, and then, you know, over 40 years they can repay the loan or repay the grant or whatever.\n\nBut I think it can't be just a punishment, we can't just tax people for letting buildings fall out, I think we need to help them bring them back in use again, as well.  So, .\n\n You wrote again in The Sunday Times that September, and in fact, we've actually been talking a bit right now about, you know, Dublin and the cities, the government under the Taoiseach Enda Kenny has been focusing too much \"on crowd-pleasing, anti-urban policies that can never work\" with regards to its growth centres and .  What are some policy ideas you think could work in, you know, de-incentivising that sort of thing?\n\n Yeah, so traditionally Ireland has been a fairly rural country, you know, and  have dominated politics in Ireland for a long, long time.  We didn't have cities like they did in the UK, so we didn't have an .  Like, in the UK they were building big cities in the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s like Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and, you know, London grew and all those kinds of places.  We didn't have any of that!  Now, Belfast did, which is like 150 miles up the road, because that was part of the United Kingdom and Belfast grew a , industrial city, but Dublin never did.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution bypassed us because we've had  and prime ministers who had no interest in cities.  We don't have an , you know.  We don't know how it is to manage a city, we don't even know what a big city really looks like, you know.  You come to Ireland and it's like, what we call cities, like, they're just towns, you know what I mean.  Like, the whole population of Ireland is just a suburb of somewhere in Singapore, you know what I mean.  The scale here is tiny, and we've never had an interest in, kind of, you know, in developing our cities and developing how they should work.  So, it's always been, kind of, the rural politicians have quite often got their way.\n\nAnd not only that, the people we've had managing places like Dublin have often been rural people, people from a rural background.  So they're not even city livers or city dwellers: they weren't born in the city, they don't know how it is to live in the city.\n\nSo, you know, we've neglected our cities over the years.  And it's getting better, but we have neglected our cities over the years.  One of the things I think we could do is have  lord mayors, with powers over the police and over urban developments and things like that.  We don't do that, we don't do local government at all, and I think the most successful things, looking at European and international cities, is when they have strong local government, they have a directly-elected lord mayor, and if I don't like what the lord mayor has done in my city, I'm going to vote them out.  Whereas we don't have that here.  We have lord mayors, but they're nominal, they're kind of titular honorary kind-of positions; they have no power.  So, everything is determined by the , and quite often they are wrong.\n\n Going back to the whole housing supply [question], you know, do you think the government should focus on, you know, incentivising people to move out of Dublin, or starting new jobs outside of cities, or?\n\n Yeah, I mean, for those who want it, absolutely.  I think we should, you know, if it takes pressure off big cities, absolutely help them, kind of, move.  But there's a caveat, and the caveat is: you don't let people move outside Dublin to live like where I am at the moment, which is a one-off house in the middle of the countryside, right.  And if I want to get a pint of milk or a newspaper, I have to get in my car outside, I have to drive five or ten kilometres to the shop, right, and then back here, okay?  That's crazy, it's not sustainable, you know, it's not economic, it's not clever.  So you can't let them do that, but I think if you let them move out of Dublin and into towns and villages, absolutely, why not?\n\nRepopulate the towns and villages, rather than let people live all over the place.\n\n The  voted recently for an amendment to a bill that would impose a 10%  rate on '' or 'cuckoo funds' with an exception if they were purchased for the purpose of social housing.  Do you think this will have a noticeable impact on the number of units available?\n\n That's a really interesting question, because I think the stamp duty rate, like exempting the funds from the stamp duty rate, is just nonsense, absolutely nonsense.  These funds make so much money that paying the stamp duty will have no effect because when they're renting to the state, the state is the equivalent of having, you know, a  tenant in your property, okay.  The state isn't going to  on the rent, the state will look after the property et cetera et cetera.\n\nSo they're making so much money off the state, there was no need to cut the stamp duty.  Previously, nobody wanted the state as a tenant because they were like \"poor people in houses, we don't want them.\"  Now, the s have realised \"actually, having the state, having the local authorities and councils as a tenant to take 300 of my properties, that's a brilliant thing!  Because they'll always be full, they're going to guarantee me 95% of market rent, and they're going to look after the properties and they will never default on the rent.  The state will not default on the rent, so therefore, it's brilliant!\"\n\nSo as long as the state keeps doing the crazy stuff of renting properties rather than building properties, these funds will always come.  So [it] probably will increase supply, yeah, but it's a bonkers policy because it's like living on your s, you know: you're constantly paying rent, and at the end of 25 years, you don't own the building.  So, it's kind of a crazy practice for the state to get into, but that's what they're into.\n\n What do you feel about such a large pre[valence] of international, or just large investment companies' presence in the Irish housing market, overall?\n\n Yeah, I'm a bit worried about it because it's a smaller market, they have a disproportionate effect.  In a large country like Germany or, I don't know where you're from.  Where are you from?\n\n From [the United States of] America.\n\n In [the United States of] America, a huge market, right?  Those funds are, like, so prevalent in the US and in Canada and places like that.  I'm quite concerned about them because they tend to have so much money that they can crowd out the small landlords.  In Ireland, the majority of our landlords are small landlords: ordinary people who happen to have a property that they rent out to somebody else.  Like 90% of our landlords are small, they're not these large funds.  I would be worried that these funds will come in, they'd crowd out the small landlords and they won't be competitive.\n\nThey won't introduce competition into the market because they're top-end, and they're only interested in the expensive product, and they won't bring down prices because they're not bringing in competition.  I would rather they were, like in other countries in Spain and places, they're not allowed to be involved in the residential market.  I think that's the correct approach, really.\n \n\n What are the features of a 'stable' housing market and 'optimal' buying conditions, in your opinion?\n\n To be honest with you, I don't think there's such a thing as a stable housing market really.  You know, I've never known a market that's 'stable', not in housing.  There's so many various things; housing's not like s and s, you know stocks and shares, they're pieces of paper.  Housing is always changing.\n\nThe demand for housing is always fluctuating, the type of housing is always changing, our needs are always changing.  Other issues impact housing: , , , , that all impacts on housing.  So it's different to stocks and shares, which nothing affects really except the market demand.\n\nSo I've never known a stable housing market, to be honest with you, but one of the things that causes the greatest amount of instability is the idea [in] Ireland and other countries like us, like the UK and Australia; we have a system called , and that really means that the government will help you buy your house, and then you're looking after yourself.  So, my house is my .  In Ireland, each man, woman and child is worth something like USD180 thousand each, something like that, alright?  More than half of that is in housing, in real estate property.  So we rely on our property for our wealth.  So when your parents die or when your parents want to send you to university, they can  and send you to university, to get a loan based on the .\n\nSo we're relying on our houses for our wealth.  In other countries, they rely on their housing for shelter.  Yeah?  I'm not talking about poor countries, I'm talking about a place like Belgium and things like that where the housing is not an asset, the housing is shelter, and like in time you sell the house, you don't make much money on it.  Here, we're constantly relying on making money from our housing, so in our heads we always want to see prices rise.  And that of course negatively affects everybody else, particularly young people who need to buy a house, so our approach to housing is one of, we know it's the wrong thing that we should be wanting our value [of] our property to rise, but yet, like, we all secretly want it because it means we're wealthier.\n\nAnd of course, you're doing nothing.  Like, the price rises in housing are not anything I've done to my house, it's just because demand in my area has gone up, you know?  So, it's kind of , and it's bad to rely on it because we're always looking for things that would keep prices high and not lower them.\n\n Do you think there's any country Ireland can look to as a role model?\n\n Every country except Ireland, I think, and maybe not the US.  I think, like, no country has it perfect to be honest with you, and every country that I've looked at in, housing has good sides and it has flaws.  I think there's probably more cities than countries that have done so; Vienna does it very well.  The city of Vienna is really well involved in the delivery of seven thousand apartments every year for citizens of Vienna, and they get them at a subsidised rent and it's, you know, it's much more affordable.\n\nPlaces like Copenhagen have also done quite well on s, where people get together to build their houses.  I think the  like Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand, we have a very similar system of asset-based welfare and that's totally unhealthy and that's why we have these booms and crashes and booms and crashes.  And unless we start taking the profit element or the asset element out of housing, we're always going to be like that.  \n\nSo when you look at countries that don't have that kind of  of housing, like the Danes and some of the Austrian cities, some German cities, some from the Swiss, you find a much more, this back to your previous question, a much more stable environment where the risks are in other parts of the economy, but not in housing.  Whereas with us, one of the major systemic risks to our economy is housing, and it shouldn't be.  Housing should be a given, housing should be just something that's there all the time like roads and electricity.  But in Ireland it's not, it's up and down and up and down and it's a major threat to the economy.\n\n Do you have any other comments on the state of the Irish housing market?\n\n Well, we often talk about the Irish housing market as being dysfunctional, right?  But I don't think there's any such thing as a 'functional' housing market.  There's just so many variables, there's so many human, you know, interactions with it.  The big variable now, of course, is the international money coming in that we can't control—well, we could control, but we're not controlling it.  So now not alone do we have  and wages and employment and planning and all those things affecting housing, now we can have  money coming in and effectively telling us what to do, and deciding rents, and so that's another, you know, it's part of , it's part of financialisation.\n\nSo, we're kind of constantly leading ourselves down a path which is really hard to get out of.  And really what it's creating is kind of , because if you're a homeowner, you are increasingly getting more and more advantages over people who don't own homes, and of course homeownership perpetuates homeownership because, you know, when I die or when I'm older I'll be able to get a deposit together and help children buy their house, and they'll be able to help their children buy their houses.  Whereas if you're never a homeowner, you can't do that.  So [it] perpetuates social [in]equality.\n\nSo, we need to look at housing in a much broader way than just economics and money, we need to look at housing much more  in terms of society, planning,  and so on.", "question": "What was one of the main drivers of rising rents in the Irish housing market according to Dr. Lorcan Sirr?  \n\nA) Increased housing quality  \nB) Government's use of the rental sector for social housing  \nC) Decreased construction activities  \nD) Higher wages for construction workers"}

Alan Winters speaks to Wikinews on trade, COVID-19, Brexit}}\n\nEarlier this month, Wikinews spoke with  professor of economics  regarding the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU) in the  and the subsequent negotiations leading up to and following the  of December, which he has researched extensively.  In a call, a Wikinews correspondent spoke with Professor Winters about recent developments in UK trade policy to learn more about his observations.\n\nWinters is professor of economics at the University of Sussex, as well as founding director and fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO).  His career spans over 15 years, including as chief economist at the , director of the Development Research Group of the World Bank, CEO of the Migrating Out of Poverty Research Programme Consortium and advisor for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the , the European Commission, the European Parliament, the , the World Trade Organization and the .\n\nThree reports where Winters is listed as an author were used as reference during the interview: \"COVID-19 will reinforce the Brexit shock\", \"The Costs of Brexit\" and \"Taking stock of the new UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: governance, state subsidies and the level playing field\". \n\nWinters was awarded the title \"Companion of the Most Honourable \", styled C.B., on June 16, 2012 as part of the .\n\n You're a member of the UK Trade Policy Observatory and wrote in December 2020's \"The Cost of Brexit\" the British exit from the European Union \"increases UK-EU costs, reduces trade between them, and requires resources for form-filling, queuing\" and that \"Brexit will be costly for UK society\" free trade agreement or not.  Do you think the government made a mistake when negotiating the Christmas agreement with the EU, or that Brexit was the mistake?\n\n Well I was certainly opposed to Brexit, and I continue to believe that it was a very poor piece of economic policy.  You have to concede that there's been a little bit of sovereignty that has been won back, but actually it's very difficult to exercise, and the government hasn't got too much idea, about how it wants to exercise its sovereignty.  So overall, I'm not very sympathetic over the Brexit decision but, you know, it's made, it's done.\n\nDo I think there was a mistake with having agreed we're going to do Brexit?  Did we get the right sort of Brexit?  Well no, again, I think we would have been much better off economically with a tighter relationship with Europe that kept some of the trade costs lower, and therefore there would be less hits on the amount of trade that's going on.\n\n Now, you've indicated in a May 2020 article that you also wrote on the Trade Policy Observatory web site that issues such as an interrupted UK-EU negotiations and an increase in  as a result of the pandemic would \"reinforce the Brexit shock\".  Does this hold true a year on?\n\n I mean, we've negotiated our way to a trade agreement, which in May last year wasn't certain, by any means, so that's an issue that hasn't arisen, except that the hurry is one of the reasons it's not a very good trade agreement for us, I think.  The reinforcement of government debt: I think we don't know yet.  It's very difficult to sort out what's a Brexit shock and what's a COVID shock, but what certainly is the case is that the UK public finances will take a hit from Brexit, particularly given that it, I think without any doubt, activity in the financial services sector will go down, and they pay a very large amount of tax.\n\nAnd so add to that that we've now sort of taken on potentially an extra three or four hundred billions worth of debt; and [it] is going to constrain economic policy.  So in that sense, the two issues reinforce each other.\n\n I believe you said [in the article] somewhat along the lines of that 'you may think that Brexit and COVID are separate, but in actuality they're very interchanged, or at least the effects of it are very interchanged.'  But from what you've said right now, how can you define between a Brexit shock and a COVID shock?\n\n Yeah, well, economists are working hard on this and, you know, we don't have enough data.  But, for instance, Brexit affects primarily UK trade with the European Union; it affects trade with other countries only through sort of second-order effects.  So if we see trade with the EU behaving differently from trade with the rest of the world, that suggests we are starting to identify a Brexit shock.\n\nIt's also the case that we have an idea of sectors that are going to be particularly affected by Brexit that wouldn't necessarily have been particularly affected by COVID.  For instance, some of the processed food trade, fishing, areas where regulations are important like some services where, for instance, the music industry.  You know, we think that COVID has had a temporary—well, clearly the COVID has had a temporary effect on travelling music concerts gigs, but Brexit looks set to have a permanent effect because it's changing the way in which these things can be organised.\n\nSo, we can't observe it at the moment, but two years from now, three years from now, we hope COVID will [be] behind us, and then sort of the difference between before and after 2019 [in] music, trade ought to be showing up as Brexit effects.  So we try to do it, or we plan to do it by finding dimensions where one or the other is very much bigger and you use that to identify the two.\n\nI mean I think they are interactive.  I was trying to think what was this blog about, I think I remember now.  It was making the point the export markets don't just sort of come and go and it's easy to move in and out.  Once you've lost an export market, it tends to be rather long term.  And so, losing export markets because of COVID which, at least in May [2020], we wondered whether it was going to be worse in the UK than the EU; it hasn't turned out that way.  But losing export markets in COVID, then trying to recover them when trading conditions have got[ten] worse, in a sense makes that recovery a lot less likely.\n\nSo I think it's in the sense there's also this fact that they interact with the dynamics: that you lose an export market, that's costly, it's hard to win back, costly to win back.  We have got two potential hits on our export trade, and therefore, you know, each makes the other more difficult to recover from.\n\n You have some that would say that trade with the EU would decline, but that the UK can make up for it with increased trade with the  or with the US, or, you know, this is an idea that some Brexiteers are in favour of: , with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Do you think that is plausible?\n\n No, it's complete nonsense.  Make that slightly more polite, but no look, it's just not plausible.  The EU is half our trade, approximately half our trade, it's very close, it's very rich, it's very similar, we've spent forty years integrating our way into that market and prior to Brexit, we had very, very close alignment with standards in goods and fairly close alignment in standards with services.  These other markets are a lot further away, we know there is economic research now that suggests that the benefitd of signing trade agreements are weaker, the further away is the partner.\n\nSo, even if we could sign the same sort of agreement with Australia and New Zealand as we had with the EU, it is likely to have a weaker effect.  And the point is, these other free trade agreements are nothing like as deep.  They still require a lot of customs formalities, there will be standards issues that arise, there will be regulations like , and you can sort of agree you'll recognise Australian dentists, but all the rest of the professions, you know, still don't get that sort of recognition.\n\nSo frankly, it's just a myth.  I think I would by all means use that: it's just not gonna happen.\n\n A big sticking point in the Brexit negotiations, and I would say they're still pretty debated today, is fishing, and the UK being able to determine its own , fish stocks, control of the fish in its own borders.  Even though it's lower than Brexiteers may have wanted, the December agreement still means the UK will get 25% of EU fishing rights in its waters between now and 2026 but would still be, in some ways, bound to the EU's rules.  What are your thoughts?\n\n The EU rules get into the story in two different ways.  You're exactly right that there has been a small amount of quota transfer.  It's quite a complicated process, and I'm not an expert—we did produce a blog or a briefing paper perhaps in the UKTPO on fishing, I don't know, six months ago — no, maybe less than that — where a fishing expert helped us go through the numbers.  You know, some of the catch quotas weren't binding, some of them spill over—there's a lot of swapping of quotas.  So, once you look at it, it wasn't that 25% of the EU quota will be caught by UK fishermen.\n\nBut the way that the EU rules get into this is in two ways: one is we have agreed that we will manage fisheries with a degree of co-operation and scientific co-operation with the Europeans so that we do agree, between us, what the maximum sustainable take is, so that that's a scientific decision in principle.  And so in a sense, the EU view of what is sustainable, it does feed into this.\n\nThe second issue is that, perversely, it might seem, most of the fish that the UK fishing industry catches is sold in Europe, and it can only be sold subject to EU regulations, EU standards.  And because we haven't got any agreement on those, we are discovering that these things are very costly to prove that you've got, you know, you have to have a vet sign off on every consignment and that sort of thing.  And so, it's not that, in a sense, Britain is obliged to stick to the EU regulations for its own fish consumed in the UK.  The problem is that we now have to prove as a third country, an external member, a non-member of the EU, that our fish meet their standards.\n\nThere's been one change I gather that's been fairly unsympathetic of: shellfish, but, you know, the EU has sovereignty as well.  So, it's in those ways that EU rules get into it and, you know, we have a bit extra quota, but essentially the way the trade agreement works is if we get difficult over the quota, we'll end up not selling any fish.  It's a long bit of the treaty, you know, about who can hit whom, and how it all has to go on, so it was immensely sensitive.  They've spent so much effort on this, for a sector that is tiny, tiny, it's the tiniest bit of the economy, but there we are, that's where we're at.\n\n I want to ask you now about the  which was given  on 29th of April and puts updated trade deals worth 218 billion on the statute books.  Trade Secretary  called the \"newfound sovereignty\" in a press release enough to \"propel a jobs-led, exports-led and investment-led recovery from COVID-19 and bring prosperity to all parts of our United Kingdom.\"  Now of course, some of the trade agreements were entirely new, a lot of them were also simply rehashed versions of already-agreed upon ones when the UK was under the EU.  So what are your thoughts on that?\n\n There's a very unfortunate way of expressing it.  First, the 218 billion is the amount of trade that is affected.  It's not the value of the income that is generated, it's the amount of trade.  Secondly, that 218 billion is all from agreements that were rolled over from the EU.  These agreements were rolled over to the maximum extent possible—they're not quite as good as we had in the EU, but they're nearly—and the UK government was very clear it wouldn't give any more, it wouldn't ask any more, it just wanted to roll them over.  So all that's happened is that trade agreements that were originally created and, sort of, justified through the EU legal system, you know, are now justified through the UK legal system.\n\nOne  with Japan was billed as being a new agreement but in fact, de facto, it was basically a rollover.  And we're now looking at Australia as the first genuinely new agreement.  The  is predicted to increase UK  [gross domestic product] by between one and two ten-thousandths of UK gross domestic product.  Its, you know, its worth in terms of new income is very, very small.\n\nSo, this is a real bit of, that's an unfortunate bit of statistics, I mean, it just is not a fair representation of what was going on.\n\n Post-Brexit checks on goods heading to and from Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK angered many  and  who claim the  is a .  However,  said the 25th of May the complications were caused not by the Protocol, but by Brexit.  What do you think?\n\n Well, it's a bit of both, in a sense.  You know, if we hadn't had Brexit, we wouldn't have had the Protocol, so in that sense von der Leyen is exactly right: this is all the result of Brexit.  But, there were different ways of doing Brexit, and the position that Theresa May had eventually, I suppose, worked out as being the best way, was to say that the whole of the United Kingdom would align pretty closely with the EU on many, many dimensions, and that that would have made continuing sort of free, I mean entirely free, bureaucratic-free trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland perfectly straightforward. It wouldn't have changed the status quo.\n\nSo, it wouldn't have happened without Brexit, that is correct, but it also wouldn't have happened if we had had a different Brexit agreement.  The Protocol arose essentially because Mr [Boris] Johnson suddenly decided that he could live with it.  It was something he had rejected while he was in government with Mrs May, and Mrs May had said no British government could accept [this], so it's absolutely not the case that it is just the fault of the Protocol, and even if it were the question is: \"where did that Protocol come from?\"  And it came from a particular conception of Brexit which was one of very very arm's length, very little integration.\n\n COVID-19 has restricted the opportunity and the willingness to spend, leading some economists to predict a post-lockdown surge in , not just in the UK but across the world.  What impact do you think this will have on UK imports from other countries, and do you think it will impact any trade talks that would go on during this time?\n\n I mean I think we don't know yet how COVID is going to turn out, but we know that a pretty close connection between the country's income and the amount that it imports.  So, for any country in the world, you cut income, you cut imports.  If COVID, you know, while we are recovering from COVID, imports are going to be mostly is going to be somewhat lower.  If we don't ever catch up, as it were, to where we would have been without COVID, imports won't catch up either.\n\nI think its impact on trade talks is a second-order thing.  I mean, you know, if you import a bit less, there might be a little bit less interest in having a trade agreement, it might just be the thing that stops you from signing one, but it's all so small that I certainly couldn't make any prediction in that dimension; I don't think that really anybody else could.  But, you know, trade is affected by income, we know that, that's clear.\n\n The country's Brexit minister  said 12th of March that \"[f]reight volumes between the UK and the EU have been back to their normal levels\" since the beginning of February and that recent drops in UK-EU trade were made \"inevitable\" because of the \"unique\" circumstances of pre-Christmas stockpiling and lockdowns across Europe.  What are your thoughts?\n\n We're waiting for the data.  The UKTPO published a paper last week, possibly ten days ago, looking at [the] first three months' trade data, and in most cases it turned out that trade had not recovered to, sort of, pre-2020 levels after the end of the transition period.  The drop was not as large as it looked like in January, and it is certainly true that because of stockpiling prior to the end of the transition period January and February always were going to have very low trade volumes.\n\nSo, I think I don't agree with Frost that things have got back to normal, and in particular this statement on March the 12th I believe is about, actually, the volume of movements, not the value of trade.  When you talk to the logistics companies, they say \"yeah, but, you know, half of those containers are empty!\"  One of the disruptive things over the last three months is lining up containers on both directions, and that is one of the things that Brexit has done.  When we were members of the EU, a British lorry could take exports out to, say, Italy, it could call in France, it could call in Germany and call in Belgium to pick up stuff to bring back, cross back.  Now it's no longer able to: it picks up to bring EU goods into the UK, they only can pick up in one place; on the way out, it can only deliver [to] two places.\n\nSo, there's as much shipping—you have to ship these things around, but they're not generating the same value of trade as previously.  So the value numbers are fairly clearly down, yet, we just don't know.  We think, my prediction is, trade is going to be lower.  But, we don't yet have the absolutely firm evidence that that is the case.\n\n The UK started talks yesterday with members of the  (CPTPP).  The Trade Secretary on [30] January, which is when the UK first applied to join, said that in joining the agreement it would \"create enormous opportunities for UK businesses that simply weren’t there as part of the EU\".  What impacts on trade do you foresee if the UK actually does join the CPTPP?\n\n There will be some impact, there's no doubt, but we, in general, we don't think there'll be a huge impact, and so in a sense it all hangs around how enormous is 'enormous'.  Why don't we think there will be enormous impacts on trade?\n\nWell one, these countries are a long way away!  And so, trade is costly, it's difficult to co-ordinate, it's expensive to carry out.\n\nSecondly, of the members of the CPTPP, we already have trade agreements, I think, with seven of them.  We are busily negotiating a trade agreement with Australia and New Zealand, so that's another two that would be taken care of, you know.  The number of areas where CPTPP opens up trade is really rather small.  Malaysia is a country we would get, you know, some tariff concessions from, and offer tariff concessions to, which we don't have any other way.\n\nThe CPTPP also liberalises 95% of tariff lines in the goods classification that we use for international trade: about twelve thousand, fifteen thousand entries; CPTPP aims to have zero tariffs and 95% of them−I think UK-Japan has got zero tariffs, eventually [they're] going to have them on 99.7%; with Europe it's a 100%, and so on.  So, CPTPP doesn't really add much liberalisation in goods.  It will affect trade, probably digital trade, digital rules will be a bit different, it will have a bit of an effect, probably, on  issues, pharmaceuticals, just slightly different regulations.\n\nSo it will have some effect, but we, frankly, wouldn't have expected it to be enormous.  Yeah, it's what Ms Truss has to say, but, yeah, frankly it's sort of, it's not, in any standard usage of the word, it would not be 'enormous'.\n\n , Cornwall will host  in a week's time.  What do you think the Prime Minister needs to bring up as it relates to trade opportunities?\n\n Well, I think the important thing for the G7 is actually for the Prime Minister not to focus on British trade at all, but to focus on trying to repair the multilateral trading system.\n\nA couple of things that would be important here: one is to try and make the Americans think more favourably about restoring the health of the  process within the World Trade Organization.  They refused the reappointment of the judges who run the  in the World Trade Organization — the WTO —, and so that whole system has just ground to a halt.  I think it would be very constructive if we could get a G7 agreement that, no no, we now intend and we can see how, we're going to repair that.\n\nThe second is that one ought to be able to think about advancing the way to do so-called 'plurilateral agreements' within the WTO.  The WTO, by convention, works by consensus: everybody has to agree, or, at least, not oppose.  And that may have made it impossible to change the rules in the WTO for 27 years, since 1994.  That's an exaggeration: it's made it impossible to do significant changes.  And the reason, often, is there's only a small number of countries, a small number of interests who don't want to do particular things.\n\nMaking it easier for subsets of countries to agree to improve trading conditions would be a big step forward−you can still have a system whereby either they agree they're going to change their trading conditions, improve conditions for imports into their country, and apply it to everybody, even those people who haven't agreed to make those changes, and that just seems like a straightforward game.  But even getting that through the WTO has proved very difficult.\n\nAnd secondly, we have a few, small number of trade agreements that apply only between a few members of the WTO: less than the whole of the membership of the WTO.  And they can only be instituted and introduced into the WTO if everybody agrees, even those people who are outside, and that just hasn't happened.\n\nSo, allowing smaller−but still quite large−I mean, 60, 70, 80 members to go ahead and make agreements among themselves to change their conditions of trade would start to ease up the log-jam that we have in the world['s] trading system, and that would help bring it into line.  Yeah, we really don't have agreements about , we don't have very much agreement on services, and all the things that are the dynamic elements of international trade that sort of lie outside WTO's effective range, because there are a few countries that resisted; we can't bring them in.\n\nAnd so, one wants to sort of set up a system that is largely a political system that makes it possible for those countries to say: \"we're not very interested, but as long as it doesn't hurt us, we don't mind if you go ahead with it.\"  And at the moment, they don't have incentives, they don't have trust enough to do it.\n\nSo, the other thing I would do would do is have G7 work, in a very focused way, on how you can reassure people, members of the member countries in the WTO, that other subsets of countries can do things which don't harm them, and therefore they ought to let it go ahead, rather than block it.  So those are the two things I would put on Johnson's agenda. \n\n This meeting will be with quite a lot of large countries, and the Prime Minister has invited India and Australia [to attend], countries which he is making an active effort to make agreements with, for the UK to have greater relations with them.  Would you believe, in any way, a part of recovery from COVID-19 could be reached next week that would involve the countries in the G7?\n\n You know, the COVID recovery is not an area which I feel I have great expertise in.  There are certainly things that can be done to ease recovery, one of which would be agreements on providing [COVID-19] vaccines for the whole of the world rather than just the rich countries; agreements on trading vaccines or components of vaccines or other medical equipment without restrictions, and if G7, or G7 plus India, Australia and South Korea decided to agree to go down those routes, they would certainly help a bit.\n\nI confess I don't have much of a feel for what the politics would be, and whether that's very likely.\n\nWhat you say about the three extra members is this is not, as you say, as you hinted, sort of a self-interested group of the next three democracies: they're three democracies Britain is trying hard to court!  Now, I'm all in favour of co-operation, and I think for world trade purposes, certainly getting the Indians to feel more comfortable with the multilateral trading system would be quite a leap forward.\n\nI'm not very happy if this is an attempt to further encircle China.  I'm concerned about Chinese-versus-West tensions, and while I think it's perfectly legitimate for China and the democracies to say \"no no, we believe in different things\", at the moment it seems to me, rather, ramped up, and it would, in the slightly longer run, we need to be aiming to make it more co-operative, and less confrontational.  And, the Democracies Club, is presented sometimes in a somewhat anti-China light, and I think that would be an unfortunate way of starting it off.  There are useful things that the democracies can do together, quite irrespective of their policies with China, and if they certainly do need to think about how [the] West and China get on, but it's not clear to me that this is necessary the best modality.\n\nWe have to wait and see.  I mean, in a sense for China, the really critical thing is where's India going to come out in this, I think, and it's difficult to know.  The Indians do not always like international groups and international laws.  So, I think we have to wait and see how it works out.\n\n Do you believe that there is any 'perfect' trade relationship in the world between two countries or organisations that the UK could look to for guidance?\n\n On the whole, I think that trade relations should be very close.  I think we're all beneficiaries of, essentially, removing barriers to international commerce, so that they are very low.  And we have to recognise that if that harms people, we have to support them: we need systems that allow one to adjust to foreign shocks.\n\nBut what are the ideal relationships in my mind?  You sent me the question, I thought about it, and I suddenly realised: every relationship that I can think of that is deep and is a model, is essentially between neighbouring countries.  So, the real message is, just be more sensible about Europe!  But, you know, France and Germany [have] a very strong relationship; Australia and New Zealand, pretty good relationship;  [North American Free Trade Agreement]: [Donald] Trump rather disturbed it, but, frankly, NAFTA has had a big effect in North America.\n\nNeighbours, and co-operation.\n\n Do you think the UK should work harder to align itself more with the World Trade Organization?\n\n The UK is moderately-well-aligned with the World Trade Organization.  There was a view, a few years ago, that Britain suddenly having an independent voice in the World Trade Organization would suddenly dynamise the organisation and solve all its problems: it was just immense .  That has clearly not come to pass, as, frankly, the whole international trade profession predicted it doesn't work like that.\n\nAnd so Britain ought, as a middle-sized country with a long tradition of openness, [to] have [an] extremely important role to play in the WTO.  It's a role of leadership and leadership by example, but it's a quiet and self-effacing role, and that's not something that Brits, yet, have got their heads around.  The  in  produced a series about Britain after Brexit, and the most recent one, you know, essentially said, you know: \"what now?\"  And the biggest single theme out of that was humility.  The Brits have got to get their head around, they cannot just boss people around!\n\nAnd if you look–I'm going around to one of your previous questions–if you look at the comments about accession to the CPTPP, you very often hear to say: \"oh no, we need to be in that group so we can influence it\", and 'influence' is a polite word for 'date'.  This idea that Britain is going to lead the CPTPP is, my view: embarrassing.  And it's not the way that you achieve influence, at least in world trade.  I can't comment on other aspects of foreign policy, but in world trade, in a sense, showing off and squaring your shoulders: it doesn't work.\n\nThe people who are good at managing world trade organisations are the countries that are naturally, or perhaps have learned, to be much quieter, much more subtle than the Brits are at the moment.  You think about Canadians, or think perhaps about the Japanese.  So, you know, I think we ought to align with the WTO, but we should do it, as it were, quietly and co-operatively rather than pushing our way to the front and saying \"we're the leaders, follow us!\"  They won't, that's the truth: they're just not going to!\n\n Is there anything else you'd like to say about Brexit and UK trade, more broadly?\n\n I suppose only that, you know, most trade policy is a, sort of a quiet business, it's plodding away, it's sorting out little difficulties.  It's not grand, it's not photo opportunities.  And this focus that, in a sense, signing these trade agreements is 90% of what trade policy is, in the end, is not very helpful.  Real trade agreements take a long time to negotiate, even longer to implement and even larger to, sort of, enlarge and deepen.  And so, we ought to have, you know, in a sense acquire a more thoughtful, more analytical view of trade policy.\n\nWe also need to work out in Britain what we think about lots of other things, and then make trade policy commensurate with it.  You know, I wrote a letter to The Times'' a couple of weeks ago–less than a couple weeks ago, I think, when I said: \"look, you know, it's fine the government says 'oh, it signs this deal with Japan, with the most advanced digital trade chapter, you know, known in European or in UK trading history', but the trouble is there's been no debate within Britain at all about what sort of digital policies we want\".  Trade policy in Britain is almost unconstrained: the executive has almost no constraints on doing what it wants with trade policy.\n\nAnd I am concerned that they are trying to use trade policy, as it were, to influence other areas of policy that actually ought to be subject to real, internal debate, and internal agreement, and then use the trade policy to reinforce, you know, back it up when it comes to dealing with other countries. So, I think it needs to be sort of longer-sighted, and it needs to be put into a larger context, and neither of these generate headlines and photo opportunities like signing free trade agreements, even rather small ones.\n\nSo, I mean, I guess that's sort of my overview of where we are with UK trade policy.\n\n__NOTOC__", "question": "What is L.

A total of 24 people in the Australian council's three wards have put themselves forward to stand as candidates. The shire has been governed by administrators appointed by the Victorian state government since August 2019, when the council was sacked after a state government inquiry found \"high levels of tension\" within the council.\n\nWikinews interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, Lindsay Love, via email. Love is contesting the Tarwin Valley ward, which elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council, and includes the towns of  and . In addition to her answers to the questions from Wikinews, Love also provided the following statement in regards to the state of the council:\n\n\"I also note that the Council satisfaction rating has been dismal for over ten years. That is a period covering various Council terms and the Administrators. The only constant has been the Administration. That would suggest that to improve the culture the change needs to be in the Administration. That means the Council has to operate like a corporate Board and give the CEO the required directions to effect a change.\"\n\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n I would like to see a change in the culture of the Administration so that it is open, transparent and has a much better community engagement profile. We need to allow people to have much greater input into the decisions that impact them.\n\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n\n The Administrators were a disaster for the Shire. Perhaps this has been compounded by the arrival of COVID[-19] but we lost the \"local\" out of local government. However, the performance of the Administration has continued upon its poor path of over 10 years.\n\n Since 1993, South Gippsland has not had a passenger railway service, when the  service to Leongatha was closed. Do you think that these services should be brought back, and why/why not?\n\n The Administrators had an opportunity to keep the railway and establish the rail trail but chose to ignore that option. Now that the line is removed it is most unlikely a train will return given the State are trying to build a line to the airport plus a suburban ring line. They will get much more bang for the buck on those projects.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n The Environment protection is largely a state area of responsibility. Local government involvement mostly leads to increased costs and administration issues which is counter to running a lean and efficient local government delivering the core remits.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n I have a long history of involvement in some of the issues impacting the Shire so a local history can be an assistance. I have a varied life history having been a farmer, business operator and volunteer in the community. I have professional training as a Civil Engineer, planner and building designer and I have also had ten years working in local government.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n The Shire has options to tackle a large number of projects. I have recently published a new vision for  in the hope that it would lead to some new community engagement on that facility. I have also promoted the idea of a water supply to  and hence a bike trail from  to Yanakie using the water pipeline as a basis for the rail trail.

I have been secretary for the South Gippsland Action Group Inc who have tried to work for the residents of the Shire.

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then. However, South Gippsland's council is scheduled to be restored with an election to be held via post from October 5–22, 2021.\n\nWikinews interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, David Liebelt, an independent candidate running in the Coastal-Promontory Ward. The Coastal-Promontory ward covers towns such as , , , , , and , and elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n\n As a councillor I hope to represent the all the people of the Coastal Ward as well as the people of the entire South Gippsland Shire. I believe I can represent the \"Quiet Majority\". The employees; farmers; small business people; the tradies; the retired and the holidays makers. We have, for too long been represented by people with narrow agendas. My focus will be on local community issues and not Federal and State Government distractions. I will work to ensure the most appropriate allocation of resources so that the Council can be seen as delivering value for money. \n\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n\n  The two year period under administration has been too long and the Administrators have performed poorly in their duties when it comes to listening to the community and delivering on community needs. Decision have been made against community wishes; extensive waste on reviews; consultants and feasibility studies that have not delivered the appropriate outcomes.\n\n , which takes up the majority of Coastal-Promontory ward's land area, attracts a significant amount of tourists on a yearly basis. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown, there has been a large impact on local businesses. What do you think needs to be done to help business recovery?\n\n The Prom is not the only tourist attraction affected by COVID-19. We have for too long neglected other valuable tourist attractions in preference for the Prom. I am currently looking into the allocation of the Council's $2 million community support package. Very few small businesses have seen any benefit from this package. I think the Council needs to immediately provide support for all outdoor community activities that any business wants to develop. We need to reduce the red tape involved in getting these projects off the ground; let's think outside the square for a change and stop relying on developing compliance checklists to justify the bureaucrats existence.\n\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n\n We need to recognises that our farmers are strong environmentalists. We need to support our farmers better by providing rate relief for environmental initiatives. I am a strong believer in Habitat Corridors. These link wildlife communities and strengthen biodiversity. I would encourage a masterplan of Habitat Corridors across the Shire. Corridors that link our coastal reserves to our ranges.\n\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n\n I have extensive small business management experience. I have extensive experience in people management and community involvement. I have an education in Economics, Finance and Small Business. I have completed studies in Climatology and Coastal & Fluvial Geomorphology. I have the ability to listen. My life experiences have taught me patience and empathy. Not all decisions will be popular, but they will be delivered honestly.\n\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n\n I will advocate for a better allocation of resources to our small communities. Better value for the rate dollars spent. I will look to improve the services delivered by the small community Centres and community Health Centres. I will look to improve the services available for our elderly to try to assist them to stay longer in the community cities they love. As I mentioned I would look to be part of a Masterplan for Habitat Corridors in conjunction with the farming community and .\n\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n\n Contact is made via the local small businesses and hospitality businesses. Social media has become a part of life; now it becomes an important conduit for ideas, advice and information.\n\n Have you ever run for a political office prior to your current candidacy for council?\n\n I have never run for a political position in any form before this.\n\n \n \n ", "question": "What is one of David Liebelt's main focuses as a candidate for the South Gippsland Shire Council?\n\nA) Developing compliance checklists  \nB) Representing the \"Quiet Majority\"  \nC) Promoting federal and state government issues  \nD) Supporting only large businesses"}

Governor-General Sir  issued a proclamation in 1997 to urge all Australians to observe one minutes' silence.\n\nThe  website states 61,630 Australians perished during the First World War between August 4, 1914 and March 31, 1921, making the conflict the deadliest in Australian history by far.  The RSL website states that from the country's population of five million, 416,809 enlisted, 155 thousand were wounded and eight thousand died of post-war injuries.\n\nQuestions were fielded by RSL Ambassador Pete Rudland, who served with the  from 1989 to 2017 and had deployments in Cambodia in 1993, Iraq in 1997 and again in 2003, East Timor in 2001 and Afghanistan in 2010, when he was injured in a fatal helicopter crash that killed four.\n\n How has Remembrance Day changed in RSL's history of commemoration?\n\n: I think, In [sic] the beginning Remembrance Day/Armistice had an effect on 2/3 of the world and everyone in our country had been impacted in some way. So many Australian men and women had died or been wounded. Just over 60,000 dead and a further 156,000 wounded out of a population of 4,985,569. \n\nLet that sink in, over 60,000 Australians that would be buried in foreign lands. \n\nAustralia, other  countries and  would not be able to effectively mourn their losses.\n\nFor Australians, the Returned & Services League (RSL) provided an opportunity for the families of the fallen and wounded to mourn together and heal through shared experiences. Soldiers from all backgrounds stood together to remember and understand everyone’s experience of War. \n\nToday’s wars do not exact the same toll, however for those that fight them and their families the RSL continues to provide the same opportunities as it did a hundred years ago. \n\nRemembrance Day in its size of impacted people has changed but the narrative will never change. \n\n What is the role you believe organisations should take in Remembrance Day?\n\n: A modern Remembrance Day is really just a collection of stories. Stories of people that sacrifice everything for the values they believe in. Organisations should take the steps to ensure that the stories and the lessons of the past are learnt and preserved. With the changing demographic of our country and others, Ex-Service Organisations are the custodians of the memories of the past.\n\n What is the role you believe governments should take in Remembrance Day?\n\n: The path to war is walked by politicians, the war is fought by soldiers and the price of war is paid by the families!\n\nWith that being said, Governments need to take the lead on Remembrance Day and . Soldiers don’t make decisions to go to war, governments do! [sic] and for that to continue soldiers must feel that their sacrifices are respected by the people that make the decision to deploy them. The act of recognising significant days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day reinforces the relationship between government, soldiers and the country.\n\n 103 years after the 1918 Armistice, why is Remembrance Day important today? Has it retained its poignancy so long after the War?\n\n: For Australians WW1 marks the first time that Australians deployed to foreign shores as Australians. We had only deployed as colonies before then.\n\n had only just been granted and most Australians would have been very proud of what our very young nation had achieved domestically and militarily during this period. \n\nAustralia, as part of the Commonwealth, along with its allies defeated the  in the largest war the world had ever seen. \n\nI think that Australians learnt the enormous price of war and honoured it. Soldiers and their families’ sacrifices shaped the direction of our nation and I think that most people today understand the relationship between the past and present. That is why it has retained its poignancy for over one hundred years.\n\n What do the lessons of World War I and its aftermath teach us of veterans' affairs today?\n\n: That war is a complex environment and we must be prepared for every continuation. The business of war does not end at the completion of hostilities. The wounded require rehabilitation and ongoing support and the families of the fallen need to feel that their sacrifice was worth it. This is relevant to every conflict.\n\n Why should Remembrance Day be commemorated alongside 25 April - ANZAC Day?\n\n: ANZAC Day is the beginning of an Australian legend! Triumph over adversity - it is built into the fabric of our culture. \n\nRemembrance Day reminds Australians of more than the heavy human price of WW1. It reminds us of the holistic burden of a new nation trying to find its place.
