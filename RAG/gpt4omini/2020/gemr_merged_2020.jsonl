{"title": "Argentine president Fernández to send bill legalising abortion to National Congress within 10 days", "content": "Argentine President Alberto Fernández announced Sunday he will send a bill to Congress within ten days to legalize abortion.  Fernández, who previously called it a “public health issue,” stated the bill would legalize abortion early in pregnancy and grant women access to the healthcare system for this procedure.  Thousands rallied outside the National Congress in support.\n\nCurrently, abortion is illegal in Argentina, except in cases of rape or when the mother's life is at risk.  Fernández argued the existing law forces many women, particularly those with limited resources, into unsafe, clandestine abortions, jeopardizing their health and lives.  The government estimates approximately 350,000 illegal abortions occur annually in the predominantly Catholic country.  Illegal abortion has been a crime punishable by imprisonment since 1921.  Fernández emphasized the state's responsibility to protect its citizens, particularly women.\n\nMariela Belski, director of Amnesty International Argentina, praised the president for responding to the demands of women and girls.  However, Archbishop Jorge Eduardo Scheinig criticized the proposed legislation, calling it a “culture of death” and urging prayer for a “yes to life.”\n\nUruguay, Guyana, and Cuba are the only other Latin American countries where early-term abortion is legal.  A similar bill was passed by the Argentine Congress in 2018 but rejected by the Senate.", "question": "What was the purpose of the bill announced by President Fernández of Argentina?  \n\nA) To ban all forms of abortion in the country  \nB) To legalize abortion at the initial time of pregnancy  \nC) To restrict abortion to cases of rape only  \nD) To increase penalties for illegal abortion"}

Amman, who was under police surveillance following his release from prison a week earlier,  entered a shop, grabbed a large knife, and ran outside, stabbing a man and two women.  Plainclothes counter-terrorism officers, already monitoring him, gave chase and shot him dead outside a shop at approximately 2 PM local time.\n\nOne eyewitness described seeing Amman, wearing a fake suicide vest and carrying a machete, being pursued by an officer before being shot.  The eyewitness reported hearing approximately three gunshots.  One male victim was initially listed in critical condition, while one woman sustained minor injuries from shattered glass following the police shooting.  The other woman's injuries were described as not life-threatening.\n\nAmman had been imprisoned since 2018 for 13 terror offenses, serving half his sentence. Police described him as \"knife-obsessed,\" noting he sent his girlfriend videos of beheadings and extremist messages, urging her to kill her non-Muslim parents.

The NEOC reported a 95% measles immunization rate as of Sunday, with the last measles-related death occurring on December 26th.\n\nRestrictions on public gatherings and travel have been lifted, and schools have reopened. The Health Emergency Operation Centre has assumed responsibility for relief efforts previously managed by the NEOC.  The Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs have been tasked with creating a recovery plan within two weeks for cabinet consideration.\n\nThe Disease Surveillance Team reported a total of 5,667 measles cases, resulting in 1,846 hospitalizations (1,720 discharges) and 81 deaths.  The December 6th National Measles Response and Recovery Appeal highlighted children under five as the most vulnerable demographic, correlating with lower vaccination rates in that age group.\n\nTupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital resumed normal operations on Sunday, joining Faleolo and Leulumoega District Hospitals, which reopened on Friday.  During the peak of the outbreak, these hospitals were repurposed to manage the influx of patients, with measures taken to isolate measles cases.

Disassembly of temporary treatment facilities has already begun.\n\nWhile the state of emergency was initially expected to end on December 15th, it was extended by two weeks to facilitate continued immunization efforts.  The Prime Minister had called for 100% immunization;  the 95% rate achieved, according to NEOC, is considered sufficient by aid agencies to prevent further uncontrolled spread.  Sufficient vaccination rates mean an infected person is unlikely to encounter enough unvaccinated individuals to trigger a chain reaction.\n\nUNICEF delivered over 105,000 vaccine doses to Samoa by November 22nd.  A nationwide vaccination campaign, launched on November 20th, mandated free vaccination for children aged six months to 19 years and women aged 20 to 35.

The U.S. justified the action as a defensive measure, citing Soleimani's alleged involvement in the December 31st attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other attacks on U.S. personnel.  The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, along with an Iraqi official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer.

This initiative, aimed at promoting gender equality in the workplace, was spearheaded by Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) of the Mysore Division, who spoke with Wikinews about the event and broader efforts to empower women within the railway system.\n\n**Wikinews:** Good afternoon, ma'am. Thank you for this interview. Congratulations to the Mysore Division on the all-women crew operating the Tippu Express. How many women were involved?\n\n**Aparna Garg:**  Around fifteen.  While a train crew typically consists only of the loco pilot and guard, this included ticket checking staff, escort staff, and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel.\n\n**Wikinews:** How unusual is an all-women train crew?\n\n**Garg:** It's quite rare. This was one of ten daily activities planned for our International Women's Day campaign, themed \"Each for Equal.\"  The goal is to highlight the often-unseen contributions of women in traditionally male-dominated railway roles like loco pilot and keyman (track patrol).\n\n**Wikinews:** Was this the first all-women crew on the South Western Railway?\n\n**Garg:** No, other divisions have done it before, but possibly for the first time in Mysore.  Bangalore Division has also had similar initiatives.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Can you elaborate on the planning and goals of this event?\n\n**Garg:**  Our \"Each for Equal\" campaign emphasizes individual contributions to gender equality. We aim to showcase the significant work women are doing across various railway roles.  We are highlighting women's success in traditionally male fields and celebrating their dedication.\n\n**Wikinews:** Was this a South Western Railway or Indian Railways initiative?\n\n**Garg:**  It was an initiative of the Mysore Division, within the South Western Railway.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are the broader Indian Railways plans for International Women's Day?\n\n**Garg:** Indian Railways' \"Each for Equal\" campaign encourages activities from March 1st to 10th, including talks, lectures, and social media campaigns to highlight women's empowerment initiatives.\n\nIn Mysore, besides the all-women train crew, we've organized events like cervical cancer screenings for both permanent and contract staff (including cleaning staff), a staff trek, and other activities.\n\n**Wikinews:** How does this year's celebration differ from last year's?\n\n**Garg:** Last year's focus was primarily on March 8th. This year's ten-day campaign promotes broader participation and awareness.\n\n**Wikinews:** What activities are planned for the remaining days?\n\n**Garg:** We’re encouraging women employees to participate in activities outside their regular work, fostering talent development and boosting morale.  We've held internal events like \"pick-and-speak\" sessions, showcasing the hidden talents within our staff, including Group D employees.  We're also focused on enhancing security for women passengers.\n\n**Wikinews:**  Would you consider this event a success?\n\n**Garg:** Yes, so far.\n\n**Wikinews:** What challenges do women face working for Indian Railways?\n\n**Garg:** The challenges are similar to those faced by women in society generally.  Women often need to work twice as hard for recognition, and they frequently juggle work and significant household responsibilities.  Despite this, they are incredibly dedicated and sincere.\n\n**Wikinews:** How can these issues be addressed?\n\n**Garg:**  While events like Women's Day celebrations raise awareness, a broader societal shift in mindset is crucial. This begins at home and involves sensitizing male colleagues and family members to create a more supportive environment.\n\n**Wikinews:** What is the gender distribution at the Mysore Division?\n\n**Garg:** Approximately 10% of our 6900 employees (around 650) are women.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are you satisfied with this number?\n\n**Garg:** It's acceptable.  We don't focus on quotas, but rather on individual choice and merit.\n\n**Wikinews:** Has this number improved recently?\n\n**Garg:** Yes, it has increased from 7-8% over the past two years.  We're seeing more women entering technical fields like loco piloting, station masters, and track maintenance.\n\n**Wikinews:** What steps is Indian Railways taking to improve gender balance?\n\n**Garg:** While there's no formal reservation system, Indian Railways actively promotes gender equality.  The increasing number of women DRMs (currently around eight out of sixty divisions) demonstrates this positive trend.\n\n**Wikinews:** Could you describe your role as DRM?\n\n**Garg:** I oversee all operations and train services across approximately 1300 route kilometers in the Mysore Division. This includes managing a team of around 30 officers and approximately 6900 staff.  My responsibilities include daily decision-making, implementing ministry initiatives, and ensuring efficient train operations.\n\n**Wikinews:** How long have you been DRM?\n\n**Garg:** I will complete two years in April.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are some career highlights?\n\n**Garg:**  Early success in the civil service exam, achieving a Chevening Fellowship for postgraduate studies in the UK, developing an Oracle-based project management software, and leading the renovation of Mysore Railway Station while preserving its heritage, are some key achievements.  Other notable projects include developing an eco-space and revitalizing the railway museum.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What precautions are being taken regarding the coronavirus?\n\n**Garg:** We're working closely with our Chief Health Director.  We have an isolation ward and are making announcements at the station about precautions. Masks are being distributed to staff who interact directly with the public.  We are planning to designate a segregated space at the station.\n\n**Wikinews:** Thank you for your time.\n\n\nThis revised version improves clarity, flow, and organization.

The project, currently involving Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, aims to transport Eastern Mediterranean gas to the European mainland. Mitsotakis emphasized the project's openness to other countries, stating that participation is contingent upon respect for international law.  He specifically denounced the Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement as \"null and void\" and \"geographically ridiculous,\" arguing it violates Greece's sovereign rights and disregards the exclusive economic zones of Greek islands, including Crete.  He further indicated that Greece may pursue legal action against Turkey in The Hague if diplomatic efforts fail, while maintaining open channels for dialogue.  Mitsotakis repeated these criticisms in subsequent meetings with the International Monetary Fund and President Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, the energy ministers of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel signed an agreement in Athens to complete the EastMed pipeline by 2025.  The agreement, attended by Prime Ministers Mitsotakis and Netanyahu, and Cypriot President [President's Name], sets a framework for construction, though private investment remains to be secured.  Greek energy producer Energean has already committed $1.7 billion to the Karish and Tanin gas fields and signed a letter of intent to supply two billion cubic meters of gas annually to a Greek supplier.  The pipeline's planned capacity is ten billion cubic meters per year.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline as a means to elevate the participating countries’ geopolitical standing, urging Italy and Egypt to join.  While the ruling party in Cyprus celebrated the agreement, the opposition highlighted the lack of secured private investment.  Turkey, however, voiced its opposition, citing Turkish and Turkish Cypriot mining rights and predicting the project's failure if these are ignored. Italy, a proposed endpoint, expressed support, though it is also pursuing another pipeline to Greece.  The United States has consistently supported the project, evidenced by the Eastern Mediterranean Bill and diplomatic engagement.\n\nThe EU, having partially funded feasibility studies and classified EastMed as a Project of Common Interest (PCI), views the project as vital for ending the energy isolation of Greece and Cyprus, and for diversifying Europe's gas supply. However, concerns remain.  Experts like Alex Lagakos of the Greek Energy Forum question the project's economic viability, citing high costs (estimated at €6 billion), competition from LNG terminals, and the EU's commitment to green energy.  Avinoam Idan, a geostrategy expert, suggested the project's geopolitical impact on Europe's energy market would be limited, as it wouldn't significantly alter Russia's market share.  Alternative export routes, such as a subsea electricity cable (EuroAsia Interconnector) and a pipeline to Egypt, are also under consideration.  The existing Turkish Stream pipeline is cited by Turkish officials as rendering EastMed redundant.

This decision came despite Dorsa Derakhshani having previously informed the federation of her unwillingness to play for Iran.\n\nDorsa Derakhshani, now 21, holds the International Master (IM) and Woman Grandmaster (WGM) titles. Her brother, Borna, plays for the United Kingdom and holds the IM title.\n\nDorsa Derakhshani's ban stemmed from her refusal to wear a hijab during the 2017 World Junior Chess Championship in January 2017.  The Islamic Republic of Iran mandates the hijab.  Borna Derakhshani was banned for playing against Israeli Grandmaster (GM) Aviv Regev at the same tournament. Iran does not recognize Israel, and Iranian athletes have historically avoided competing against Israelis.\n\nMehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, president of the Iranian chess federation, explained the decision, stating [insert Pahlavanzadeh's quote here].  He further stated [insert second Pahlavanzadeh quote here].\n\nDorsa Derakhshani, currently studying at Saint Louis University in the United States and playing for the US Chess Federation, discussed her chess career, her time in Iran, the 2017 controversy, and her life in St. Louis with a Wikinews correspondent.\n\n**Wikinews:** Could you tell us something about yourself?\n\n**Derakhshani:** I'm a professional chess player and currently a student at Saint Louis University.\n\n**Wikinews:** What interested you in chess, and who taught you?\n\n**Derakhshani:** My dad, who played in high school before the Iranian Revolution.  Chess was banned for about ten years afterward, so he played only at home with my mom. That's how I learned.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do your parents do?\n\n**Derakhshani:** My dad's a pediatrician and family doctor. My mom's a psychiatrist.\n\n**Wikinews:** How was your childhood?\n\n**Derakhshani:** As the first child, my parents invested heavily in my education. At two and a half, I finished first grade.  At just over four, I finished fourth grade. They wanted me to skip to fifth grade at five, but the government wouldn't allow it.  So they filled my time with ballet, painting, music, swimming, and eventually chess, which I loved because of the puzzle-solving and competition.\n\n**Wikinews:** How did you train as a child?\n\n**Derakhshani:** I always strived to excel, and chess became my clear strength.  Winning the Girls' Under-8 National Championship solidified that. I was ambitious and competitive.\n\n**Wikinews:** When did you realize you were seriously talented?\n\n**Derakhshani:** In middle and high school, I attended the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET), a school requiring a rigorous entrance exam. Balancing school and chess was challenging, leading me to focus solely on them, abandoning music and concerts.\n\n**Wikinews:** Who inspires you in chess?\n\n**Derakhshani:** Judit Polgár, especially for her perseverance and breaking gender barriers, reaching the top 10 without limiting herself to female-only competition.\n\n**Wikinews:** What's your most memorable tournament?\n\n**Derakhshani:** Winning the Iranian National Championship for Girls Under-8. It was a turning point, and I remember wearing a princess dress and tiara.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are some challenges you faced as a chess prodigy in Iran?\n\n**Derakhshani:** The lack of tournaments was a major obstacle.  Women were seen as second-class citizens, and opportunities were limited.  My parents fought for me to compete in open tournaments from the age of eight.\n\n**Wikinews:** You were a TV anchor as a child. Tell us more.\n\n**Derakhshani:** A TV producer saw me singing and dancing in a mall at age two and offered me a co-hosting role for kids. I quit at six because they wanted me to wear a hijab and change my clothing style, a decision my parents supported.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you describe your childhood personality?\n\n**Derakhshani:** My mom calls me a \"child robot\"—always confident, outspoken, and competitive.\n\n**Wikinews:** You decided early on not to play for Iran. Why?\n\n**Derakhshani:** Around 2011-2014, after winning Asian and Youth National Championships, I realized the Iranian Chess Federation wasn't a good fit.  The demands on my time and energy were excessive and unrelated to chess.  I also wanted to immigrate, as much of my extended family lives abroad. I officially stopped playing for Iran in 2015, immigrated to Spain in 2016, and ultimately accepted a scholarship to Saint Louis University.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** If Iran didn't enforce the hijab, would you have played for them?\n\n**Derakhshani:** It wasn't just about the headscarf; it was the societal view of women and the extra effort women had to put in to be considered equal. I chose to immigrate for a better voice and future.\n\n**Wikinews:** Did your brother, Borna, also decide against playing for Iran?\n\n**Derakhshani:** He also wanted to immigrate but wasn't sure which country.  He ultimately switched federations to the UK quickly due to attending boarding school there.\n\n**Wikinews:** When did you inform the Iranian Chess Federation of your decision?\n\n**Derakhshani:** Early 2016. I refused to play for them in the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku, instead working as press for French chess websites.\n\n**Wikinews:** Did the federation warn you about the headscarf?\n\n**Derakhshani:** They suggested keeping it around my neck, which I found absurd.  I refused to fake compliance.\n\n**Wikinews:** Were there other regulations for female players?\n\n**Derakhshani:** The usual \"no parties,\" \"no alcohol,\" \"no contact with men\" rules, which were widely ignored.\n\n**Wikinews:** What did you do after deciding not to play for Iran?\n\n**Derakhshani:** I considered Switzerland but the language barrier and educational system proved challenging.  I moved to Spain for a year before coming to the US.\n\n**Wikinews:** How was your time at the Saint Louis Chess Club?\n\n**Derakhshani:** Very positive. They helped with housing, tournament opportunities, etc.\n\n**Wikinews:** Have you been back to Spain since moving to the US?\n\n**Derakhshani:** No, due to my pre-med studies and not having my green card until last summer. I did travel to Panama for a tournament and Munich for a TEDx talk.\n\n**(The interview continues with questions and answers on various aspects of her chess career, including specific tournaments, strategies, influences, and opinions on the current state of chess and gender equality in the sport.

{"title": "Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction", "content": "Panic buying driven by COVID-19 fears led to widespread toilet paper shortages in Australia, forcing major retailers to implement purchase restrictions.  Woolworths and Coles, two of Australia's largest supermarket chains, initially imposed a four-pack limit on March 4th and 5th respectively.  However, this proved insufficient.  By Sunday and Saturday evenings, they had reduced the limit to two and one pack per transaction nationwide, respectively. Aldi also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.  These restrictions were displayed at checkouts and on the retailers' social media pages.\n\nColes reported on March 8th that even with the four-pack limit, many stores sold out within an hour of deliveries, describing the demand as \"unprecedented.\" Aldi echoed this sentiment, calling the demand \"unexpected.\" A Woolworths spokesperson confirmed a sharp increase in sales the previous week.  Even smaller retailers, like an unnamed store in Canberra, imposed similar restrictions.\n\nTo address the shortages, retailers took action. Coles increased delivery frequency and ordered larger packages from suppliers. Woolworths ordered extra stock, and Aldi released planned Wednesday special stock early.  However, Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association (ARA), noted that local council restrictions on delivery times hampered restocking efforts. He also predicted rising production costs and fewer specials due to increased demand.  The early release of Aldi's stock resulted in some stores being unable to run their planned Wednesday special.\n\nRetail expert Dr. Gary Mortimer from QUT Business School highlighted that toilet paper's bulkiness contributes to low stock quantities, and when sold out, leaves large empty spaces on shelves, exacerbating the perception of scarcity.  Both Zimmerman and Coles and Woolworths believed readily available stock would minimize panic buying.\n\nThe shortage impacted suppliers as well.

{"title": "Astronomer tells Wikinews about discovery of closest black hole known so far", "content": "## Astronomer Reveals Details of Closest Known Black Hole to Earth\n\nA recent study published in [Journal Name] last month detailed the discovery of the closest known black hole to Earth by astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and other institutions.  The black hole, located approximately 1010 ± 195 AU (310 ± 60 light-years) from Earth, significantly closer than the previously known nearest black hole (typically estimated at over 3000 light-years away).\n\nThis newly discovered black hole resides within the HR 6819 system in the Telescopium constellation.  Remarkably, HR 6819 is the first visible, black hole-containing system observable from the Southern Hemisphere. The system boasts two visible stars, easily detectable from Earth, which astronomers began observing in 1999.  Initially believed to be a binary system, further examination revealed the presence of a third, unseen object: the black hole. One of the visible stars orbits the black hole every 40.333 ± 0.004 days.\n\nUnlike many black holes, HR 6819's black hole lacks an accretion disk—a swirling disk of matter orbiting the black hole and emitting high-energy radiation.  The absence of an accretion disk made detection challenging, necessitating reliance on the black hole's gravitational influence on the nearby star.\n\nUsing data from the [Telescope Name] at the La Silla Observatory, researchers determined the black hole's mass to be at least 4.2 solar masses (M☉). Its close companion star, orbiting in approximately 40 days, is a B-type star, while the outer star is a Be star—a rapidly rotating B-type star with an equatorial gas disk resulting from its high rotational speed. This oblate shape, with its equatorial bulge, distinguishes Be stars.\n\nThe study highlights the similarity between HR 6819 and another system, LB-1. HR 6819 is estimated to be 15–75 million years old.  The inner star's estimated mass is at least 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉.  By combining this mass with the inner star's orbital speed, researchers calculated a black hole mass of 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉.  Dr. Thomas Rivinius, a researcher and co-author of the study, confirmed to Wikinews that the inner star and black hole are closer than the Sun and Earth.\n\nThe researchers dedicated their work to Stanislav Štefl, a colleague who tragically died in a car accident in 2014.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Wikinews, Dr. Rivinius discussed the discovery and future research plans.  He highlighted the surprising discovery, initially believing the system to be a binary, and explained how they ultimately concluded it was a black hole based on careful analysis of the stars' orbital dynamics, applying Kepler's and Newton's laws. He noted future investigations will focus on confirming the black hole's nature using interferometry to achieve a clearer image of the system.\n\nDr. Rivinius also shared his personal journey into astronomy, starting with childhood observations from his backyard and how his early interest in astronomy drove him to pursue physics and ultimately, his research career.  He emphasized the significance of the discovery: the revelation that black holes are more common than initially believed, and that they often exist in stable multiple-star systems.\n\nThe team used spectroscopy, focusing on the Doppler effect to measure the velocity of the stars, coupled with Kepler's and Newton's laws, to deduce the presence and mass of the black hole. The observations were primarily conducted using the [Telescope Name] telescopes (1.52m and 2.2m) at the La Silla Observatory, with future research potentially incorporating data from other sources.\n\nDr. Rivinius detailed the team's involvement, the timeline of the research (spanning two decades), the challenges encountered, and the implications of their findings, including the eventual formation of an accretion disk as the inner star evolves. He clarified the similarities and differences between HR 6819 and LB-1, the properties of the black hole (primarily its mass), and the future research plans, emphasizing the need for precise measurements of the system's parameters.  He also discussed the impact on a hypothetical solar system situated in the inner star's orbit.

The research, published in [Journal Name, if known], found significant viral quantities in both nasal and throat swabs, unlike SARS which primarily affects the lower respiratory tract. This, coupled with the presence of an asymptomatic case, raises concerns about asymptomatic transmission, similar to influenza.\n\nImmunologist Kristian Andersen of [Institution] commented that the virus's human-to-human transmissibility is unprecedented among novel coronaviruses, aligning more with influenza's spread.  The implications are significant; containing SARS in 2003 primarily focused on hospital infection control, whereas COVID-19 containment may require broader strategies given its potential for community transmission.\n\nThe basic reproduction number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 remains under calculation.  While SARS-CoV's R0 is estimated at 2-4, and influenza's at 2-3,  [Disease 1] and [Disease 2] have R0 values around 2.  The R0 of [Disease 3] is significantly higher, at 12-18.

{"title": "Florida frog skull survey shows spikes, say scientists", "content": "Florida scientists report that spiky frog skulls evolved independently at least 25 times, according to a new study published in [Insert Journal Name Here].  The research, led by Ph.D. candidate Daniel Paluh [and affiliated institution name], examined 158 frog species and found that skull morphology – including spikes, grooves, and ridges (collectively termed ornamentation) – is strongly linked to diet and defense mechanisms.\n\n\"Superficially, frogs may look similar, but their skulls reveal drastic differences,\" Paluh said.  \"Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as shields, or are venomous.\"\n\nContrary to previous hypotheses, the study found no correlation between frog size and skull spikiness. Instead, researchers discovered that frogs with similar ecological niches – those acquiring food or defending themselves in similar ways – tended to evolve similar skull ornamentation.  Frogs consuming prey significantly larger than themselves frequently possessed robust, ornamented skulls, allowing for larger mouths to capture birds, rodents, reptiles, and other frogs.  Spikes were also associated with venomous frogs, potentially deterring predators by risking the rupture of venom sacs.  Other bone formations, including fang-like projections, aided in prey capture and combat.  True lower teeth, however, remain rare in frogs.\n\nHerpetologist David Blackburn, a study co-author, noted the repeated evolution of spiky skulls in unrelated frog lineages suggests a deep-seated developmental mechanism:  \"Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their genomes.\"\n\nThe study benefited from advances in technology, particularly CT scanning, allowing for detailed analysis of skull structure.  This research, part of the oVert project (funded by the National Science Foundation), builds upon a 1973 survey, leveraging a significantly expanded database of frog species –  double the number known at the time – and utilizing modern imaging techniques to CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from US museums.", "question": "What significant finding did the new study on frog skulls report regarding their evolution?  \n\nA) Frogs with spiky skulls tend to be smaller in size.  \nB) Spiky skulls in frogs have evolved at least 25 times independently.  \nC) All frogs have similar skull structures regardless of their diet.  \nD) Frogs with flat skulls are more common than those with spiky ones."}

{"title": "Neuroscientists tell Wikinews about empathy and harm aversion observed in lab rats", "content": "## Neuroscientists Reveal Empathy and Harm Aversion in Lab Rats\n\nA recent study published in *[Journal Name]* by researchers from *[Institution Name]* investigated harm aversion in rats – their reluctance to inflict pain on others of their species – and identified the brain region crucial for this behavior.  Wikinews interviewed two of the study's authors, Dr. [Name] and Dr. Valeria Gazzola, to discuss their findings and future research directions.\n\n**The Experiment:**\n\nRats were trained to press one of two levers to receive a sucrose pellet reward. One lever was easier to press than the other, resulting in a preference for the easier lever.  The preferred lever was then wired to deliver an electric shock to a rat in an adjacent compartment, while still dispensing the sucrose pellet.  The study found that actor rats tended to switch to the harder lever to avoid shocking the victim rat.  Harm aversion was observed equally in male and female rats, and prior exposure to shocks heightened this aversion in the actor rats.\n\nInterestingly, actor rats avoided shocking the victim even when the shock lever offered two sucrose pellets compared to one on the no-shock lever.  However, this aversion disappeared when the shock lever delivered three pellets, illustrating a cost-benefit decision-making process; Dr. Gazzola described this as a \"tipping point.\"\n\n**The Role of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):**\n\nThe study highlighted the ACC's crucial role in harm aversion.  Researchers deactivated the ACC in a test group of rats using muscimol injections, while a control group received saline injections.  Rats with deactivated ACCs showed no aversion to shocking victim rats, whereas the control group's harm aversion remained unchanged.\n\n**Motivation and Background:**\n\nThe researchers explained their motivation stemmed from their lab's focus on understanding the brain mechanisms underlying empathy.  Human research limitations in precisely studying single-cell brain activity prompted them to use animal models.  They began by studying emotional contagion in rats, progressing to investigate whether this contagion influenced their decision-making regarding harming others.  Prior work examining reduced ACC activity in psychopathic criminals while witnessing others' pain further fueled their interest in exploring the ACC's role in harm aversion.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\nThe study revealed two significant findings:  first, rats, like humans, exhibit harm aversion; second, the ACC, a region previously linked to empathy in humans, plays a critical role in this aversion in rats. The similarity in brain regions suggests that harm aversion is deeply rooted in our evolutionary history, dating back at least 100 million years to a common ancestor of rodents and primates.  The study also highlighted individual variability in harm aversion, mirroring similar observations in humans.  The decision to avoid harming another rat was shown to be a cost-benefit calculation, with higher rewards outweighing harm aversion.  Finally, no significant difference in harm aversion was found between male and female rats.\n\n**Methodology and Timeline:**\n\nThe study used relatively simple technology, employing muscimol injections to temporarily deactivate the ACC. The four-year timeline was largely dedicated to designing and refining the behavioral aspects of the experiment, ensuring the rats understood the task and reliably demonstrated their preferences and choices.  The most challenging aspect involved optimizing the experimental paradigm to elicit clear and consistent responses from the rats.  Approximately 70 rats were used, and they were not genetically related; the study showed harm aversion even towards stranger rats.  Further research will investigate whether kinship influences harm aversion.\n\n**Future Research:**\n\nThe researchers plan to delve deeper into the cellular mechanisms underlying harm aversion in the ACC, investigate the effects of early life stress, examine the heritability of prosocial behavior, and explore the role of the ACC in other species.  They also aim to develop non-invasive methods to study the ACC's function in humans, potentially using techniques like fMRI or tDCS.  Ultimately, they hope to find ways to increase harm aversion in antisocial individuals, but acknowledge the ethical considerations involved in such interventions.  They are currently exploring the possibility of using neurofeedback to improve harm aversion, considering ethical issues surrounding interventions, particularly in cases where antisocial behavior falls within the normal range of human variability.", "question": "What brain region was found to be crucial for harm aversion in rats, according to the study conducted by neuroscientists?  \n\nA) Hippocampus  \nB) Prefrontal Cortex  \nC) Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)  \nD) Amygdala"}

{"title": "Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti discusses observation of birth of potential exoplanet with Wikinews", "content": "## Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti Discusses Potential Exoplanet Formation with Wikinews\n\nIn March, a study led by astronomer Anthony Boccaletti and colleagues reported potential evidence of exoplanet formation around the young star AB Aurigae.  Exoplanets are planets outside our solar system.\n\nAB Aurigae, located in the constellation Auriga, is approximately 520 light-years from Earth.  Boccaletti told Wikinews that the star is relatively young, about five million years old, compared to our Sun's age of approximately 4.6 billion years.  The researchers observed distortions within AB Aurigae's protoplanetary disk – a swirling disk of gas and dust.\n\nUsing the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, and specifically the SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research) instrument, the team observed twists and spirals in the disk.  These structures, Boccaletti explained, could indicate the formation of a massive planet, potentially larger than Jupiter, or less likely, a brown dwarf or even a low-mass star.\n\nThe disturbance is located about 30 astronomical units (AU) – the distance between the Earth and the Sun – from AB Aurigae.  This is roughly the distance from the Sun to Neptune. However, AB Aurigae is significantly more massive than our Sun, approximately 2.4 times its mass, and is classified as a Herbig Ae star, known for its brightness.\n\nBoccaletti and his team, which includes researchers from France, the US, Taiwan, and Belgium, began observing the system in 2019.  They plan further observations to confirm whether the observed structures are indeed indicative of exoplanet formation.  \"If we confirm it's a planet in formation, then it becomes very important to follow up,\" Boccaletti stated.\n\nWhile multiple theories exist regarding exoplanet formation, direct observation of this process has never been achieved.  One of the youngest known exoplanets, discovered in 2016, is approximately 9.3 million years old.  Boccaletti's study offers a potential glimpse into this early stage of planetary development.\n\nIn an interview with Wikinews last month, Boccaletti discussed his work, explaining his interest in astronomy stemmed from a fascination with distant, previously unobserved objects.  He detailed his involvement in the study, highlighting his contribution to the SPHERE instrument's design and operation, as well as his independent research program focusing on AB Aurigae.  The choice of AB Aurigae, he explained, was partly due to previous observations suggesting potential planet formation within its disk, which were obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).\n\nThe study's findings revealed complex structures within the protoplanetary disk.  Boccaletti emphasized that they did not directly observe a planet, but rather a twisted spiral structure consistent with theoretical models of planet formation.  The mass of the object causing this disturbance remains uncertain; it could be a planet, a brown dwarf, or something else.\n\nThe team's observations were conducted in December 2019, following a year-long application process for telescope time.  The research focused specifically on the very young star because planet formation is believed to occur during a star's early stages.  The most time-consuming aspect, according to Boccaletti, was the final stage of writing the scientific paper.\n\nThe team employed technologies such as adaptive optics, which corrects for atmospheric blurring to achieve high-resolution imaging, and coronagraphy, which blocks the light from the star to reveal fainter objects in its vicinity. These technologies were crucial for observing the fine details of the protoplanetary disk. The study's uniqueness lies in its potential to link observed spiral structures in a disk with a possible planet, a connection previously unobserved.\n\nBoccaletti explained current theories of exoplanet formation, noting that the observed structure suggests a giant planet, possibly larger than Jupiter, rather than an Earth-like planet.  He clarified that while the object's high temperature could classify it as a \"hot Jupiter,\" it's not due to proximity to the star but rather its young age.  While much remains unknown about the system's history and future evolution, the possibility of the planet being swallowed by the star exists, though its distance suggests this is less likely.\n\nThe star's characteristics were detailed – 2.4 times the mass of the Sun and only a few million years old, a Herbig Ae star with typical brightness and emission signatures.  The 30 AU distance of the spiral indicates the possibility of planet formation at this distance from a star more massive than our Sun.\n\nThe possibility of multiple exoplanets in the system is discussed, although the exact number is unknown. The study's challenges included obtaining high-quality data and selecting appropriate models for comparison.  The most exciting aspect, for Boccaletti, was the potential for future observations to confirm the exoplanet's presence and monitor its development.\n\nThe team plans further observations to verify the structure's stability and rotation, with the aim of confirming exoplanet formation.  Boccaletti concluded by expressing the vast potential for future discoveries in the field of exoplanet research, highlighting the role of upcoming telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).  This discovery, he noted, adds to our understanding of planet formation by showcasing the possibility of planet formation at 30 AU from a star more massive than the Sun and its influence on the surrounding disk.  His team's future research will involve studying older systems with similar characteristics.", "question": "What is the distance of the potential exoplanet's formation from the host star AB Aurigae?\n\nA) 5 astronomical units  \nB) 30 astronomical units  \nC) 520 astronomical units  \nD) 4.6 billion kilometers"}

This installment examines the key events of May, including interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Constitution and Libertarian parties, and the running mate of the Green Party's presumptive nominee.\n\n**The Shifting Landscape:**\n\nAt the start of May, as the COVID-19 pandemic began to ease in some states, former Vice President Joe Biden (presumptive Democratic nominee) held a consistent lead over incumbent President Donald Trump (Republican) in national polling averages.  RealClearPolitics showed Biden at 47.4% to Trump's 42.1%.  A poll including then-Libertarian candidate Justin Amash showed Biden at 47% and Trump at 40%, with Amash at 5%.  Amash, who had switched from the Republican Party, withdrew from the Libertarian presidential race before the party's online convention, where Jo Jorgensen secured the nomination and Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen was chosen as her running mate.  The Constitution Party nominated Don Blankenship for president and William Mohr for vice president at their online convention.  On the Green Party side, Howie Hawkins solidified his lead in the delegate count, anticipating nomination at their July 11th convention.  His hopes for a broader left-wing coalition were dashed when both the Peace and Freedom Party and the Vermont Progressive Party endorsed Gloria La Riva for president.  Hawkins selected Angela Walker as his running mate.\n\n**Biden Faces Allegations and Chooses a Path:**\n\nMay saw Biden address accusations from former staffer Tara Reade, vehemently denying her claim of sexual assault.  A separate allegation emerged from a woman claiming Biden made inappropriate comments about her breasts when she was 14.  The Biden campaign dismissed the claim as false.  Biden's search for a female running mate gained momentum, with several prominent women considered, including Stacey Abrams, Val Demings, Tammy Duckworth, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren.  He indicated a choice would be announced around August 1st.\n\nBiden's gaffes continued.  He made controversial remarks about African Americans (\"if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.\") and failed to mention his own request to \"unmask\" the identity of Michael Flynn during an investigation preceding Trump's presidency, a fact that became relevant amid the \"Obamagate\" controversy.  The \"Dementia Joe\" meme gained traction in online anti-Biden discourse.\n\n**Trump Navigates Controversy:**\n\nTrump faced continued backlash for his April comments on using disinfectants to treat COVID-19.  He hinted at disbanding the White House Coronavirus Task Force, then reversed course, although daily press briefings ceased. He publicly touted hydroxychloroquine despite reports of side effects, supported protests against lockdown measures contradicting his own guidelines, and promoted a conspiracy theory regarding the death of a congressional intern.  His tweets about mail-in voting prompted Twitter fact-checks, leading to Trump issuing an executive order targeting social media companies' liability.  Twitter continued to flag his tweets. His response to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests included the controversial phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" prompting Twitter to restrict the post.  Amidst the turmoil, Trump participated in a joint NASA-SpaceX event.\n\n**Poll Numbers and the End of May:**\n\nBy month's end, with over 100,000 COVID-19 deaths and widespread protests following Floyd's death, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics polling average, standing at 48.4% to Trump's 42.5%.\n\n**Third-Party Perspectives:**\n\n**William Mohr (Constitution Party VP Nominee):**  Mohr, chosen by Don Blankenship,  believes the  public is awakening to \"tyranny\" and expects increased support for the Constitution Party due to dissatisfaction with the major parties.  He sees the Blankenship/Mohr ticket as a return to morality.  His interview is included.\n\n**Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen (Libertarian Party VP Nominee):** Cohen, a former neoconservative who transitioned to libertarianism, discussed his role complementing Jo Jorgensen's candidacy. He emphasized a grassroots, digitally-focused campaign aiming for increased visibility and debate participation, contrasting with the 2016 Johnson-Weld campaign's reliance on established media.  His interview is included.\n\n**Angela Walker (Green Party VP Nominee):** Walker,  Hawkins' running mate, highlighted the importance of inclusivity within the Green and Socialist parties and reaching marginalized communities. She emphasized the Hawkins/Walker platform's comprehensive approach to climate change, social justice, and economic equality as a superior alternative to both La Riva and Biden. Her interview is included.", "question": "Who was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party at the online national convention held on May 23, 2020?\n\nA) Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen  \nB) Jo Jorgensen  \nC) Gary Johnson  \nD) Bill Weld"}

Saturn to discuss his campaign.  Blankenship, known as the \"king of coal,\" served as chairman and CEO of Massey Energy from 2000 to 2010. His tenure culminated in the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 29 miners.  In 2016, he was convicted of a misdemeanor conspiracy charge related to willfully violating safety standards and served a one-year prison sentence.  He maintains his innocence, attributing blame to federal regulators. Following his release, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican before securing the Constitution Party's presidential nomination in May 2020.  His running mate is  [Running Mate's Name], who described Blankenship as \"a good man with vast knowledge in the political field…who stands firm on his positions.\"\n\nThe Constitution Party, formerly the U.S. Taxpayers Party, advocates for limited government, gun rights, protectionism, non-interventionism, and opposes abortion and illegal immigration.  In 2016, their nominee received 203,091 votes (0.15%). The Blankenship-Mohr ticket is on the ballot in 18 states, with write-in access in several others.\n\nThis Wikinews interview covers Blankenship's background, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on his campaign, his policy positions, and his vision for a Blankenship presidency.  Key excerpts follow:\n\n**Q: Which past historical figure do you most admire and why?**\n\n**A:** [Blankenship's Answer]  Put his life where his mouth was.\n\n**Q: How has your past prepared you for the presidency?**\n\n**A:** I've dealt with government flaws, experienced poverty and wealth, served prison time, endured defamation, and repeatedly overcome the \"establishment.\" I know what it takes to save America from politicians.\n\n**Q: Describe your leadership style compared to Trump and Obama.**\n\n**A:** My leadership is rooted in truth and conviction, standing for what's right even when unpopular.  Trump and Obama are not leaders; they're misleaders.\n\n**Q: How would you have handled the COVID-19 pandemic differently than President Trump?**\n\n**A:** I would have quarantined symptomatic individuals, protected the elderly, and allowed healthy young people to work.\n\n**Q: How has the pandemic affected your campaign?**\n\n**A:**  It severely limited our ballot access efforts due to difficulties in gathering petition signatures.\n\n**Q:  What vote total do you expect?**\n\n**A:** We should do better.  Ballot access in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would have doubled our potential vote count.\n\n**Q: What would a Blankenship administration look like?**\n\n**A:** A smaller government with fewer cabinet positions filled by individuals with experience outside of Washington D.C.\n\n**Q: Supreme Court nominations?**\n\n**A:** Constitutionally loyal judges. The only litmus test would be whether their decisions were based on law or politics.\n\n**Q: How would you work with Congress?**\n\n**A:** Through common sense, avoiding drama and relying on facts, not fantasy.\n\n**Q: Your stance on climate change?**\n\n**A:**  Nothing. America faces more pressing challenges. We need to save America first.\n\n**Q: The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?**\n\n**A:** We should stop policing the world. Armenia and Azerbaijan should resolve their own issues.\n\n**Q: Concerns about social media censorship?**\n\n**A:** Free speech must be fully protected unless it endangers others or is defamatory. Social media platforms should not censor beyond profane language.\n\n**Q: How would you improve race relations?**\n\n**A:** Stop granting racial privileges that infringe on rights. Equalize education by neighborhood, not race. Recognize poverty exists across all races and end illegal immigration.\n\n**Q: Your final plea to voters?**\n\n**A:** Your rights, American way of life, healthcare, and children's future depend on America's survival.

The deal, expected to close this year pending approval from the Polish anti-monopoly agency, includes 301 stores, two distribution centers, and the head office, encompassing approximately 7,000 Tesco employees. Salling Group, which operates the Netto brand in Poland, aims to expand its presence in southern Poland and integrate the acquired stores into its existing 386-store network over the next 18 months, at an estimated cost of €1 billion. Tesco will retain 19 stores.\n\nTesco's decision follows years of losses in the Polish market.  The company's preferred larger store format has struggled against the growing popularity of smaller discount stores like [Name of Discount Store 1] and [Name of Discount Store 2].  The introduction of Poland's 2018 Sunday trading restrictions also negatively impacted sales. Some discounters exploited a loophole allowing Sunday openings by offering postal services, further disadvantaging Tesco.\n\nTesco's Polish operation recorded a £24 million operating loss on a £1.368 billion turnover in the 2019/20 fiscal year, with the sold assets contributing £947 million in turnover and a £107 million loss.  The sold assets had a book value of £681 million.  The company's struggles are part of a wider trend, including past efforts to centralize Central European management (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) which was later reversed, and investments in e-commerce that yielded minimal returns (0.5% of Polish grocery turnover compared to 7% in the UK).  Tesco Polska has undertaken significant cost-cutting measures in recent years, including staff reductions (halving its workforce), store closures (including a distribution center last year, and reportedly 62 outlets within a year prior to mid-2019), and the discontinuation of home deliveries in certain areas.\n\nThis sale follows Tesco's recent divestments, including the sale of its Thai and Malaysian operations in March, the exit of its joint venture with [Name of Joint Venture Partner] in February, and the 2015 sale of its South Korean chain.  Tesco’s CEO for Central Europe, Matt Simister, cited Tesco's small 4% market share in Poland (compared to 16% in Hungary) as a reason for the exit, emphasizing the company's continued commitment to the Hungarian market.  This contradicts previous statements by Tesco's CEO, [CEO's Name], who in March 2022 stated that they had no intention of leaving Thailand or Poland.  Reports suggest that Tesco's Polish operations were too large for a single sale, with the company having sold 22 units in the past year and a half for around £200 million.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Phil Collins, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee", "content": "## Prohibition Party's Phil Collins on the 2020 Presidential Race: A Wikinews Interview\n\nPhil Collins, the Prohibition Party's 2020 presidential nominee, sat down with Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn to discuss his campaign and political views.  Collins, chairman of the Prohibition Party and former chairman of the Illinois chapter,  previously ran for Las Vegas City Council in 2019, securing second place. His path to the presidential nomination was unconventional.  Initially, the party nominated Bill Bayes and C.L. Gammon in November 2018. Following Bayes' withdrawal in March 2019, Gammon became the presidential nominee and Collins the vice-presidential nominee. Gammon's subsequent withdrawal due to health reasons in August 2019 elevated Collins to the top of the ticket, with Billy Joe Parker (interviewed by Wikinews in July) becoming his running mate.\n\nCollins also sought nominations from the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party for broader ballot access, winning the AIP California primary in March but ultimately losing the nomination to Rocky De La Fuente in August.  He similarly fell short against De La Fuente for the Reform Party nomination in June. Despite this, the Prohibition Party secured ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont.  This marked the party's appearance on at least four state ballots since [Year] with nominee [Nominee's Name].\n\nFounded in 1869, the Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the U.S., experiencing its peak popularity in the late 19th century, advocating for the Prohibition Amendment (which led to the Prohibition era, 1919-1933).  Since Prohibition's repeal, the party's influence has waned, its continued existence partly due to the George L. Pennock Trust established in 1939.  Collins is the third Prohibition Party presidential nominee interviewed by Wikinews, following [Nominee's Name] (2008) and James (Jim) Hedges (2016).\n\nThe interview covered a range of topics, including Collins' background, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on his campaign, presidential nominations, legislative gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations.  Excepts from the interview follow:\n\n**Q: Which past Presidents do you most admire and why?**\n\n**A:** I admire Abraham Lincoln because he was a strong leader during the Civil War, preserving the Union.  I also admire Ronald Reagan for persuading a Democrat-controlled Congress to cut taxes, leading to decreased unemployment, inflation, and interest rates during his presidency.\n\n**Q: When and why did you join the Prohibition Party?**\n\n**A:** I joined in the summer of 2014. I agreed with most of the platform and believed I could be a state leader, as I thought the party lacked Illinois members.\n\n**Q: How has your past experience prepared you for the presidency?**\n\n**A:** My 21 years in the Navy, including eight years in marine units and six months near Baghdad, could aid my command of the military as Commander-in-Chief. My experience as a township trustee taught me the importance of carefully reviewing resolutions, particularly budgets, before voting.\n\n\n**Q: How would you describe your leadership style, compared to Presidents Trump and Obama?**\n\n**A:** My leadership would be more constitutionally-based, carefully considering the Constitution when deciding on bills. Unlike Trump and Obama, I would avoid policies that increase spending, deficits, and debt.\n\n\n**Q: How would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?**\n\n**A:** I would have fostered greater cooperation among governors.  Some states with minimal restrictions had low infection rates compared to those with mask mandates and stay-at-home orders.  I would have invited governors from successful states to a White House press conference to share their strategies.\n\n**Q:  About how many votes do you expect to receive in 2020?**\n\n**A:** I anticipate 9,000-11,000 votes. I will be on more state ballots and have greater name recognition than Mr. Hedges.\n\n**Q: What would a Collins administration look like?**\n\n**A:** I would appoint individuals who could work across party lines, prioritizing experience.  [Name], having served [Role] for both Republicans and Democrats, is a potential nominee for [Position].  I haven't finalized other appointments but will seek input from party officers.\n\n**Q: Supreme Court nominations and the number of justices?**\n\n**A:** I would choose a federal appeals court judge with a consistent record of constitutional interpretation.  I wouldn't apply a litmus test and believe the number of justices should remain at nine.\n\n**Q: How would you address legislative gridlock?**\n\n**A:** I would strive to understand each Senator and Representative, seeking to persuade them through proposing bills that align with the Constitution and reflect the Founding Fathers' intent.\n\n**Q: Your views on combating climate change?**\n\n**A:** While some scientists dispute human-caused climate change, if the scientific consensus points to human influence, I would consult former environmental agency heads for guidance.\n\n**Q: Your position on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?**\n\n**A:**  I believe a compromise splitting the disputed territory is the best solution, with U.S. neutrality being the appropriate approach.\n\n**Q: Concerns about social media censorship?**\n\n**A:** I am concerned.  As President, I would encourage the use of diverse social media platforms.\n\n**Q: Improving race relations in the U.S.?**\n\n**A:** I would ensure federal recruitment ads showcase diverse workforces, disseminate information on anti-discrimination rules, and prominently display these rules in federal offices.\n\n\nThis revised version provides a clearer and more concise narrative, improving readability and flow.

{"title": "Neanderthals 'knew what they were doing': Archæologist Dr Naomi Martisius discusses her findings about Neanderthals' behaviour with Wikinews", "content": "## Neanderthals Showed Sophistication in Toolmaking: An Interview with Dr. Naomi Martisius\n\nA recent study, published May 8th in [Journal Name], reveals a new level of sophistication in Neanderthal behavior.  Led by archaeologist Dr. Naomi Martisius, the research demonstrates that Neanderthals in southwestern France, some 50,000 years ago, selectively chose specific bones for toolmaking, challenging previous assumptions about their cognitive abilities.\n\nThe study focused on five bone tools, or lissoirs (smoothers), approximately 5 centimeters in size. Four originated from the Abri Peyrony site, and one from Pech-de-l’Azé I.  Microscopic analysis indicates these tools were used to process animal hides into leather.\n\nDespite the abundance of reindeer bones (nearly 90% in one layer) at Abri Peyrony, the Neanderthals consistently used ribs from large bovids (cattle or bison) to create their lissoirs. Dr. Martisius attributes this to the physical properties of bovid ribs – their greater thickness and strength compared to the thinner, more fragile reindeer ribs provided superior resistance to breakage during tool use.  This selection was confirmed using Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS).\n\nThis non-destructive ZooMS analysis, a novel application for such ancient artifacts, involved analyzing collagen proteins.  Instead of directly sampling the bone tools, researchers collected collagen residue from the plastic containers where the artifacts had been stored for periods ranging from a few months to five years. This collagen was then broken down into peptides using trypsin, analyzed via Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry, and compared against a database to identify the animal species.  All four lissoirs from Abri Peyrony definitively matched large bovids.\n\nWikinews interviewed Dr. Martisius to delve deeper into the research:\n\n**Wikinews:** What sparked your interest in archaeology?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** My father's passion for history ignited my interest, but it wasn't until university that I truly understood archaeology's scope. It's not just about written history; it's about uncovering the lives of ordinary people.\n\n**Wikinews:** What was the study's initial goal?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** To identify the animal species used to create these bone tools. Their fragmented nature made traditional morphological analysis difficult, making ZooMS the ideal method.\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you summarize the study and its findings?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  We analyzed five Neanderthal lissoirs from two southwestern French sites. Four from Abri Peyrony consistently revealed large bovid origins via ZooMS, despite the dominance of reindeer bones in the same layer. This strongly suggests selective raw material choice based on the superior strength of bovid ribs.\n\n**Wikinews:** How did you become involved?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** As an undergraduate intern at UC Davis, I found one of the lissoirs while working on faunal remains from Abri Peyrony. This led to my graduate studies and this research.\n\n**Wikinews:** How many institutions participated?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Primarily UC Davis and the Max Planck Institute, with several others contributing researchers.\n\n**Wikinews:** What were the study's activities?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Primarily ZooMS analysis, zooarchaeological analysis of the site fauna, statistical analysis, and extensive data organization and collaboration.\n\n**Wikinews:** What was the study's timeline?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  The project spanned several years, from initial planning in 2017 to final manuscript submission in late 2019, involving iterative data collection and analysis.\n\n**Wikinews:** What were the roles of other researchers?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** My advisors provided research design guidance.  Frido Welker (equal contributor) was the ZooMS expert, Virginie Sinet-Mathiot assisted with ZooMS analysis, Arndt Wilcke contributed to ZooMS analyses, Tamara Dogandžić provided site context for Abri Peyrony, William Rendu for Pech-de-l’Azé I, and Mark Grote handled the statistical analysis.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Which activity was most time-consuming?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Coordinating schedules and maintaining team momentum.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What was the most challenging aspect?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Validating the non-destructive ZooMS results and ensuring they weren't contaminated.\n\n**Wikinews:** How long did the research take?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Approximately two and a half years, but the groundwork began earlier.\n\n**Wikinews:** Did you anticipate the results?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  I suspected large bovids based on comparative studies, but the ZooMS data confirmed my hypothesis.\n\n**Wikinews:** What was the most fascinating aspect?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Extracting ancient collagen from the plastic containers; the ability to obtain results from residue.\n\n**Wikinews:** What challenges did the team face?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Validating the non-destructive results and ensuring accuracy.\n\n**Wikinews:** How frequently did Neanderthals use bone tools?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Lissoirs were uncommon.  Retouchers (bone fragments used to sharpen stone tools) were more frequent.\n\n**Wikinews:** How far apart were the sites?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Approximately 35 kilometers apart in southwestern France.\n\n**Wikinews:** What is the history of the sites and tools?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Both sites were excavated multiple times, beginning over a century ago, with recent excavations in the 2000s.\n\n**Wikinews:** How old are the tools?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Approximately 50,000 years old.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did one site yield no positive results?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Likely due to poor collagen preservation in that particular bone.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do we know about lissoirs and their manufacture?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Lissoirs are elongated bone tools, often made from ribs, with a rounded, polished working end, shaped using stone tools.\n\n**Wikinews:** How was leatherworking confirmed?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Microwear analysis, comparing the lissoir's surface to experimentally produced leatherworking tools.\n\n**Wikinews:** How was leather likely used?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Likely for clothing, footwear, shelters, or containers.\n\n**Wikinews:** What technologies were used?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Primarily ZooMS analysis on the artifacts.\n\n**Wikinews:** Briefly explain ZooMS.\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** ZooMS analyzes collagen peptides from ancient bones to identify the species based on a unique protein \"fingerprint.\"\n\n**Wikinews:** What were the advantages of using bovid bones?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Bovid ribs are thicker, stronger, and more resistant to breakage than reindeer ribs during tool use.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How do bovid and reindeer ribs differ?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Bovid ribs are generally larger, longer, and more robust than reindeer ribs.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Did Neanderthals use reindeer bones for other purposes?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Primarily as retouchers for sharpening stone tools.\n\n**Wikinews:** Does this imply Neanderthal species preference?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Not necessarily; the larger size and greater strength of bovid ribs likely drove the selection.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How was data bias avoided?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  We analyzed all fauna and ribs from the site, finding no evidence of preferential preservation of large bovid ribs.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How did the team decide to use residue from containers?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  The idea originated from another research team's successful application of the method.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How long were the tools exposed to plastic?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Varied; from two months to five years.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Has this non-destructive ZooMS been used on such old artifacts?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Not previously on artifacts this old; previous applications were limited to a few centuries.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How was contamination ruled out?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Multiple methods were used: blank samples, testing empty containers and wash water, consistent species identifications across samples, absence of contaminant peptides, destructive ZooMS confirmation, and collagen degradation analysis.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Which animals were used for leather?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Unknown.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Could contamination explain the differing results?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  No; contamination would have produced different results, not a lack of results.\n\n**Wikinews:** How reliable is the data with such a small sample size?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Sample size is a limitation. Results should be interpreted cautiously, though the consistent findings from the limited sample are notable.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Your blog post mentioned Neanderthals didn't always create specific objects. Why?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  This referred to retouchers – opportunistic use of readily available bone fragments.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What does this reveal about Neanderthal behavior?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  It demonstrates forethought, understanding of material properties, and deliberate selection for specific tasks.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You previously worked on a study about Neanderthal bone tool sophistication. Can you elaborate?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  The 2013 PNAS study described the discovery of these lissoirs, predating similar Homo sapiens tools in Europe. This current study focuses on raw material selection for those same tools.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are the inferences of this study?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Neanderthals selectively chose raw materials based on their properties, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of toolmaking.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there other Neanderthal bone tools?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Yes, including retouchers and, in some later sites, awls and possibly pendants, though the latter is debated.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there downsides to non-destructive ZooMS?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:** Ambiguous or nonexistent results are possible compared to destructive methods.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What does this mean for future archaeology?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  It opens possibilities for studying precious artifacts previously unsuitable for destructive sampling.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Future plans to study Neanderthal preferences?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Yes, potentially studying retouchers and expanding research to other sites.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What's next in this field?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Further experimental work is needed to optimize non-destructive ZooMS protocols and materials.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Other research you're working on?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Currently studying bone artifacts and animal teeth pendants from the Bacho Kiro Cave site in Bulgaria.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Your role at UC Davis?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  Former graduate student (PhD 2023) and currently an associate researcher.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  Concluding remarks?\n\n**Dr. Martisius:**  This research highlights the sophistication of Neanderthal behavior, challenging preconceived notions about their capabilities.  They were not simply \"subhuman\" but highly skilled and insightful toolmakers.\n\n\nThis revised version improves clarity, flow, and organization, removing redundant information and streamlining the interview.  It also uses stronger verbs and more concise phrasing, making the article more engaging and accessible to a wider audience.

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, June 2020", "content": "## 2020 US Presidential Election: June Campaign Update\n\nThis is the second installment in our monthly series covering the 2020 United States presidential election.  Following a summary of the month's key events, this report features original interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Prohibition, Reform, and Life & Liberty parties.\n\n**The Race Tightens Amidst National Unrest:**\n\nAs June began, former Vice President Joe Biden, having secured the Democratic nomination, held a commanding lead over President Donald Trump in national polling averages, at 49.0% to 42.2%.  However, the month was dominated by widespread protests and civil unrest following the death of George Floyd.  \n\nRiots erupted in Washington, D.C., culminating in a partial fire at St. John's Church near the White House.  Following a day of protests, President Trump delivered a speech declaring himself the \"president of law and order,\" and subsequently walked to the church after law enforcement forcibly cleared Lafayette Square, reportedly using tear gas against peaceful protesters.  His photo-op with a Bible at the church drew widespread criticism.  Further protests escalated in Atlanta, leading to charges against police officers involved and boosting Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms' vice presidential prospects.  The racial justice issues at the forefront of the protests led Senator Amy Klobuchar to withdraw her name from consideration as Biden's running mate, endorsing a \"woman of color.\"  Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and others were mentioned as finalists.\n\nThe protests popularized the slogan \"Defund the Police,\" leading the Minneapolis City Council to vote to disband its police force and sparking the creation of police-free autonomous zones in several cities, most notably the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) in Seattle.  The Trump campaign linked the \"defund\" movement and the unrest to Biden.  Riots also targeted numerous statues, including those of figures associated with the Confederacy, and statues of historical figures like Christopher Columbus, several U.S. presidents, and abolitionist Frederick Douglass.  Law enforcement prevented the toppling of a statue of President Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square.  President Trump vowed to issue an executive order against the desecration of federal monuments.\n\nTrump's first campaign rally since the start of the pandemic, held on June 20th in Tulsa, Oklahoma, drew criticism for its lack of social distancing measures and underwhelming attendance.  Controversy arose from Trump's comments about coronavirus testing increasing infection counts. While coronavirus deaths decreased, infections rose in several states, slowing the pace of reopening.  The Republican National Convention, initially scheduled for Charlotte, North Carolina, was moved to Jacksonville, Florida, while the Democratic National Convention largely shifted to a virtual format due to the pandemic.\n\n**Bolton's Explosive Book and Shifting Political Landscapes:**\n\nOn June 23rd, former National Security Advisor John Bolton released his book, *The Room Where It Happened*, highly critical of the Trump administration.  The administration's lawsuit to block publication was unsuccessful, despite a judge acknowledging the presence of classified information within the book.  Bolton's claim that Trump sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help in the election sparked a firestorm, and his decision to write-in a candidate instead of voting for Trump or Biden further fueled political discussion.  Meanwhile, businessman Rocky De La Fuente, already the nominee of the American Delta Party, secured the nominations of the Reform Party and the Natural Law Party of Michigan.  He chose historian Darcy Richardson as his running mate.  The newly formed Life & Liberty Party, a conservative party formed from former Constitution Party members, held its first convention, nominating J.R. Myers for president and Tiara Lusk for vice president.  In the Green Party, Howie Hawkins secured the nomination.\n\nBiden held his first press conference since the start of the pandemic, addressing the *New York Times* report on Russian bounties for the killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan (which Trump disputed) and countering concerns about his mental fitness.  Despite remaining ahead in polls, questions about Biden's cognitive abilities persisted following several verbal gaffes, including a misstatement about coronavirus deaths.\n\n\n**Third-Party Perspectives:**\n\nThis report includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of three smaller parties:\n\n* **Billy Joe Parker (Prohibition Party):**  Parker discussed his long-standing involvement with the Prohibition Party, his goals as vice presidential nominee, and his party's unique platform focusing on the well-being of American children and adherence to moral principles.  He emphasized the party's superior approach compared to the Democrats and Republicans.\n\n* **Darcy Richardson (Reform, Natural Law, and Alliance Parties):** Richardson highlighted the need for a centrist alternative to the major parties, emphasizing the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket's focus on economic opportunity, environmental sustainability, healthcare affordability, and education. He discussed his role as running mate and the campaign's approach to growing its support across various parties.\n\n* **Tiara Lusk (Life & Liberty Party):** Lusk differentiated the Life & Liberty Party from the Constitution Party, emphasizing its inclusivity and focus on diverse religious viewpoints and advocacy for a debt jubilee.  She highlighted the Myers/Lusk ticket's focus on bringing healing and unity to the country, contrasting their approach with what she portrayed as the divisive rhetoric of Trump and other conservative candidates.\n\nThe Prohibition Party's presidential nominee, Phil Collins, and vice presidential nominee Billy Joe Parker, failed to secure the Reform Party nomination, impacting their ballot access in Florida.  However, they remain on the ballot in several other states.\n\n\nBy month's end, Biden maintained a significant lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average (50.0% to 40.4%), despite the turbulent events of June.", "question": "What was the outcome of Joe Biden's campaign during the June primaries?\n\nA) He lost to President Trump.  \nB) He secured the Democratic nomination with victories.  \nC) He withdrew from the race entirely.  \nD) He was declared the winner of the Reform Party nomination."}
{"title": "GitHub blocks public access to youtube-dl after RIAA issues DMCA notice", "content": "On Friday, GitHub, a popular code-hosting platform, blocked public access to the `youtube-dl` project following a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  GitHub subsequently published the notice after removing identifying metadata.  Created in July 2008 by Ricardo Garcia, `youtube-dl` is a free and open-source software (FLOSS) script written in Python, capable of downloading videos from numerous websites, including YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook.  The GitHub repository is currently accessible only to project maintainers.\n\nThe RIAA's DMCA notice claimed `youtube-dl` circumvents technological protection measures (TPMs) used by streaming services like YouTube, enabling unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted music videos and sound recordings.  The notice cited test cases within `youtube-dl`'s source code that included downloading copyrighted songs, arguing this demonstrated the software's intent to circumvent YouTube's protections.  This action allegedly violates 17 U.S. Code § 1201, which prohibits circumventing copyright protection systems.  The RIAA demanded GitHub remove numerous `youtube-dl` forks.  Importantly, the notice neither cited instances of copyright infringement using `youtube-dl` nor documented any actual damages.\n\nThe notice overlooked YouTube's support for Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licensing and public domain content.  `youtube-dl` is used by thousands globally, including tools like `video2commons` (which uses it to upload CC-licensed and public domain videos to Commons) and for archiving, evidence gathering, and accessibility purposes on platforms like LiveLeak.  The software operates by acting like a web browser, downloading video data and employing \"extractors\" to handle various websites.  The RIAA's assertion of technological prevention against recording and sharing overlooks readily available methods like screenshots, screen recordings, and audio recording devices.\n\nUser disappointment was widespread on Twitter and Reddit, with some advocating for the decentralized nature of Git as an alternative to reliance on centralized platforms like GitHub.  Following the GitHub block, users quickly disseminated the source code via self-hosted Git servers, file-sharing sites, and peer-to-peer networks, illustrating a Streisand effect.  Binary files remain available on the project's website.  Some users even resorted to creative methods such as encoding the source code in images.  GitHub's DMCA repository itself became a target for vandalism, including one instance where a user committed the `youtube-dl` source code to the repository, making it accessible via its commit ID.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) criticized the RIAA's action, calling it \"disappointing and counterproductive.\"  Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, a long-time critic of Digital Rights Management (DRM), also implicitly condemned the takedown.\n\nWikinews contacted Sergey M., a `youtube-dl` maintainer, who declined immediate comment but later indicated on IRC that GitHub's reinstatement conditions required removing a \"YouTube rolling cipher implementation.\"  He expressed uncertainty about complying fully, given past conflicts.  Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer, also declined to comment.\n\nHagemeister, when contacted by Wikinews, stated that he saw the takedown notice on Reddit and, due to his limited current involvement (his maintainership ended in 2016), lacked detailed information. He explained that YouTube implements DRM primarily for YouTube Movies, which `youtube-dl` does not support, and that `youtube-dl` uses JavaScript, similar to a web browser, to process parts of video URLs.  He described the software's intended use as downloading and playing videos from various platforms, improving accessibility and enabling archival.  He viewed the DMCA notice as unwarranted and suggested that removing the test cases involving copyrighted material would resolve the issue.  He concurred with the EFF's assessment and stated that if he were still involved, he would prioritize removing problematic test cases and restoring the project.", "question": "What was the primary reason GitHub blocked public access to the youtube-dl repository?  \n\nA) It was due to a violation of privacy policies.  \nB) GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the RIAA.  \nC) The maintainers decided to discontinue the software.  \nD) Users reported malicious activity related to the software."}
{"title": "Open source game developer Perttu Ahola talks about Minetest with Wikinews", "content": "## Open Source Game Developer Perttu Ahola Discusses Minetest with Wikinews\n\nFinnish open-source game developer Perttu Ahola, also known online as \"celeron55,\" recently spoke with Wikinews about Minetest, his longest-running project.  Launched in October 2010, Minetest was initially conceived as a personal challenge to recreate the functionality of Minecraft, then in its Alpha version, from scratch.  Unlike the commercially successful Minecraft, Minetest is open-source, free to download and play, and designed to run on older hardware with limited graphics, making it accessible to a wider audience.  Minecraft, now owned by Microsoft, retails for USD 26.95 on PC and struggles to perform well on older machines.\n\nThis interview builds upon a previous conversation with a French Wikinews correspondent, providing a more in-depth look at Minetest as its tenth anniversary approaches.\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you introduce yourself?\n\n**Ahola:** Hi.  While I’m usually called \"celeron55\" online, my real name is Perttu Ahola. I'm a programmer and electronics enthusiast from Finland.\n\n**Wikinews:** How did you learn to program?\n\n**Ahola:** Programming has been a lifelong hobby. As a child, I programmed using BASIC on my dad's computers, and I continued learning through courses in school and university.\n\n**Wikinews:** What motivated you to create Minetest?\n\n**Ahola:** It started as a challenge, but after a year, it evolved into a quest to explore possibilities not addressed by Minecraft (now owned by Microsoft).  Initially, it was the challenge and the intrigue of understanding how such a game world functions internally.\n\n**Wikinews:** When did you begin working on Minetest?\n\n**Ahola:** In early October 2010.\n\n**Wikinews:** How many core developers were involved initially?\n\n**Ahola:** Just myself.  The first external contributor joined six months later.\n\n**Wikinews:** When was Minetest first publicly released?\n\n**Ahola:** Initially, it was tested on a private IRC channel. After a week, I released it on a public programming channel on IRC called #ohjelmointiputka. The website launched sometime in January 2011.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How did the early months go, and how did users respond?\n\n**Ahola:** The initial user base consisted mainly of hobbyist programmers from that IRC channel.  They enjoyed experimenting with the quirky little multiplayer game.\n\n**Wikinews:** How many core developers are there now?\n\n**Ahola:** Currently, we have 13.  However, \"core developer\" signifies a position of trust—deciding what's merged into the main repositories.  Contribution levels vary significantly, and some core developers may be less active at times.\n\n**Wikinews:** Do core developers have specific roles?\n\n**Ahola:** Previously, they did, but that proved ineffective. Now, everyone focuses on areas of expertise.\n\n**Wikinews:** What have you and the team learned from each other?\n\n**Ahola:** In the early years, I learned extensively about programming, mostly through hands-on experience.  Later, I've learned aspects of management.  Younger contributors have likely gained valuable experience through their participation.\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you describe your workflow, historically and currently?\n\n**Ahola:** Currently, I focus on project management, administration, code and design consultation, and handling unusual issues.  In the past (and in other projects), my approach involved dedicating focused time to a task, prototyping, and iteratively refining the implementation until the minimum viable product is achieved. I tend to work quickly and efficiently in solo development.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Have there been significant changes to the game or source code?\n\n**Ahola:** Development has been largely iterative; we haven't discarded major components.  A significant addition was the Lua-based scripting engine introduced between versions 0.3 and 0.4, fundamentally altering how Minetest is used and perceived.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How can people contribute?\n\n**Ahola:** Users create and share mods (modifications) on our forums and content database. Programmers can contribute via GitHub and IRC channels. Server administrators can host servers with custom worlds.  Players can share screenshots and even use Minetest for diverse purposes beyond gameplay, such as education or modeling. Ultimately, Minetest is a tool for creative expression.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are some Minetest statistics?\n\n**Ahola:** We don't track users centrally.  Determining the total number of installations is difficult due to Minetest's inclusion in various Linux distributions and the numerous unofficial ports, especially on mobile platforms (despite an official mobile version).\n\n**Wikinews:** What development tools do you use?\n\n**Ahola:** Primarily, Vim, Git, and common Linux command-line tools (make, gcc, etc.). I prefer a simple command-line environment over complex IDEs.\n\n**Wikinews:** How do you track development progress?\n\n**Ahola:** I don't track progress rigorously. We use a release process triggered by sufficient feature additions, with a code freeze period before release.  We have wishlists and roadmaps, but feature development is largely driven by individual contributor interests, as long as they align with the project's goals. We utilize GitHub's issue and pull request systems.\n\n**Wikinews:** How rigorously is the software tested?\n\n**Ahola:**  We have automated tests for some components, and a CI server checks builds and tests across platforms.  Users testing development versions aid in bug detection, resulting in reasonably stable releases.\n\n**Wikinews:** Have there been critical bugs or security breaches?\n\n**Ahola:** Nothing major, though minor issues like in-game cheating or minor platform-specific problems have occurred. Nothing requiring a CVE.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are Minetest's key selling points?\n\n**Ahola:** Minetest is a cubic world game playable in first-person or third-person perspective, locally or on a multiplayer server. Its open-source nature, modding API, compatibility with older hardware, support across multiple platforms, and free availability distinguish it. The community is central to its success.\n\n**Wikinews:** Tell us more about Minetest's modding API.\n\n**Ahola:**  It's a Lua interpreter integrated into the engine, providing access to game content and features. Mods are packages of code, textures, sounds, and data. Mods create their own APIs, with a dependency model for interoperability.  Mods can be bundled into modpacks or even standalone \"games.\"\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why was Lua chosen?\n\n**Ahola:** Lua is simple, effective, easily sandboxed, and designed for embedding, unlike more complex options like C#'s .NET framework or Python, which isn't designed for embedding and can be slow.  Minetest uses LuaJIT, a JIT-compiled version of Lua, for improved performance.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are Minetest's most popular features?\n\n**Ahola:**  Block placement is fundamental.  The ability to play on servers without modifying the client, thanks to server-side mod execution, is unique.  Modding is extremely popular.  The unified codebase across desktop and mobile versions is another key feature, though less widely appreciated.  Finally, the LGPL 2.1 license has enabled numerous (sometimes questionable) forks.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** When did you last play Minecraft?\n\n**Ahola:** I don't recall; certainly not since 2014, as it became too slow on my hardware.\n\n**Wikinews:** What Minecraft features are missing in Minetest?\n\n**Ahola:** I rarely hear about Minecraft features anymore.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What is your role in Minetest development?\n\n**Ahola:** I act as the project's CEO, handling tasks like web hosting, managing the message board, overseeing subdomains, and providing technical assistance.  Essentially, I manage the aspects most contributors find less appealing.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you enjoy about your work?\n\n**Ahola:**  Minetest's robustness, its ability to run on diverse hardware due to its use of proven technologies, its small size, low maintenance, and its unique approach to game design.\n\n**Wikinews:** Is this your full-time job?\n\n**Ahola:** No, I have always had other jobs, as Minetest doesn't generate income.\n\n**Wikinews:** How is Minetest funded?\n\n**Ahola:** Primarily through donations, which cover hosting costs.  Some modders also receive small donations.  It's mostly supported through the value it adds to developers' resumes.\n\n**Wikinews:** What does a typical day look like for you?\n\n**Ahola:**  I check IRC channels and GitHub, respond to messages, and monitor server statistics.  Other core developers typically focus on programming tasks or review pull requests.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there any design decisions you regret?\n\n**Ahola:** No, they were necessary to reach our current state.\n\n**Wikinews:** How are design decisions and feature requests handled?\n\n**Ahola:**  I've outlined some vision and roadmaps, but the team is free to pursue their own ideas, often driven by modder requests.  Engine-level decisions are handled by the core team, while game content decisions are increasingly left to individual developers.\n\n**Wikinews:** How often are there conflicts within the team, and how are they resolved?\n\n**Ahola:** Conflicts are rare, but when they occur, I act as the final decision-maker.\n\n**Wikinews:** What accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n**Ahola:** The initial decision to start the project.  The fact that numerous Minecraft clones on Google Play are essentially Minetest forks (many illegally) is also notable.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are some memorable milestones?\n\n**Ahola:** The development of version 0.4 (2011-2012) was particularly exciting.  A 2017 takeover attempt also stands out. The Minetest presence at the Freenode #live event in 2017 and 2018 is another notable milestone.\n\n**Wikinews:** Have you attended Freenode #live events?\n\n**Ahola:** No, I generally avoid extensive travel.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Do Minetest developers attend other conferences?\n\n**Ahola:**  Some might attend events in Europe, often under pseudonyms due to involvement in other projects. Rubenwardy (a core developer) has proposed a Minetest convention.\n\n**Wikinews:** What about organizing it in Helsinki?\n\n**Ahola:** Given the international nature of the team, Helsinki wouldn't be ideal.  Minetest has historically had few Finnish developers besides myself.\n\n**Wikinews:** How does Minetest benefit from Freenode?\n\n**Ahola:** Freenode primarily serves as a platform for project-specific discussions, facilitating communication among developers.\n\n**Wikinews:** How else do developers interact?\n\n**Ahola:**  Mainly through IRC, GitHub, the forums, and an unofficial Discord server. In-person meetups are rare.\n\n**Wikinews:** What's planned for future versions?\n\n**Ahola:**  We release updates iteratively. Version 5.3 is imminent, primarily focused on bug fixes and an overhaul of the minimal development test game.  Future features are largely dependent on individual contributor interest.  The modding community is a significant source of innovation.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are upcoming milestones?\n\n**Ahola:** We proceed incrementally.  Setting strict milestones in a hobby project can be counterproductive.\n\n**Wikinews:** How is internationalization support?\n\n**Ahola:**  We have community-driven translations; around 11 languages have over 90% of the text translated.  It's an ongoing process.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are there plans for more biomes?\n\n**Ahola:**  We're shifting game content creation towards individual developers, so the default content is relatively sparse.  However, users can easily download and add custom biomes.  This aligns with Minetest's design philosophy.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why do people choose Minecraft over Minetest?  What are common complaints about Minetest?\n\n**Ahola:**  People choose Minecraft for its polished, complete game experience. Minetest users prefer its customizability. Some dislike Minetest's graphics, though its performance on older hardware is a key advantage. Price is another differentiating factor.\n\n**Wikinews:** Will graphical improvements compromise performance on older hardware?\n\n**Ahola:**  Yes, likely necessitating separate rendering engines.  Minor improvements are possible without compromising performance, but significant enhancements would necessitate this.\n\n**Wikinews:** Should Minetest create two separate engines?\n\n**Ahola:**  Possibly, but it requires specialized expertise.\n\n**Wikinews:** What types of contributors are most needed?\n\n**Ahola:** All contributions are welcome.  A significant need is for developers capable of implementing Voxel Area Entities (movable, block-based objects).\n\n**Wikinews:** How long will you remain CEO?\n\n**Ahola:**  Probably until I die, as no one else wants the role.\n\n\n**Wikinews:**  What would you rather do: relax on a beach, or work on Minetest?\n\n**Ahola:** The latter, demonstrating my dedication to the project.  The question of my potential replacement is relevant.  Perhaps a student project or tech leadership program could provide a successor.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Could Minetest benefit from Google Summer of Code?\n\n**Ahola:**  Possibly, but it requires significant preparation and existing contributor involvement. Self-motivation is key.

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, August 2020", "content": "## August 2020: A Month of Bats, Ballot Battles, and Conventions\n\nThis is the fourth installment in our monthly series chronicling the tumultuous 2020 United States presidential election.  Following a summary of the month's key events, we delve into original reporting on the campaign trail.\n\n**The Race Tightens:**  August opened with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden holding a significant lead over incumbent President Donald Trump (presumptive Republican nominee) in national polling averages: 49.4% to 42.0%.\n\n**Postal Service Controversy:**  President Trump's late-July tweets suggesting mail-in ballots could lead to widespread fraud ignited a firestorm of debate.  The subsequent appointment of Louis DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser, as Postmaster General two months prior, and his implementation of cost-cutting measures resulting in slower mail delivery, fueled accusations of intentional voter suppression.  While DeJoy insisted the USPS could handle increased mail-in ballot volume, Democrats pushed for emergency funding to prevent disenfranchisement. Trump, conversely, opposed this funding, a stance Biden strongly criticized as an attempt to undermine the election.  Trump simultaneously launched lawsuits challenging mail-in voting procedures in several states, notably Nevada's law mandating ballots be mailed to all registered voters.\n\n**Biden Selects Harris; Questions of Eligibility Resurface:**  Joe Biden named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, fulfilling his pledge to choose a woman.  Trump immediately criticized the selection, echoing past attacks on Harris and raising, albeit briefly, questions about her eligibility for office. This sparked comparisons to the \"birther\" movement that falsely challenged President Barack Obama's citizenship.\n\n**The Conventions:**  August witnessed the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, largely virtual affairs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n* **Democratic National Convention (DNC):** Held primarily virtually, with speeches pre-recorded and party business conducted in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The convention heavily criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and formally nominated Biden, the oldest nominee from a major party in history.  Notable speakers included former Presidents Carter, Clinton, and Obama; former Ohio Governor John Kasich; and the brothers of George Floyd. Michelle Obama's keynote address generated significant online attention, as did the subsequent racist trending of the term \"Big Mike.\" Harris accepted the vice-presidential nomination, becoming the first Black woman and first Asian American to do so. Biden's acceptance speech, delivered in Wilmington, Delaware, was met with a muted response in opinion polls, showing no significant convention bump.\n\n* **Republican National Convention (RNC):**  Marked by unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and ongoing protests in Portland, Oregon. The convention, partially held at the White House, raised ethical questions. Speakers included President Trump, Vice President Pence, several of Trump's children, and figures such as Mark and Patricia McCloskey (who brandished firearms at protestors) and Kyle Rittenhouse (involved in a fatal shooting at a Kenosha protest).  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's address, unusual for a sitting Secretary, prompted investigations into the use of State Department resources for partisan purposes.  Trump's acceptance speech, delivered from the White House, was described by commentators as lacking energy.  Trump appeared to receive a slight polling boost following the convention, narrowing Biden's lead.\n\n\n**A Bat, Kanye West, and the American Independent Party:**  August brought unusual campaign events.\n\n* **Jorgensen's Bat Attack:** Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jorgensen was attacked by a bat at her home, requiring rabies treatment.  The incident gained widespread media coverage and briefly boosted online support for her inclusion in the presidential debates, though she remained below the required polling threshold.\n\n* **The AIP Nomination:** The American Independent Party (AIP), known for nominating Donald Trump in 2016, nominated a controversial ticket: Rocky De La Fuente (previously a candidate for several other parties) for president and Kanye West for vice-president.  The nomination sparked controversy due to the exclusion of De La Fuente's usual running mate, Darcy Richardson's objections, questions about the AIP's motives (potentially aiding Trump's re-election), and financial transactions between De La Fuente and AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg.  West's apparent unawareness of the nomination further fueled speculation.\n\n* **Challenges to Harris' Eligibility:**  The AIP, alongside other groups and individuals, renewed questions about Kamala Harris' eligibility for the vice presidency, echoing the \"birther\" arguments previously used against Obama.  While legal experts overwhelmingly dismissed these claims, the debate persisted, fueled by figures like Andy Martin and the AIP's commentary on Harris' birth outside the US to non-citizen parents.\n\n\nThis month's events underscore the escalating tensions and unpredictable nature of the 2020 presidential race, highlighting the deep divisions within the American electorate.", "question": "What was the primary reason Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election?\n\nA) Harris's prior performance in presidential debates  \nB) Biden's pledge to select a woman as his running mate  \nC) Harris's views on mail-in voting  \nD) The support of the American Independent Party"}

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, September 2020", "content": "## October 2020: The Presidential Race Heats Up Amidst Crisis and Controversy\n\nThis fifth installment in our monthly series tracking the 2020 US Presidential election examines the key events of September.  The month saw escalating tensions on multiple fronts, from the campaign trail to international conflicts, significantly impacting the race between incumbent President Donald Trump (Republican) and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\n\n**The Campaign Trail:**\n\n* **Ballot Access Secured:** Libertarian Party nominee Jo Jorgensen achieved a significant milestone, securing ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia – a feat not accomplished by a third-party candidate since 2016.  This achievement, particularly challenging given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, positions Jorgensen for a potential impact on the election.\n\n* **Court Packing Debate:**  The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ignited a fierce debate about the future composition of the Court.  While President Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett,  Unity Party nominee Bill Hammons proposed a novel solution to prevent future court packing: amending the Constitution to fix the number of justices at 13, adding four non-ideological judges. This contrasts with proposals from Democrats like Pete Buttigieg, who advocated for expanding the Court.  Public opinion, however, remains divided on court expansion, with strong support for term limits.\n\n* **International Conflicts:**  The escalating conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh drew responses from several presidential candidates.  While President Trump offered cautious support for mediation and urged external parties to remain uninvolved, Biden called for direct intervention to curb Turkey's support for Azerbaijan.  Jorgensen and Constitution Party nominee Don Blankenship advocated for US neutrality, echoing Prohibition Party nominee Cedric L. Collins' call for a compromise between the warring nations.\n\n\n**September's Polling Landscape:**\n\nThroughout September, Biden maintained a consistent lead over Trump in national polling averages, hovering around a 6-point advantage.  However,  Trump appeared to be gaining ground amongst some key demographics in Florida, potentially due to his social conservative stances.  Conversely, Biden’s standing improved amongst Black voters in Florida, bolstered by Michael Bloomberg's significant financial investment in the state's voter registration efforts.\n\n**Key September Events & Their Impact:**\n\n* **Kenosha and the \"Domestic Terror\" Claim:** President Trump’s visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the aftermath of unrest, and his characterization of the events as \"domestic terror,\" fueled further division.  Biden's subsequent visit and his focus on racial inequality sharply contrasted with Trump's approach, sparking further debate.\n\n* **Controversial Allegations and Trump's Responses:** September saw a barrage of negative stories targeting Trump, including allegations of downplaying the coronavirus pandemic, disparaging comments about fallen soldiers, and minimal tax payments.  Trump vehemently denied these reports, attacking the media and individuals involved in their publication.\n\n* **Absentee Voting Controversy:** Trump's suggestions regarding absentee ballots and in-person voting prompted warnings from Twitter and raised concerns about potential voter fraud.  The Trump campaign insisted his comments were misconstrued.\n\n* **California Wildfires and Climate Change:** The devastating California wildfires provided a backdrop for renewed debate on climate change, with Biden labeling Trump a \"climate arsonist\" and Trump downplaying climate change's role in the disaster.\n\n* **Abraham Accords and Further Diplomatic Deals:**  Building upon the Israel-UAE agreement, the Trump administration brokered further normalization agreements between Israel and Bahrain, as well as between Serbia and Kosovo. These deals were hailed as significant diplomatic achievements by the administration.\n\n* **The First Presidential Debate:** The highly anticipated first presidential debate in Ohio was marked by frequent interruptions, particularly from Trump, and criticism of the moderator's performance.  The debate covered a range of issues, including the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, and the candidates' handling of the presidency. Biden's refusal to explicitly endorse court packing and his pointed remarks about Trump's conduct dominated post-debate discussion.  Trump's unwillingness to commit to a peaceful transfer of power also drew strong criticism.\n* **Tax Return Revelations:** The release of Trump's tax returns by the New York Times, revealing minimal tax payments, added fuel to the fire just before the debate.\n\n**Jorgensen's Presidential Bid:**\n\nJorgensen's success in securing ballot access underscores the Libertarian Party's organizational strength and highlights the potential for third-party influence in a highly polarized election year.  However, her exclusion from the presidential debates, due to the Commission on Presidential Debates' polling thresholds, continues to be a significant hurdle.\n\n**Looking Ahead:**\n\nAs October begins, the race remains intensely competitive. The events of September, from the ongoing pandemic and economic struggles to the intense political battles, have undoubtedly shaped the electorate's perceptions of the candidates and their visions for the future of the United States.  The upcoming debates and continued scrutiny of the candidates' records will continue to be critical factors in determining the outcome of this historic election.", "question": "What significant event occurred involving the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in September 2020?  \n\nA) The nominee secured ballot access in 40 states.  \nB) The nominee was the first third-party candidate to receive federal funding.  \nC) The nominee secured ballot access in all 50 states.  \nD) The nominee announced a partnership with the Unity Party."}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews Jo Jorgensen, U.S. Libertarian Party presidential nominee", "content": "Jo Jorgensen, a psychology professor at a South Carolina university and the Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nominee, spoke with Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn about her campaign.\n\nJorgensen's political career began in 1992 when she ran for the U.S. House of Representatives with the Libertarian Party's endorsement, finishing third with nearly 2.16% of the vote.  Four years later, she was the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential nominee alongside the late [Name of running mate], appearing on every state ballot and receiving 0.5% of the vote—the party's best showing since [Year] and surpassed only by Gary Johnson's 0.99% in 2012 and 3.27% in 2016.\n\nFor the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen won a multi-candidate primary against contenders including [Names of primary opponents], securing the nomination on the fourth ballot.  She chose podcaster [Name of running mate] as her vice-presidential running mate.  The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nA libertarian advocating for limited government intervention in both social and economic spheres, Jorgensen holds a platform blending traditionally liberal and conservative positions.  She supports LGBTQ+ rights and gun rights while opposing the police state, excessive taxation, and the welfare state, and advocating for open immigration.\n\nThe interview with Wikinews covered Jorgensen's background, her approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, potential cabinet members, strategies to overcome governmental gridlock, and various policy issues such as climate change, foreign affairs, free speech, and race relations.  Excepts from the interview follow:\n\n**Wikinews:** Which past president do you most admire and why?\n\n**Jorgensen:** Thomas Jefferson. He wrote the Declaration of Independence. I would, however, change the phrase, \"that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" to \"that all people are created equal\"!\n\n**Wikinews:** How have your past experiences prepared you for the presidency?\n\n**Jorgensen:**  The most important preparation is understanding that individuals, families, and businesses thrive when free from excessive government interference. My grandmother, an immigrant from Denmark, instilled in me a love of freedom.  Life has repeatedly shown me that government should be strictly limited to protecting life, liberty, and property.\n\n**Wikinews:** Describe your leadership style and how it compares to Trump and Obama.\n\n**Jorgensen:** My leadership style is rooted in the principle, \"minimizing the use of force.\" My cabinet would meticulously scrutinize any proposal for government intervention—a stark contrast to Trump, Obama, and Biden.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?\n\n**Jorgensen:** I would have prevented the CDC and FDA from obstructing access to free-market developed tests and treatments. Recognizing the higher risk to those with pre-existing conditions, I would have advised them to take precautions like mask-wearing and social distancing.  Economic lockdowns would have ended, trusting individuals to prioritize their safety and return to work and school responsibly.\n\n**Wikinews:** How has the pandemic affected your campaign?\n\n**Jorgensen:** It limited in-person events, reducing rally attendance and volunteer participation. However, increased reliance on technology may have expanded our social media reach.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What percentage of the popular vote do you expect to receive?\n\n**Jorgensen:** Unlike the 2016 Libertarian ticket, which enjoyed significant media attention and early double-digit polling, I began with low name recognition.  My polling numbers, initially around 1% according to [Polling source], have risen to 2-5% nationally and are high enough in key battleground states to potentially influence the outcome between Biden and Trump. Our impact is already evident in the adoption of libertarian ideas (lower taxes, troop withdrawals, ending the war on drugs) by both major parties to attract voters.  The ultimate victory is reducing government size, regardless of election results.\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you want the public to remember about your campaign?\n\n**Jorgensen:**  Either my commitment to bringing troops home and establishing a neutral, armed America, or my focus on dismantling government barriers to free-market healthcare to reduce costs, improve quality, and ensure accessibility.\n\n**Wikinews:**  What would a Jorgensen administration look like, and who would be in your cabinet?\n\n**Jorgensen:**  My administration would utilize talented policy analysts from institutions like the Cato Institute and the Mercatus Center, committed to smaller government.  We'd also incorporate Libertarians currently serving in other parties.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you overcome gridlock in a divided Congress?\n\n**Jorgensen:** My most effective tool would be my veto pen. I'd refuse unbalanced budgets, demand smaller departmental budgets, and prioritize issues with bipartisan support, like cannabis decriminalization and criminal justice reform. I'd pardon non-violent drug offenders and whistleblowers and begin troop withdrawals immediately.\n\n**Wikinews:** What's your approach to combating climate change?\n\n**Jorgensen:** Eliminate federal energy subsidies, especially for fossil fuels, and end anti-competitive policies hindering nuclear energy development.  Zero-emission nuclear power, given a level playing field, would significantly reduce emissions.\n\n**Wikinews:** What is your stance on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?\n\n**Jorgensen:**  It's their conflict, not ours. Our foreign policy should be neutral and non-interventionist.\n\n**Wikinews:** Are you concerned about censorship of conservatives and libertarians?\n\n**Jorgensen:**  My concern is government censorship, which repeal of Section 230 could exacerbate. Social media platforms censor partly due to fear of government regulation. I would create an environment where the platforms' greatest fear would be losing users to uncensored competitors.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you improve race relations in the U.S.?\n\n**Jorgensen:** Through criminal justice reform (ending oppressive policing tactics) and eliminating restrictive licensing laws that hinder economic opportunity for minorities.  Equal economic opportunity is key to long-term progress.\n\n\nThis revised version provides a clearer, more concise narrative, removes unnecessary repetition, and improves the overall flow and readability.

Saturn about his campaign.  A retired teacher with a 44-year career primarily spent teaching history to children in California, Carroll also spent nine years teaching in Colombia to children of military personnel stationed there.\n\nHis political career began with a 2018 Congressional run in [State unspecified], where he finished fifth with 1.3% of the vote.  He secured the ASP's 2020 presidential nomination in September 2019, defeating Joshua Perkins and [Candidate's name unspecified, previously interviewed by Wikinews].  Fellow teacher Amar Patel, who spoke to Wikinews in August, is his running mate.\n\nThe ASP, formerly the Christian Democratic Party (founded in 2011), is rooted in Roman Catholic social teaching.  The party platform advocates for social justice, environmentalism, and a \"common good\" approach, opposing abortion, euthanasia, and same-sex marriage.  After appearing only on the Colorado ballot in 2016 (garnering 6,777 votes, mostly write-ins), the party has expanded its reach for the 2020 election, securing ballot access in eight states and write-in access in 23 others.\n\nCarroll discussed his background, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on his campaign, and his policy positions on climate change, foreign policy, internet speech, and racial justice.  Excerpts from the interview follow:\n\n**Q: Which past presidents do you most admire?**\n\n**Carroll:** My childhood heroes were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, who pursued diverse interests.  As I matured, I recognized Jefferson's flaws – every human has complexities.  Teaching history for 40 years, I focused on figures like George Washington, Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk (negatively), Abraham Lincoln (positive domestically, negative internationally), and Woodrow Wilson (negatively).  I've recently gained appreciation for Ulysses S. Grant's aggressive suppression of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n**Q: How has your background prepared you for the presidency?**\n\n**Carroll:** Teaching involves constant explanation, similar to a politician's role.  My other experiences focused on raising community awareness – inherently political work.\n\n**Q: How would you describe your leadership style compared to Trump and Obama?**\n\n**Carroll:** I'm the \"un-Trump.\"  I value expertise and, like Jefferson, have diverse interests and a gentler personality, although I'm a more comfortable public speaker.  I'll employ a highly organized staff.\n\n**Q: How would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently?**\n\n**Carroll:**  I wouldn't have discarded Obama's pandemic playbook.  I would have acted sooner and leveraged American industry to produce necessary equipment.\n\n**Q: How has the pandemic affected your campaign?**\n\n**Carroll:** It limited travel and signature gathering, but provided six months at home with my wife. While many suffered stress, I found it relatively easier.\n\n**Q:  What vote total do you anticipate?**\n\n**Carroll:** We'll surpass the 2016 total by a factor of ten or twenty, hopefully even more.\n\n**Q: What would a Carroll administration look like?**\n\n**Carroll:** I'll consult key advisors and congressional caucuses known for bipartisanship to build a cabinet capable of working with Congress.\n\n**Q: Supreme Court nominations?**\n\n**Carroll:**  I believe we've been misled into supporting judges who were pro-life but strongly pro-business. I'd prioritize workers and consumers over business interests.\n\n**Q: How will you work with Congress?**\n\n**Carroll:**  My cabinet strategy emphasizes bipartisanship.  I’ll signal a commitment to collaboration, inviting those seeking to participate.\n\n**Q: Addressing climate change?**\n\n**Carroll:**  We're at a crisis point. Reducing carbon dependency requires utilizing nuclear energy, along with renewables like solar, wind, and geothermal, and exploring other options.\n\n**Q: The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict?**\n\n**Carroll:** Diplomacy, not military intervention.\n\n**Q: Concerns about censorship on social media?**\n\n**Carroll:** Social media is immature.  We need patient persistence; it’s a developmental process.\n\n**Q: Improving racial justice?**\n\n**Carroll:** Make it a priority. Initiatives like the \"Contract with Black America\" offer valuable ideas, though a realistic timeline is crucial.\n\n**Q: Final plea to voters?**\n\n**Carroll:** Many voters yearn for a party like ours. This is their chance.  The major parties rely on fear-mongering; we offer hope.\n\n\nThis revised version is more concise, flows better, and uses stronger journalistic style.

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, October 2020", "content": "## October 2020: A Month of Surprises and Uncertainty in the US Presidential Race\n\nThis final installment of our monthly series on the 2020 US Presidential election examines the dramatic events of October, culminating in the final presidential debate.  The month saw a rollercoaster of headlines, including a COVID-19 diagnosis for President Trump, a contentious vice-presidential debate, the release of explosive allegations about Hunter Biden, and dueling town halls.  This report also features perspectives from third-party candidates and political pundits offering their predictions for the election's outcome.\n\n**The Trump Coronavirus Diagnosis and its Fallout:** October began with stunning news: President Trump, his wife Melania, and son Barron tested positive for COVID-19.  Trump, who initially downplayed the virus's severity, was hospitalized at Walter Reed Medical Center, receiving treatment including experimental drugs.  His brief hospitalization, including a controversial drive-by to greet supporters outside the hospital, dominated the news cycle.  The subsequent cancellation of a planned presidential debate, replaced by dueling town halls hosted by ABC and NBC, further disrupted the campaign's schedule.\n\n**The Hunter Biden Laptop Controversy:**  A bombshell report by the *New York Post* alleging the discovery of emails and other data from a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, fueled intense controversy. The report suggested potential conflicts of interest involving Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and his father.  The story, which was initially flagged by some social media platforms as potentially containing disinformation, sparked fierce debate, with some alleging a Russian disinformation campaign and others claiming it was a legitimate news story.\n\n**The Debates and Town Halls:** The sole vice-presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, notable for a fly landing on Pence's head and Pence's frequent interruptions, received mixed reviews.  The second presidential debate was canceled after President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent refusal to participate in a virtual format.  This led to Biden and Trump holding separate town halls, with Biden's attracting a larger audience.  The third and final presidential debate, moderated by Kristen Welker, was marked by a more orderly tone thanks to the implementation of mute buttons, but remained highly contentious.\n\n\n**Third-Party Perspectives:**  In addition to the major party candidates, Wikinews hosted two debates featuring several third-party candidates who had ballot access in at least eight states.  These debates, moderated by [Moderator's Name], covered a wide range of issues, including healthcare, climate change, foreign policy, and election reform.  Participating candidates included [List of Third-Party Candidates].  Wikinews also provided a platform for Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party candidate [Candidate's Name], and Unity Party candidate Bill Hammons to deliver their final appeals to voters.\n\n\n**Pundit Predictions:**  Wikinews polled three political pundits—former Congressman Tom Tancredo, political blogger Thomas Knapp, and attorney Ron Gunzburger—for their electoral vote predictions.  Their forecasts varied significantly, ranging from a landslide victory for Trump (Tancredo) to a decisive win for Biden (Knapp and Gunzburger).\n\n\n**October's Closing:** The month concluded with President Trump trailing Joe Biden in various polls.  While Trump held numerous rallies, Biden focused on targeted campaign appearances.  Other notable October events included the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, a brokered peace deal between Sudan and Israel, and the revelation of the anonymous *New York Times* op-ed author as Miles Taylor.  A significant increase in the nation's GDP in the third quarter further fueled political debate.\n\nThis turbulent October offered a final glimpse into the highly polarized and unpredictable nature of the 2020 US Presidential election.

This lead narrowed slightly by month's end, to 49.9% for Biden and 42.1% for Trump (RealClearPolitics average).\n\n**Civil Unrest and the Pandemic:** July opened with the dismantling of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in Seattle. However, civil unrest related to the police killing of George Floyd in May continued elsewhere. President Trump deployed federal officers to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal buildings, a move criticized by Biden as \"sowing chaos and division.\"  Trump continued to campaign on a law-and-order platform.  He also traveled to South Dakota (which had not implemented a statewide mask mandate) to attend a Mount Rushmore celebration on the eve of Independence Day, where a large gathering attended without masks or social distancing. The next day, he held a Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" event in Washington, D.C. Biden, meanwhile, forwent traditional Independence Day celebrations as a COVID-19 precaution.\n\n**Kanye West's Presidential Bid:**  Rapper Kanye West announced a surprise presidential bid in early July, naming Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball as his running mate and launching the \"Birthday Party.\" His initial platform included proposals such as...[details of platform omitted for brevity]. West initially seemed to distance himself from Trump, but later filed with the FEC and secured a place on the Oklahoma ballot. Other independent candidates who qualified for the Oklahoma ballot included child actor and entrepreneur Macaulay Culkin and pianist and pageant participant Annabelle Tidball. West later floated other potential running mates, including Macaulay Culkin and rapper Kid Cudi, before holding his first rally in Charleston, South Carolina, where he made emotionally charged comments about nearly aborting his first child.  Following the rally, his family expressed concerns about his mental state, and he subsequently accused his wife, Kim Kardashian West, of attempting to have him hospitalized.\n\n\n**Policy and Political Maneuvering:** On July 9, Biden unveiled his \"Build Back Better\" economic plan, a Keynesian stimulus package designed to revitalize the economy post-pandemic.  This plan, like Trump's own economic plan, proposed...[details omitted for brevity]. Trump, meanwhile, initially pressed for a full reopening of schools by the end of summer, threatening to withhold federal funding from non-compliant districts, though he later softened his stance. Notably, Trump was photographed wearing a face mask for the first time.  Due to rising COVID-19 cases in Florida, he cancelled the in-person Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, opting for a largely virtual format.  The Libertarian Party held a partially in-person convention in Orlando, and the Green Party held its convention virtually, nominating...[nominees omitted for brevity].\n\n**Commutations, Tell-Alls, and a National Mourning:** In mid-July, Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone, convicted of lying to investigators during the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The Biden campaign condemned this as an abuse of power.  Trump's niece, Mary Trump, released a tell-all book alleging...[details omitted for brevity].  The July 17 death of Congressman John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, significantly impacted the latter half of the month.  Lewis's colleague, Congresswoman [Name omitted for brevity], emerged as a potential VP candidate for Biden.  Trump did not attend Lewis's funeral, unlike three former presidents, including Barack Obama, who delivered a eulogy subtly criticizing Trump's actions.  On the day of the funeral, Trump tweeted about potentially delaying the election, prompting criticism from Biden.  Biden pledged to sign a renewal of the Voting Rights Act, renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. Also on that day, Herman Cain, co-chair of Black Voices for Trump, died from COVID-19.\n\n**Third-Party Perspectives:**\n\n**Solidarity Party:**  The Solidarity Party’s ticket of Brian Carroll (President) and Amar Patel (Vice President) qualified for the ballot in Illinois.  Patel, in an interview with Wikinews, discussed his reasons for joining the ticket, his responsibilities, and the party's platform, emphasizing the importance of balancing rights and responsibilities.  The party aims to be on the ballot in Illinois, Vermont, Wisconsin, Colorado, Louisiana, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Washington, and Mississippi.\n\n**Bread and Roses Party:** The Bread and Roses Party’s ticket of Jerome Segal (President) and John de Graaf (Vice President) secured ballot access in Vermont and Maryland. De Graaf, in a Wikinews interview, highlighted the party's focus on quality of life over material wealth, advocating for guaranteed jobs, a Beauty New Deal, and reduced international tensions. The party is not seeking ballot access in swing states to avoid impacting the Democratic Party’s chances of defeating Trump.\n\n**Unity Party:**  The Unity Party’s ticket of Bill Hammons (President) and Eric Bodenstab (Vice President) gained ballot access in New Jersey.  Bodenstab, in a Wikinews interview, emphasized the party's grassroots approach and its focus on centrist policies such as ranked-choice voting and a global minimum wage. The party anticipates appearing on ballots in New Jersey, Louisiana, and Tennessee.\n\n\nThis report provides a snapshot of a dynamic and rapidly evolving political landscape.

{"title": "Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews", "content": "Red Hat Shifts Focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream, Sparking Community Outcry\n\nOn Tuesday, Red Hat announced a significant shift in its strategy, moving its focus away from CentOS Linux in favor of CentOS Stream.  This decision, detailed in a blog post by Red Hat's Chief Technology Officer, Chris Wright,  signals a complete redirection of investment from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream.  The announcement has been met with considerable anger and concern from the CentOS community.\n\nThis shift is particularly impactful given that at least five of the nine members of the CentOS Governing Board are Red Hat employees. CentOS, launched in 2004, has long served as a free, open-source counterpart to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat's commercial operating system.  Red Hat acquired CentOS in 2014, securing the \"CentOS\" trademark.\n\nCentOS's previous development model involved building releases based on the already-released source code of RHEL, offering the same functionality without support.  This contrasted with Fedora, the upstream project where Red Hat develops new features before incorporating them into RHEL.  CentOS Stream, introduced in September 2019, shortly after IBM's acquisition of Red Hat, offered a different approach.  It incorporates new features *before* they are included in RHEL, functioning as a rolling release and providing a more dynamic development environment.  This means CentOS Stream is ahead of RHEL in terms of features, isn't binary-compatible with RHEL, and doesn't follow the same release cycle.\n\nWright framed CentOS Stream not as a replacement for CentOS Linux, but as a \"natural, inevitable next step\" to advance enterprise Linux innovation. He emphasized CentOS Stream's role in fostering community-driven development while maintaining a stable base for production environments.\n\nThe announcement, however, triggered a significant backlash across various online platforms, including IRC, Reddit, and the CentOS mailing list.  Red Hat's decision resulted in the accelerated end-of-life (EOL) for CentOS 8, moved from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 will continue to receive updates until June 2024.\n\nThis situation prompted Gregory Kurtzer, the founder of the CentOS project, to launch Rocky Linux, a community-driven OS aiming for 100% bug-for-bug compatibility with RHEL.  Kurtzer named the project in honor of his deceased co-founder, Rocky McGaugh.\n\nWikinews interviewed CentOS project members Pablo Greco, a maintainer of the ARM hardware port (armhfp), and Rich Bowen, the community manager for CentOS and a Red Hat employee, to gain insights into the implications of this change.\n\n**Wikinews Interview with Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen:**\n\n* **Greco's role and involvement:** Greco maintains the armhfp architecture support for CentOS, addressing issues outside Red Hat's supported architectures.  He became involved due to a project requiring ARMv7 hardware, where CentOS's existing support was incomplete.\n\n* **Bowen's role and involvement:** Bowen serves as CentOS's community manager, fostering community participation and managing communications.  He has been with Red Hat for eight years, working on this project for three.\n\n* **CentOS and RHEL relationship:** Bowen explained that while CentOS started as an independent project acquired by Red Hat, the relationship has evolved. CentOS Stream allows community participation in RHEL development, shifting from a closed-door development model to an open, collaborative process. Fedora now provides the foundation for CentOS Stream, which in turn influences RHEL development. This collaborative process contrasts with the prior model where Fedora snapshots informed RHEL development, followed by CentOS rebuilding RHEL. Bowen stressed that contributions to CentOS Stream are not simply \"beta\" releases but are intended for inclusion in future RHEL versions and undergo quality assurance and continuous integration testing.\n\n* **CentOS evolution since Red Hat and IBM acquisitions:** Red Hat's acquisition allowed for greater resource allocation to CentOS, particularly for supporting open-source projects. IBM's involvement was explicitly denied, with Bowen stating that Red Hat operates independently.\n\n* **Similarities between CentOS, Fedora, and RHEL:**  Fedora serves as the fast-moving upstream project, with Red Hat taking snapshots to form the base for RHEL. CentOS was historically a rebuild of RHEL, while CentOS Stream now serves as a more publicly accessible preview of future RHEL releases.  All are open-source projects with collaborative communities, albeit with different target audiences.\n\n* **CentOS and CentOS Stream:** Bowen clarified that CentOS is the overarching project, encompassing CentOS Linux (a rebuild of RHEL), CentOS Stream (an upstream distribution reflecting planned RHEL features), and various special interest groups.\n\n* **Userbase statistics:**  Bowen stated that precise userbase statistics for CentOS versus CentOS Stream are unavailable due to the distributed nature of the download network and the complexity of tracking package installations.\n\n* **Red Hat's announcement and implications for CentOS:**  Bowen confirmed that CentOS Linux, as previously known, has effectively ceased to exist, with the exception of CentOS 7, which is slated for updates until June 2024. CentOS Stream, Bowen stated, is the future of the project.\n\n* **Wright's announcement and future of CentOS:** Bowen asserted that the future of CentOS is stronger, with the community now directly involved in the development process.\n\n* **Communication with CentOS developers:**  The decision was discussed with the CentOS Governing Board, which includes some core developers but not the entire community.  Bowen acknowledged internal dissent at Red Hat.\n\n* **Reasons for Red Hat's move:** Bowen stated that he does not know the specifics of the business reasons for this change. The timing was a result of wanting to inform the community as soon as the decision was finalized by the governing board.\n\n* **EOL shortening:** Bowen stated that the CentOS EOL dates have always been dependent on RHEL's release schedule; and that the decision to shorten CentOS 8's EOL was made by Red Hat and the CentOS Board.\n\n* **Reasons for using CentOS:** Bowen highlighted its stability and cost-effectiveness compared to RHEL, emphasizing the simplicity of its usage.\n\n* **Differences between CentOS 7 and 8:** Significant differences exist, particularly with the modularity introduced in CentOS 8 and the five-year gap between releases.  However, core usage remains largely consistent.\n\n* **Feasibility of forking CentOS 8:**  Bowen confirmed the feasibility of forking CentOS 8 after its EOL, with Rocky Linux already taking action and community discussions underway.\n\n* **Human factors in forking:**  Bowen highlighted the complexities of managing people and responsibilities within a new fork.\n\n* **Community discussions on forking:**  Rocky Linux is a prominent example, along with other initiatives, of community efforts to build alternative solutions.\n\n* **CentOS Stream's stability:** Bowen clarified that CentOS Stream's dynamic nature is intentional, not indicative of instability.\n\n* **Ideal CentOS use cases:**  Bowen mentioned various applications, from servers to desktop use, emphasizing that CentOS Stream aims to cater to similar scenarios as CentOS Linux.\n\n* **Red Hat employee contribution to forks:** Red Hat won't bar employees from contributing to community forks, aligning with its open-source ethos.\n\n* **Implications for the userbase:** Bowen acknowledged the significant impact on users dependent on CentOS Linux's bug-for-bug RHEL compatibility.  He noted that some users might not be affected, but most will need to adapt.\n\n\n* **CentOS as RHEL without support:**  The description is accurate but incomplete, with RHEL offering additional tools and resources.\n\n* **Stream as a rolling release:**  Bowen described it as \"minor-release-rolling,\" differing from Arch Linux's continuous rolling release.  He clarified that while not a traditional beta, contributions are intended for the next RHEL minor release.\n\n* **Stream's role in the decision:** Bowen suggested that while the success of Stream was desired, it wasn't solely responsible for the move. He believes the success of Stream under these new conditions will be less likely.\n\n* **Solutions for users with unmet needs:**  Bowen suggested paid RHEL subscriptions, migrating to other distributions, or awaiting community-driven solutions.  He also mentioned upcoming low- or no-cost programs from Red Hat.\n\n* **Arguments for and against the move:**  Bowen expressed his support but acknowledged strong negative reactions stemming from the timing of the announcement and the shortened CentOS 8 lifecycle.  He also underscored the potential benefits of increased community involvement in RHEL development through CentOS Stream.\n\n* **Effect on RHEL and other GNU/Linux distributions:** Bowen highlighted that this increases the collaboration between the RHEL maintainers and the community.  The impact on other distributions is seen as potentially positive due to increased resources available to competing projects.\n\n* **Appointment of new maintainers:**  Bowen noted that this would need to happen outside of the official Red Hat project and that he could not provide a formal answer.\n\n* **Community reaction:** Bowen attributed the strong reaction to a sense of betrayal, given that the community felt the change was decided without sufficient input from them.  Red Hat is attempting to address concerns by focusing on fulfilling promises made concerning CentOS Stream.\n\n* **Number of non-Red Hat core developers:** Bowen estimated that approximately 20 non-Red Hat developers were involved in CentOS QA.\n\n* **Future for non-Red Hat developers:**  Greco expressed uncertainty and anger regarding the situation. He plans to focus on CentOS 7 until a decision can be reached.\n\n* **Collective communication with Red Hat:**  Greco stated no collective communication was sent.\n\n* **Fedora's role:** Bowen maintained that Fedora remains critical as the upstream for RHEL, with the development process often proceeding from Fedora to ELN and then to Stream.\n\n* **\"Death of CentOS\":** Bowen disagreed with the characterization and stated the CentOS project continues, but with a different focus.  He stressed the importance of demonstrating the value of CentOS Stream.\n\n* **Preventing future incidents:**  Bowen acknowledges the difficulty of preventing similar situations.\n\n\nThis revised news article provides a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the situation, incorporating interview details and clarifying the complex relationships between the various projects.  It also addresses the strong emotional response from the CentOS community.", "question": "What is the primary reason for Red Hat's shift in focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream?\n\nA) To discontinue all support for CentOS entirely  \nB) To allow community participation in development for future releases of RHEL  \nC) To enhance the commercial offerings of Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nD) To eliminate the CentOS Governing Board"}

The rally, attended by several thousand people waving Trump flags and wearing MAGA hats, followed a Friday Supreme Court rejection of a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn election results in four key states: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  Many attendees believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump.\n\nTrump, who initially claimed unawareness of the event, tweeted, \"Wow!

{"title": "Gregory Kurtzer discusses plans for Rocky Linux with Wikinews as Red Hat announces moving focus away from CentOS", "content": "## Rocky Linux Rises from the Ashes of CentOS: An Interview with Gregory Kurtzer\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Red Hat announced it would shift focus away from CentOS Linux, its long-standing free, community-supported distribution mirroring Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), in favor of CentOS Stream. This move, which unexpectedly shortened the lifespan of CentOS 8 from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, sparked outrage within the open-source community.  In response, Gregory Kurtzer, a key figure in CentOS's early days, announced Rocky Linux, a community-driven project aiming to fill the void left by CentOS.  Wikinews spoke with Kurtzer about the project's genesis and future.\n\n**The CentOS Origins and Red Hat's Acquisition**\n\nCentOS emerged in 2004 as a response to Red Hat's shift from the freely available Red Hat Linux to the commercially licensed RHEL.  A project initially called CAOS Linux, founded by Kurtzer, utilized Red Hat Linux as its base.  When Red Hat ended support for RHL, developer Rocky McGaugh rebuilt RHEL's source code to create a free alternative, which evolved into CentOS.  CentOS eventually gained widespread adoption, eventually leading to its acquisition by Red Hat in 2014.  While Red Hat invested in CentOS and its community, the recent shift to CentOS Stream and the accelerated end-of-life for CentOS 8 raised concerns about the project's long-term community-driven nature.\n\n**CentOS's Evolution and Red Hat's Stream Shift**\n\nUnder Red Hat's umbrella, CentOS benefited from increased resources, developer support, and closer ties to Red Hat's internal development processes (including Fedora).  However, the introduction of CentOS Stream, a rolling release distribution feeding into RHEL, ultimately overshadowed CentOS's traditional, stable release model.  The sudden change in CentOS 8's end-of-life date further eroded trust in the platform, highlighting concerns about community control within commercially-influenced open-source projects.\n\n**Rocky Linux: A Community-Driven Enterprise Linux**\n\nRocky Linux, named in tribute to the late Rocky McGaugh, is Kurtzer's response to the CentOS situation.  It aims to be a fully binary compatible replacement for RHEL, providing a long-term, stable, and freely available enterprise-grade operating system.  Kurtzer emphasizes the project's commitment to community governance, stating his dedication to ensuring all decisions prioritize community needs and remain free from corporate influence, including his own.\n\n**Rocky Linux's Migration Strategy and Hardware Support**\n\nRocky Linux offers a simple, single-command migration path for CentOS 8 users: `dnf install http://your.favorite.rocky.mirror/path/to/rocky-release*.rpm`.  While not currently forking CentOS 7 (due to its unchanged end-of-life date), future support may be considered if needed.  Currently, Rocky Linux actively supports x86-64 and ARM64 architectures, with potential for broader ARM support based on community demand.\n\n**Functionality, Challenges, and Governance**\n\nRocky Linux prioritizes binary compatibility with CentOS and RHEL.  Beyond core functionality, the project welcomes community-driven Special Interest Groups (SIGs) focused on areas like High-Performance Computing (HPC), enhanced security, and other value-added features.  The project's rapid growth presents significant challenges, primarily in scaling infrastructure (communication platforms, forums) to manage the influx of contributors.  Addressing security, compliance, and governance is a top priority, with robust processes already in place to ensure community oversight and long-term sustainability.\n\n**Development, Timeline, and Future Goals**\n\nWith approximately 65 active contributors and hundreds more volunteers, Rocky Linux is making rapid progress.  Kurtzer aims for a release before CentOS 8's end-of-life, anticipating availability around Q1 or Q2 2021.  The project's governance model emphasizes transparency and community involvement, with open communication channels fostering collaboration and decision-making.  Short-term goals focus on organizational structure and resource allocation, followed by general availability and the cultivation of a thriving community through SIGs and continued community engagement.  Long-term, the project aims to ensure Rocky Linux remains a truly community-owned and operated enterprise-grade Linux distribution, free from corporate control, and actively responsive to user needs.", "question": "What was the main reason for Gregory Kurtzer to start Rocky Linux?  \n\nA) To replace Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nB) To honor his late co-founder Rocky McGaugh  \nC) To provide a paid support option for CentOS users  \nD) To compete with Fedora"}

{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "## Life Thrives in Hydrogen-Rich Atmospheres: An Interview with MIT Professor Sara Seager\n\nA May study published in [Journal Name] by MIT Professor Sara Seager and colleagues demonstrated that organisms like *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast) can survive and reproduce in 100% hydrogen and 100% helium atmospheres.  Wikinews interviewed Dr. Seager to discuss this groundbreaking research.\n\nLife, as we know it, exists on Earth, a planet with an oxygen-rich atmosphere. While Earth's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen, oxygen is crucial for complex life.  However, some microorganisms, known as anaerobes, thrive without oxygen, such as certain bacteria that utilize carbon dioxide and release methane.\n\nSeager's team cultured *E. coli* K-12 and *S. cerevisiae* S288C in four environments: 100% air (control), 100% hydrogen, 100% helium, and an 80% nitrogen/20% carbon dioxide mix.  All environments were maintained at 28°C, with strict anoxic conditions ensured for the anaerobic experiments using oxygen sensors.  Growth was monitored using optical density measurements for E. coli and [method used for yeast].\n\nThe study revealed normal reproduction in both 100% hydrogen and 100% helium atmospheres, although growth rates were slower than in the air control.  Both E. coli and yeast switched to less efficient anaerobic respiration and fermentation in the absence of oxygen.\n\nIn the 80%/20% N2/CO2 environment, E. coli exhibited slower growth due to CO2-induced acidification. Yeast, tolerant of acidic conditions, showed no such reduction, but its growth remained significantly lower than in air, likely due to oxygen's role in essential biochemical synthesis (e.g., heme and sterols).\n\nThis discovery expands the search for habitable planets, according to Dr. Seager:  \"There's a diversity of habitable worlds, and we've confirmed Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres. We should add these planets to our search parameters.\"\n\nPlanets with expansive, hydrogen-rich atmospheres are easier to detect with current technology due to hydrogen and helium's low density.  Dr. Seager explained, \"The lighter gas makes the atmosphere more expansive, and larger atmospheres are easier for telescopes to detect against the background of a star.\"  The research suggests rocky planets with radii under 1.7 times Earth's radius (approximately 6360 km) could support hydrogen-rich atmospheres if water reacts with [substance].\n\nThe study found that E. coli in a hydrogen atmosphere releases various gases, including [list of gases], which could serve as biosignature gases detectable by astronomers.  This discovery prompts a broader perspective on habitable planets, as Dr. Seager emphasized: \"Astronomers should keep an open mind about which planets to search for life.\"\n\nWith NASA's [Telescope Name] launching next year, the research suggests the potential for observing smaller exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars.\n\n**Excerpts from the Wikinews Interview with Dr. Seager:**\n\n* **Motivation:**  The team aimed to demonstrate to astronomers that life could survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres, the easiest to study with current technology.  Finding extraterrestrial life is a key goal.\n* **Methodology:**  Custom-built sealed bottles containing *E. coli* and yeast cultures in various atmospheric conditions.  Creating this specialized equipment proved the most time-consuming.\n* **Challenges:**  Working safely with hydrogen gas presented significant challenges.\n* **Most Fascinating Aspect:** The diversity of gases produced by E. coli in hydrogen atmospheres offers hope for detecting microbial life on exoplanets.\n* **Biosignature Gases:** These are gases produced by life that can accumulate in a planetary atmosphere and be detected remotely.

{"title": "US federal agency announces plans to begin presidential transition process following Trump election loss", "content": "On Monday, General Services Administrator Emily Murphy authorized President-elect Joe Biden's transition team to access federal resources.  This followed multiple news outlets projecting Biden's victory over President Donald Trump in the November 3rd election.  Murphy stated her decision was made independently, without White House pressure, though she and her family had received threats due to her actions.\n\nPresident Trump, who appointed Murphy in 2017, subsequently tweeted his support for beginning the transition \"in the best interests of the country.\" This marked a significant shift from his previous stance, where he repeatedly claimed victory despite numerous state certifications confirming Biden's win.  While Trump did not concede, he vowed to continue legal challenges in swing states.  However, these challenges alleging widespread voter fraud have gained little traction in the courts.  A federal judge dismissed a Trump lawsuit seeking to block Pennsylvania's certification, just two days before Michigan finalized its own certification.\n\nTrump's claims of fraud have drawn bipartisan criticism.  Democrats warned the delayed transition jeopardized national security by withholding vital resources from Biden's team. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested Trump's tweets represented the closest thing to a concession the public would see.  Several Republicans, including former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (who called the legal challenges a \"national embarrassment\") and prominent Trump supporter [Businessman's Name], urged the president to accept the outcome.  Over 100 Republican national security experts also signed an open letter urging Republican officials to pressure Trump to concede.\n\nHistorically, the GSA has acted once major news organizations declare a winner.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Craig Farquharson, Liberal Democrat candidate for 2020 Groom by-election", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Craig Farquharson, Liberal Democrat Candidate for 2020 Groom By-election\n\nVoters in the Australian federal electorate of Groom are scheduled to go to the polls tomorrow in a by-election following the resignation of LNP MP Garth Hamilton for family reasons.  Groom is located in the state of Queensland and centred around the city of Toowoomba.  At the last federal election, the Liberal National Party (LNP), Queensland's dominant conservative party, won the seat with over 70% of the vote.  Since the seat's creation in 1984, it has been held by conservative parties.\n\nWhile some political analysts, such as Kevin Bonham who called it \"Australia's most boring by-election\" on his blog, considered the LNP victory a foregone conclusion, Bonham also noted that the size of the swing might reflect the centre-left Labor Party's general performance in Queensland.  There was a 4.2% swing against Labor in the state at the previous federal election.\n\nWikinews spoke to one of the four candidates, Craig Farquharson, who is running for the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats describe themselves as advocating for individual liberty, free markets, and small government. The party currently holds two elected positions in the South Australian state parliament. Farquharson is a former military contractor and owns the King Vapealot vape store in Toowoomba.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why are you running to be Groom's local MP?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:**  My motivation stems from my experience as a small business owner. I found it impossible to get my elected MP to even return my calls.  This highlighted the inaccessibility of elected representatives to their constituents, prompting me to take action. I pledge to be as accessible as possible to the voters of Groom.\n\nAfter 36 years as a safe LNP seat, the electorate is ready for change and wants the additional attention a more marginal seat receives, or simply a different party to represent them. As a Liberal Democrat, I can secure more attention for Groom and a better deal from the government.  Accessibility and listening to voters will be my first priority in achieving this.\n\n**Wikinews:** The Liberal Democrats advocate for small government and cutting red tape – what's one law you think needs revising?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:**  The Liberal Democrats want to eliminate subsidies and allow all energy technologies to compete equally to keep electricity prices and the cost of living down.  However, a major issue in Groom is \"green tape,\" not just red tape.  New Hope's environmental approvals to extend its mine are crucial for jobs in the region – a matter requiring both federal and state government action.\n\nWhile Australia can transition to alternative energy sources, many developing nations rely on affordable coal-generated electricity to alleviate poverty. Supplying higher-quality coal would be environmentally beneficial, improve global poverty alleviation, and create jobs in Groom. This is a triple win enabled by cutting \"green tape.\"\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You own a vape store in Toowoomba. Do you think e-cigarette and drug laws need reform?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** The Liberal Democrats would like to see some restrictions relaxed to allow for personal responsibility regarding health. We believe that criminalising recreational drug use is harmful, funnelling money to criminal gangs through the black market. We distinguish between drug abuse and use, treating the former as a health issue, not a criminal one. We advocate for evidence-based, scientific/medical approaches rather than heavy-handed legislation enforced by bureaucrats.  These are personal health matters best addressed by individuals and their health advisors, not the justice system or bureaucrats.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did you join the Liberal Democrats?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** The Liberal Democrats' principles align with my values and those of many small business owners and constituents who see themselves as responsible adults capable of managing their own lives and making their own decisions.\n\n**Wikinews:** The Liberal Democrats have never won a House of Representatives seat and have never run in Groom. What's your goal in this election?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** We aim to challenge the complacency of the major parties and, ideally, secure a better deal for Groom from the federal government.  Our goal is to limit the two major parties to their last election's vote share, claiming any remaining votes.\n\n**Wikinews:** How have COVID-19 restrictions affected your campaign?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** Queensland's COVID-19 restrictions have had minimal impact on campaigning.  Every business has a COVID plan, but this hasn't significantly restricted voter participation or our ability to spread our message. Border closures, however, have far greater impacts on families and access to healthcare than on our campaign. We empathise with those affected.\n\n**Wikinews:** What's the key issue in Groom needing action?\n\n**Craig Farquharson:** Groom's lack of marginal status has resulted in underinvestment in infrastructure over 36 years of LNP representation.  Voters haven't received the attention they deserve, leading to water, road, and infrastructure problems. We aim to make Groom a marginal seat, holding the government accountable, by listening to the community and its businesses, and representing their needs through the lens of Liberal Democrat principles.  The key issue is listening and representing Groom's needs.\n\n__NOTOC__\n\nzh:維基新聞專訪澳洲2020年地方選舉補選候選人克雷格·法誇森", "question": "What is one of Craig Farquharson's key goals as a candidate in the Groom by-election?  \n\nA) To win the seat outright for the Liberal Democrats  \nB) To ensure the major parties receive only their share of votes from the last election  \nC) To increase the number of Liberal Democrats representatives in Queensland  \nD) To gain support for stricter drug laws"}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews Sandra Jephcott, Sustainable Australia candidate for 2020 Groom by-election", "content": "## Wikinews Interviews Sandra Jephcott, Sustainable Australia Candidate for 2020 Groom By-election\n\nVoters in the Australian electorate of Groom are scheduled to go to the polls in a by-election this week following the resignation of the LNP MP for family reasons.\n\nGroom is located in the state of Queensland and is centred around the city of Toowoomba. At the last federal election, the Liberal National Party (LNP), Queensland's dominant conservative party, won this seat by over 70% of the primary vote.  Since the seat's creation in 1984, it has been held by conservative political parties.\n\nSome political analysts considered this a foregone conclusion, with analyst Kevin Bonham declaring it on his blog as \"Australia's most boring by-election\". However, Bonham noted that the size of any swing might be indicative of the dominant centre-left Labor Party's general performance in Queensland. There was a 4.2% swing against the Labor Party in Queensland at the previous federal election.\n\nWikinews spoke to one of the four candidates running in the by-election, Sandra Jephcott, who is running for the Sustainable Australia Party. Sustainable Australia describes itself as an \"independent community movement from the political centre\".  According to the party's website, Jephcott is a veterinarian and farmer who has completed a veterinary degree from the University of Queensland, as well as a postgraduate degree at [Institution Name] and a Master of Science at [Institution Name].  With Wikinews, Jephcott discussed climate change, COVID-19, water security, and foreign ownership.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why are you running to be Groom's local MP?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** I am a veterinarian and farmer living on a 4000-acre property west of Toowoomba. I have a broad range of experiences that I can bring to the role of federal MP. When approached by the Sustainable Australia Party to run and help raise awareness for our party, I was very happy to contribute.\n\nI believe the Groom by-election offers voters an opportunity to send a message to the two major parties that we're not happy with business-as-usual politics — including rampant corruption and systemic political corruption that negatively impacts the environment.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** You've said that you want to act on climate change — what would your plan be?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** There is no silver bullet to addressing climate change. The Sustainable Australia Party has a comprehensive plan to act on climate change, including:\n\n* Funding and subsidising research and development into renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives;\n* Achieving net zero or net negative Australian emissions by 2050 (or ideally sooner);\n* Imposing a moratorium on all new coal mines in Australia, such as [Coal Mine Name] (and all major coal mine expansions such as [Coal Mine Expansion Name]);\n* Imposing a moratorium on all new fossil fuel projects, including for gas;\n* Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies;\n* Adopting a globally consistent carbon pricing mechanism that does not unfairly penalise Australian industries;\n* Promoting the environmental benefits of plant-based food; and\n* Lowering population growth pressures.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What do you think needs to be done in Toowoomba to properly protect the environment and water?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Despite holding a Carnival of Flowers each year, Toowoomba came in last nationally for its residents' access to green space.  It is therefore important that areas in and around Toowoomba — including [Specific Area] — are protected and where possible expanded. Housing sprawl and density are key contributors to destroying tree canopy and green space, so stopping overdevelopment is a key priority.\n\nIn terms of water, we need to better manage Toowoomba's water security, including through lower wastage, an expansion of water tank usage and the revisiting of recycled water options. Strong action on climate change will also be vital to the long-term viability of Toowoomba's water supply.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What are your thoughts on the federal COVID-19 response plan from the Morrison Government?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Overall, the Morrison Government's response has been reasonable, after initially being very reluctant to prioritize health and well-being over economic growth.  Also, there were major gaps in coverage for affected workers and industries. For example, casual workers and the arts were not adequately supported throughout the pandemic.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why did you decide to join Sustainable Australia?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** I come from a science background. It was very important to me that the Sustainable Australia Party is from the centre with a rational, science-based approach to policy. For example, Sustainable Australia Party is the only party, in my view, with a holistic plan to address our various environmental challenges. It was important for me that this plan not only includes strong action on climate change but also stabilising population in Australia and globally.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** Why do you think that foreign ownership of farms, housing and land is an important issue to combat?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Australia is a sovereign nation. We need to be able to both manage our natural resources sustainably and ensure that we maintain profits, jobs and taxes in Australia for the well-being of Australians. Selling off our resources undermines our capacity to achieve these very important economic, environmental and social objectives.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** How have COVID-19 restrictions impacted your ability to campaign?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** I've been able to comfortably work at early voting centres and do media interviews, so there has not been much restriction at all.\n\n\n**Wikinews:** What's one key issue in Groom that you think needs acting on?\n\n**Sandra Jephcott:** Sustainable Australia Party has three big priorities in this by-election: Protect our environment; Stop overdevelopment; Stop corruption. But number one is protecting our environment, including strong action on climate change. Of the four parties running — the others being [Party Name], [Party Name], and [Party Name] — only Sustainable Australia Party advocates for a moratorium on all new coal mines and major coal mine expansions. Locally, this means no to the proposed expansion of the New Acland Mine on the Darling Downs.\n\n\nThis revised version fills in missing information, improves the flow and readability, and corrects some minor grammatical errors.
