{"title": "Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan resigns over Brexit border checks", "content": "**DUP First Minister Resigns in Protest Against Goods Checks from the EU**\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) First Minister of Northern Ireland, Paul Givan, has resigned effective midnight Friday as part of his party's protests against checks on goods arriving from the European Union. \n\nThese checks were introduced under the Northern Ireland Protocol, a key agreement made during Brexit negotiations which facilitated the UK's departure from the EU. However, many prominent figures in Northern Ireland have vehemently opposed the terms of this arrangement.\n\nGivan's resignation will also necessitate the resignation of Sinn Féin's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, effectively paralyzing the legislative functions of the devolved government at Stormont. This disruption means that the Executive cannot convene to address critical policies, including a three-year budget, an energy bills grant, and potential easing of COVID-19 restrictions. However, other ministers at Stormont will retain their portfolios until elections scheduled for May.\n\nIn an emotional press statement, Givan remarked that Northern Ireland's institutions are \"being tested once again\" and that the delicate balance established by the Good Friday and St. Andrews agreements has been undermined by the recent UK-EU arrangement. He specifically highlighted the \"cornerstone\" power-sharing principles introduced by the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.\n\nGivan expressed his sincere hope that all community factions would soon be able to consent to the restoration of a fully functioning executive in order to resolve these pressing issues. Reflecting on his nearly eight-month tenure as First Minister, he described it as \"the privilege of my lifetime,\" having succeeded Arlene Foster after her resignation in June 2021.\n\nThe resignation has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn Féin finance minister Conor Murphy describing it as \"reckless and self-serving.\" Leaders from both the British and Irish governments have also expressed disapproval. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called for an early election in light of the absence of a functional Executive, asserting that \"the DUP's actions have real consequences for people who are struggling.\" The leader of the Alliance Party, Naomi Long, framed the situation as destabilizing, warning it could result in \"more hardship for the people of Northern Ireland,\" while ultimately proving futile as the Protocol will remain in place.\n\nMcDonald also condemned the DUP for inaction regarding the budget and healthcare investments, saying their focus is on \"self-serving political interests.\" Other officials voiced alarm about the impact on government services, with UK officials calling the move \"extremely disappointing\" and urging reinstatement to ensure public services are delivered for Northern Ireland residents. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated the UK government’s commitment to a stable Northern Ireland Executive.\n\nIrish Taoiseach Micheál Martin characterized Givan's decision as \"highly damaging.\" Through a spokesperson, he emphasized the importance of the Executive delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Martin called on the DUP to engage fully with all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, which the Protocol aims to protect.\n\nMartin also noted that ongoing negotiations between the UK and EU—of which Ireland is a member—need to be given the opportunity to succeed. He pointed out that the European Commission has proposed serious measures to address concerns regarding the Protocol's implementation.\n\nIn the wake of Givan's resignation, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič held discussions regarding the Protocol. Šefčovič criticized a directive from Stormont's Agriculture Minister and former DUP leader Edwin Poots to suspend certain checks as \"very unhelpful.\" Truss and Šefčovič are scheduled to meet again on February 11.\n\nUnionist politicians have clearly articulated their stance on the Protocol. Following Givan's resignation, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson insisted that the Protocol poses an \"existential threat\" to Northern Ireland's status within the United Kingdom. He accused the UK government of failing to uphold the agreements that led to the DUP’s return to the Executive in January 2020, thus ending a three-year power-sharing impasse with Sinn Féin.\n\nSources indicate that Givan's resignation and its timing were confirmed during a high-level meeting among DUP leaders earlier Thursday.\n\nPoots’s decision to suspend certain sanitary and phytosanitary checks, which had not been imposed by the December 31, 2020 deadline, was reportedly based on legal advice suggesting he had the authority to do so without Executive approval. Although the UK government has stated it will not intervene since this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive, it has faced criticism from Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who labeled it a \"breach of international law.\" Šefčovič reaffirmed the necessity of continuing these checks, while a spokesperson for Johnson emphasized the importance of reaching a swift resolution."}

Over the years, various organizations have criticized the use of Native American names and imagery by sports teams.

However, faced with mounting pressure, including a letter from 87 sponsors—covering major companies like **Nike** and **Pepsi**—requesting a change, the team began to reconsider its branding. Complaints about the outdated name's impact on Native American communities also surged. To aid in the renaming process, the team enlisted consultant **John Wright**, who sought input from fans, former players, and Native Americans. While some fans favored \"Red Wolves,\" many variations of that name had already been trademarked.\n\nReactions from Native American advocates were mixed. Crystal Echo Hawk of ***IllumiNative*** emphasized that while the change is a step forward, there is still significant healing to be done. She remarked, \"There's still a lot of healing that needs to happen, so I don't think the team's work in regards to reconciliation and healing is over.\"\n\nIn contrast, **Fawn Sharp**, president of the ***National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)***, criticized the team's management for failing to adequately address the harm caused by its former name: \"Without an apology, without any measure of accountability, and without fulfilling the honored commitments they made to tribal nations in 2020 to right this wrong, the NFL and Snyder are simply 'Commanding' a continued course of open, intentional and profit-driven racism and erasure.\"\n\nCurrently, around one thousand sports teams across the United States still use Native American names, a decrease from approximately three thousand in the 1990s. Advocacy groups like the ***NCAI*** and others continue to push for teams to adopt names and mascots that do not draw from Native American culture."}

Plans for a battery energy storage system are currently on hold due to fire safety concerns. Set to be constructed by OSMI Australia Pty in 2023, this wind farm will be the first of its kind in a plantation in Victoria.\n\nIn late 2021, a planning panel reviewed input from local residents, community groups, and representatives from OSMI.

Unlike many other prehistoric statuettes carved from ivory or bone, this iconic piece is made from oolite, a sedimentary rock. Researchers believe it was crafted by members of the Gravettian culture, likely using rudimentary tools. The sculpture is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love.\n\nTo determine the stone's origins, scientists compared rock samples from as far west as France to as far east as Ukraine with microscopic images of the Venus. Oolite is formed through the gradual accumulation of silt and other materials, allowing researchers to identify individual grains and shell fragments. One fragment embedded in the statue originated from a creature that existed during the late Pleistocene epoch, although the stone itself would have been extracted and sculpted much later.\n\nIn contrast to previous analyses that focused solely on the exterior of the Venus, scientists employed advanced imaging techniques to examine the interior of the statue without causing damage. Their scans indicated that the Venus bears little resemblance to local oolites near Willendorf but closely matches those found in Italy, just across the Danube and Inn rivers, more than 300 miles away. A less likely candidate for the stone's origin is a site in Ukraine, located approximately 600 miles east of where the statue was discovered in 1908.\n\nLead author Gerhard Weber suggested that the movement of the stone might have coincided with prehistoric migrations: \"When the climate or the prey situation changed, [people] moved on, preferably along rivers,\" he explained.\n\nThese findings shed new light on how prehistoric humans navigated and traveled in and around the Alpine region.\n\nThe study was supported by funding from the state of Austria."}

Representatives from the local Liberal and National parties sent their apologies for not being able to attend.\n\nThe forum kicked off following a climate action rally held outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and Town Hall. The rally featured speeches from BREAZE members, representatives from the Ballarat branch of various environmental organizations, and the Ballarat Trades Hall.\n\nEach candidate began with a three-minute summary of their climate policies before fielding questions from the audience. John Barnes opened for the Greens, stating, \"The Greens have the most ambitious program of any party addressing climate change.\" He emphasized the party's commitment to achieving a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030 and ending coal mining, burning, and export.\n\nIndependent candidate Alex Graham expressed his passion for environmental issues and touted the superiority of his policy, which focuses on introducing a referendum allowing the government to create its own money supply. He argued that this funding could rejuvenate the environment.\n\nCatherine King reflected on her two decades in Parliament, acknowledging previous attempts by the last Labor government to enact climate policies, including the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which were later dismantled. She highlighted the Labor Party's Powering Australia policy, promising a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050.\n\nKerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party positioned community perspectives at the forefront of her climate approach. She emphasized that \"carbon is not the enemy; toxic pesticides are the true enemy,\" attributing major nitrous oxide emissions to pesticide use.\n\nFollowing their opening remarks, candidates responded to questions from the public about their top priorities for climate action.

Graham proposed that his referendum could enable the federal government to subsidize underground transmission lines rather than overhead, stressing the need to prioritize ecological preservation over financial considerations. King acknowledged concerns about a proposed transfer station's location while advocating for regulatory reform.\n\nCandidates addressed questions regarding carbon capture technology and commitment to halting new coal and gas infrastructure. King clarified that while Labor does not support a moratorium on new projects, it does not seek to invest taxpayer funds in them. In contrast, Graham affirmed his commitment to closing existing coal-fired power stations and prohibiting new constructions.\n\nDuring a discussion on job transitions for coal communities, candidates shared their visions for supporting affected workers as Australia shifts towards renewable energy. Graham advocated for a universal basic wage, while King emphasized the importance of retraining and creating renewable energy jobs.

The shooter was later located and killed in a confrontation with security forces early Friday morning.\n\nIsrael's national emergency medical service reported receiving the first call about the incident at 9:00 PM local time. Victims were transported to three different hospitals, where two men were pronounced dead at the scene, and a third succumbed to his injuries shortly after. Three individuals are currently in serious condition, while four others sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe shooting began at a pub, where five victims were reported, before the attacker moved on to J.

Notably, Republicans Susan Collins (Maine), Mitt Romney (Utah), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) broke with their party to support her nomination. Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the proceedings and was prepared to cast a tiebreaking vote if necessary.\n\nJackson and President Joe Biden watched the confirmation process unfold from the White House. Biden nominated Jackson on February 25 to succeed retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, fulfilling a promise he made during his presidential campaign to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. All presidential nominations must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDuring her introduction to the Senate on March 21, Jackson was accompanied by former D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland. In her opening remarks, she shared her belief that her journey was made possible by the sacrifices of her parents: \"They taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had to face growing up, my path was clearer... [In the U.S.], I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be.\"\n\nShe concluded her address with a commitment to upholding the Constitution: \"If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and this grand experiment of American democracy that has endured through the past 246 years. I hope that you will see how much I love our country and the Constitution and the rights that make us free.\"\n\nDuring the second day of confirmation hearings, Senator Josh Hawley (Republican; Missouri) probed Jackson about her sentencing decisions in child pornography cases, specifically questioning a three-month sentence she imposed in United States v. Hawkins, where prosecutors had requested a two-year term. Jackson defended her decision by arguing that the standards for sentencing are flawed and do not consider individual circumstances of defendants.\n\nJackson stated, \"Congress has given judges the discretion to make decisions on an individualized basis, taking into account not only the guidelines but also various factors including the age of the defendant and the context of the case.\" In Hawkins, the defendant was eighteen years old.\n\nOn the third day of the hearings, Jackson addressed how to interpret Constitutional provisions written over two centuries ago. She explained, \"It’s a process of understanding what the core foundational principles are in the Constitution and applying those principles to modern-day issues.\"\n\nSenators Lindsey Graham (Republican; South Carolina) and Ted Cruz (Republican; Texas) continued their inquiries regarding Jackson’s past sentencing decisions, which led to frequent interventions from Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Dick Durbin (Democrat; Illinois) on Jackson's behalf. Despite assertions that Jackson was being interrupted, some accused Durbin of filibustering in support of her nomination.\n\nDuring the final day of hearings on March 24, Durbin announced that the Judiciary Committee would convene on March 28, setting up a potential vote on Jackson for April 4. On this day, Jackson was absent as the Senate heard testimony from other witnesses, including Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who praised Jackson's qualifications, stating, \"Her background is absolutely extraordinary and her mastery of the law is second to none.\"\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (Republican; Tennessee) requested access to confidential pre-sentencing reports in Jackson's prior child pornography cases, which are typically protected to safeguard victims. Durbin advised against this, saying, \"I would not want that on my conscience... I'm going to resist it every step of the way.\"\n\nOn April 4, the Judiciary Committee reached an 11-11 deadlock on Jackson’s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) called a vote to break the tie, sending her nomination to the Senate floor for final consideration.\n\nBefore her nomination, Jackson had an extensive legal background, having served as a law clerk for Justice Breyer, as a federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and as an attorney in private practice.\n\nThe Supreme Court is composed of eight associate justices and one chief justice."}

The scientific name remains unchanged.\n\nThe decision to eliminate the common name was announced last July, but a new name was not selected until last week when the Society voted unanimously to adopt \"spongy moth.\" \n\nRomani scholar Magda Matache of the Roma Program emphasized the significance of this change, stating, \"Gypsy is considered a racial slur by many Romani people. It carries a painful history and is offensive.\" The Romani, or Roma, have historically faced significant prejudice in both Europe and North America.\n\nThe 57 members of the Project assigned to this species gathered input from the public and reviewed over 200 proposed names. \"Spongy moth,\" derived from the French term for \"spongy,\" was first suggested in January. The name reflects the sponge-like appearance of the egg masses that protect the larvae through the winter.\n\nAdditionally, the name aligns with those used in other languages, such as \"sponge-spinner\" in German and \"sponge-knitter\" in Dutch. According to CNN, the spongy moth is most likely to spread to new areas during its egg stage, as they can easily be transported on firewood or vehicles.\n\nNative to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, the spongy moth has become a highly destructive pest in North America since its introduction in 1869. The caterpillars are brown, covered in spines, and have distinctive blue and red spots. They can strip trees of their leaves, leading to significant deforestation—approximately 1 million acres of trees have been defoliated annually since 1980.\n\n\"They basically chew their way through deciduous forests,\" noted Jessica Ware from the Entomological Society of America, referencing a children's picture book. \"The term 'spongy moth' is already starting to appear in media stories and online resources, which is encouraging. However, we recognize that this name change will take time to fully implement,\" she added.\n\n\"In print media, literature, and regulations concerning L. dispar, integrating the new name may be a gradual process. The Entomological Society of America will continue to provide support for organizations in this transition,\" Ware stated.\n\nThe Entomological Society of America is the largest professional organization for insect scientists worldwide."}
{"title": "Financial Action Task Force places United Arab Emirates on money laundering 'grey' list", "content": "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on its global grey list on March 4 due to \"strategic deficiencies\" in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing, subjecting the country to increased scrutiny.\n\nThe UAE joins 23 other countries on the list, which includes regional neighbors like Jordan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as Pakistan and Turkey. While being on the grey list is less severe than a 'black' listing—reserved for countries like Iran and North Korea—it could potentially harm the UAE's reputation as a business-friendly destination.\n\nThis status may also lead to less favorable interest rates, increased transaction costs, and heightened competition with neighboring Saudi Arabia. A report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), published in May 2021, found that grey-listing typically results in an average GDP decline of 7.6%, which would equate to about $27.3 billion based on the UAE's 2020 GDP.\n\nThe FATF clarifies that being placed on the grey list implies the country has committed to promptly addressing the identified strategic deficiencies. A follow-up report in November 2021, stemming from a 2020 evaluation, indicated that the UAE made progress in four areas and is considered \"compliant\" or \"highly compliant\" with 36 out of 40 FATF recommendations.\n\nSince 2018, the UAE has implemented a federal decree on money laundering to align itself with international standards and has established four specialized courts for prosecution in this arena. In December 2020, the country also set up an Executive Office focused on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. However, the FATF has urged improvements in risk management across specific sectors and called for enhanced capabilities in domestic and international investigations and prosecutions related to money laundering.\n\nThe Executive Office affirmed, \"The UAE will continue its efforts to identify, disrupt, and penalize criminal and illicit financial networks in accordance with FATF’s recommendations and the UAE’s National Action Plan,\" and pledged ongoing cooperation with international partners. A former UAE Foreign Affairs Minister expressed on Twitter the country's steadfast commitment to strengthening strategic cooperation with global allies to confront this challenge.\n\nKatherine Bauer, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, criticized the UAE's \"inherent vulnerabilities to illicit finance\" due to its role as a regional commercial and financial hub, noting that necessary changes cannot occur overnight.\n\nThe UAE was also mentioned in the 2016 Panama Papers leak, which identified it as a hub for financial secrecy. The leak implicated several Emirati officials in suspicious transactions, including the Prime Minister, who has ties to a cybersecurity firm alleged to engage in espionage.\n\nIn this context, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) labeled the UAE as a \"center for financial crime,\" citing that \"mass surveillance and the monarchy's tight grip on the courts and media make it difficult to challenge the system or expose dubious business practices.\" Jodi Vittori, a Fellow at the Center for International Relations, remarked that the U.S. appeared to have overlooked the UAE's role in facilitating illicit finance and organized crime.\n\nThe FATF's decision to grey-list the UAE took place during its sixth plenary session held under a German presidency from March 2 to 4. In the same session, Zimbabwe was removed from increased monitoring, and France was acknowledged for having a \"robust and sophisticated\" regulatory framework, though with areas still in need of improvement."}

According to state media, the missile flew for an undisclosed distance before landing in the sea.\n\nState media described the weapon as a demonstration of the DPRK's strength, boasting \"superior maneuverability\" and asserting that it was test-fired for \"final verification of overall technical specifications.\" However, Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, stated in an email to Al Jazeera that the so-called hypersonic weapon was \"not technologically ready.\" Initially, there was some downplaying of the missile's significance, but subsequent reports noted that it displayed \"improvement.\"\n\nEarlier this year, North Korea conducted two missile tests: one on Wednesday and another on Monday, both acknowledged by South Korea and others. The first launch was described by state media as a winter resilience test. North Korea's first hypersonic missile, unveiled on September 28, has drawn attention; defense expert Ankit Panda remarked that last Wednesday's missile was not a Hwasong-8 but a new model showcased at an October weapons exhibition in Pyongyang. After the September test, Panda labeled the Hwasong-8 a \"significant milestone\" in comments to the BBC.\n\nIn response to these missile tests, the UN missions of Albania, France, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States jointly called for dialogue and condemned the initial test.

Her resignation came just hours after she told the BBC that she had \"absolutely no intention\" of stepping down. However, in her resignation speech, she acknowledged that Khan \"no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue,\" adding that the mayor had left her \"no choice but to step aside.\"\n\nKhan had put Dick on notice on February 2, following the release of a report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) that detailed \"disgraceful\" incidents of bullying, discrimination, misogyny, and sexual harassment within the force. Dick had previously weathered several scandals since 2019, including allegations of misleading the public in an inconclusive investigation, but recent criticisms focused on claims of \"institutional corruption\" in the Metropolitan Police, which Dick has denied.\n\nThe February 1 report highlighted troubling behavior among some officers, including racist, sexist, and homophobic remarks made in Facebook and WhatsApp groups from 2016 to 2018. Although nine of the fourteen officers investigated remain on duty, two were promoted from constable to sergeant despite the allegations.\n\nThe force faced widespread criticism for its delayed investigation into \"Partygate,\" a series of gatherings at Downing Street that violated Covid-19 restrictions. Sources indicated a feeling of disillusionment within the police and public regarding the Met's ongoing issues, with some attributing the concerns to Dick's perceived defensiveness in addressing the scandals.\n\nIn his statement, Khan expressed dissatisfaction with Dick's responses to the urgent demands for reform necessary to rebuild public trust in the Metropolitan Police. He emphasized the need to eradicate the prevalent issues of racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, and misogyny within the organization, and found an initial meeting with Dick inadequate, prompting her resignation ahead of a follow-up.\n\nThe Met's handling of the murder of Sarah Everard by police officer Wayne Couzens also sparked outrage, particularly after four attendees of a vigil for Everard were arrested for breaching Covid-19 restrictions. The force faced further criticism in October when it advised women feeling threatened to shout to passersby or run into nearby homes rather than providing clearer directives.\n\nBoth the Metropolitan Police and the government are conducting inquiries into the force's oversight in Everard's case, led by Baroness Casey in the independent government review.\n\nIn December, two constables were sentenced to 33 months for sharing inappropriate photos of sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, drawing public outrage. Their mother, Mina Smallman, rejected the force's apology, accusing it of systemic racism and dehumanization.\n\nEarlier during an interview with Radio London, Dick, who had insisted she would not resign, stated that \"enough is enough\" and expressed her anger over the report's findings. She maintained that the Met is capable in many ways but acknowledged that its reputation has been severely damaged.\n\nReactions to Dick's resignation have been mixed. Former IOPC superintendent Mehtab reported that her stepping down was a necessary move to address the ongoing \"sub-culture\" of sexism and racism within the force. Alastair Morgan, whose family has been affected by police failures, noted that while it's unfortunate to see another commissioner resign, it was essential for accountability.\n\nActivist organizations echoed the sentiment, emphasizing the necessity for substantial reforms rather than just a change at the top. Ruth Davidson of the charity stated that one resignation does not resolve the deeper issues within the police, while Mehtab refuted the idea that the problems stem from just a few \"bad apples.\"\n\nHowever, Dick received support from Ken Marsh, chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation, who stated she should have been given more time to rebuild public trust. Both Khan, Home Secretary Priti Patel, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed gratitude for Dick's service, with Johnson acknowledging her dedication.\n\nKhan pledged to collaborate closely with Patel to appoint her successor swiftly, aiming to restore confidence in London's police service. Dick will remain in a caretaker role until a new commissioner is appointed.\n\nHaving joined the force as a constable in 1983, Dick led efforts against gang violence before becoming the first female commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in February 2017. Despite her achievements in tackling violent crime, London's teenage homicide rate reached its highest level since 2008 last year."}

{"title": "Court finds UK allowed undervalued Chinese imports into EU", "content": "**European Court of Justice Rules UK Neglected Customs Obligations for Chinese Imports**\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) determined that the United Kingdom failed to uphold its responsibilities as a former European Union member by permitting undervalued imports of textiles and footwear from China to enter EU markets.\n\nThe European Commission contended that the UK \"failed to fulfill its obligations\" under EU law by inadequately collecting customs duties on imports of Chinese clothing and shoes from 2011 to 2017. In 2017, it was reported that over half of these products were imported below the \"lowest acceptable prices,\" a benchmark set by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to identify imports at risk of undervaluation.\n\nOLAF had warned member states—including the UK—about the risks of \"extreme undervaluation\" during bilateral meetings in 2015 and 2016. However, the ECJ found that British authorities did not apply this metric in their monitoring efforts between 2011 and 2014, which resulted in inadequate customs controls and allowed these products to circulate freely within the EU. For instance, fraud investigators discovered that women’s trousers from China were declared at just €0.91 per kilogram, significantly below the cotton market price of €0.53.\n\nThe Commission estimates that this negligence cost the EU budget approximately €2.68 billion (around $2.9 billion) from 2011 to 2017, as approximately 80% of customs duties contribute to the EU budget.\n\nDespite this ruling, the ECJ rejected the Commission's request for the UK to repay the full amount, noting inconsistencies that meant the Commission had not met the required legal standards. The UK remains under ECJ jurisdiction regarding infractions committed during its EU membership, even after leaving the EU in January 2020. Consequently, the UK has been ordered to cover four-fifths of the legal costs incurred by Brussels since OLAF's first allegations of misconduct in 2017.\n\nThe UK has the option to challenge the fine but cannot contest the overall judgment. The fine amount of €2.68 billion reflects an increase from the initial estimate of €1.99 billion related to a complex fraud scheme. While today's sum encompasses 2011-2017, the investigation initially concentrated on evidence from 2013-2016 involving ports in England.\n\nAt the time, a representative for then-Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the sum was \"not a bill, it’s an estimate,\" emphasizing that the figures were not recognized by the UK government.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based court concluded that the British government had failed \"to apply effective customs control measures or to record the correct amounts of customs duties.\" It further indicated that the \"inadequate nature of checks carried out by UK customs authorities\" allowed fraudulent shell companies to relocate their operations to the UK.\n\nThe ECJ also found that the UK had not provided the Commission with all necessary information for accurate calculations.\n\nThe UK has expressed opposition to the EU's methods for assessing undervalued goods, a stance supported by countries such as Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Portugal, and Slovakia. Among these, Portugal, Slovakia, and the UK—along with Malta and Spain—were identified as having \"major undervaluation hubs\" during OLAF's 2014 Operation Snake.\n\nBritish ports, particularly Dover, were highlighted as key entry points for Chinese goods before they cleared European customs and were distributed across the continent. Bruno Collin, head of a French anti-fraud operation in 2016, lamented the lack of cooperation from British authorities, stating that they provided only \"extremely vague answers\" to French requests, if they responded at all.\n\nIn response to OLAF's allegations of the UK's \"continuous negligence\" in combating fraud, HM Revenue and Customs told Politico Europe that it maintained an \"excellent record in tackling fraud and rule-breaking of all kinds.\" However, Collin criticized their efforts, concluding, \"They don't make an effort.\""}

{"title": "Motion on transgender women in sports defeated in Queensland Parliament", "content": "In Queensland, Australia, a motion put forth by the Katter's Australian Party (KAP) seeking to prohibit transgender women from participating in women's sports was rejected on Wednesday. The motion argued that allowing transgender women to compete would \"erode the integrity of female sport.\"\n\nThe KAP's motion asserted that those who support the participation of transgender women in women's sports, regardless of age or level of competition, are complicit in undermining both female athletics and women's rights. It claimed that transgender women possess \"insurmountable physical advantages\" that create an unfair competitive edge and safety risks for cisgender female athletes.\n\nThe proposal was ultimately defeated by a vote of 49 to 33, with backing from the KAP and the Liberal National Party (LNP), but opposed by the ruling government and other parties.\n\nKAP leader Bob Katter emphasized the significance of the issue for parents, mentioning, \"As a parent of young girls who will hopefully participate in sports, the thought of them at 15 or 17 years old competing against someone identifying as female does not sit well with me.\" He acknowledged that while he does not wish to exclude anyone from sports, he believes there is a clear advantage for transgender women in competitive settings. Katter also alluded to broader social issues that need attention ahead of the upcoming election.\n\nQueensland Sports Minister Stirling Hinchliffe strongly opposed the motion, labeling it a \"blatant political maneuver\" that aims to incite fear and division. He stated, \"This is not a debate about sport or women's rights; it's an attack on the dignity of individuals based on gender identity.\" Hinchliffe criticized the notion of making blanket decisions solely based on gender identity as \"draconian and bigoted.\"\n\nDebate on the motion lasted about 30 minutes and featured representatives from all parties except the LNP. KAP MP Nick Dametto voiced concerns that the motion could allow individuals to exploit gender identity to gain an advantage in women's sports, while asserting that unrestricted access for transgender individuals to these competitions is neither fair nor safe. One Nation MP Mark Latham supported the motion, warning that failure to advocate for these issues could result in the eventual disappearance of women's sports.\n\nTwo representatives from the Greens opposed the motion. Amy MacMahon, who represents the South Brisbane electorate, argued that the motion was more about political point-scoring than genuine concern for women. She called for equal pay for female athletes, increased visibility for women's sports on television, and initiatives to encourage participation among women and girls. Greens leader Amanda Green characterized the motion as \"repugnant\" and unnecessary, noting the lack of opposition from other political parties."}
{"title": "Ten-year Tennessee study shows preschool associated with poorer student performance", "content": "A research team led by Dale Farran has challenged the notion that preschool education benefits children in the long term, as detailed in a recently published paper.\n\nThe study tracked 2,990 low-income children from Tennessee who applied to attend the state's free public preschools. This research represented a natural experiment since admission was determined by lottery rather than a merit-based system. Researchers monitored the academic and personal outcomes of the children for nearly a decade after they completed preschool.\n\nThe findings revealed that while preschool graduates initially seemed better prepared for school, their non-preschool peers eventually caught up. By the time the students reached middle school, those who had not attended preschool outperformed their preschool counterparts. The disparity widened over time: sixth graders who skipped preschool exhibited fewer disciplinary problems, had lower absenteeism rates, and were less likely to require special services. There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the two groups.\n\nIn 2015, then-Governor of Tennessee raised concerns about the quality of preschool education. Steven Barnett from Rutgers University's National Institute for Early Education Research contended that the state had made several missteps in its establishment of preschools, particularly regarding quality control, which left educators' practices unmonitored.\n\nAll preschool classes included in the study were led by licensed teachers located within public school buildings for older children.\n\nIn contrast, a similar study on Boston schoolchildren published in 2021 found that preschool attendance was linked to improved academic and behavioral outcomes, contradicting Farran's conclusions.\n\nFarran speculated that the unusual results in her study may stem from the level of control and discipline enforced by teachers. Most preschool educators in Tennessee had obtained certifications primarily for teaching pre-K through alternative paths, meaning their training for working with children under five was limited. As part of larger public school settings, preschool students often spent significant portions of their day transitioning between classrooms, bathrooms, and cafeterias, where their movements and noise levels were closely monitored.\n\nIn 2022, the World Population Review ranked Tennessee 38th out of the 50 U.S. states for the quality of K-12 education.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's agenda includes increased funding for early childhood education initiatives."}
{"title": "UK clarifies foreign, domestic response to cost of living crisis", "content": "**UK Government Clarifies Response to Cost of Living Crisis Amid Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nEarlier this month, Wikinews obtained clarification from the UK government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) regarding its response to the escalating cost of living crisis intensified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK government anticipated Russian aggression towards Ukraine for several months and coordinated its response with NATO and the European Union. Following the invasion in February, a series of \"swift retributive responses, including an unprecedented package of sanctions\" were implemented, covering financial, trade, aircraft, shipping, and immigration sectors. The latest sanction announced by Business Secretary Tuesday commits the UK to phasing out Russian oil and natural gas imports by the end of the year.\n\nThis announcement coincided with US President Joe Biden's declaration of a ban on imports of Russian oil, coal, and gas.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK government emphasized the need for a gradual approach: \"We cannot have a cliff-edge where oil and gas are abandoned overnight. Turning off the taps could jeopardize energy security, British jobs, and industries, leading to greater dependency on foreign imports.\"\n\nIn contrast, the European Commission is proceeding cautiously, aiming to reduce EU reliance on Russian imports by two-thirds this year, ultimately ceasing such imports \"well before 2030.\" While Russia supplies around 40% of the EU’s natural gas, the UK sources the majority of its energy domestically.\n\nThe spokesperson noted: \"Our single largest source of gas is from Norway, and imports from Russia constituted less than 4% of total UK gas supply in 2021.\" The government continues to engage constructively with energy-intensive industries to manage costs and maintain energy supply.\n\nA FAQ released on February 25 highlighted that the UK possesses three liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, while Germany has none. The fact sheet encouraged European nations to diminish their reliance on Russian gas through alternative supplies, especially from the global LNG market.\n\nA government press release on Tuesday specifically condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin, labeling the invasion as \"illegal.\" The spokesperson added, \"We are monitoring the impact of Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on the cost of living in the UK and will keep our approach under review.\"\n\nDespite sanctions, the release asserted that Russian oil \"is already being ostracized by the market.\" In the competitive global oil market, demand can be fulfilled by alternative suppliers, and the UK government is collaborating with international partners to secure those supplies.\n\nHowever, high inflation, propelled by rising petrol costs, has contributed to increased prices across various sectors. Anticipating inflation to peak at around 7% this spring—up from 5.4% last year—the Bank of England has adjusted its forecasts, with some economists estimating a rise close to 8% in the coming month.\n\nThe Centre for Economics and Business Research has significantly downgraded its growth projection for 2022 from 4.2% to 1.9%. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) stated that the £9 billion assistance package from Chancellor Rishi Sunak \"would now only offset roughly one-fifth of the expected rise in household energy bills.\"\n\nThe government spokesperson acknowledged public concerns about the cost of living, stating that support measures totaling around £21 billion have been introduced, including a £150 council tax rebate in April and a further £200 energy bill discount in October—designed to alleviate energy costs for most households.\n\nThese measures were initially announced prior to the Russian invasion, which began on February 24. On February 3, it was revealed that households in England within council tax bands A-D would receive a £150 reduction on their council tax, along with a £200 discount on energy bills in autumn, repayable over five years.\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticized Sunak for proposing “a forced £200 loan” for each household, to which Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the £20 billion support package, labeling it \"unprecedented\" and pledging to unveil an energy independence plan in the coming days.\n\nSunak also detailed changes to Universal Credit and the continued freeze on fuel levies in his autumn budget statement on October 27. The taper rate for Universal Credit was reduced from 63 pence to 55 pence for every pound earned above the threshold, following the government's cancellation of a £20 weekly uplift in Universal Credit.\n\nThe fuel duty rate has remained frozen for twelve years, saving motorists an estimated £190 on fuel costs. Sunak's budget announced a simplification of alcohol duties and a suspension of a proposed increase, incurring a projected £3 billion loss to the treasury.\n\nDespite these initiatives, critics argue that the assistance offered is insufficient to address the ongoing crisis. Ahead of Sunak's anticipated spring statement on March 23, Conservative MPs have urged the Chancellor to explore additional measures, with officials in HM Treasury reportedly considering options in light of soaring oil prices.\n\nAnalysts predict that from February 24, household energy bills could spike to £3,000 annually, with the energy regulator announcing a 54% increase in the cap on default tariffs to £1,971 starting in April.\n\nWhile oil prices have stabilized below $120 per barrel as of Wednesday, they briefly surged to a record $147.50 before the Russian invasion. Sir Keir pressed for an increasing focus on nuclear energy, renewable resources, and improved home insulation during PMQs.\n\nJohnson defended the government's renewable energy record, asserting the UK is \"the Saudi Arabia of wind power.\" A government spokesperson reiterated the importance of diversifying energy sources away from Russian oil and gas, emphasizing the transition to nuclear and renewable energy sources.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson added, \"The challenges we face stem from high international gas prices, rather than a lack of domestic supply,\" indicating that more UK oil and gas licensing is unlikely to yield immediate benefits.\n\nThe Labour Party has called for a windfall tax on the excess profits of major fossil fuel companies like BP and Shell, both of which reported record profits for 2021. Following BP's profit announcement, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated, \"The Chancellor’s energy plans have left families more worried than ever. It’s time for Labour’s plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut bills.\"\n\nWhen questioned at PMQs, Johnson cautioned against a windfall tax, arguing it could lead to higher energy prices and hinder the transition away from reliance on Russian oil and gas.\n\nThe government spokesperson articulated concerns that a windfall tax could deter approximately £14 billion in investment opportunities, threatening energy supply security and nearly 200,000 jobs within the industry. \n\nThey confirmed that oil and gas companies in the North Sea already bear tax rates on profits exceeding double those applicable to other businesses. To date, these companies have contributed more than £375 billion in production taxes. \n\nIn response to criticism regarding home insulation retrofitting, the spokesperson stated that the government is investing nearly £6.6 billion to enhance energy efficiency in homes, particularly benefiting low-income owners and tenants. The Heat and Buildings Strategy outlines a comprehensive strategy for transitioning to low-carbon heating, including the £450 million Boiler Upgrade Scheme and the £950 million Home Upgrade Grant."}

However, public sentiment shifted dramatically after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson last month, Marin indicated that Finland would make a decision regarding NATO membership \"within weeks.\" A recent poll revealed that 76% of Finns now support joining the alliance.\n\nThe statement from Niinistö and Marin emphasized: \"As the moment for decision-making approaches, we present our united perspective for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would enhance Finland's security.” They expressed hope that the \"national steps still needed to make this decision\" would be taken \"rapidly within the next few days.\"\n\nIn response, a Russian official warned that \"Helsinki must be aware of the responsibility and consequences of such a move,\" adding that Russia would implement \"retaliatory steps, both military-technical and other measures, to counter threats to its national security.\"\n\nThe announcement by Niinistö and Marin followed closely after a cooperation agreement was signed, committing the United Kingdom to defend Finland and Sweden if either is attacked. During a press conference on Wednesday, Niinistö asserted that Russia was \"ready to attack a neighboring country\" and remarked that if Russia were concerned about Finland joining NATO, the appropriate response was, \"you caused this, look in the mirror.\"\n\nThe Social Democratic Party, led by Marin, is expected to announce its stance on NATO membership tomorrow. Reports indicate that the party is \"almost certain to favor membership,\" potentially paving the way for Finland to join NATO as soon as Monday. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has previously welcomed both Finland and Sweden, expressing confidence that the accession process would be swift and straightforward. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas expressed her full support for Finland's NATO entry on Thursday, adding that Estonia backs a rapid accession process."}

This decision follows proposals made in 2020 by organizations, including WWF-Australia, advocating for stronger protections for the species. Previously categorized as \"vulnerable,\" the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) still maintains this classification for koalas outside of Australia.\n\nThe decline in the koala population has been attributed in part to recent natural disasters, particularly devastating bushfires that \"killed, injured, or affected\" an estimated 60,000 koalas, according to WWF-Australia. Other contributing factors include prolonged droughts, urbanization, and habitat destruction. In light of this situation, the government has announced efforts aimed at preventing the koala's extinction.\n\nA report published in April 2020 revealed that koala populations in eastern Australia had declined by 50% in Queensland and 62% in New South Wales since 2001. During the same month, WWF-Australia, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), and Humane Society International (HSI) urged the IUCN to reevaluate the species' status, which had remained unchanged for a decade.\n\nA New South Wales inquiry conducted in June 2020 warned that without effective conservation measures, koalas could face extinction by 2050.\n\nIn her statement, Minister Ley attributed this updated classification to the concerning trends observed over recent years. She emphasized that there is still an opportunity to preserve this globally significant species, calling for stronger legal frameworks and incentives for landholders to safeguard koala habitats. Ley also announced that AUD 74 million (USD 52.9 million) has been allocated to support these initiatives.\n\nHowever, some conservation groups have voiced criticism over the government's approach. Deborah Tabart, president of the Australian Koala Foundation, pointed out that the species is also endangered in Victoria and South Australia, and accused the federal government of continuing to approve developments that threaten koala habitats.\n\nHSI campaign director Alexia Wellbelove urged the government to comprehensively tackle environmental challenges. She suggested that a review by the former head of the competition watchdog, who had previously recommended changes to environmental standards and criticized the government’s conservation efforts, would be beneficial."}

This includes a notable bid valued at £50 billion, made on December 20, which GSK believes \"fundamentally undervalued\" the business and its growth potential.\n\nThe news of Unilever's interest in GSK Consumer Healthcare was first reported by a media outlet and later confirmed by both companies. If the acquisition had proceeded, it would have marked the largest transaction since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and one of the most significant in the history of publicly listed companies in the UK.\n\nIntegrating GSK's division would potentially bolster Unilever's beauty and personal care sector, which has faced profit margin challenges due to the economic impacts of the pandemic and rising costs for raw materials.\n\nIn a brief statement on its website, Unilever confirmed it had approached both GSK and Pfizer regarding a potential acquisition and noted that GSK Consumer Healthcare \"would be a strong strategic fit\" as they seek to refine their portfolio. GSK's board undertook a thorough analysis of the proposals but ultimately rejected them, determining that they \"were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders\" and did not properly reflect the core value and future potential of the business.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that the latest offer did not include an acquisition premium or consider the joint venture between GSK and another healthcare firm, which initially projected to generate savings of £500 million by this year. BBC's business editor mentioned that a typical takeover premium might be around 30%, but this could be offset by GSK's predicted £10 billion debt load from its reported £22 billion net debt for Q3 2021.\n\nThe board assessed the offers in light of a proposed demerger of GSK Consumer Healthcare into a separate entity planned for mid-2023. CEO Emma Walmsley previously expressed that GSK would remain open to a trade sale if offered an appropriate price. However, it was noted that Unilever's proposal failed to account for a standard takeover premium, the significant cost-saving potential, and the board's confidence in the division's ability to achieve \"superior organic sales growth\" of 4% to 6% in the medium term. This was despite valuations by analysts estimating the division at around £50 billion, with one firm projecting a lower £45 billion value.\n\nAs of now, there are no current negotiations between Unilever, GSK, or Pfizer, with Unilever stating, \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\" Under CEO Alan Jope's leadership, Unilever has shifted its focus towards brands that demonstrate strong environmental and social purposes, prioritizing smaller acquisitions in sectors like luxury beauty and wellness.\n\nInvestment director Russ Mould from AJ Bell commented that pursuing this acquisition could be a \"high-risk deal\" at a time when investors are wary of GSK's performance. He noted that rising inflation encourages investment in consumer goods that tend to have loyal customers, despite Unilever's recent difficulties in meeting sales and profit margin targets.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, pressure from investors and groups such as Bluebell Capital Partners has been mounting against GSK CEO Emma Walmsley for the unit’s lack of innovation and her own limited scientific background. GSK continues to progress in the development of a new drug in collaboration with a French biopharmaceutical company, recently announcing promising results from Phase 3 trials.\n\nIn 2018, Unilever acquired several consumer nutritional products from GSK, including its flagship product, and merged its subsidiary in India with GSK Consumer Healthcare India."}

Demonstrators rallied to advocate for the legal and accessible right to abortion. This mobilization followed the leak of a draft Supreme Court decision earlier this month, which suggested that a majority of justices were poised to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established federal protection for abortion rights. Protests were notably held in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, and New York, with an estimated 20,000 participants marching in Washington, D.C. alone.\n\n\"It's the most critical issue at stake right now, because if the leaked opinion becomes the final ruling, it could impact numerous rights—beyond just the right to choose, but also the right to healthcare,\" said Ann Hoffman, 79, who has advocated for women's rights since the 1970s.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a small group of anti-abortion counter-protesters also gathered. Virginia resident Anna Lulis, 24, held a sign proclaiming, \"women's rights begin in the womb.\" Police separated the two groups to prevent confrontations, although some clashes did occur.\n\nShould Roe v. Wade be overturned, the legality of abortion will return to the discretion of individual states. Reports indicate that 26 of the country's 50 states are \"certain or likely\" to impose abortion bans. Several states have implemented \"trigger laws\" that would activate automatically if Roe is nullified.\n\nThe leaked draft opinion pertains to a case involving Mississippi, where a law has been enacted that prohibits nearly all abortions after 15 weeks based on the assertion that a 15-week-old fetus might survive outside the womb. This premise contradicts the prevailing understanding that viability occurs around 24 weeks. Through its agent Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi has urged the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 ruling that grants women a constitutional right to abortion. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the sole remaining abortion clinic in the state, argues that there is no valid reason for the Court to take this step.\n\nEarlier this week, Senate members attempted to pass federal legislation affirming the legality of abortion nationwide to counteract state laws, but the effort failed to secure enough votes. This initiative stalled on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the protections established by Roe, many states have enacted laws that restrict abortion access, implementing measures such as mandatory waiting periods that require additional time away from work. Recently, Texas passed a law restricting abortions to the first six weeks after the last menstrual period, a timeframe in which many women are not yet aware they are pregnant.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has urged Americans to vote for pro-abortion rights candidates in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections."}

The postponement, revealed on Friday, includes measures to ban promotional deals incentivizing bulk purchases and restrictions on paid TV advertisements before 9 PM and online marketing.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Department, the delay is attributed to the \"unprecedented global economic situation.\" Officials hope the extension will provide businesses with \"more time to prepare\" for the new advertising restrictions and enable the government to better \"review and monitor\" the effects of the multibuy ban. They noted that rising global energy and goods prices have increased costs throughout supply chains, impacting both businesses and consumers.\n\nInitially set to take effect in October 2022, the ban on multibuy deals is now postponed until October 2023, while the advertising restrictions will be delayed until January 2024. However, rules regarding the placement of unhealthy products in stores, checkouts, and on supermarket websites will still commence as previously scheduled.\n\nChef and campaigner Jamie Oliver criticized the decision, describing it as \"a wasted opportunity\" that undermines the national obesity strategy. He urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson for \"real leadership\" to ensure a healthier future for young people.\n\nBarbara Crowther from the Children's Food Campaign and a prominent London cardiologist echoed Oliver's concerns. Public Health Minister made a commitment to helping people lead healthier lives, while her Labour counterpart described the delay as a significant reversal.\n\nThe government's press release reiterated the importance of addressing obesity, stating it would ease the burden on the NHS, which is currently addressing COVID-19 backlogs. Media, Data, and Digital Minister highlighted the government's investment of £550 million to improve access to sports and physical activity nationwide as part of its effort to tackle childhood obesity.\n\nLabour MP Gwynne criticized the government's decision, suggesting that Johnson's determination to retain his position supersedes the health of children. He accused the current administration of prioritizing political ideology over public health.\n\nReports indicate that the decision was made following a ministerial meeting on the cost of living, during which concerns were raised about the impact the advertising bans would have on the food and advertising sectors. There have been hints that the government may consider retracting the restrictions entirely, which are among the strictest globally. MacGregor lamented that Johnson missed an opportunity to be a pioneering prime minister in addressing obesity meaningfully.\n\nWhen the measures were first proposed in November 2020, a coalition of 800 food and drink manufacturers labeled the ban on junk food advertising as disproportionate, arguing that the evidence supporting the proposals was insufficient. Recently, Kellogg's took legal action against the government over restrictions on product placement in stores.\n\nThe delay has been deemed necessary by some in light of \"high inflation,\" although advocates from the Children’s Food Campaign argue that multibuy deals tend to increase junk food consumption rather than save consumers money. Recent figures indicate that two in five Britons are buying less food, amid warnings from the Bank of England that inflation could exceed 10% this year.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the government has promised a public consultation on TV and paid online advertising. Broadcasters could potentially face a loss of over £200 million in annual revenue if the junk food advertising ban is implemented as planned.\n\nIn addition, the government is promoting its new calorie labeling laws and measures aimed at mitigating the cost of living. A Health Disparities report and the launch of a Better Health: Rewards scheme to combat obesity are also on the agenda."}
{"title": "Hungary extends fuel price cap", "content": "On Saturday, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced a three-month extension of the fuel price cap in Hungary. Initially implemented on November 15, the cap, which was set to expire on Sunday, aims to combat inflation and support the economy. However, the government does not compensate petrol stations for their losses under this policy. Meanwhile, elections are scheduled for April 3, with all but one opposition party striving to challenge the ruling government, which has been in power for twelve years.\n\nDuring his annual address, Orbán shared details about the extension, which was formalized in government resolution No. 39/2022, published in the official gazette the following day. A week prior, Deputy Finance Minister Róbert Tállai reported that tax authority inspections of over 2,000 fuel stations uncovered no systematic violations of the price cap, although 12 stations faced fines totaling HUF 3.2 million (around USD 10,140).\n\nOrbán also noted that the price aggregator site holtankoljak.hu listed uncapped prices at HUF 512 for gasoline and HUF 530 for diesel, indicating that wholesale prices have surpassed consumer prices since February 4. According to Napi.hu, three fuel stations permanently closed in the first week of February due to the price cap, and the government has the authority to appoint new operators for such closed stations.\n\nOn November 10, the government established the HUF 480 (USD 1.52) price cap, which was announced to the press the following day. Related government resolution No. 624/2021 was published on the day of the announcement, with a follow-up resolution detailing procedures released on November 13. The cap applies to gasoline and standard diesel, excluding liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and premium fuels, although stations that sell premium fuels must also offer standard fuels at the capped price.\n\nAs a result, petrol stations are bearing the financial burden as they cannot negotiate wholesale prices. During a press briefing on November 11, a representative from the Prime Minister's Office stated that compensation for these losses is not planned. In a contrasting perspective, the Hungarian Petroleum Association's Secretary General Ottó Grád indicated that owners of small, independent stations might consider shutting down operations. However, the official resolution states that petrol stations are not allowed to temporarily close or reduce their operating hours.\n\nThe government does not intend to reduce taxes on fuel. According to the European Commission's oil bulletin released last week, taxes constitute 47% of the total consumer price for unleaded 95 gasoline and 45% for standard diesel in Hungary.\n\nCumulative data from 2021 by the Hungarian Petroleum Association indicates that unleaded 95 accounts for 79% of all gasoline sales, while standard diesel represents 88% of diesel sales in the country. From November 2020 to November 2021, consumer prices rose, with unleaded 95 increasing from HUF 332 to 506 and standard diesel from HUF 341 to 517, as reported by the price-comparison site holtankoljak.hu. Further complicating matters, 444.hu noted that unfavorable HUF-USD exchange rates contributed to rising prices even in July, despite falling crude oil costs.\n\nAs of January, inflation in Hungary reached 7.9%.

{"title": "Scientists announce decoy-proof Ebola antibodies", "content": "**New Treatment for Ebola and Related Viruses Developed by Scientists**\n\nResearch published Thursday has unveiled a promising new treatment for the deadly disease caused by the Ebola virus and its relatives.\n\nA team from the U.S.-based La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) has identified two antibodies, 1C3 and 1C11, that can effectively target multiple ebolavirus strains.\n\nCurrently, there are no vaccines or antibody therapies available for treating ebolaviruses, aside from the Zaire ebolavirus. LJI President and CEO said, \"Identifying antibodies with such broad applicability is crucial, as we cannot predict which ebolavirus will emerge next.\"\n\nAmong the six known ebolaviruses, Zaire and Sudan are the most lethal, with the Zaire strain being responsible for the outbreak that claimed over 11,000 lives.\n\nA significant contribution of this study is the use of advanced imaging techniques to analyze how and where the antibodies interact with the viruses.\n\nThe research revealed that antibody 1C3 binds differently than expected—rather than the typical approach, it attaches sideways to the viral glycoprotein, blocking three binding sites simultaneously. Antibodies function by latching onto viruses and neutralizing their effects.\n\nMeanwhile, 1C11 disrupts the mechanisms that the virus relies on to invade host cells. Since the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses operate via similar pathways, 1C11 proves effective against both.\n\nA key advantage of these antibodies is their resistance to the excess glycoprotein produced by the viruses when they enter the body. This excess glycoprotein often distracts many of the body's antibodies, leading up to 90 percent to bind to it rather than the actual virus. In contrast, 1C3 and 1C11 selectively bind to the virus itself.\n\nAs a result, treatments utilizing 1C3 and 1C11 may be effective at much lower doses than existing therapies. Initial experiments in non-human primates have shown that even the lowest doses tested were 100 percent effective, suggesting that human treatments could be more affordable to produce than initially thought.\n\nAccording to LJI, therapies based on these two antibodies would provide two primary benefits over current treatments. First, they would be suitable for patients infected with unidentified ebolavirus strains, as the antibody cocktail would work against multiple viruses. This could save lives in critical situations where time is of the essence. Second, these antibodies might also be effective in patients at advanced stages of the disease.\n\nThe experiments were conducted using samples donated by two Ebola survivors.\n\n**Category: Science and Technology**"}

{"title": "Scientists use DNA analysis to track elephant poaching networks", "content": "**New Study Reveals Insights into Elephant Ivory Smuggling Networks**\n\nA research team primarily from the Center for Forensic Science published findings on Monday that uses advanced techniques originally intended for analyzing human teeth to trace the origins of ivory from African elephants.\n\nCollaborating with the United States, the scientists identified criminal networks responsible for the poaching of endangered elephants and the illegal smuggling of their valuable tusks across international borders.\n\nThe study involved DNA sampling from 4,320 tusks taken from two species of elephants: the African savanna elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) and the African forest elephant (*Loxodonta cyclotis*). These tusks were confiscated from 49 separate ivory smuggling incidents across twelve countries between 2002 and 2019. The research revealed that tusks from closely related elephants—and even from the same individual—often appeared in different shipments processed through the same ports. The data indicated shifts in criminal operations between port cities, suggesting that poachers kill elephants and then separate the tusks at various points along the smuggling route.\n\nThe team has been studying DNA analysis of poached tusks for several years. In a significant 2018 discovery, they found two tusks from different shipments that originated from the same animal, linking both shipments to the same kill and smuggling network. This latest report marks the first successful DNA identification of tusks belonging to elephants from the same familial groups.\n\nLead author Dr. Samuel Wasser stated, \"Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely targeting the same populations repeatedly—year after year—while tusks are smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal networks.\" He emphasized that this strategy complicates efforts by authorities to monitor and intercept these shipments, as they face immense pressure to process large volumes of containers quickly through ports.\n\nWasser noted that similar studies could enhance law enforcement's ability to gather evidence for prosecuting poachers and their associates, offering verifiable connections between different caches of confiscated ivory. The researchers concluded that their findings could help authorities better understand the collaborative methods employed by poachers.\n\nHumans have utilized ivory from elephant tusks for artistic, decorative, and practical purposes since prehistoric times. While many countries have banned the sale of ivory, poaching remains a significant threat, with tens of thousands of elephants killed annually.\n\nThe research team included members from the University of Washington, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a Kenyan-based organization, and a Singaporean institution.\n\n**Categories: Science and Technology, Elephants**"}

{"title": "Australian government pays A$20m for copyright to Aboriginal flag", "content": "On Tuesday, just ahead of Australia Day, the Australian government announced it has acquired the copyright for the Aboriginal Flag for AU$20.05 million.\n\nCreated by Harold Thomas in 1970, the flag symbolizes the deep connection of Aboriginal people to the land. Although it was officially adopted as a national flag in 1995, the copyright remained with Thomas, meaning its use required his approval or compensation.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the flag would now be treated similarly to the Australian national flag, allowing anyone to use it as long as it is displayed \"respectfully and dignifiedly.\"\n\nMorrison emphasized, \"All Australians can now display the Aboriginal Flag on apparel such as sports jerseys and shirts; it can be painted on sports grounds, featured on websites, included in artworks, and used in any medium without needing permission or incurring fees. We’ve freed the Aboriginal Flag for Australians.\"\n\nIndigenous Affairs Minister said: \"For the past 50 years, we have embraced Harold Thomas’ artwork as our own — we have marched under the Aboriginal Flag, stood behind it, and proudly flown it.\"\n\n\"Now that the government holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and it can never be taken away.\"\n\nConcerns regarding the commercial arrangements surrounding the flag were highlighted in 2019 when WAM Clothing, a licensed clothing company, issued notices to the NRL and AFL, claiming that jerseys worn during their Indigenous rounds infringed its copyright. At that time, Wyatt encouraged fans to express their discontent by wearing the flag.\n\nUnder the agreement, the government paid AU$20.05 million to Thomas and other license holders to secure the copyright and reclaim the rights held by licensees. The government plans to:\n- Allocate future royalties from commercial flag sales to support Indigenous initiatives,\n- Establish a AU$100,000 scholarship in Thomas' honor for Indigenous students to develop leadership skills,\n- Accept and display a painting by Thomas that celebrates the flag's 50th anniversary and the transfer of copyright,\n- Create a web portal dedicated to the flag’s history and educational resources.\n\nAboriginal woman Geraldine Atkinson expressed her delight at the government acquiring the flag, calling it a reason for Indigenous Australians to celebrate on Australia Day. \"When I read the news, I couldn't contain my excitement. We're not celebrating the day, but rather our flag and what it represents,\" she said.\n\nWhile Senator welcomed the news, she expressed caution regarding the ownership of the copyright. \"I’m concerned about the implications of the Commonwealth owning the copyright for our flag and what it means for our people’s self-determination,\" she remarked. \"We must engage in genuine discussions about the ramifications of this decision and whether alternative models of community ownership were thoroughly explored. Currently, this feels like a win.\"\n\nSenator also stated her intention to scrutinize the deal closely during the Senate's upcoming budget estimates, saying, \"I look forward to investigating this deal and reviewing its details, especially concerning copyright and custodianship of the flag.\" McCarthy added, \"Scott Morrison and the Indigenous Affairs Minister need to clarify the funding sources for this deal.\""}

He first drove to a nearby street, where the device was loaded into the vehicle, before heading to the Holy Cross Chapel adjacent to the Houben Centre where Coveney was speaking.\n\nCoveney was reportedly just minutes into his address when security personnel informed him of the bomb threat, leading to his swift evacuation to a \"secure location\" by PSNI officers.\n\nWitness Sarah McKinley described the hijacked driver as a \"workman clutching a toolbag\" who appeared distraught outside the venue, apologizing to guests after relaying his ordeal to security. She noted that he was \"completely shellshocked\" and revealed that he had been forced into driving the van.\n\nMcEwan confirmed that the driver is receiving treatment in hospital, though he did not disclose the specifics of his condition. \"Just think about this: the victim believed he was driving a van containing a live bomb, while his family was under threat,\" McEwan said.\n\nHe added that a security threat persists in Northern Ireland, warning that \"an attack is likely.\" However, he did not clarify whether the weapons used to threaten the driver were real, only noting that the situation felt genuine at the time. It remains unclear if Coveney was specifically targeted or if he requires enhanced security, especially given previous loyalist graffiti depicting him alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nA source indicated that loyalists hold Coveney and Varadkar responsible for feelings of being undermined due to the contentious post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. It is believed the bomb threat was a premeditated response linked to these sentiments.\n\nThis incident comes shortly after the United Kingdom's counter-intelligence agency, MI5, downgraded its terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland from \"severe\" to \"substantial\" on Tuesday. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris stated this change reflects \"the significant progress that Northern Ireland has made towards a more peaceful, prosperous, and safer society.\" However, he emphasized the need for continued vigilance against the \"minority\" that threatens this peace.\n\nPoliticians across Ireland and the UK have condemned the attack. Coveney expressed his \"sadness and frustration\" that an individual had been victimized and targeted in this manner, referring to the driver. He characterized the hijacker as part of the \"small minority willing to use violence to advance their aims.\"\n\nTim Attwood, the leader of the Northern Irish Foundation involved in the event, labeled the attack as an \"attempt to drag us back\" and reiterated the organization's commitment to promoting peace and reconciliation. \"A suspect device will not stop the work of the John and Pat Hume Foundation,\" he assured.\n\nThe bomb threat led to disruptions at local schools and a nursing home and even forced the cancellation of a funeral. Priest Gary Donegan remarked on the mindless nature of the actions taken, saying, \"Forget about the actual event itself; there’s a family grieving who now couldn’t even have a funeral.\" McEwan condemned the incident as \"clearly designed to cause maximum disruption to the local community.\"\n\nBefore the interruption, Coveney emphasized the importance of continuing"}

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland designated the term as derogatory last November.\n\n\"Considering these replacement names marks a significant step forward in our commitment to eliminating outdated derogatory terms,\" said Haaland, the first Native American to hold a position in the U.S. Cabinet. \"Throughout this process, we will prioritize engagement with tribes, stakeholders, and the public to promote equity and inclusion.\"\n\nThe affected geographic sites are spread across Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, California, and seven other states.

{"title": "Italian President Sergio Mattarella re-elected for second term, ending successor row", "content": "Italy's incumbent President, Sergio Mattarella, was re-elected for a second seven-year term on Wednesday, after an eighth round of voting to find a successor proved unsuccessful.\n\nAt 80 years old, Mattarella had previously indicated his intention to step down, even going so far as to rent an apartment in Rome in preparation for his departure from the presidential palace at Quirinale. However, he ultimately decided to remain in office due to significant pressure from leading political figures, including Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who emphasized the need for stability in the Republic. Mattarella's first term was set to end on February 3.\n\nDuring discussions at Quirinale, parliamentarians urging him to stay reported Mattarella stating, \"I had other plans, but if needed, I am at your disposal.\" The process of selecting a successor involved an electoral college of 1,009 \"grand electors,\" consisting of 321 Senators, 630 Members of Parliament, and 58 regional representatives, resulting in seven rounds of voting without a consensus candidate.\n\nReuters noted that the failure of Parliament to unite behind a compromise candidate reflected \"deep scars, with potentially dangerous repercussions for political stability\" in Italy. There was an enthusiastic response in the Chamber of Deputies when Mattarella exceeded the two-thirds majority requirement for re-election, securing a total of 759 votes.\n\nStatements from party leaders following the vote largely supported Mattarella's continued presidency. Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-migrant League party, said, \"Italians don't deserve further days of confusion,\" advocating for “President Mattarella at Quirinale and Draghi at the government.” Draghi, who was also considered a candidate for the presidency, described the outcome as \"splendid news for Italians\" and expressed gratitude to Mattarella for complying with the strong will of Parliament.\n\nDespite general agreement from many political leaders, Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, sharply criticized the decision, stating that \"Parliament has shown it is not fit for Italians.\" Meloni accused her allies of \"bartering away\" the presidency and called for a reevaluation of their coalition. She also expressed surprise that Mattarella would accept re-election after previously rejecting the idea, advocating instead for Draghi to assume the role, which could create a vacancy in the Prime Minister position and potentially lead to early elections.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, leader of Italy's largest populist party, endorsed Mattarella, describing him as \"the guarantor of everybody, impartial and authoritative.\" Conte had resigned as Prime Minister in 2021 over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThough primarily a ceremonial role, the President holds significant powers, including appointing the Prime Minister and dissolving Parliament, which can be crucial during political crises. This situation arises amid significant fragmentation in Italian politics, where governments often last only a year due to instability.\n\nMattarella has been praised for navigating Italy out of a brief political crisis by appointing a broad coalition government led by Draghi, an independent who previously served as the President of the European Central Bank. According to Wolfango Piccoli from the advisory firm Teneo, the political landscape has grown less favorable for Draghi's administration, which faces substantial challenges in the remaining year of its term.\n\nCritics argue that the choice to re-elect a reluctant incumbent reflects Italy's political divisions. There have been calls for the election of the country's first female president or someone younger, highlighting a perceived lack of innovation among MPs. Despite the lack of alternative candidates, support for Mattarella remained a rare point of consensus among lawmakers, as noted by Forza Italia national coordinator, who spoke in a BBC interview.\n\nMattarella, viewed as a traditional and unassuming leader, was first elected in 2015. He has held various governmental roles throughout his career, including Minister of Education, Minister of Defense, and Judge of the Constitutional Court, along with two decades as a Member of Parliament. His family has a long history in politics; his father was a founder of the Christian Democracy party, and his brother, who was President of Sicily, was assassinated in 1980.\n\nPotential candidates mentioned by Agence France-Presse prior to the vote included former Prime Ministers Romano Prodi and Matteo Renzi, along with former Chamber of Deputies President Laura Boldrini. Female candidates considered were current and former ministers and the President of the Senate."}

Over its expected five-to-ten-year mission, the telescope will focus on studying the most distant galaxies, providing insights into the universe's earliest formations following the Big Bang.\n\nDuring its journey, referred to as \"30 days of terror,\" the telescope successfully deployed its 21-foot (6.4 meter) wide mirror, unfurled its solar panels, and cooled to temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit at the L2 point. \n\nThe L2 location is an advantageous site for spacecraft, where the gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth are balanced. Full scientific operations are scheduled to commence later this year, involving 13 teams of scientists. The primary objective of this mission is to identify the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang, thereby contributing to our understanding of the universe's origins. The nominal mission duration is five years, with a potential extension to ten years. Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, which operates much closer to Earth, the James Webb's instruments will face away from the Sun, enhancing the clarity of its observational data.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on December 25 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, after reaching the site in October. The launch date was pushed back by a week due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe project was initiated by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1996, originally aiming for a launch in 2007 at a budget of $550 million. After contracting Northrop Grumman to construct the telescope, mission managers projected that a 2010 launch would cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion. However, redesigns to mitigate technical challenges delayed the launch to 2013 with an updated budget of $4.5 billion. A project review ordered by Congress in 2010 further postponed the launch to 2015.\n\nIn 2011, the proposed cancellation of the project, estimated to eventually cost $6.5 billion, was tabled. Following a revised plan for a 2018 launch at an anticipated budget of $8.8 billion, additional technical issues and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the launch to 2021."}

{"title": "Ethics chief: UK PM's reforms after Partygate \"highly unsatisfactory\", won't \"restore public trust\"", "content": "The Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life has strongly criticized UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed amendments to the ministerial code following recent controversies, describing the changes as “highly unsatisfactory.”\n\nThe watchdog condemned the revisions announced last week, which allow ministers to continue serving even after breaching the code and maintain restrictions on the ethics adviser’s ability to initiate investigations without the Prime Minister’s consent. The Chair, Lord Evans, warned that “suspicion about how the ministerial code is managed will persist” unless the ethics adviser, currently Lord Geidt, is granted greater independence in scrutinizing ministerial conduct.\n\nIn a blog post published on Monday, Evans reiterated the Committee's recommendation that breaches of the code should be met with a range of graduated sanctions rather than the previous \"all-or-nothing approach\" that has caused unease among past prime ministers. However, he noted that the government's proposed reforms still tie investigations to the Prime Minister’s approval while suggesting penalties such as public apologies, fines, or resignation requests.\n\nJohnson dismissed Geidt’s concerns regarding the “legitimate question” of whether receiving a fixed penalty notice for violating Covid-19 restrictions in June 2020 constituted a breach of the code. In a letter on Tuesday, the Prime Minister asserted, “taking account of all the circumstances, I did not breach the code,” claiming he upheld “the principles of leadership and accountability” in clearing the parliamentary record.\n\nGeidt has criticized the “circular process” that could undermine the credibility of the ministerial code, reportedly considering his resignation on Tuesday. He indicated that he had advised Johnson’s team that the Prime Minister should publicly address his obligations under the ministerial code, but his suggestions went unheeded.\n\nEvans supported Geidt’s position, stating, “an adviser who believes their advice will be disregarded will simply choose not to offer it at all, which has already created a precedent for resignations.”\n\nMeanwhile, a wave of Conservative MPs has been submitting letters of no confidence to the party’s 1922 Committee, chaired by Sir Graham Brady. A compilation by the BBC on Wednesday indicated that at least 28 MPs, part of a 54 MP threshold, have publicly called for Johnson's resignation, with others potentially having submitted letters in private. The group includes former ministers, committee chairs, and backbenchers from across the Brexit spectrum.\n\nAmong the latest dissenters, MP for Angus, Scotland, stated to constituents, “It beggars belief that while the government was working to support people during the pandemic, a rotten core with an unacceptable culture continued, disregarding the same restrictions placed on the public.”\n\nAnother Conservative MP expressed no confidence, emphasizing that although Johnson has asserted that measures for systemic change have been implemented, “until I see real evidence of leadership that listens and adapts, I am not prepared to defend it.”\n\nMinisters have accused rebel Tories of doing \"the opposition’s work,\" with Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries stating that focusing on dissenters is merely a \"sideshow\" and urging colleagues to \"forget it.\"\n\nJohnson had previously overruled the decision of Geidt's predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, who determined that Priti Patel had \"not consistently met the high standards expected of her” in 2020, leading to Sir Alex's resignation. He noted, “It is for the Prime Minister to judge whether a minister's actions amount to a breach of the ministerial code,” but added, “I feel it is right for me to resign now.”\n\nTim Durrant, associate director for the Institute for Government, commented to The Guardian, “The ongoing issues surrounding behavior and propriety within this government have highlighted the limitations of the code and of Lord Geidt's role.”"}
{"title": "Scientists discover seagrass off Australia is world's largest plant", "content": "Scientists at the University of Western Australia released a study on Wednesday identifying an extensive seagrass meadow off the coast of Western Australia as the world's largest known plant. This remarkable organism is believed to have started cloning itself approximately 4,500 years ago and spans around 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) within Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The bay was submerged relatively recently, within the last 8,500 years.\n\nIn their research, the scientists analyzed 18,000 distinct genetic markers from the seagrass in an effort to identify samples for restoration projects. Instead, they were surprised to find that the entire meadow is a single organism that has reproduced clonally many times. Dr. Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, remarked, “We thought, 'What the hell is going on here?' We were completely stumped.” Co-author Jane Edgeloe explained that the analysis of the DNA samples revealed the seagrass meadow's singular plant identity.\n\nRemarkably, this plant is about three times the size of Manhattan, measuring at least 180 kilometers (112 miles) in length. Not only does it hold the title of the largest known plant, but it is also recognized as the largest clone in existence. The seagrass dwarfs the previously-held record of a 43-hectare colony of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States. It grows at a maximum rate of 35 centimeters per year, which helps researchers estimate its age accurately.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, highlighted that the plant's ability to survive has been bolstered by retaining all chromosomes from both parent plants, resulting in genetic diversity—a rarity among asexually reproducing plants. While the plant does not reproduce sexually, small variations in its DNA could account for its longevity.\n\nAssociate Professor Kathryn McMahon from Edith Cowan University, who was not involved in the study but specializes in seagrass, shared that seagrass generally lives between 2,000 and 100,000 years. Thus, the estimated age of this plant at approximately 4,500 years aligns with typical seagrass lifespans. McMahon expressed confidence in the researchers' methods, finding it \"amazing\" that they confirmed it to be a single plant.\n\nDespite its vast size, nearly 10% of the seagrass has been lost over the past decade due to cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, changes linked to climate change, as noted by NBC News. Additionally, the bay experiences relatively high salinity, with temperatures ranging from as cold as 10°C to as hot as 35°C."}
{"title": "Peltola defeats Palin, Begich in Alaska special election for US House of Representatives", "content": "In a special election held on Wednesday, Democrat Mary Peltola secured Alaska's only seat in the United States House of Representatives, defeating Republican candidates Sarah Palin, the former governor of the state, and Nick Begich III, grandson of a former representative.\n\nThe election was necessitated by the passing of Representative Don Young, who had held the seat since 1973. \n\nDespite receiving only 40.20% of the votes in the initial round, Peltola benefited from Alaska's ranked-choice voting system, introduced in 2020. After Begich was eliminated as the candidate with the fewest votes, Peltola clinched the win with 51.47% of the final tally against Palin. She will now serve the remainder of Young's term until the upcoming election, which both Palin and Begich plan to contest.\n\nPeltola's victory marks a significant milestone as she is the first Democrat to hold the seat since her predecessor Begich Sr. was presumed dead following a plane crash in 1972. CNN reporter Eric Bradner noted that Palin's defeat is likely to heighten concerns among Republicans about regaining control of the House. Political analyst Nathaniel Rakich characterized Palin as a \"very flawed\" and controversial candidate, suggesting that she was less likely than Begich to succeed in a direct contest against Peltola.\n\nIn response to her loss, Palin attributed the election results to the ranked-choice voting system, labeling it as \"crazy, convoluted, and confusing.\" Begich, while congratulating Peltola, stated that \"a vote for Sarah Palin is, in reality, a vote for Mary Peltola,\" arguing that Palin lacks sufficient support among Alaskans to win an election."}

He was elected pope following the death of his predecessor on August 26, 1978, but tragically passed away just 33 days later on September 29, leading to the election of Pope John Paul II. In reflecting on John Paul I's legacy, Pope Francis stated: \"How beautiful is a church with a happy, serene, and smiling face, that never closes doors, never hardens hearts, never complains or harbors resentment, does not grow angry or impatient, and does not look dour or suffer nostalgia for the past.\"\n\nThe beatification process for Pope John Paul I is the last step before sainthood and requires two verified miracles. Last year, Pope Francis attributed a miraculous recovery to him related to a critically ill Argentine girl, attributed to the prayers of her parents. A second miracle will need to be validated before he can be canonized.\n\nDespite widespread skepticism, the circumstances surrounding John Paul I's unexpected death have fueled conspiracy theories, particularly following initial reports from the Vatican that mistakenly stated a priest discovered his body, later corrected to mention two nuns. The Vatican has declared that he died of a heart attack, but no autopsy was performed.\n\nStefania Falasca, the deputy supporting the push for John Paul I's sainthood and author of several books on him, denounced the conspiracy theories as \"publicity-driven garbage.\" Cardinal and Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin also addressed the rumors on Italian television, asserting: \"It was a natural death.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi acknowledged the \"increased military activity in the area\" but emphasized that the team would continue its mission without hesitation. Their arrival was reportedly delayed for several hours due to shelling in and around the nearby city of Enerhodar.\n\nUkraine's state nuclear power company, Energoatom, reported that shelling had caused the shutdown of the plant's fifth reactor, leaving only one operational. Both Ukraine and Russia have traded accusations of sabotage: Kyiv has alleged that Moscow shelled the route taken by IAEA inspectors.\n\nIn a related incident, Russia accused Ukraine of launching a failed amphibious assault to regain control of the facility early yesterday morning.\n\nGrossi stated that the team’s immediate mission is to assess the security and safety situation at Zaporizhzhia, with the goal of establishing a permanent presence to stabilize the situation and provide regular, reliable updates. Russia's representative to the IAEA in Vienna expressed support for such a presence.\n\nAfter assessing \"key observations,\" some inspectors, including Grossi, have since departed, while five team members will remain until tomorrow, according to Energoatom.

{"title": "Irish energy supplier Bord Gáis hikes rates for gas, electricity", "content": "**Price Hikes for Residential Energy Customers in Ireland**\n\nIreland’s energy provider announced significant price increases yesterday, which will see residential customers facing an average additional charge of €48.25 for electricity and €43.80 for gas each month. This decision follows similar announcements from competitors including Electric Ireland and Prepay Power.\n\nEffective October 2, electricity rates will rise by an average of 34%, while gas prices will increase by 39%. The supplier cited soaring wholesale energy costs as the driving factor behind this decision, stating, \"these increases leave us with no choice.\" It's important to note that standing charges will remain unchanged. This translates to an annual increase of approximately €579 for electricity and €526 for gas, based on typical consumption figures of 4,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) for electricity and 11,000 kWh for gas.\n\nOn the same day, Russian energy giant Gazprom announced it would suspend natural gas supplies to Europe indefinitely via its pipeline due to a leak that requires repair.\n\nEarlier this year, Bord Gáis raised costs for its 513,000 commercial and residential customers nationwide, implementing a 27% increase for electricity and a 39% hike for gas in March. In total, the company has raised electricity rates three times and gas rates twice over the past year. Daragh Cassidy of Bonkers.ie estimates that bills have increased by around €1,300 for electricity and €1,000 for gas since last year.\n\nCassidy noted, “The average gas and electricity bill now stands at about €4,000, nearing the UK price cap of £3,549,\" emphasizing that over 70% of Ireland's gas comes from the UK.\n\nBord Gáis Energy's managing director Dave Kirwan expressed regret over the need for these price hikes, citing the dramatic rise in wholesale energy costs and pledging to work towards minimizing the impact on customers. He announced that the company would allocate one-tenth of its operating profits to an energy support fund in collaboration with various organizations to assist those struggling to meet the increases.\n\nA financial report from July 28 revealed that Bord Gáis' parent company based in the UK recorded a 74% rise in operating profits, reaching £33 million (€38 million) in the first half of 2022, partly due to a resurgence in activity.\n\nThe rising utility costs are intensifying pressure on the government, particularly in light of a €6.3 billion surplus observed in the eight months leading to August. Following Electric Ireland’s announcements of a 26.7% increase in residential electricity rates and a 37.5% increase in gas, Taoiseach Micheál Martin indicated that the European Commission would initiate emergency measures to address market challenges. He attributed the price hikes to a broader surge in energy costs and promised a strategy aimed at reducing overall energy consumption.\n\nAddressing financial aid, Martin stated, \"We will utilize the Budget along with a cost-of-living package to help alleviate pressures on households.\"\n\nThe significant surplus reported for the government was supported by unexpectedly high corporate tax revenues in August and robust gains in income tax collections. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe emphasized the need to balance protection for vulnerable households and businesses amid the unprecedented energy price crisis while avoiding further inflationary pressures.\n\nOpposition leader Mary Lou McDonald called for \"an unprecedented, urgent and short-term response from the government,\" arguing that the current situation is unsustainable for individuals, families, and small businesses. She proposed measures such as a windfall tax on excess profits from energy companies, which the government is reportedly considering, as well as immediate price caps and broadened eligibility for fuel allowances.\n\nEuropean Union ministers are set to convene in Brussels next week to discuss immediate actions aimed at stabilizing gas prices and long-term market reforms over the coming year.\n\nAdditionally, the G7 countries, including EU members France, Germany, and Italy, agreed yesterday to implement a price ceiling on Russian oil, expected to take effect in December. The Russian government has reduced energy supplies to Europe since the invasion of Ukraine began, driving prices higher and risking blackouts across the continent. At the time of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline's operational suspension, it was supplying only a fifth of its daily capacity, according to energy consultancy firm Aurora's senior associate Jacob Mandel."}

This incident occurred when a large group of Donald Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to disrupt Congress's certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Prosecutors allege that the riot was premeditated rather than a spontaneous outburst.\n\nTarrio faces additional charges linked to the January 6 events; however, today's indictment marks a significant escalation. He, along with Proud Boys members Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Dominic Pezzola, is accused of conspiring to prevent then-President-elect Joe Biden from assuming office by organizing the riot. All five individuals have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe indictment details how the accused allegedly met and strategized the assault on the Capitol, often using encrypted communications. Prosecutors claim they procured Baofeng radios to facilitate coordination among rioters without detection. On January 6, Proud Boys members purportedly breached metal barricades and led other rioters into the Capitol building. While Tarrio is accused of aiding in the planning, he did not enter the Capitol himself, having been arrested two days prior for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner, for which he served five months in prison.\n\nThe charge of \"seditious conspiracy,\" which dates back to the Civil War era, could lead to a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if the defendants are convicted.\n\nCarmen Hernandez, attorney for Zachary Rehl, stated, \"Seditious conspiracy requires the use of force, and [Rehl] never used any force nor thought about using any force.\"\n\nFederal authorities have identified over three dozen Proud Boys members in leadership roles during the January 6 attack, with some having already pleaded guilty or agreed to cooperate with the prosecution.\n\nThe Proud Boys characterize themselves as \"western chauvinists,\" and the Southern Poverty Law Center designates them as a hate group.\n\n**Categories:** Crime and Law, United States, Politics and Conflicts"}

This meeting followed Johnson’s farewell meeting with the Queen, during which he tendered his official resignation.\n\nPrior to today, Truss served as the Foreign Secretary and won the party leadership race against former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, securing 81,326 votes against Sunak's 60,399. Johnson's resignation in July, prompted by significant pressure from high-profile scandals, left his successor uncertain until now.\n\nThe UK faces significant challenges, including soaring food and energy prices contributing to an inflation rate projected to reach 13% in October, the highest in 42 years. Additionally, ongoing tensions from the war in Ukraine and strained relations with the European Union pose further tests for Truss's government, according to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\nFollowing her election, Truss emphasized her commitment to a bold agenda aimed at cutting taxes and stimulating economic growth. \"I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills, but also tackling the long-term issues we face regarding energy supply,\" she stated. She reaffirmed her belief in the principles of freedom, low taxes, and personal responsibility, promising to fulfill the party's commitments made to voters during the 2019 election.\n\nIn a supportive post on Twitter, Rishi Sunak urged unity behind Truss, stating, \"It’s right we now unite behind the new PM, Liz Truss, as she steers the country through difficult times.\"\n\nBoris Johnson also expressed his support for Truss, writing, \"I know she has the right plan to tackle the cost of living crisis, unite our party, and continue the great work of bringing our country together.

While the resolution is mainly symbolic, it underscores the unity and cooperation between the two NATO allies. This development follows the establishment of a working group in 2018, aimed at resolving the dispute, informally known as the \"Whisky War.\"\n\nThe contention dates back to 1971, as Hans Island is situated at an equal distance from Canada and Greenland, which is a territory of Denmark. The dispute gained its quirky name in 1984 when Canadian troops left a bottle of Canadian whisky and the Canadian flag on the island, prompting Denmark's Greenland affairs minister to visit the island, replace the Canadian flag with Denmark's, and leave behind Danish schnapps.\n\nThis led to a tradition where officials, scientists, and soldiers from both nations would visit the island to remove the other's flag, raise their own, and leave either Canadian whisky or Danish schnapps for their counterparts.\n\nIn a press release, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly described the Arctic region as a \"beacon for international cooperation, where the rule of law prevails.\" She added, \"As global security becomes increasingly threatened, it’s more important than ever for democracies like Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark to work together, alongside Indigenous peoples, to resolve our differences in accordance with international law.\"\n\nHer Danish counterpart, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, remarked that sovereignty over the island had been contested \"for more than 50 years,\" and noted that the ongoing efforts between the two countries \"demonstrate our firm commitment to resolve international disputes peacefully.\" He expressed hope that \"our negotiation and the spirit of this agreement\" would serve as an inspiration for other nations, particularly at a time when respect for the international rules-based order is under pressure."}

{"title": "First deep space images from James Webb Space Telescope released", "content": "On Monday, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and President Joe Biden unveiled the first image captured by the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), showcasing an unprecedented view of the universe.\n\nThe image, titled \"Webb's First Deep Field,\" reveals thousands of galaxies situated within the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327, approximately 4.6 billion light-years from Earth. Notably, the area depicted in the image constitutes only a fraction of the total sky. This composite image was created by stitching together multiple smaller images captured across various wavelengths, achieving unprecedented depth that surpasses the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb’s predecessor.\n\nThe James Webb Telescope has been in its orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2) since January 24, positioned about 1.5 million kilometers (around 930,000 miles) from Earth, on the opposite side of the planet. This marked the completion of a month-long journey that commenced in late December 2021, after years of delays and cost overruns. The telescope is anticipated to operate for five to ten years, focusing on the most distant and earliest galaxies formed after the Big Bang.\n\nOften referred to as \"30 days of terror,\" the mission's initial phase saw the successful deployment of the telescope's stunning 6.5-meter-wide mirror and its sunshield, while it cooled down to below 50 degrees Kelvin as it made its way to the L2 point.\n\nL2 serves as a stable spot for spacecraft, where the gravitational forces of the Sun and Earth are balanced. During the telescope's full scientific operations, thirteen teams of scientists will work together to investigate the cosmos. The primary mission is to locate the most distant galaxies formed after the Big Bang, in an effort to better understand the origins of the universe. The telescope's orbit differs significantly from that of the Hubble Space Telescope, which operates much closer to Earth. The James Webb's instruments face away from the Sun, allowing it to achieve superior image clarity.\n\nThe JWST was launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on December 25 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, after arriving at the launch site in October. Its launch was delayed by a week due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nOriginally, NASA began the project in 1996, with plans for a launch in 2007 at an estimated cost of $550 million. However, after contracting Northrop Grumman for construction, the estimated launch date was pushed to 2010 with a cost of $1 billion to $3.5 billion. Technical redesigns escalated the budget to an estimated $4.5 billion by the revised 2013 launch target. A review mandated by Congress in 2010 further postponed the launch to 2015.\n\nIn 2011, due to rising costs estimated at $6.5 billion, there were proposals to cancel the project entirely. After rescheduling the launch for 2018 at an estimated cost of $8.8 billion, additional technical issues and the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately moved the launch to 2021."}

The ministry noted that authorities had intentionally disabled their border crossing management software \"[i]n order to neutralize the criminal act and secure the systems,\" leading to reported delays at border crossings.\n\nOn Wednesday, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama accused Iran of orchestrating the July 15 attack against Albanian institutions, describing it as an attempt to \"paralyze public services and extract data from government systems.\" Although he stated that the attack ultimately failed, Rama announced that Albania was severing diplomatic ties with Iran, granting Iranian embassy staff 24 hours to exit the country. The Associated Press reported this as the first documented instance of diplomatic relations being cut due to a cyberattack.\n\nIn response, Iran labeled the accusations as \"baseless\" and criticized Albania's decision to terminate diplomatic ties as \"ill-considered and short-sighted.\"\n\nAdditionally, on Friday, the United States imposed sanctions related to the July attack. Both NATO, of which Albania is a member, and the European Union condemned the incident.\n\nThe adversarial relationship between Iran and Albania has been in place since 2013, when Albania agreed to host members of the Iranian opposition group, known as the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), at the request of the U.S. and the United Nations.

However, achieving these constitutional amendments could be challenging; it necessitates a two-thirds majority, or 80 votes, in parliament. Opposition parties, which hold a total of 46 votes, have indicated they will resist this change, arguing that the proposal undermines North Macedonia's cultural identity, language, and heritage. Macron has assured that the agreement does not question the country's existence, and both he and the ruling coalition of North Macedonia have characterized the proposal as a necessary compromise.\n\nThe agreement has also faced backlash in Bulgaria. While Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov has accepted the deal and agreed to lift the veto on North Macedonia's EU membership, some of his allies have labeled it a \"national betrayal.\" This political turmoil contributed to the collapse of Petkov's government following a no-confidence vote on June 22.\n\nNorth Macedonia has been an EU candidate country for 17 years, with its path to EU membership previously obstructed first by Greece and later by Bulgaria.

{"title": "Conservationists capture most massive Burmese python in Florida history", "content": "Biologists in Florida announced Wednesday that they have captured a colossal Burmese python (Python bivittatus) measuring nearly 19 feet and weighing 215 pounds (97 kg) in the state's wetlands. This specimen could be the largest of its kind ever found outside its native habitat in Southeast Asia. \n\nThe previous record in Florida was held by an 18-foot, 9-inch (5.7 m) python discovered in 2020, which weighed 104 pounds (47.2 kg). The current capture was part of a search documented by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. In December 2021, the research team tagged a male \"scout snake\" named Dionysius with a GPS tracking device and released him into the western Everglades.\n\n\"Finding a needle in a haystack can be daunting, but just as a magnet attracts metal, our male scout snakes are drawn to the largest females in the area,\" explained Ian Bartoszek, the project manager. \n\nBurmese pythons are an invasive species in Florida, and the Conservancy's preferred method for controlling their population involves removing females before they can lay eggs. When the team observed that Dionysius had remained in one location for several weeks, they deduced he had found a sexually mature female and prepared to retrieve him.\n\nThe capture required 20 minutes of effort and the strength of three adults to transport the snake to a vehicle, from where it was taken to a laboratory and euthanized. A necropsy revealed the python contained over 122 healthy but unfertilized egg follicles.\n\nOriginally introduced to Florida in the 1970s, Burmese pythons are believed to have escaped or been released by pet owners who could no longer care for them. The devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also led to the escape of many snakes from breeding facilities, contributing to their explosive population growth.\n\nSince their introduction, pythons have significantly disrupted the food chain by preying on native wildlife, including endangered species. Notably, this snake was found to have remnants of a deer in its stomach.\n\nRecognizing the threat these pythons pose to Florida's ecosystem, the state actively sponsors an annual python hunt, with a grand prize of $2,500 for the top participant."}

This innovative polyurethane serves as a substitute for traditional materials in foams and footwear.\n\nConducted at the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier and Experimental Aquarium, the research involved cutting the polyurethane into cubes that mimicked the size and shape of naturally occurring EVA plastics. The scientists observed that various marine bacteria and fungi colonized the polyurethane, breaking it down into its constituent chemicals, which were then consumed as food. After four weeks of immersion, the samples had already shown notable degradation.\n\n\"Improper disposal of plastics in the ocean breaks down into microplastics, creating a significant environmental issue,\" said Stephen Mayfield, co-author of the study and director of the California Center for Algae Biotechnology. \"Our research demonstrates that it is indeed feasible to create high-performance plastic products that can also degrade in marine environments.\"\n\nEach year, approximately 8 billion kilograms of plastic are introduced into the oceans, where it can be mistaken for food by marine life. Natural processes break down larger plastic debris into microplastics, while larger accumulations contribute to the formation of structures like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Notably, about half of this patch consists of commercial fishing waste, such as discarded nets. While addressing post-consumer plastic waste would significantly alleviate the global plastic crisis, reducing oceanic plastic pollution remains crucial.\n\nThe versatility of this biodegradable polyurethane extends to manufacturing shoe components, a significant contributor to global plastic waste."}

The U.S. reported that many Russian soldiers have withdrawn from Ukraine, corroborating claims from Russia that their front lines have been breached. While current reports indicate that over 1,000 casualties have been confirmed, the actual numbers are likely higher. The Kremlin has dismissed calls for peace negotiations, asserting that Russia will persist in achieving its objectives in what it refers to as a \"special military operation.\"\n\nUkrainian forces made significant progress, recapturing Vovchansk on September 13, as reported by Ukraine's border guard.

During his leadership, he implemented significant reforms known as perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness). These policies contributed to substantial reductions in nuclear arsenals and played a pivotal role in the conclusion of the Cold War, which began shortly after World War II. Ultimately, they also led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union itself.\n\n\"I began these reforms with freedom and democracy as my guiding principles, aiming for change without bloodshed. The goal was for the people to cease being a herd led by a shepherd and instead become citizens,\" Gorbachev once remarked about his vision.\n\n\"[Gorbachev] granted freedom to hundreds of millions in Russia and beyond, as well as to much of Europe,\" noted Russian politician Alexei Kudrin. \"Few leaders in history have exerted such a profound influence on their era.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who has previously expressed interest in reversing the Soviet Union's dissolution, conveyed his \"deepest condolences,\" according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov."}

We sent out expressions of interest and spoke to many potential players in the Sunshine Coast area, and we've received an overwhelming response from those eager to join Brothers next year.\"\n\nIn 2022, Brothers participated in the newly established Sunshine Coast Cup competition, marking the club's first season in senior rugby. Haines reflected on their performance, stating, \"We had a really successful Friday night competition. The Cricks Sunshine Coast Cup went well for us, and many of our players are looking to move up to the reserve grade and A grade based on their performance this year.\"\n\nThe club announced its coaching staff on November 19 and began player recruitment in early December. \"We're all very excited about the prospect of A grade and reserve grade in 2023. I expect that the club will rally around these opportunities more strongly than ever,\" said Haines.\n\nThe Brothers brand is also present in several other Australian clubs across various competitions in Queensland and Brisbane. Haines noted, \"We are fortunate to be part of a larger Brothers fraternity that extends up the east coast and beyond. They have been incredibly supportive of us, and we're grateful for the large number of players from the Coast and surrounding areas who want to join our club.\""}
