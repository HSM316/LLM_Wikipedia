If passed, adults 21 and older could legally possess up to one ounce of marijuana and cultivate up to six mature plants and six seedlings at home.  The initiative also includes provisions for expunging some past marijuana possession convictions.  Revenue generated from taxing marijuana sales would fund the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority, with the remainder distributed as follows: 30% to the state's general fund, 30% to public school programs (improving student success, extracurricular activities, and reducing drug abuse), 20% to state and non-profit drug abuse prevention programs, 10% to the courts, and 10% to the local government where the sale occurred.\n\nWikinews interviewed Michelle Tilley, Campaign Director for Yes on 820, on January 11, 2023.\n\n**Wikinews:** What are the main problems with Oklahoma's current marijuana laws?\n\n**Tilley:** Oklahoma currently allows medical marijuana with a doctor's referral.  However, recreational marijuana use and possession remain illegal.  SQ 820 aims to safely legalize, regulate, and tax recreational marijuana for adults over 21.  This would generate tens of millions of dollars in new tax revenue annually, boosting underfunded public schools, law enforcement, and other vital state programs. Local economies would also benefit from job creation and increased sales tax revenue.  Legalization would allow law enforcement to focus on serious crimes instead of minor marijuana offenses, and it would enable Oklahomans with past low-level marijuana convictions to expunge those records. Finally, SQ 820 establishes a safe regulatory framework, ensuring all marijuana products are tested for safety, potency, and contaminants, and tracked from seed to sale.\n\n**Wikinews:** How would you respond to concerns that legalizing marijuana could lead to the legalization of other drugs?\n\n**Tilley:** SQ 820 only proposes legalizing marijuana.\n\n**Wikinews:** Which unexpected groups support Initiative 820, and why?\n\n**Tilley:**  Support comes from diverse groups including: Oklahomans seeking increased funding for education, healthcare, and infrastructure; businesses and families anticipating job growth and economic investment; members of the legal and law enforcement communities who want to focus on serious crimes; and adults who want to use cannabis recreationally.\n\n**Wikinews:** Why do you believe Initiative 820 will succeed?\n\n**Tilley:** Oklahomans want better funding for priorities like education, economic growth through a new industry, and the public safety benefits of refocusing law enforcement.

Sources cited by CNN indicate the payments were made to two adult film actresses to suppress allegations of affairs with Trump.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office announced it had contacted Trump's legal team to arrange his surrender.  Trump, a Republican, vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the indictment \"an act of blatant Election Interference\" orchestrated by Democrats.  Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) echoed this sentiment, condemning the indictment as a \"catastrophic escalation in the weaponization of the justice system.\"\n\nUnlike impeachment, a conviction in this case would not legally bar Trump from running for president in 2024.\n\nThe indictment stems from payments orchestrated by Michael Cohen, then Trump's lawyer.  In 2016, Cohen arranged for David Pecker, owner of American Media Inc. (AMI), to pay Stormy Daniels (Stephanie Clifford) $150,000 for the rights to her story alleging an affair with Trump in 2006-2007.  The *National Enquirer*, owned by AMI, subsequently suppressed the story until after the election.  AMI publicly acknowledged the payment was intended to benefit Trump's campaign.  Cohen also paid Karen McDougal $130,000 to remain silent about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump later reimbursed Cohen approximately $420,000, disguised as legal fees and bonuses.\n\nThe payments and alleged affairs were revealed through leaks.  Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in 2018, serving three years in prison. He provided evidence, including emails and recordings, to the grand jury.

The move, detailed in a national control list to be published before summer, follows months of negotiations with the United States and aims to curb the flow of sensitive technology to China.\n\nSchreinemacher cited technological advancements and the geopolitical context as justification for the expanded controls, emphasizing the need for swift action to oversee these technologies. The government claims the restrictions were crafted with \"surgical precision\" to minimize disruption to global supply chains and maintain a level playing field.\n\nThis decision comes after the US imposed sweeping export restrictions in October 2022, limiting Chinese access to advanced chips and chipmaking equipment.  US officials acknowledged the need for international cooperation to maximize the effectiveness of these measures.  Subsequent discussions between US and Dutch officials, including meetings between President Biden and Prime Minister Rutte, led to the agreement on these new Dutch restrictions.\n\nThe new controls are expected to impact ASML Holding, the world's leading producer of lithography systems crucial for advanced chip manufacturing.  While ASML's sales to China already faced restrictions since 2019, the new measures target the most advanced immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography and deposition systems. ASML, which reported over €2 billion in 2021 sales to China (approximately 16% of its total revenue), stated that while they will need to apply for export licenses for the most advanced immersion DUV systems, they do not anticipate a material impact on their 2023 or long-term financial outlook.

Thirty-four other migrants, including five children, were found alive but hospitalized, some in critical but stable condition, suffering from hypothermia, dehydration, and starvation after several days without food or adequate oxygen.\n\nFour people have been arrested, one of whom has a prior human trafficking conviction.  Charges are pending against the arrestees pending further investigation.  Authorities believe the migrants illegally entered Bulgaria from Turkey and were being smuggled to Serbia, a common transit point for migrants aiming to reach the European Union.\n\nInterior Minister Asen Medzhidiev attributed the deaths to a lack of oxygen in the truck's concealed compartments, a statement corroborated by police chief Borislav Sarafov who stated some had suffocated.\n\nThe tragedy comes amidst ongoing concerns about Bulgaria's handling of migration.  In December, Austria and the Netherlands blocked Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen Area due to concerns over rising asylum seeker numbers and insufficient crime-fighting measures.

{"title": "Study: floods, droughts more intense in past 20 years due to higher global temperatures", "content": "A new NASA study published Monday reveals a strong link between rising global temperatures and the increasing severity of water-related extreme weather events over the past two decades.  Scientists Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li used a novel algorithm analyzing data from GRACE satellites to identify 1,066 regions experiencing prolonged periods of either excessive or insufficient rainfall between 2002 and 2021.  Their findings indicate that rising temperatures are driving a significant increase in the overall intensity of both wet and dry extremes, a trend exceeding the variability seen in natural climate fluctuations like El Niño.\n\nThe study identified 505 \"wet\" and 561 \"dry\" clusters.  Since 2015, one of the warmest seven-year periods on record, the severity of these events has increased notably.  The number of \"most extreme\" events (among the 30 wettest or driest) rose from three to four per year.  The researchers observed an increase in the wet-to-dry event ratio in certain latitudes (15° to 20° N) and a decrease in others (15° N to 50° N), suggesting an inverse relationship in how these regions are affected by extreme events.\n\nThe study highlights a record-breaking South American drought (2015-2016) as the most intense dry event and a prolonged, severe drought affecting much of sub-Saharan Africa (above 10° S) since 2002, culminating in record-high flooding and displacement in 2020.\n\nLead author Rodell expressed surprise at the strong correlation between global intensity of these events and global mean temperatures. He emphasized that while regional impacts are harder to predict with certainty, the study strongly suggests a global increase in the frequency, magnitude, and severity of both wet and dry extremes as the world warms.\n\nExperts corroborate these findings.  Richard Seager (Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) anticipates intensified wet and dry extremes, impacting water resource management and flood control. He praised the study's innovative use of GRACE data to confirm the influence of human-driven warming. Park Williams (University of California, Los Angeles) lauded the study's significance in understanding the planet's water cycle.  Kim Cobb (Brown University's Institute for Environment and Society) called it a crucial piece of evidence linking drought, flood, and wildfire trends to a global analysis of the changing water cycle, informing emergency planning, infrastructure development, and resource management.\n\nThe study adds to existing evidence, including the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2021 report, which highlighted increased frequencies of droughts and floods.  The escalating impacts are further exemplified by the \"weather whiplash\" phenomenon, seen recently in California, and the significant economic losses attributed to drought and flood in the US (estimated at 20% of annual extreme weather-related losses).  Rodell is the Acting Deputy Director of Earth Sciences for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, while Li is an assistant research scientist at Goddard's Hydrological Sciences Laboratory.", "question": "What was the primary conclusion of the study published by NASA scientists Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li regarding extreme weather events?\n\nA) The increase in global temperatures is unrelated to the severity of weather events.  \nB) The occurrence of extreme weather events has decreased in the past two decades.  \nC) Rising temperatures are strongly linked to an increase in the severity and frequency of hydroclimatic extreme events.  \nD) The number of wet events is outpacing the number of dry events globally."}
{"title": "US Interior Department approves Willow oil project in Alaska", "content": "The Biden administration approved a scaled-back version of ConocoPhillips' Willow oil drilling project in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) on March 13, 2024.  The Department of the Interior revoked leases on 68,000 acres (275 square kilometers) within the project's Bear Tooth Unit, granting three of ConocoPhillips' five requested drill sites.  The approved plan, according to the Department, minimizes environmental impact by reducing the need for ice roads, pipelines, water usage, vehicle trips, and aircraft flights, as well as minimizing land disturbance.\n\nAlaska Republican Senator [Senator's Name] celebrated the decision on Twitter, calling it a \"huge and needed victory for all Alaska.\"  However, the project remains highly controversial.  A January 2024 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) projected that over its 30-year lifespan, the Willow project would destroy approximately 532 acres (2 square kilometers) of wetlands, consume 1.5 billion gallons (5.7 billion liters) of freshwater, and emit approximately 613 trillion pounds (278,036 metric megatons) of gross greenhouse gases.\n\nThe project's development began in 2018.  The BLM's initial Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), released in August 2020, was met with immediate criticism from indigenous and conservation groups who accused the Trump administration of rushing the approval process.  A Record of Decision authorizing up to three drill sites and supporting infrastructure was issued in October 2020 by then-Secretary of the Interior [Secretary's Name], who touted the project's contribution to oil production and revenue generation.\n\nA temporary injunction halting construction was issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2021.  In August 2021, the court reversed the 2020 EIS, citing inadequate analysis of foreign greenhouse gas emissions, insufficient consideration of alternative proposals, and failure to comply with the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act's (NPRPA) requirement for maximum surface value protection in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA).\n\nPresident Biden's January 2021 executive order pausing new oil and gas leases on federal lands was temporarily blocked by a US District Judge [Judge's Name], who ultimately issued a permanent injunction in August 2021, citing lack of administrative authority.  The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) mandated annual leasing of a minimum amount of federal land and offshore waters for oil and gas development.\n\nDespite environmental concerns, the Willow project enjoys support from several Alaska Native organizations and Alaska's congressional delegation, who emphasize its economic importance.

This marked the first such trial in French history.\n\nWhile Judge Sylvie Daunis found both companies negligent – citing Airbus' failure to replace faulty airspeed sensors (pitots) linked to previous incidents and its inadequate communication of these issues to pilots, and Air France's negligence in not adequately reminding pilots of prior pitot problems – she ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict them of manslaughter.  Airbus was cited for negligence four times, Air France once.\n\nDespite the not-guilty verdict, the judge upheld the companies' civil liability, affirming Air France's existing reparations to the victims' families. A hearing to determine further civil damages is scheduled for September 4th.  The companies faced potential fines of €225,000 each, but avoided this penalty.  Airbus reported €20.64 billion in revenue during Q4 2022, while Air France reported €7.1 billion.

Claire Durousseau, whose niece was among the victims, stated, \"Our lost ones have died a second time. I feel sick.\"  Danièle Lamy, president of the victims' families' association Entraide et Solidarité AF447, described the families as \"mortified and overwhelmed\" after over a decade of legal battles, including a nine-week trial.  She declared, \"The loser first and foremost is French justice.\"  Attorney Alain Jakubowicz echoed this sentiment, stating, \"We were waiting for the word 'guilty'.\"\n\nBoth Airbus and Air France expressed compassion for the families and reaffirmed their commitment to aviation safety.  However, the prosecution had previously argued for acquittal, citing insufficient evidence to directly link corporate negligence to the pilots' actions.  Air France maintained that the exact causes of the accident remain unknown.\n\nThe crash of AF447, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, occurred on May 31, 2009. The main wreckage was discovered on April 3, 2011, approximately 3,900 meters below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.  Investigations by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) concluded that ice accumulation on the pitot tubes disabled the autopilot, leading to a stall and subsequent disregard of warnings by the pilots.  Airbus concurred with this assessment.  However, Air France, the National Airline Pilots Union, and Entraide et Solidarité AF447 had previously criticized the BEA for allegedly focusing excessively on the airline and insufficiently investigating Airbus' role.\n\nThe AF447 crash prompted new regulations regarding sensor testing and pilot training, according to reports.", "question": "What was the outcome of the trial regarding Airbus and Air France in connection with the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447?  \n\nA) Airbus and Air France were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.  \nB) Airbus and Air France were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter.  \nC) Airbus was fined €225,000.  \nD) Air France paid €20 billion in reparations."}

{"title": "Reports: 'streamlined' UK asylum process to replace interview with questionnaire for five nationalities", "content": "The UK government is implementing a new questionnaire-based system to process asylum claims for approximately 12,000 applicants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, and Yemen who applied before last summer.  This initiative, part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to clear the 92,000-case asylum backlog by year-end, replaces face-to-face interviews for these nationalities, whose claim acceptance rate exceeds 95%.  While standard security, criminal, and health checks remain, the government claims this \"streamlined\" approach will expedite processing.\n\nThe questionnaires, reportedly ranging from 10 to 32 pages with 40 to 50 questions, must be completed in English within 20 working days.  Although the government recommends using online translation tools, an internal letter leaked to Sky News warns that failure to return the questionnaire without reasonable explanation may lead to claim withdrawal.  The government will, however, provide reminders and consider extensions.  Officials insist all claims will be assessed fairly, denying that refusals will be based solely on questionnaire responses.\n\nThis fast-track approach follows a similar, previously rejected proposal for Afghan refugees in 2021.  While the Home Office dismisses concerns that the system constitutes an amnesty, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper criticizes the government's delay in implementing a similar system, highlighting the UN's recommendation two years ago and calling for its expansion to include applicants from safe countries like Albania.  Cooper advocates for a common-sense approach encompassing fast-tracked cases, return agreements for unsuccessful claims, and stronger action against criminal gangs facilitating illegal crossings.\n\nThe announcement coincides with the release of figures showing a record 45,756 migrant Channel crossings in 2022, pushing outstanding asylum claims to over 150,000 – another record.  Sunak has prioritized migration control, with legislation expected next month to ban illegal migrants from claiming asylum.  The Home Office intends to potentially expand the questionnaire system to other claimants, but currently has no specific plans to do so.\n\nThe initiative has drawn criticism. While proponents argue it streamlines processing, critics like immigration barrister Colin Yeo and Caitlin Boswell of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants express concern about the questionnaire's complexity and language barrier challenges for applicants who may lack English proficiency or access to legal aid.  The Guardian highlights examples of lengthy, complicated questions, raising concerns about the potential for misinterpretations and jeopardizing the safety of vulnerable individuals.  Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, emphasizes the need for a well-thought-out process, cautioning against bureaucratic hurdles and the threat of application withdrawal.

McGregor argued that the investigation, which involved a search of his US home, violated his Charter rights regarding unreasonable search and seizure.  The court found the search reasonable, effectively ending McGregor's years-long legal battle.\n\nMcGregor was convicted on September 30, 2019, of two counts of voyeurism, one count of possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, one count of sexual assault, and one count of disgraceful conduct.  These charges stemmed from incidents between 2011 and 2017. He received a three-year prison sentence, a further 20-year forfeiture of pay, and was dismissed from the Canadian Armed Forces with disgrace.  Friday's ruling ensures his sentence remains in effect, and he will be barred from future Canadian government employment.\n\nWhile stationed with the Canadian Defence Liaison Staff in Washington, D.C., from August 2015 to March 2017, McGregor held diplomatic immunity.  However, this immunity was waived at the request of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) following a report from another member of the Canadian Armed Forces who discovered recording devices in her home.  She suspected McGregor, leading to a search warrant executed on February 16, 2017, at McGregor's quarters in Alexandria, Virginia.  The search yielded computers, CDs, storage devices, and five hidden cameras.\n\nForensic analysis revealed a 2011 video of McGregor assaulting an unconscious woman in Victoria, B.C., as well as recordings from inside his home showing a woman using the restroom and a video depicting underage cartoon characters engaged in sexual acts.  The child pornography charge related to the latter was later dropped.  The woman in the assault video testified that she believed the recording was made on a night she invited McGregor for drinks and video games, and that she blacked out and awoke to him assaulting her.\n\nMcGregor argued that the search violated Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure. His appeal to the Supreme Court challenged the 2007 *Hape* ruling on extraterritorial application of the Charter, arguing that military personnel should retain Charter rights when investigated by Canadian military police for Canadian offences, even abroad.\n\nThe Crown argued that Section 8 did not apply as the search was conducted under Virginia law, outside Canadian jurisdiction.

The newspapers, in 2018, published articles alleging Roberts-Smith committed war crimes in Afghanistan, claims he said cost him lucrative speaking contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhile the judge found some of the newspapers' allegations – that Roberts-Smith killed, or allowed or encouraged the killing of, unarmed civilians – met the legal threshold for defamation, the overall case was unsuccessful for Roberts-Smith.\n\nInvestigative journalist Nick McKenzie, involved in the reporting, hailed the ruling as a \"day of justice for the brave men of the SAS who stood up and told the truth about Ben Roberts-Smith: a war criminal, a bully and a liar,\" and a \"day of some small justice for the Afghan victims.\"\n\nRoberts-Smith, who was in Indonesia during the hearing, is expected to face substantial legal costs.  The trial cost an estimated AU$35 million, and *The Guardian* predicted he may owe the defendants millions.  It is reported that his employer, Seven West Media, loaned him AU$2 million to fund the case, secured against his Victoria Cross.\n\nThe newspapers' reporting detailed several alleged incidents, including: Roberts-Smith kicking a captured civilian off a cliff in Darwan in 2012; machine-gunning a Taliban prisoner in the back at least ten times in 2009 and subsequently using the prisoner's prosthetic leg as a drinking vessel; and ordering the execution of two civilians as a \"blooding\" ritual.  One witness testified Roberts-Smith described shooting a terrified Afghan teenager in the head as \"the most beautiful thing [he had] ever seen.\"\n\nThe judge's ruling highlights the high burden of proof (\"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\") required for criminal prosecution, a standard not met in the civil defamation case.\n\nBefore the allegations emerged, Roberts-Smith was widely considered a national hero.

LCWW aims to \"increase the visibility of all cats, educating everyone to do their part in addressing the overwhelming rescue situation, preserving breeds, and protecting ethical breeders, all while organizing ground-breaking interactive Cat Extravaganzas.\"\n\nLCWW has already held Cat Extravaganzas across the globe this year, including events in multiple locations within the UK (Liverpool and Scotland, with others unspecified), as well as Peru, the United States, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Colombia.  By April, videos of these events had amassed millions of views online.\n\n**On the founding of LCWW:** Meserve explained that the organization was founded to elevate cats to a more prominent position, stating, \"Dogs have taken centre stage for too long, and it's time for cats to be put into the spotlight!\"  He cited a lack of education surrounding cat ownership and awareness of the large number of cats needing rescue as key motivators for launching LCWW in 2015.\n\n**On ethical breeding:** Meserve defines ethical breeding as requiring breeders to conduct thorough genetic and health testing, maintain excellent cat care, and possess extensive breed knowledge. He emphasizes that potential owners should also be diligent.  Ethical breeders, he says, ensure kittens are vaccinated (specific vaccines not listed), treated for parasites, and microchipped before going to their new homes at a minimum age of 13 weeks. LCWW maintains a database of ethical breeders, \"LCWW Cats and Kittens,\" accessible at lcwwgroup.com.  The organization also provides educational content and advice via its digital platforms and social media channels.\n\n**On the \"Adopt, Don't Shop\" mentality:** Meserve believes LCWW bridges the gap between adopting and purchasing pedigree cats. He advocates for collaboration between rescue and adoption centers and ethical breeders as the most effective way to improve the lives of cats.  A video detailing LCWW's stance on this topic is available on their YouTube channel.\n\n**On the Cat Extravaganzas:**  The Birmingham Cat Extravaganza and Rescue Awareness Event will offer visitors opportunities to support local charities and rescues, watch an international cat competition, view a cat fashion show (\"strut the cat walk\"), and participate in a \"Best in Show\" competition.  Attendees can also purchase gifts in a shopping village and learn more about cat care.  Meserve hopes these events cultivate deeper appreciation for cats and increase their global visibility.\n\n**On choosing the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmingham:** Meserve expressed excitement about hosting the event at the NEC, highlighting its stature as a premier UK venue.\n\n**On the future of LCWW:** Meserve stated that the organization will continue supporting local rescues, charities, and ethical breeders.  He also aims to expand the Meserve Foundation's mission through education and implementation to reduce the number of cats in need and ensure a brighter future for all felines.\n\n\nThis revised version improves clarity, flow, and organization.

The charges, filed in the District of Columbia, include conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding.  The indictment alleges Trump pursued unlawful means to discount legitimate votes and subvert the election outcome, culminating in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya presided over the arraignment.  Judge Tanya Chutkan, assigned to the case, plans to set a trial date at an August 28 hearing.  Prosecutors, led by Jack Smith, advocated for a speedy trial, while Trump's lawyers, John Lauro and Todd Blanche (with Evan Corcoran present in the audience), argued they needed more time to review the extensive evidence.  Upadhyaya warned Trump about the conditions of his release, including a prohibition against discussing the case with witnesses outside the presence of his legal team.\n\nThree law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol during the January 6th attack, including Capitol Police officer Aquilino Gonell, witnessed the arraignment. Gonell, injured in the attack and now retired, noted the irony of Trump's arraignment in the same court where many rioters had been sentenced.  Other attendees included Chief Judge Beryl Howell and Judge Randy Moss.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters in the rain before departing for New Jersey, called the charges a \"very sad day for America,\" framing the prosecution as politically motivated due to his leading position in the Republican primary.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, declined to comment on whether he believed the 2020 election was stolen, instead emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidence in the electoral process.\n\nProsecutors requested a protective order to prevent Trump from publicly releasing sensitive evidence obtained through discovery, citing a social media post where he threatened retaliation against those pursuing him. Trump's lawyers opposed a blanket order, arguing it infringed on his First Amendment rights.  Judge Chutkan scheduled a hearing on this matter for Friday.  On Sunday, Trump, claiming bias, called for Judge Chutkan's recusal and a change of venue, suggesting West Virginia as an alternative.\n\nThe August 1 indictment, the product of a federal grand jury, details Trump's alleged attempts to influence election results in multiple states, including his efforts to pressure election officials, his unsuccessful attempt to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results, and the deployment of fraudulent electors. The indictment also cites Trump's repeated dissemination of false claims about election fraud, despite being informed of their inaccuracy by advisors.  The indictment followed previous indictments in New York (state-level charges related to hush money payments) and Florida (alleged retention of classified documents).  Georgia is also conducting an investigation into Trump's actions related to the 2020 election in that state.

The ruling temporarily blocks a lower court's suspension of the 2022 rule, which defines firearms lacking serial numbers and not manufactured by a licensed manufacturer as \"ghost guns\" (PMFs).  This allows the administration to appeal the lower court's decision.\n\nA Texas judge had previously struck down the regulation, arguing that the administration lacked the authority to redefine ghost gun parts and kits as firearms.  The judge cited Congressional intent, stating that a firearm cannot be defined simply as \"weapon parts, or aggregations of weapon parts.\"\n\nThe ATF's \"Frame or Receiver\" rule (2021R-05F) mandates serial numbers on easily assembled gun kits and expands the definition of a firearm receiver. It also requires background checks for purchasers of kits containing readily assembled firearm parts—a significant change from previous regulations. The ATF aimed to improve firearm traceability and record-keeping.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety President John Feinblatt praised the Supreme Court's decision, stating it would improve public safety.  Conversely, Cody J. Wisniewski, representing the Firearms Policy Coalition, a plaintiff in the case, expressed disappointment, arguing the court improperly paused the lower court's decision that effectively overturned the ATF's redefinition of \"firearm.\"\n\nPrior regulations did not cover privately made firearms for personal, lawful use, provided the maker could legally own a firearm and, for certain regulated weapons (like NFA firearms), obtained ATF approval and registration.

In January 2022, Trump employees handed over 197 documents bearing classifications ranging from \"CONFIDENTIAL\" to \"TOP SECRET,\" prompting NARA to refer the matter to the Department of Justice (DoJ) the following month.\n\nThe indictment details how a staffer, identified as a co-defendant, discovered classified documents, including one marked \"SECRET//REL TO USA, FVEY\" (indicating restricted sharing with US and Five Eyes alliance members), spilled on the floor of a Mar-a-Lago storage room in December 2021.  It further alleges that Trump stored classified documents at his Bedminster, New Jersey, property and includes a partial transcript of a conversation where Trump discussed sharing classified information with others that he had not declassified before leaving office.\n\nThe indictment accuses a Trump attorney of making false statements to the FBI and DoJ last June, claiming all classified documents had been provided, while Trump allegedly directed the co-defendant to move documents after a second attorney searched for materials to comply with a May 2022 grand jury subpoena.

Trump faces 13 charges.  The indictment alleges the defendants \"refused to accept that Trump lost\" and conspired to unlawfully change the election outcome in his favor.  This conspiracy, according to the indictment, involved multiple acts of racketeering in Georgia and other states.\n\nThe indictment charges Trump with violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, along with numerous other offenses including soliciting a public officer to violate their oath (three counts), conspiracy to commit impersonation of a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery (two counts), conspiracy to commit false statements and writings (two counts), false statements and writings (two counts), conspiracy to commit filing false documents, and filing false documents.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis gave the defendants eleven days to surrender.  Trump denied wrongdoing, stating \"I didn't tamper with the election!\" His 2024 presidential campaign denounced the indictment as \"election interference\" by a \"biased prosecutor,\"  and previously called for Willis's recusal.\n\nTrump initially announced a press conference to present a report on alleged election fraud, but later canceled it, stating his lawyers preferred to file the evidence in court as part of their efforts to dismiss the indictment.\n\nThis is Trump's fourth indictment:  prior charges include state-level hush money payments (New York City), federal charges related to classified documents (Miami), and federal charges related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election (Washington, D.C.).  Unlike impeachment, a state-level criminal conviction would not prevent Trump from running for president, and a president cannot pardon state-level convictions or remove state prosecutors.\n\nThe 98-page indictment names 30 unindicted co-conspirators.  It details attempts by Trump and his associates, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis (both indicted), to pressure Georgia officials to alter the election results.  This included asking Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (both Republicans) to \"find\" votes for Trump and falsely claiming election fraud in unsuccessful lawsuits.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump organized individuals to falsely claim to be legitimate electors, including state Republican Party chairman David Shafer and Cathleen Latham.  Some electors reportedly stated they would only vote if Trump's legal challenges were successful.  Shafer and Mark Meadows, Trump's former chief of staff, were also indicted.\n\nThe indictment further describes how Trump's attorneys attempted to persuade Georgia legislators to overturn the election results, and details the actions of Jeffrey Clark, a top official at the Department of Justice's civil division, who drafted a letter urging legislators to convene a special session.  The indictment also alleges that several defendants falsely accused Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman of election crimes.  \n\nMark Meadows is accused of attempting unauthorized access to a Fulton County civic center where election audits were taking place.  Latham is charged with participating in a scheme to compromise ballots and election machines.\n\nA special grand jury convened prior to the indictment, hearing testimony from several individuals, including Giuliani, Meadows, Ellis, Mike Flynn, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Representative Jody Hice.  The special grand jury indicated that Shafer faced the highest risk of prosecution among the pro-Trump electors.", "question": "Who was indicted alongside former President Donald Trump for attempting to unlawfully change the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia?  \n\nA) Rudy Giuliani  \nB) Joe Biden  \nC) Lindsey Graham  \nD) Frances Watson"}

The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency confirmed the crash of Embraer Legacy 600 jet, registration number RA-02795 (a plane sanctioned by the US in 2019 for its ties to Prigozhin),  listing Prigozhin among the passengers.  Flight data indicated the plane plummeted at nearly 8,000 feet per minute before ceasing to transmit altitude data, after exhibiting erratic altitude changes during its flight from Moscow to St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Grey Zone, a pro-Wagner Telegram channel, immediately claimed the jet was shot down by Russian air defenses under the Ministry of Defence, stating, \"Today is exactly two months since the march of justice.\"  This claim remains unsubstantiated.\n\nBesides Prigozhin, the manifest included Sergey Propustin, Evgeniy Makaryan, Aleksandr Totmin, Valeriy Chekalov (a Wagner field commander and former military intelligence agent), Nikolay Matuseev, and crew members Commander Aleksei Levshin, copilot Rustam Karimov, and flight attendant Kristina Raspopova.  An investigation has been launched.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that speculation surrounding the crash and Prigozhin's death was \"sheer lies,\" urging reliance on facts emerging from the ongoing investigation.  President Vladimir Putin offered \"sincere condolences,\" describing Prigozhin as a \"talented businessman\" who had made \"serious mistakes\" but achieved results for both himself and the state.\n\nUS officials, however, expressed strong suspicion of foul play.  A US official speaking to ABC News suggested an explosion, possibly from a bomb on board, as the likely cause.  Another US official indicated a similar belief.  Brigadier General Patrick Ryder stated that US intelligence assesses Prigozhin was \"likely killed\" but added there was no indication of Russian state involvement.  CNN sources cited US officials considering an explosion as a possible cause.\n\nPresident Biden, while vacationing, stated he wasn't surprised by the incident, noting, \"There's not much that happens in Russia that Putin's not behind, but I don't know enough to know the answer.\"\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggested the crash was a \"demonstrative elimination\" aimed at sending a message to Russia's elites ahead of the 2024 elections.\n\nPrigozhin, often dubbed \"Putin's chef\" due to his catering business that secured lucrative government contracts, had a colourful past.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Tatton Spiller, founder of political news service Simple Politics", "content": "## Simple Politics: An Interview with Founder Tatton Spiller\n\nTatton Spiller, founder of the online news service Simple Politics, spoke with Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley on October 13th.  Simple Politics boasts a significant online presence, with 829,000 Instagram followers, 233,000 on Facebook, and 83,700 on Twitter.  The service focuses on UK political news, covering policy, politician quotes, and curated headlines.\n\n**Wikinews:** What inspired the creation of Simple Politics, and have your goals evolved over time?\n\n**Spiller:**  It stemmed from a belief that political news wasn't being explained effectively. My experience working in Parliament highlighted the challenges of maintaining impartiality, often hindering clear communication.  Personally, I was going through a difficult period – a burnout from teaching – and needed a new project.  Simple Politics began as a website launched shortly after David Cameron's 2015 election victory, with the initial, somewhat vague goal of explaining the impact of parliamentary bills on people's lives.  However, the website received little traffic, leading to a shift to social media.  Twitter was the first platform, followed by Facebook, and later, Instagram – where the service's growth truly accelerated, largely thanks to the urging of my colleague Hattie.\n\nWhile early goals focused on growth to expand reach and explanatory power, the core aim has remained consistent: fostering more informed, understanding, and less abusive political discourse. This, however, is incredibly difficult to measure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus shifted to providing helpful information during a challenging time. Currently, the daily goal is simply to help people understand current events.\n\n**Wikinews:** What's the most important attribute for a journalist, and does Simple Politics embody it?\n\n**Spiller:** Clarity is paramount.  A message's impact is irrelevant without effective communication.  Simple Politics strives for clarity, though I'm not a journalist myself.  What impresses me about professional journalists is their ability to distill the core narrative from a wealth of information. This skill is crucial, given the constant influx of daily news. While Simple Politics does a reasonable job at identifying key stories for our specific demographic, we sometimes fall short.  Our strength lies in clarity, but accuracy in story selection can be improved.\n\n**Wikinews:**  With your short-form content, how do you avoid sensationalism?\n\n**Spiller:** We largely avoid sensationalism by ignoring press speculation. We prioritize verifiable information over potentially exciting but unconfirmed rumors, even if such stories might generate more social media engagement.  Maintaining trust is key.  While we strive for accuracy, occasional lapses occur, perhaps due to my own enthusiasm.  The definition of sensationalism itself is also subjective.\n\n**Wikinews:** What type of news best suits your format, and what are the reporting limitations?\n\n**Spiller:** Policy announcements, presenting contrasting viewpoints on issues, are ideal.  However, condensing lengthy speeches (like hour-long parliamentary addresses) into concise summaries presents challenges. Analyzing complex political issues is also difficult, as we lack the space for in-depth analysis characteristic of publications like *The Times*. Our strength lies in simplifying complex ideas; however, this necessitates sacrificing detail or context sometimes.  Careful consideration and discussion among the team determine content inclusion, balancing the need for key information with readability within the space constraints of short-form content.\n\n**Wikinews:** What areas could Simple Politics improve?\n\n**Spiller:**  Everything! We're a small team, limited in our weekend coverage.  We could improve our judgment on what *not* to post, avoiding less impactful stories.  Balancing self-promotion (we only advertise ourselves and accept donations) without alienating our audience is another challenge.\n\n**Wikinews:** What does the future hold for Simple Politics?\n\n**Spiller:** The upcoming general election presents a significant opportunity and responsibility. We need to ensure impartiality and facilitate constructive political discussions.  This may involve engaging with the public directly, through events, videos, etc.  The aim is to help people understand policy and the reasons behind differing viewpoints.  Beyond the election, next year marks Simple Politics' tenth anniversary, prompting reflection on the service's long-term direction.  For now, however, the focus remains firmly on the election.", "question": "What significant milestone does Simple Politics anticipate reaching next year?  \n\nA) Launching a new social media platform  \nB) Its 10th anniversary  \nC) Covering a general election with a large following  \nD) Expanding to international political news"}

Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley interviewed University of Birmingham student David Rock, who rode the extension on its opening day.  The new section, in Zone 4, branches off the existing line after [Location].\n\nWhile the previous terminus, [Previous Terminus Name], remains open for a \"shopper's service\" (with every other tram terminating there due to its proximity to Wolverhampton's shopping district), it will close later this autumn for further works, according to a West Midlands Metro press release.  The extension, originally slated for completion in 2019, experienced significant delays.  The Metro has stated its focus is now on extending the service to [Next Destination].\n\nThawley asked Rock about the extension's impact on residents along the route:\n\n\"I think it makes the tram a more attractive option because of better public transport integration,\" Rock said.  \"The tram now directly serves Wolverhampton's train station, giving people a greater incentive to use it instead of the bus, especially for journeys involving [Mode of Transport].\"\n\nRegarding the planned extension to Brierley Hill, Rock commented: \"It will likely contribute significantly to the local economy overall, but proportionally, maybe not as much.  [Location] already has good bus links to Wolverhampton and Birmingham. The tram won't take a direct route to either city, as it goes through Wednesbury.  Reduced traffic impact is a benefit, but the tram's higher cost compared to the bus makes its impact on shorter journeys unclear.\"\n\nRock also expressed concerns about fares:  \"Better fare integration is crucial!  I paid £5.00 for an all-zone tram day ticket today. A train return to Birmingham costs £5.20-£6.90 (£3.40-£4.55 with a Railcard), and is much faster. For Birmingham-Wolverhampton journeys, there's little incentive to use the tram.  The tram's main market is communities like [Location 1] and [Location 2]. A bus day pass is £4.00 (£2.00 single), making the tram's £4.10 (two zones) or £4.60 (three zones) day ticket expensive. A London-style Oyster system would be far better—that's what the Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) should be investing in.  Today, I walked seven miles to avoid paying extra for a bus because I only bought a tram day ticket.  Better integration would have made the extra cost for a hop-on, hop-off network worthwhile.\"\n\nWhen asked about TFWM's performance, Rock responded: \"I think they're doing a reasonable job, although I'm not very familiar with them, as I mainly use trains and buses, which aren't entirely under their control.\"\n\n\nThis revised version improves clarity, flow, and readability.
