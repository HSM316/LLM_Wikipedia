{"title": "Ballarat candidates debate climate at election forum", "content": ", Australia — In the lead-up to the , four candidates for the  met last Sunday at the Ballarat Tech School in a climate-centred forum organised by local group Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions (BREAZE).\n\nIn attendance were sitting  member ,  candidate and former mayor John Barnes,  candidate Kerryn Sedgman, and independent candidate Alex Graham. Local  and  candidates gave apologies in place of attendance.\n\nThe event was preceded by a climate action rally outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and the Ballarat Town Hall, which featured speeches from both representatives of BREAZE, the Ballarat branch of , Environment Victoria, the , and the Ballarat Trades Hall.\n\nThe forum began with each candidate being given three minutes to summarise their policies on climate before questions were taken from members of the public. John Barnes, the Greens candidate, began by claiming \"the Greens have the most ambitious program of any of the parties on addressing climate change\", and said if the Greens were in the  in the coming election, they would work to push Labor towards the \"reforming zeal of past generations\", invoking former Labor Prime Minister . Barnes stated the Greens have a target of 75% emissions reduction by 2030, by which time they would also end the mining, burning, and export of coal in Australia. \n\nIndependent candidate Alex Graham began his speech by saying he was \"passionate about our environment\" and claimed to have \"absolutely, without question, the best policy\", explaining the focus of his candidacy was to introduce a referendum that would allow the Australian government to \"write its own money supply into existence\". Graham said this policy would deliver \"money beyond the pale to totally restore our environment\".\n\nIncumbent MP Catherine King said that in her twenty years as an MP, the Australian Parliament had been unable to deal with the climate issue. She referenced previous attempts by the last Labor government to legislate policies to tackle climate change, such as the  (CPRS), but stated these efforts were \"completely and utterly dismantled\" after the . \n\nKing referred to the Powering Australia policy announced in December 2021 by Labor energy and climate spokesperson , stating the policy had been supported by the  (BCA),  (NFF) and \"some\" environmental groups. King stated the policy included a commitment to 43% emissions reduction by 2030, net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and it would overall \"grow jobs, increase renewable energy, and bring emissions down\". \n\nKerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party promised to centre the opinions of views of the community, and read from the Federation policy on climate directly, saying \"carbon is not the enemy. Toxic pesticides are the true enemy.\" Sedgman claimed pesticides were the primary source of nitrous oxide (N₂O) released, and that N₂O was \"300 times worse than carbon\".\n\nAfter the candidates concluded with their opening summaries, members of the public were open to ask questions. The first question asked candidates what their first two priorities were for climate action. Barnes said the Greens' top priority was \"prompt action\", and they would also focus on transforming the nation's economy to \"a new way — a new sustainable way — of making our living in the world\". Graham stated if Australia had a limitless supply of money, there would not be a climate change issue and Australia would become a model for the world. He said his two priorities would be creating more money and introducing newer technologies.\n\nKing said her first priority would be getting more renewables into the grid and generally increasing the amount of renewables, and also added a third priority, saying that as  in a Labor government, she would add a climate section to the department and work to create a network of electric vehicle charging stations. Sedgman stated \"there's more than two top priorities\", but remarked that soil regeneration was a key part of carbon sequestration, and called for a more immediate approach to deal with climate through education and community hubs.\n\nThe event was then disturbed slightly by a person asking about a supposed \"ninety-year suppression order suppressing the names of twenty-eight VIP alleged paedophiles\", who was asked to leave by organisers for disrupting the event. King labeled the belief a \" conspiracy theory\".\n\nAfter this, the topic shifted to the proposed Western Victorian Transmission Network, a proposed overhead transmission line from Bulgana to Sydenham. Graham said his proposed referendum, if successful, could lead to the federal government subsidising a plan to put the transmission line underground beneath the , emphasising we shouldn't \"let money interfere with saving this planet\". King noted the location of a proposed transfer station was \"really problematic\", but stated the issue lay more with the regulatory process, and Labor would work with state and territory governments to reform this process.\n\nSedgman admitted she was not fully aware of some of the background King had bought up, and she would like to speak to those affected personally. Barnes said the consultation of , who propose building the transmission line, had not been good, and hopes an extended time granted for the environmental impact statement will allow all people affected to be properly heard. Barnes also stated AusNet had claimed diverting the line underground would cost thirteen times more than the overhead alternative, while a  study showed it would only cost five times more.\n\nOne questioner asked about what the candidates would do to investigate the possibility of . Barnes remarked \"the best way to sequester carbon is not to release it in the first place\", and said the mechanical removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was \"probably a pipe dream\". Graham quipped he was \"prepared to ask my friend if he could do it, and I'm sure he could.\" King argued the technology was \"a fair way off yet\", but noted 3 billion was reserved in Labor's Powering Australia plan for new technologies to reduce emissions. Sedgman stressed the importance of reducing the \"extraordinary rate\" at which deforestation occurs.\n\nCandidates were then asked if they would commit to no new coal and gas infrastructure. King confirmed a moratorium on new coal and gas was not part of Labor policy, but they were not interested in investing taxpayer funds towards them, contrasting it with what she said was the current government's approach to projects such as the . Graham said, as someone who had previously worked in the industry, he would \"close down every coal-fired power station as soon as it was possible\" and disallow the construction of new coal-fired power stations. Graham also pledged to close down coal mines and ban .\n\nBarnes stated the Greens take the advice of the  seriously, and would not allow any new coal, gas, or oil projects, as well as closing down coal-fired power stations by 2030, to be replaced by renewable energy. Barnes emphasised the need to lower emissions before 1.5 °C of global warming was reached.\n\nOne questioner asked candidates what they would do in the event of two scenarios after the coming election — one being that Labor had a clear majority, the other that the Greens held the balance of power. King stated the \"beauty of power in Australia\" was it didn't require any legislation. However, she said Labor would still attempt to legislate targets of 43% emissions reduction and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Barnes reiterated the Greens in the balance of power would push Labor to be more ambitious, and that while compromise would be needed in a hung parliament, the Greens would \"play hardball\" on addressing the climate.\n\nCandidates were then asked about a proposal from  to turn northern Australia into the \"battery of Asia\". Barnes stated Australia could become a \"energy superpower\", and good government policy could have the market \"with us\" on this issue. King declared over 600,000 jobs could be realised under Labor's Powering Australia plan, and concurred in saying Australia should be a renewable energy superpower and exporting technology to the world. She highlighted the need for a government that \"believes in climate change, believes that we have to do something about it\", and restated that Labor's plan was endorsed by the BCA and NFF.\n\nThe final question asked how those in coal communities such as the  could be helped to deal with the potential loss of jobs with a transition to renewable energy. Graham responded by calling for a \"basic, living universal wage to all people\", while Sedgman asked who was eligible to have these jobs in the first place \"due to the current mandate conditions\". King said the demand for fossil fuels was running out, with trading partners setting targets of net zero emissions by 2050. She underlined the \"really good jobs in renewables\", and emphasised the need to start now in training people for new, good-paying renewable jobs, as otherwise these workers wouldn't get jobs again. \n\nBarnes stated the Greens had announced A$19 billion over ten years with the aim of transitioning communities affected by a move away from fossil fuels, they would aim for renewables running the power system by 2030, and they would run retraining programs and maintain existing incomes for \"up to a decade\" if workers cannot find \"equally lucrative\" jobs. Barnes emphasised the need to not vilify those working in mining communities, and a plan must be in place for these communities to maintain their dignity.\n\nThe forum concluded with representatives from Environment Victoria in the local area invited to present copies of an open letter calling for \"faster and fairer climate action\", and which was signed by 125 people. Among other things, the letter called for a replacement of \"coal, oil and gas with clean energy\", \"a national plan to slash climate pollution this decade with strong targets that, at a minimum, match our trading partners\", and an accelerated rollout of renewable energy projects with the aim of creating \"a healthy, prosperous economy while ceasing new energy generating projects from fossil fuel sources\".\n\n ", "question": "What was the target for emissions reduction by 2030 proposed by the Greens candidate John Barnes during the climate forum in Ballarat?  \nA) 43%  \nB) 75%  \nC) 100%  \nD) 50%"}

{"title": "Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick resigns amid criticism", "content": "The  of the London, United Kingdom Metropolitan Police (Met) Dame  resigned Thursday after losing the approval of  Sadiq Khan.\n\nDick's resignation took place just hours after she assured BBC  she had \"absolutely no intention\" of leaving the post. However, in her stepping-down speech she concluded Khan \"no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue\", adding the mayor had left her \"no choice but to step aside\".\n\nKhan placed Dick \"on notice\" from February 2 to reform the police service, the day after a report on police conduct was released. The February 1 report by the  (IOPC) concluded \"disgraceful\" incidents of bullying, discrimination, misogyny and sexual harassment. She survived a number of scandals from 2019, after she was accused, and cleared of \"deliberately [misleading] the public\" over the inconclusive  investigation.\n\nHowever, recent criticism centred around \"institutional corruption\" in the force, which Dick denies. It also involves racist, sexist, homophobic and Islamophobic remarks by some of its constables at  between 2016 and 2018. The February 1 report found that of the fourteen officers investigated for disparaging and sexist messages in two  and one Facebook groups, nine remain serving. Additionally, two were promoted from constable to sergeant.\n\nThe force was also criticised for its belated investigation into , a number of gatherings held at Downing Street despite Covid-19 restrictions. Sources told The Guardian there was despondency in the  and  over the Met's scandals, which some view as partially resultant from Dick's \"defensiveness\".\n\nIn a statement, Khan said he was \"not satisfied with the commissioner's response\" to his demands for \"change I believe is urgently required to rebuild the trust and confidence of Londoners in the Met\". He added reform was necessary \"to root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exists.\" Khan found an initial meeting with Dick after the report surfaced was inadequate; she resigned ahead of another meeting.\n\nThere is also discontent over the Met's handling of  by Met officer Wayne Couzens. Four people attending a vigil in her honour last year were arrested for breaching Covid-19 restrictions. Furthermore, the force faced ridicule in October after informing women fearing an approaching officer to . Otherwise, \"shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down\" were advised. This was accompanied by a new strategy against sexual violence and the formation of a dedicated unit against predatory offenders.\n\nBoth the Met and the government launched separate inquiries into the force's handling of Everard's murder. The independent government review is headed by Baroness .\n\nIn December, two constables were jailed for 33 months after taking and sharing photos on WhatsApp of  sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman. Their mother Mina Smallman rejected an apology by the force, accusing it of racism and \"dehumanising our children\".\n\nIn the earlier Radio London interview, Dick, then adamant she would not resign, said \"enough is enough\", adding she was \"seething angry\" about the February 1 report. She encouraged she be held to account, saying \"it's a big job\", but she was \"doing her best\". She maintained the Met was \"hugely capable in so many ways. However, she acknowledged its reputation has been tarnished by the \"awful [findings in the report] and also some other awful things that have happened and come to light in the last several months\".\n\nWhile she led a \"real transformation\" as commissioner to tackle bad behaviour in the Met, \"I'm not complacent\". She maintained \"there could be and probably will be, over the coming months, some more examples which will be embarrassing or disgusting because we will be rooting them out\". BBC correspondent Lauren Moss said while the Met had issued many apologies in the past, this was the first to come from Dick herself.\n\nReactions to Dick's resignation were mixed. Former IOPC superintendent and Met officer  told the  Dick stepping down was part of the radical action needed to combat a \"sub-culture\" of sexism and racism. Mehtab added: \"The level of violence against women being expressed in [the Facebook and WhatsApp] messages damages the trust women and girls have in the police.\"\n\nAlastair Morgan, brother of the , told The Guardian \"since [first interacting with Dick in 2012] all she has done in relation to my family is just delay, obstruct and disappoint on a huge level\". While \"it is a shame that we are seeing another commissioner disappear under a cloud of smoke, it is necessary.\" The sentiment was shared by activist organisations Reclaim These Streets and . Ricky Waumsley, whose partner Daniel Whitworth was one of the four targets of serial killer Stephen Port, was \"glad\". He said: \"I held Cressida accountable for [Met] failures and made a statement that she should ‘resign with immediate effect’.\n\nCalls remain to institute long-lasting change. Ruth Davidson of charity  said \"one resignation at the top doesn’t mean the police have solved their misogyny problem\" and called for \"root and branch reform\" across the UK. Mehtab said \"This is not just a few ‘bad apples’ which is a term that the Met keeps using to deflect criticism\" for its behaviour. Journalist  alluded the present scandals facing the force to the 1970s police corruption investigation , which resulted in hundreds of Met officers resigning or retiring, and eight prosecutions.\n\nHowever, Dick found support in the chair of the Met Foundation Ken Marsh, who said she \"should have been given the opportunity and the necessary time to build back trust in the Metropolitan police service.\" Khan, Home Secretary  and Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Dick for her service. Johnson, former London mayor currently under investigation for his involvement in Partygate, said Dick \"served her country with great dedication and distinction\".\n\nKhan promised to work closely with Patel to appoint a new commissioner \"so that we can move quickly to restore trust in the capital’s police service while keeping London safe.\" Dick will continue serving in a caretaker capacity before a successor is decided.\n\nDick joined the force as a constable in 1983, and headed the anti-gang  in 2003.

In 2017, over half of such products were found by the  (OLAF) to be imported below \"the lowest acceptable prices\".\n\nThe lowest acceptable prices are a risk assessment tool introduced by OLAF to detect \"imports presenting a significant risk of undervaluation\". OLAF informed member states of the chance for \"extreme undervaluation\" by , including during bilateral meetings with the UK over 2015 and 2016. Despite this, the ECJ found British authorities did not utilise the metric for its monitoring operations in 2011 and 2014.\n\nAs a result, it did not conduct \"appropriate customs controls\", allowing the products \"free circulation in the \". As an example, fraud investigators in 2017 found women's trousers from China were declared at €0.91 per kilogram, €0.53 below the market price for cotton. The Commission estimates this cost the EU budget €2.68 billion (~$2.9 billion) from 2011-17, as 80% of customs duties go toward funding the EU's budget.\n\nHowever, the ECJ denied the Commission's request the UK provide such a sum as repayment, citing inconsistencies with its full amount calculations which meant it had not met the \"requisite legal standard\". The UK remains under ECJ jurisdiction for infractions made during its EU membership even after leaving the EU in January 2020. The UK was ordered to pay four-fifths of legal costs Brussels incurred since OLAF first alleged misconduct in 2017.\n\nThe UK can challenge the fine, but not the result from the judgment. The fine amount €2.68 billion is up from the original €1.99 billion in lost duties uncovered from a sophisticated fraud ring.

Of them, Portugal, Slovakia and the UK, as well as Malta and Spain, were found to have \"major undervaluation hubs\" in the first month of OLAF's 2014 Operation Snake.\n\nBritish ports, specifically Dover, were found to be the main entry points for Chinese goods before clearing European customs and being trafficked across the continent.

Turning off the taps would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and we would be even more dependent on foreign imports.\"\n\nThe European Commission was more cautious, planning to cut Union dependence on Russian imports by two-thirds this year, before ceasing altogether \"well before 2030\".

The common understanding is that a fetus cannot do this until 24 weeks.

LJI President and CEO  said: \"Finding antibodies with this breadth is important because we don't know which virus in the genus of ebolaviruses is going to break out next.\"\n\nOf the six ebolaviruses known to science, the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses are the two most deadly: the  that killed eleven thousand was caused by the Zaire virus.\n\nThe new contribution made in this paper is that scientists used the imaging technique  to observe how and where the antibodies interact with the viruses.\n\nThe team saw that 1C3, instead of binding to the target site on the viral  in the typical molecular -and- fashion, stuck itself sideways across the glycoprotein, blocking three binding sites at once. Antibodies work by binding to s and neutralizing their s.\n\n1C11 works by interfering with the molecules that the virus would use to enter a cell.  Because the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses use very similar mechanisms, 1C11 is effective against both.\n\nAccording to the research team, the primary advantage that these two antibodies have over others is that they are resistant to .  When some viruses enter the body, including the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, they produce excess glycoprotein and release it into the area like a smokescreen. This causes many of the body's antibodies bind to this glycoprotein instead, as many as 90 percent of them.  1C3 and 1C11 do not; they bind only to the real virus.\n\nThis means that antibody treatments based on 1C3 and 1C11 are likely to be effective at much lower doses than other treatments, as early experiments have already shown:  One treatment has already been tested in non-human primates, and even the lowest doses used were 100 percent effective.  This also means the human treatment might be much cheaper to produce than expected.\n\nAccording to LJI, treatment based on these two antibodies would offer two advantages over existing treatments.  First, patients with undiagnosed species of Ebolavirus can be treated with an antibody cocktail that is effective against more than one virus.  Because doctors don't always have time to figure out which virus a patient has, this could save many lives.  Second, these antibodies would be effective in patients with later stages of the disease.\n\nThe experiments were conducted using samples donated to  by two Ebola survivors.\n\nCAT:Science and technology", "question": "What is the main advantage of the antibodies 1C3 and 1C11 developed by scientists at LJI for treating ebolaviruses?  \n\nA) They can only bind to the Zaire ebolavirus.  \nB) They are effective against multiple types of ebolaviruses and can work at lower doses.  \nC) They were created using genetic modification techniques.  \nD) They support the production of vaccine candidates."}

The scientists found that teeth from the closely related elephants, or even two tusks from the same individual, often surfaced in different shipments that transited through the same ports. The data also showed when criminal networks shifted their operations from between port cities. They inferred poachers were making kills, then separating the tusks at some point along the smuggling route.\n\nThe team had been studying DNA analysis on poached tusks for years: in 2018, they found two tusks from different shipments had come from the same animal, which indicated both shipments were from the same kill and transited by the same criminal network. This is the first report of DNA identification tusks that came from elephants in the same families.\n\nLead author Dr Samuel Wasser said: \"Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly — year after year — and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network.\" He added: \"This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports.\"\n\nWasser said similar studies will provide law enforcement groups access to a greater range of evidence with which to prosecute poachers and their criminal partners by providing verifiable links between different caches of captured ivory. The researchers concluded in their paper that law enforcement could use their information to discern the ways in which poachers are collaborating.\n\nHumans have used the ivory from elephant tusks to make art, decorations, and tools since prehistory. Many countries have since outlawed the sale of ivory, but poachers continue to kill tens of thousands of elephants each year.\n\nThe paper's authors were from the University of Washington, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the , Kenyan-based organisation , the , and Singapore's .\n\nCat:Science and technology\n\nCat:Elephants", "question": "What innovative technique did researchers use to track poached tusks from African elephants?\n\nA) Genetic fingerprinting  \nB) Radiocarbon dating  \nC) Knuckle bone analysis  \nD) Forensic entomology"}

Shark Bay was submerged relatively recently, within the past 8,500 years.\n\nThe scientists discovered the plant was a single organism after taking 18,000 separate genetic markers to examine the seagrass to find samples to use in restoration projects. However, they discovered the same plant had cloned itself many times instead. Dr Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, said “We thought 'what the hell is going on here?'... We were completely stumped.\" Jane Edgeloe, one of the co-authors of the research, said the DNA of the samples was compared and it was discovered from this that the seagrass meadow was a single plant.\n\nThe plant is around three times the size of Manhattan, and measures at least 180 kilometres (112 miles) in length. As well as being the world's largest known plant, it is the world's largest known clone. The seagrass greatly surpasses the 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States, previously thought to be the world's largest plant. The seagrass grows a maximum of 35 centimetres per year, with its large size helping scientists calculate its age.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, said the plant's survival was helped by it holding onto all the chromosomes from both its parents. This gave it genetic diversity, which is unusual among plants that produce asexually. The plant does not sexually reproduce; however, subtle variations in its DNA may help explain its longevity.\n\nAssociate Professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the study but is an expert on seagrass. She said seagrass tends to live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, meaning the plant's age of about 4,500 years fits into the normal age range of seagrass. McMahon also said she was confident in the method used by the researchers, and that the finding it was a single plant was \"amazing\".\n\nDespite the plant's vast size, in the past ten years, almost a tenth of it has been destroyed by cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which NBC News noted had been attributed to climate change.
