Her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederik, will succeed her.\n\nAt 83 years old, Queen Margrethe has reigned for nearly 52 years. In her live television speech, she also addressed pressing global issues, including climate change.\n\nAs the head of state in Denmark, the monarchy plays a ceremonial role, with the parliament responsible for governing. Queen Margrethe has maintained strong support among the Danish populace, with approximately 80 percent approval as of 2022. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed heartfelt gratitude for the queen's decades of service, calling her the \"epitome of Denmark\" in a statement.\n\nSince the passing of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Margrethe has been the longest-serving monarch in Europe and remains the world’s only reigning queen.\n\nBorn shortly after the German occupation in 1940, Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972. Her reign followed significant changes to the Danish succession laws, which allowed women to inherit the throne for the first time in over 500 years.\n\nDenmark does not observe formal coronation ceremonies, so Crown Prince Frederik will be officially proclaimed king immediately after the queen's abdication.\n\nThe queen revealed that her recent back surgery had prompted her to reflect on her future. \"The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future,\" she explained.\n\nThroughout her reign, Queen Margrethe has actively engaged with her country, often traveling without formal protocol and visiting deployed Danish soldiers at the age of 70. She is also renowned for her passion for archaeology and the arts, having illustrated a 1977 Danish-language version of \"The Lord of the Rings\" under a pseudonym."}

The justices clarified that the authority to disqualify a presidential candidate under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment rests with Congress, not individual states.\n\nThe core of the case revolved around whether the Colorado Supreme Court was correct in declaring Trump ineligible for the Republican nomination. That court had determined that Trump's actions constituted insurrection against the Constitution, thus disqualifying him from holding the presidency.\n\nAccording to the Fourteenth Amendment, no one may hold office if they have previously taken an oath \"to support the Constitution\" and then \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against it.\n\nThe case originated in September when a group of voters from Colorado sought to prevent Trump from appearing on the primary ballot. Although a lower Colorado court found that Trump had engaged in insurrection, it ruled that Section 3 did not apply to the presidency. After the Colorado Supreme Court overturned this aspect of the ruling, Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for clarification."}

{"title": "Industry leaders see energy supply as the next hurdle for AI", "content": "**Title: Mark Zuckerberg Highlights Energy Supply Challenges for AI Development**\n\nIn a podcast released on Friday, Mark Zuckerberg underscored a growing industry concern that the energy supply may soon become a significant barrier to the further advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). His comments echoed a warning from Elon Musk last month, who suggested that AI could exceed energy capacity as soon as next year. Musk noted that AI technology is progressing at an exponential rate, improving tenfold every six months, which is straining both chip manufacturing and energy resources.\n\nMajor tech firms such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are rapidly enhancing their AI capabilities, necessitating the expansion of their data centers. Collectively, these companies are projected to invest over $120 billion in data center growth by 2025. This surge in data center demand is expected to significantly increase energy consumption, with projections indicating that energy demand could soon outstrip supply.\n\nZuckerberg, co-founder of an AI-development laboratory, predicted that the future will require 1-gigawatt data centers, a capacity that has yet to be realized. He remarked, \"Building power plants to supply that amount of energy will take time. If we wanted to establish a massive facility, powering it is a long-term project. Some may pursue it, but it's not as simple as saying 'we'll get a level of AI, secure capital, and deploy it into a big data center.'\"\n\nZuckerberg also pointed to government regulations as a hurdle to rapidly expanding energy supply. He stated, \"When you're discussing large new power plants or transmission lines that cross public or private lands, you're looking at many years of lead time.\"\n\nThe competition for energy resources is further complicated by the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market, which is vying with the AI sector for power supply. During a teleconference for the Connected World Conference, Musk remarked, “The simultaneous growth of electric cars and AI creates tremendous demand for electrical power and associated equipment.”\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of AI, EVs, and global energy supply? We may already be witnessing its effects. Reports indicate that Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers in Ireland are facing restrictions on launching new cloud resources because of power limitations at their data centers, which has prompted a shift to using AWS data centers in other European regions.\n\nWikinews inquired about the balance between AI growth and energy supply growth. The response highlighted a concept termed the TPIF Framework—Technological advancements, Policy support, Infrastructure readiness, and Financial investment—as essential components for overcoming these challenges.\n\n**Wikinews:** \"Tell me about yourself in both technical terms and from a personal perspective.\"\n\n**ChatGPT:** \"Technical Overview: I’m built on OpenAI’s GPT-4 architecture, a multimodal model capable of processing both text and images, though my current functions are text-based.

This has led to recommendations to utilize AWS centers in other regions, such as Sweden. This power crunch highlights the strain on Ireland's power grid, compounded by the energy demands of concentrated data centers.\"\n\n**Wikinews:** \"Can renewable energy production quickly meet this demand?\"\n\n**ChatGPT:** \"Meeting energy demand through renewable energy production is feasible but faces challenges. Success hinges on advancements in technology, supportive policies, readiness of infrastructure, and financial backing.\"\n\n**Wikinews:** \"Does Ireland possess the necessary components to meet this challenge?\"\n\n**ChatGPT:** \"Ireland has made notable progress, particularly in wind energy, supported by ambitious government targets and policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy infrastructure, despite challenges like community opposition and environmental considerations.\"\n\n**Wikinews:** \"Given Musk's timeframe and the impacts in Ireland, what does this suggest for AI, EVs, and global energy supply?\"\n\n**ChatGPT:** \"The interplay between AI, EV growth, and energy demand suggests a transformative future. Key implications include:\n\n- **Increased Energy Demand:** The rapid rise of AI and EVs will significantly boost electricity needs, necessitating urgent infrastructure upgrades and a shift towards renewables.\n  \n- **Infrastructure Modernization:** Many regions' aging energy infrastructure will require modernization to handle increased load and renewable energy variability.\n\n- **Evolving Policies:** Regulatory frameworks must adapt to new technological realities to promote innovation, address grid stability, and support energy storage solutions.\n\n- **Global Collaboration:** Addressing energy supply challenges will necessitate international cooperation, aligning standards, and pooling resources.\n\n- **Socioeconomic Impacts:** The renewable energy shift will require workforce retraining and efforts to ensure equitable energy access.\n\nThe future could see rapid transformation, presenting both challenges and opportunities in managing global energy supply sustainably.\"\n\n**Wikinews:** \"What qualifies you to answer these questions?\"\n\n**ChatGPT:** \"My capabilities stem from extensive training on diverse datasets, advanced algorithms for understanding and generating human-like responses, and the adaptability to meet user inquiries across various topics.

This accident has disrupted the crucial connection between Baltimore's container port and the global shipping network, leaving at least six people missing.\n\nThe vessel involved, named Dali, was constructed in 2016 and is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. It struck a bridge pillar around 1:30 AM EDT (5:30 AM UTC). Fortunately, the timing of the collision likely reduced potential casualties, as it could have resulted in a much higher toll had it occurred during peak traffic hours. The collapse has severely impacted the transportation network, which processes an average of 1.1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers annually—an essential component of both the local and national economy.\n\nThis disruption arrives at a challenging time for East Coast ports, already facing pressures from contract renegotiations and shifts in global cargo routes due to various international logistics issues. Experts anticipate that this incident will worsen congestion and delays along the Eastern seaboard.\n\nThis is not Dali's first encounter with infrastructural damage; in 2016, the ship was involved in a less severe incident in Antwerp, where the crew, particularly the ship's master and pilot, were blamed for a collision with the dock.

Many of the CDs on display are hard to find in Russia and other countries, and each disc was produced in the artist's home country, with no reissues or digital copies included in the collection.\n\n“All the items exhibited were sourced during my travels and expeditions,” Pinchuk explained, expressing disappointment that many of the nations he visited lack the resources to produce physical CDs.\n\nThe exhibition opening attracted around a dozen attendees, and currently showcases only half of the entire collection. The exhibit will remain open for two weeks, providing an opportunity for both local residents and visitors to explore the unique display.\n\nIncluded in the exhibition are maps detailing Viktor Pinchuk's expedition routes, as well as receipts and documentation from his travels, such as a cash receipt from a store where one of the CDs was purchased and his membership ID card as a philophonist."}

Israeli officials reported that many of these rockets were intercepted. Two civilians in Herzliya sustained injuries, and shrapnel from the rockets caused damage to a residential home. Later that day, the Israeli Defense Forces successfully destroyed a rocket launcher responsible for the attacks.\n\nThis incident marks yet another episode in the ongoing hostilities between Hamas and its allies, including groups such as [insert allied forces], Iran, and others. Recently, there was a significant surge in violence, with over 4,300 rockets fired into Israel during an eleven-day period. Since its formation, Hamas—designated as a terrorist organization by numerous countries—has reportedly launched more than 20,000 rockets at civilians in both Gaza and Israel.\n\nThe latest escalation follows a devastating attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,139 Israelis, among them 373 security personnel, 695 civilians (including 36 children), and 71 foreign nationals. Additionally, approximately 250 Israelis were taken hostage during the assault, which saw over 3,000 Hamas fighters breach the border alongside nearly 6,000 rocket launches.

Ollongren's only stipulation was that Ukraine \"comply with international law and the right to self-defense as outlined in the U.N. Charter,\" allowing them to target military objectives necessary for their defense.\n\nThe F-16s, which are American-made, are typically subject to U.S. influence regarding their use. However, according to NL Times, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra spoke with NATO allies, including U.S. representatives, and concluded that no U.S. approval is required for their deployment.\n\nThe Netherlands is part of a coalition with Belgium, Denmark, and the United States to supply F-16s to Ukraine.\n\nIn March, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed Russian pilots about the potential delivery of F-16s to Ukraine. As reported by Russian media, he claimed that the arrival of these aircraft would not significantly alter the conflict, stating, \"we will destroy the aircraft just as we are currently destroying tanks, armored vehicles, and other equipment, including multiple rocket launchers.\"\n\nThe F-16s will replace older aircraft lost during the conflict, offering enhanced capabilities such as improved radar, extended strike range, and superior air-to-air combat performance. They will also enable integration with other NATO-provided weapon systems, including advanced radar jamming technology and air-launched cruise missiles."}

This marks the first time since 1969 that this service has been operational.\n\nTwo new stations, Leven and Cameron Bridge, have been constructed and are now served by an hourly service to Edinburgh via Kirkcaldy, operated by ScotRail.\n\nThe redevelopment project, managed by Network Rail, cost £116 million (US$148 million) and was officially opened by the Scottish Government on May 29; however, the new services began with the June timetable change. The project was funded by the Scottish Government.\n\nBoth new stations feature parking lots and bicycle facilities, including electric vehicle charging stations. Cameron Bridge's parking area also includes dedicated disabled parking spaces. ScotRail has stated that both stations are \"fully accessible,\" offering step-free access to all platforms.\n\nIn addition, ScotRail has increased service frequency during evening hours between Falkirk High and Larbert, as well as between various stations, now offering a half-hourly service.\n\nIn Wales, service frequency on the Cardiff to Holyhead route has improved, with additional trains running to destinations including Chester, Shrewsbury, and more.

A U.S. official stated, \"Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv, enabling them to retaliate against Russian forces that are striking or preparing to strike them.\" However, the official clarified that strikes deep inside Russia, particularly those involving long-range missiles, were not permitted.\n\nThis shift in policy appears to respond to a request from Ukraine made weeks earlier, seeking permission to attack Russian positions near Kharkiv. French President Emmanuel Macron raised concerns about how Ukrainians could effectively defend Kharkiv without targeting \"the locations from which the missiles are launched.\" He emphasized the need to \"allow them to neutralize the military sites responsible for launching the attacks.\" The United Kingdom also expressed support for Ukraine's ability to strike inside Russia.\n\nThis development marks a significant change from the previous U.S. policy, which restricted strikes within Russia due to fears of escalating the conflict. Until now, Ukraine could not use Western weapons for attacks on Russian territory and had to rely on its own military arsenal.

This marks a historic moment, as Trump is the first former U.S. president to face criminal convictions.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016, just prior to the presidential election. This payment was intended to prevent Daniels from discussing her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. In 2017, Cohen received $420,000 from Trump as reimbursement for various expenses he covered for the former president, including the payment to Daniels. Prosecutors contended that Trump committed fraud by intentionally misclassifying these payments in official documents.\n\nTrump, who has vowed to appeal the verdict, described the trial as being \"rigged\" against him and maintains that he never had an affair with Daniels and did not commit fraud. In response to Trump's remarks, some political figures criticized him as \"reckless.\" However, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky defended Trump on social media, asserting that \"these charges never should have been brought in the first place\" and expressed confidence that the conviction would be overturned on appeal. Other political allies also voiced support for the former president.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Daniels' attorney stated, \"This was the culmination of a lot of things,\" adding that the outcome weighed heavily on Daniels, but ultimately brought her a sense of relief. \n\nOn June 1, Daniels commented on the trial, expressing that she believed Trump should face jail time and community service. She characterized Trump as \"completely and utterly out of touch with reality\" and emphasized the ongoing impact of the trial on her life, stating, \"I’ve been telling the truth the entire time. It’s not over for me. It’s never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.\" It is worth noting that not all of Daniels' testimony regarding Trump during the trial was negative.\n\nIn the wake of the verdict, several commentators speculated that it could impact Trump's poll numbers. A recent poll revealed that 54% of registered voters approved of the verdict, while 34% disapproved. Analysts cautioned that initial polls may not accurately reflect longer-term public opinion trends."}

Titled \"Mini Chase Pride,\" this gathering aims to provide an LGBTQ+ friendly space after the larger Chase Pride event was cancelled at the end of August due to escalating costs and changes in government legislation.\n\nLocal community group, The Friends of Hednesford Park, has transformed the town center with vibrant LGBTQ+ imagery, including posters for the local charity SAGE and a festive banner featuring the emblematic deer, a significant symbol for the area. This display has been funded by the Hednesford Town Council through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, along with support from the Council of Queers.\n\nIn an effort to enrich the experience, the group plans to host a family craft workshop in conjunction with the market. \n\nOn the day the original Pride event was supposed to take place, local MP, who is the constituency's first openly LGBTQ+ representative, shared a video on Facebook praising The Friends of Hednesford Park for their decorations and celebrating the upcoming mini-pride. \"There was a time when I wished I wasn't gay, that I could just fit in,\" he reflected. \"But through events like pride, we learn that embracing ourselves and living authentically is essential for a fulfilling life.\"\n\nChase Pride's operations director, Aiden Bowden, spoke with Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley via email about the event’s challenges and objectives. \n\n**Why was Chase Pride's main event cancelled this year?**\n\nBowden explained, \"The rising operational costs have become overwhelming, especially given the current economic climate. Usually, grants and corporate sponsorship cover about 50% of our costs, but these have become tougher to secure.\"\n\n**What prompted the idea for Mini Chase Pride?**\n\n\"This concept emerged from community engagement,\" Bowden shared. \"Our mission extends beyond a one-day celebration; it's about promoting diversity and inclusivity throughout the year. A comment suggesting that the community could still come together in the park sparked the idea. With only eight days to organize, we embraced the challenge of creating a small, low-key pride event—a safe space for everyone.\"\n\n**What is the origin of Chase Pride?**\n\nChase Pride was initiated by Kathryn Downs, a local transgender woman, who desired to foster a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ individuals in Cannock Chase. After experiencing considerable prejudice, she aimed to ease the path for future generations. The idea gained momentum on social media, leading to a community meeting in her kitchen where the vision for Chase Pride was established.\n\n**Does the Mini Pride event share Chase Pride's original mission?**\n\n\"Each person experiences pride uniquely,\" Bowden remarked. \"While some seek a relaxed atmosphere, others reflect on the history of LGBTQ+ rights. There's still a pressing need to advocate for equality and combat discrimination.\"\n\n**What are the challenges of organizing an event without a dedicated space?**\n\nLimited preparation time poses obstacles for the mini-pride. \"The Hednesford Street Market team has been wonderfully accommodating, granting us space for the event,\" Bowden noted. \"Although attendance will be restricted compared to previous years, if even one person finds value in the event, it will be a success.\"\n\n**Is there a plan for funding the event?**\n\n\"This year's event is self-funded and low-key, which helps minimize costs,\" Bowden explained. \"However, it relies heavily on support from friends and family, making sustainability challenging at this stage. Yet, we are committed to making it happen.\"\n\n**Looking ahead, is Chase Pride planning future events?**\n\n\"Organizing Chase Pride is a significant undertaking, and all options are carefully examined,\" Bowden stated. \"We continuously adapt to changing regulations to ensure we can create a successful event. The best way to stay updated is by following our social media channels.\" \n\nThe Mini Chase Pride event promises to be a heartfelt celebration of community spirit, affirming the importance of inclusivity and support for the LGBTQ+ population in Cannock Chase."}

The Azov Brigade gained prominence for its role in the conflict during Russia's invasion in 2022. While the group has been labeled by Russia as a far-right, ultranationalist, extremist, racist, and neo-Nazi organization, it is officially recognized as the 12th Special Forces Brigade in Ukraine.\n\nThe prior ban on the Azov Brigade's access to American weapons stemmed from concerns regarding the extremist ideologies associated with its founders. Human Rights Watch had also raised issues related to human rights violations involving brigade members. According to the brigade's official website, since 2014, it has been engaged in a process of \"cleansing\" itself of undesirable elements. The US State Department, however, stated that there was \"no evidence of gross violations of human rights\" attributed to the brigade.\n\nNotably, Russia has designated the Azov Brigade as a terrorist organization since 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticized the brigade, calling it an \"ultranationalist armed formation\" and accused the US of \"flirting with neo-Nazis,\" suggesting that Washington is using the \"Ukrainian people as an instrument.\"\n\nIn response to the US decision, the Azov Brigade characterized the move as a \"new page\" in its history, asserting that they are \"becoming even more powerful, more professional, and more dangerous for occupiers.\" The brigade also announced that this development would enhance its combat capabilities and contribute to the safety and health of its personnel.\n\nPreviously, the Azov Brigade had been restricted from participating in US-led military exercises and receiving American weapons. Formed in 2014 to combat Russian separatists, the brigade was integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2015."}

This clarification came after Melbourne University Publishing (MUP) announced its plans to release a book titled *He Went Back for His Hat*, with Justice Lee credited as the author on the publisher's website.\n\nIn response to the court’s remarks, Professor Emeritus Warren Bebbington, chairman of the MUP board, informed *The Sydney Morning Herald* that they had consulted Justice Lee before making the announcement and that he had no objections to the book’s publication. \"The book was an initiative of MUP, but Justice Lee was approached by us in advance and did not see any issue with the publication of a judgment that is in the public domain,\" Bebbington stated. He further noted that MUP did not seek Justice Lee's approval for the book's title or cover.\n\nThe title of the book alludes to a remark made by Justice Lee regarding former Liberal staffer Bruce Lehrmann’s choice to sue Network 10 after criminal charges against him were dropped. \"Having escaped the lion's den, Mr. Lehrmann made the mistake of going back for his hat,\" Lee commented. The case involved Lehrmann's defamation lawsuit against Network 10 and Brittany Higgins following an interview she gave. Ultimately, Judge Lee found that on the balance of probabilities, Lehrmann had raped Higgins. Lehrmann previously faced criminal charges for the alleged assault, which were dismissed due to juror misconduct.\n\nIn May 2024, Lehrmann filed an appeal against the court’s decision in the defamation case.

Lehrmann's solicitor, Zali Burrows, opposed this request, arguing that Lehrmann was on Centrelink benefits and unable to make the payment. \"The only shot he'd probably ever have in making money is by going on [television] or something silly like that,\" Burrows told the court."}
{"title": "Thousands of pagers explode in Lebanon killing twelve people and injuring thousands", "content": "On Tuesday, a series of coordinated explosions rocked southern Beirut, Lebanon, resulting in the tragic deaths of twelve individuals and injuring approximately 2,800 others. CNN reported that the blasts primarily targeted Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and paramilitary organization. The exact cause of the explosions remains under investigation, but preliminary findings have pointed to the possibility that the devices were either rigged with explosives or had faulty batteries, according to Reuters. \n\nThe following day, additional explosions from walkie-talkies, laptops, and radios led to an increased death toll, with 20 more fatalities and 450 additional injuries reported. \n\nExperts from the consulting firm Predicta Lab indicated to CNN that hardware tampering was likely a factor in the pager explosions, dismissing the possibility of a cyberattack. They suggested that the malicious modifications could have occurred before the bulk shipment arrived in the country.\n\nReports indicated that a shipment of the targeted pagers had been sitting at a port for three months, awaiting completion of import paperwork. Investigators have suggested that the pagers contained one to three grams of an explosive substance alongside metal balls, seemingly added to amplify the explosion's impact.\n\nThe timing of the attack appears to coincide with Hezbollah's investigation into reports of inconsistent battery life among the batch of pagers, as noted by sources.\n\nThe pagers in question are produced by a Taiwanese company. On Wednesday, Gold Apollo, the affiliated company, stated that the devices were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, a firm based in Hungary's capital. However, Hungarian authorities have since denied any involvement by BAC Consulting KFT in the manufacturing process. The CEO of BAC Consulting KFT told NBC News that the company acted as an \"intermediate\" but did not manufacture the pagers. The BBC has reported that official records show BAC registered at an address associated with multiple organizations, none of which operates as a manufacturing facility.\n\nA law professor from Indiana University condemned the attacks, emphasizing the prohibition against weaponizing devices used by civilians. The United Nations has also called for a thorough investigation into the matter.\n\nLebanon's government described the incident as an \"Israeli cyberattack,\" although Israel has not claimed responsibility. These explosions occur against a backdrop of heightened tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, which have escalated since the onset of conflict in 2023."}

Inside, you'll find original content compiled over the past month, alongside an overview of major polling trends and the most significant stories in the race.\n\n**Campaign Trail Highlights**\n\nThis month's feature delves into an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the U.S. Reform Party's process for selecting its presidential nominee, the ongoing turmoil at the Trump trial, and an interview with the Libertarian Party's recently appointed vice presidential nominee.\n\nAs of early May, former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, led President Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, in head-to-head polling 46.6% to 45.1%. When independent candidates—specifically presumptive Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—were included, Trump's lead expanded to 41.4%, compared to 39.2% for Biden, 10.2% for Kennedy, 2.1% for Cornel West, and 1.6% for Stein.\n\nBy the end of May, Trump continued to lead Biden, 45.4% to 44.6% in the head-to-head matchup, and 41.9% to 39.7% in a five-way race that included Kennedy, Stein, and West.\n\nTrump's legal troubles continued to unfold in New York, where testimony from adult film star Stormy Daniels and his former attorney was heard. A judicial order restricted Trump's comments about the trial, but he still managed to criticize Judge Juan Merchan and prosecutor Alvin Bragg, alleging that Biden and the White House orchestrated the case against him. Ultimately, Trump was found guilty of all 34 felony counts. In the aftermath, his campaign reportedly raised over $50 million within 24 hours.\n\nAmid these legal challenges, Trump maintained a campaign schedule in New York City, including rallies in New Jersey and the Bronx, even stopping at a bodega in Harlem. He asserted that traditionally Democratic states like New York and New Jersey could be viable targets for his campaign this November.\n\nWhile stopping short of outright endorsement, former Trump rival Nikki Haley indicated she would vote for Trump in November, despite continuing to secure a notable percentage of support in her own campaign. Trump has denied any interest in selecting Haley as his running mate. Among potential vice presidential picks for Trump, media speculation includes Senators Tim Scott, Kevin Cramer, and Marco Rubio, as well as Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and former Governor Larry Hogan.\n\nIn a twist, an Ohio ballot access law cast doubt on Biden's ability to qualify for the state ballot, as his official nomination was set for the Democratic National Convention in August. To circumvent this issue, the Democratic Party opted for a June ceremony to officially nominate Biden. Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers passed an amendment to ensure Biden's presence on the ballot.\n\nBiden has agreed to two debates with Trump, the first taking place on June 27—an unprecedented early date for the general election debates. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to debate Trump's yet-to-be-selected running mate.\n\nThe Biden campaign has also targeted Trump over a controversial ad that features the phrase \"Unified America.\" By extension, Biden emphasized Trump's alleged comments regarding his programming choices on the reality show \"The Apprentice\" in 2004, highlighted by an expose from producer Bill Pruitt.\n\nIn other news, Biden addressed graduates at a college in Delaware, condemning what he called the \"poison of extremism.\" Despite the institution not facing widespread protests, some graduates protested by turning their backs during his speech, largely due to Biden's administration's support for Israel.\n\nIn a surprising revelation, the New York Times reported that Kennedy had a parasitic infection removed from his brain in 2010, an assertion he confirmed in legal documents, though experts disputed the claim's accuracy. Amid ongoing debates and campaign preparations, Kennedy formally lodged a complaint with the Federal Election Commission after being excluded from the debate hosted by CNN.\n\nKennedy also garnered nominations from several minor parties, solidifying his position as a formidable independent candidate.\n\nThe Libertarian Party convened its national convention in Washington, D.C., featuring speeches by both Kennedy and Trump. Ultimately, former police officer Chase Oliver, an LGBTQ activist, secured the party's nomination for president after seven rounds of balloting, with Mike ter Maat as his running mate.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution Party's Randall Terry gained notoriety as the anti-abortion activist nominee for president, while Jill Stein locked in her candidacy for the Green Party.\n\nNicholas Hensley, national chairman of the Reform Party, elaborated on the party's unexpected nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president. Initially focused on local races, Hensley described a pivotal video conference with Kennedy that resulted in the party's decision to forgo a convention and nominate Kennedy directly with a vote of 17 in favor, two opposed, and two abstentions.\n\nHensley expressed optimism about Kennedy's ability to attract votes, noting alignment on key issues like fiscal responsibility, ethics reforms, and foreign policy. Kennedy, previously a Democratic primary candidate, now runs with attorney and activist as his vice presidential pick.\n\nExcitement and turmoil marked the Libertarian National Convention from May 23-26, where notable moments included Trump's address to the delegates amidst division over his presence. His reception was mixed, with some delegates booing, while he received applause for certain promises aligned with libertarian principles.\n\nFollowing his speech, leading Libertarian candidates held a joint press conference, which was overshadowed by a candidacy frontrunner who made headlines for erratic behavior, later attributed to an unintentional cannabis high.\n\nAs the primary season ramps up, the political landscape remains dynamic, marked by unexpected alliances, legal battles, and a diverse array of candidates vying for voter support ahead of November's election."}

She was approximately 50 years old. \n\nKamala’s posture had made her susceptible to this degenerative joint and bone condition, which the elephant care team managed through a regimen of multi-modal therapies, including monthly injections. In recent weeks, her mobility had significantly decreased, and she often remained in one place, likely due to discomfort. Given her poor prognosis, the animal care staff made the difficult decision to end her suffering.\n\nBorn in the wild around 1975 in Sri Lanka, Kamala was raised at a sanctuary for orphaned elephants before being relocated to the zoo in 1976. She had two calves during her time in Calgary: a male named Calvin, born in June 1986, and a female named Maharani, born in 1990. In May 2014, she was transferred to the Smithsonian National Zoo along with her calf Maharani and another herd mate.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes Asian elephants as endangered. Kamala's lineage has played a vital role in the birth of at least a dozen elephant calves worldwide, and the zoo noted she was a significant ambassador for her species.\n\nThough her herd mates were not present during the procedure, they were allowed time to be with her afterward."}

Deif, accused of orchestrating targeted rocket attacks and the intentional murder of civilians, has reportedly been killed by Israeli forces. While Hamas has not confirmed or denied his death, the ICC stated it is still in the process of verifying the information. Prior to this, the court had dropped charges against seven individuals due to their deaths.\n\nThe arrest warrants require the 124 ICC member states to detain the accused if they enter their territories. Since the ICC does not have its own enforcement capabilities, it depends on member states to implement these warrants. Previous instances have shown that such warrants can significantly restrict the international movements of indicted individuals as member states are obligated to uphold these legal commands within their jurisdictions."}
