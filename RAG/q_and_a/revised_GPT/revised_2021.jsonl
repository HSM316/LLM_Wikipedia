Under the updated plan, businesses will be required to contribute 10% of wages in July and 20% in August and September as the scheme winds down. Additionally, support for self-employed individuals will continue, with another grant available from February to April.\n\nOther measures to support workers include an increase in the minimum wage to £8.91 per hour starting in April, and the continuation of a £20 weekly increase in Universal Credit benefits through September.\n\nSunak also announced changes to the tax structure, revealing that corporation tax will rise to 25% in April 2023. He emphasized that this would remain the lowest rate in the G7, with only businesses making profits over £250,000 being taxed, which accounts for just 10% of companies. Firms with profits below £50,000 will maintain a 19% corporation tax rate. He confirmed that income tax, national insurance, and VAT rates will not change, with duty on alcohol and fuel remaining frozen.\n\nFor the hospitality sector, VAT will remain at a reduced rate of 5%, and the threshold for business rates relief will increase from £45,000 to £100,000 this year. Additionally, new tax incentives were announced for designated areas including locations in Liverpool City Region, which aim to reduce customs costs and encourage investment."}
{"title": "International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Palestine", "content": "On Wednesday, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced the opening of a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in Palestine. This investigation will be led by a British lawyer set to succeed Fatou Bensouda as chief prosecutor on June 16.\n\nBensouda stated that the decision to initiate the investigation followed a thorough preliminary examination by her office, which spanned nearly five years. She committed to a \"principled, non-partisan approach\" and assured that the case will be treated \"independently, impartially, and objectively, without fear or favor.\" The preliminary examination, conducted in December 2019, concluded that \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe investigation will center on alleged war crimes occurring since June 13, 2014, shortly before the Israeli military operation in Gaza. Bensouda indicated that the investigation’s priorities would be determined in due course and identified both the Israeli Defense Forces and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as potential perpetrators.\n\nSince becoming a member of the ICC in 2015, Palestine has long accused Israel of war crimes. Conversely, Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, asserts that the court lacks jurisdiction over Palestinian territories, arguing that Palestine is not sovereign.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the ICC's decision, calling it \"the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy.\" He criticized the court for seemingly ignoring other nations, such as Iran and Syria, that are also accused of committing grave offenses. \"Without any jurisdiction,\" Netanyahu said, \"it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against terrorists who deliberately target civilians, are the war criminals.\" He vowed to \"fight for the truth until we overturn this scandalous decision.\" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid referred to the ICC's decision as \"morally bankrupt and legally flawed.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. State Department stated, \"We will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security,\" asserting that the ICC lacks jurisdiction in this matter. The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. emphasized continued collaboration with the American government.\n\nThe U.S., a non-member of the ICC, previously imposed targeted sanctions on the prosecutor's office during Donald Trump’s presidency and has urged current President Joe Biden to maintain these sanctions, calling the ICC investigation \"illegitimate\" and \"politically motivated.\" The United States also opposes the ICC's investigation into American actions in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, welcomed the decision as \"a long-awaited step\" toward justice and accountability, urging nations not to politicize \"these independent proceedings.\"\n\nHamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem, who has previously asserted the legality of rocket attacks on Israel under international law, praised the ICC decision as \"a step forward to implement justice\" for the Palestinian people. He expressed the hope that it would lead to accountability for the occupation.\n\nEstimates from the United Nations indicate that approximately 2,200 Palestinians, including 1,500 civilians, lost their lives during the 2014 Gaza conflict, known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. Israeli estimates indicate that at least 73 Israelis, including six civilians, were killed in the same operation.\n\nThe Israeli government has reportedly engaged in public relations and diplomatic efforts to thwart the investigation, according to the Associated Press."}

The current limit is set at 20 people. This incident occurred just days after new restrictions were implemented, which include stay-at-home orders, a military-enforced curfew, and a fine of approximately 100 Jordanian Dinars (about US$140) for individuals not wearing face masks.\n\nPrime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh accepted their resignations, which were formalized in one of two Royal Decrees issued by King Abdullah II. Reports indicate that the second decree appointed the Deputy Prime Minister for Local Administration to oversee the Ministry of Interior and the State Minister for Legal Affairs to manage the Ministry of Justice.\n\nA recent surge in coronavirus infections has resulted in at least 4,627 deaths and over 300,000 confirmed cases in Jordan, a nation of ten million, according to Reuters. Officials have attributed the rise in cases to the public's failure to adhere to restrictions, leading to dozens of arrests for breaching stay-at-home orders.

{"title": "Wales widens smoking ban, includes at hospitals, schools and playgrounds", "content": "**Wales Expands Smoking Bans in Public Spaces**\n\nToday, Wales announced an extension of its smoking ban to include hospitals, schools, and playgrounds, with violators facing a £100 fine. This makes Wales the first region in the UK to implement such a comprehensive ban.\n\nThis new measure builds on existing restrictions, including a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces since 2007 and a prohibition on smoking in cars with children since 2015. \n\nGoverned by the left-wing party, the Welsh government stated that the purpose of the ban is to discourage smoking among both adults and children by making it appear less normalized, while also encouraging those who smoke to quit.\n\nTo reinforce the smoke-free initiative, two hospitals in southern Wales have implemented a button-activated speaker system to remind visitors of the ban. A similar system was trialed in 2016, featuring messages recorded by local schoolchildren.\n\nEluned Morgan, the Minister for Mental Health, Wellbeing, and the Welsh Language, expressed pride in the new legislation, asserting that \"[t]his legislation will benefit the health of future generations in Wales, as fewer children will be exposed to smoking.\" She emphasized the need to \"combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\n\nHowever, the government faces criticism from smokers' rights groups. Simon Clark, Director of the Forest organization, argued that the ban is excessive, stating, \"There is no evidence that smoking in the open air poses a risk to anyone else's health, including children.\" He further contended that targeting smokers in high-stress situations, such as hospital visits, is particularly unfair.\n\nWikinews reached out to Eluned Morgan's office for further insights on the ban:\n\n**What is the core objective of this law?**\nThe legislation aims to protect individuals from harmful second-hand smoke exposure, assist those trying to quit, and reduce the likelihood of children starting to smoke.\n\n**What is the envisioned future of Wales in terms of smoking if the law succeeds?**\nWe aim to create more smoke-free public spaces, promoting healthier lifestyles. Plans to extend the smoking ban to the outdoor areas of cafes, restaurants, and town centers are underway.\n\n**How do you address criticisms regarding government overreach?**\nThe law is designed to safeguard public health, diminish second-hand smoke exposure, and deter smoking amongst youth.\n\n**Do you believe individuals have the right to smoke?**\nWhile smoking is an individual choice, it remains the leading preventable cause of early death in Wales, hence the need for legislation to mitigate its effects and promote healthier choices.\n\n**Where can smokers smoke?**\nThe smoke-free law applies strictly to designated areas specified in the legislation.\n\n**Does the ban on smoking in playgrounds apply at all times, even when children are not present?**\nYes, all public playgrounds in Wales will be smoke-free at all times, irrespective of the presence of children. Restricting smoking in areas frequented by young people helps to normalize healthier behaviors and decrease the likelihood of youth smoking.\n\nBy enforcing these regulations, Wales hopes to create a healthier environment for future generations."}

Last year, he garnered widespread admiration by raising nearly £33 million for the National Health Service (NHS) by walking 100 laps around his garden to celebrate his 100th birthday. Moore was also a World War II veteran, having served in the British Army.\n\nHis daughters shared the news of his passing, stating, \"The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable.\" They added that he was \"an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay in our hearts forever.\"\n\nBorn in West Yorkshire, England, Moore joined the Army in 1939. After serving, he became an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Bovington, Dorset. He relocated to Bedfordshire in 2007, where he lived with his family.\n\nIn April 2020, Moore started walking laps in his garden with the goal of raising £1,000 for the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. His efforts soon gained immense popularity, ultimately raising millions and setting a Guinness World Record for the most money raised by an individual through a charity walk. He also collaborated with singer Michael Ball on a duet that reached number one on the UK charts, making Moore the oldest artist to achieve this milestone. On his birthday, April 30, he was appointed an honorary colonel by the British Army, and in July, he received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his accomplishments.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Moore, calling him \"a hero in the truest sense of the word\" and highlighting how he \"embodied the triumph of the human spirit.\" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said, \"Britain has lost a hero.\" A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen would send a private message of condolence to Moore's family. In his honor, flags at places like 10 Downing Street were flown at half-mast.\n\nMoore had previously battled skin cancer and suffered a hip fracture in 2018. He credited his hospital care with inspiring him to support the NHS, referring to the medical staff as \"marvellous.\" He is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren."}

The ten-day campaign commenced on March 1, marking the theme \"Each for Equal,\" designed to promote gender equality within the Mysore Division.\n\nDuring our interview, Garg addressed the societal challenges women face in the Indian Railways. \"For a woman to succeed, the journey is far more arduous than it is for a man. They often need to work twice as hard before gaining recognition,\" she remarked. Garg emphasized that women juggle multiple responsibilities, balancing work and household duties, which places them under immense pressure. Her observations indicated that despite these challenges, women show exceptional dedication.\n\nGarg suggested that societal attitudes need to shift, starting at home, to support women in their professional paths. She stressed the importance of educating male colleagues and family members to foster a culture of respect and support.\n\nAs the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread globally, panic buying ensued, with consumers hoarding essentials like toilet paper. In response, Woolworths and Coles in Australia limited purchases, initially setting a cap of four packs per transaction, which later reduced to one or two. Both retailers increased order frequency and stock to meet consumer demand after experiencing shortages.\n\nIn March, Wikinews interviewed Iranian chess player Dorsa Derakhshani about her career and experiences. Banned from representing the Iranian national team in 2017 for not wearing a hijab during competition, Derakhshani’s brother also faced sanctions for competing against an Israeli opponent. Currently studying in the United States, she reflects on her inspirations, including Judit Polgár, and discusses the significant barriers faced by women in Iran's chess community.\n\nIn a fascinating study published in March, researchers examined social harm aversion in lab rats, uncovering brain regions pivotal in such behavior. The study demonstrated that rats preferred not to harm their peers even when it benefitted them, revealing deep-seated social instincts.\n\nAstronomers from the European Southern Observatory reported the discovery of the closest known black hole to Earth, found in the V590 Monocerotis system, located approximately 1,010 light-years away. The team, led by Thomas Rivinius, revealed that this system is the first visible to the naked eye to contain a black hole.\n\nIn the buildup to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Wikinews conducted interviews with multiple vice-presidential nominees from various parties, including the Constitution, Libertarian, and Green parties. Each candidate spoke about their political philosophies, campaign strategies, and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations.\n\nA notable event occurred in August when a major water main break in White Plains, New York, disrupted supplies citywide. Emergency crews worked swiftly to restore water service, with repairs completed by the evening of the incident.\n\nIn the realm of sports, Caloundra Rugby Union defeated Wynnum 45-24 in an intense match during the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union season. Both team coaches highlighted the competition's physical nature and the improving dynamics of the teams involved.\n\nAs the U.S. presidential race intensified, Wikinews continued to interview candidates from various parties, summarizing their key positions on critical issues such as climate change, social media freedom, and international conflicts like that in Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nIn a significant technological shift, the announcement by Red Hat to transition CentOS to CentOS Stream in December led to widespread disappointment among long-time users, prompting the community to seek alternatives. This prompted the development of Rocky Linux, named after the original founder of CentOS.\n\nLastly, the implications of extraterrestrial research sparked intrigue as a study explored the ability of Earth-based life, such as E. coli, to survive in entirely hydrogen or helium-rich atmospheres, potentially broadening the scope for life detection on exoplanets.\n\nTogether, these stories illustrate not only the challenges faced by women and minorities in various fields but also the resilience of communities and individuals around the globe in navigating unprecedented times."}

This motion was inspired by the [Global Campaign Name], which advocates for the implementation of the [Treaty Name]. The council's resolution requests that the Australian Prime Minister be contacted to express their support for the treaty.\n\nDuring Tuesday's council meeting, Councillor Tony Crook introduced the motion, with Councillor Jane Greacen seconding it. Crook acknowledged that the council's influence over nuclear weapons is limited but emphasized Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle, stating that nuclear weapons \"have brought untold misery to communities around the world.\" In contrast, Councillor Arthur Allan opposed the motion, arguing that nuclear weapons are a \"federal issue\" and that the motion amounted to a \"non-binding resolution.\"\n\nDeputy Mayor Mark Reeves voiced his support for the motion, characterizing it as a matter of \"moral standing\" and reflective of community values. He humorously noted, \"Nobody's said to me — 'You know what we need?

Specifically, Cavani used the term \"negrito,\" which the FA deemed \"insulting, abusive, improper, and harmful to the reputation of the game,\" classifying it as an \"aggravated breach\" due to its reference to color, race, and/or ethnic origin.\n\nThe Uruguayan Academy contended that terms like \"negro\" (black) and its diminutive \"negrito\"—similar to terms such as \"gordo\" (fat) or \"gordito\"—are often used in a friendly or affectionate manner. The statement, signed by the academy’s president, emphasized this point.\n\nIn addition to the Academy's defense, the Argentine Academy of Language, which shares a variety of Spanish with Uruguay, called upon the FA on December 22 to exonerate Cavani, reinforcing the notion that his intent was not racist.\n\nOn Friday, the hashtag #graciasnegrito became a trending topic on Twitter in both Argentina and Uruguay, as fans showed solidarity with Cavani in light of the sanctions he received. \n\nIn summary, the Uruguayan Academy criticized the FA's decision, attributing it to a \"lack of cultural and linguistic understanding.\""}
{"title": "International Criminal Court rules its jurisdiction includes Palestine", "content": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled on Friday that its territorial jurisdiction extends to areas of Palestine, a decision that has drawn criticism from Israeli and U.S. officials.\n\nIn a 2-1 ruling, the ICC judges stated that their decision was based on Palestine's membership in the court's founding treaty. They clarified, however, that the ruling does not address the statehood of the disputed territory or its borders. Citing a 60-page legal brief, the court confirmed that its jurisdiction includes territories occupied by Israel since 1967, specifically Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nChief Prosecutor Karim Khan endorsed the ruling for its \"judicial clarity,\" while noting that the Office would analyze the decision before determining its next steps. In December 2019, Khan previously indicated that \"war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,\" naming both the Israeli Defense Forces and the Palestinian group Hamas as potential offenders.\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh hailed the ruling as \"a victory for justice and humanity.\" Similarly, Hamas and various Palestinian officials, along with the international organization Human Rights Watch, commended the decision.\n\nIn contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ruling as hypocritical, asserting that \"when the ICC investigates Israel for fabricated war crimes, this is pure antisemitism.\" He vowed to contest what he described as \"this perversion of justice\" with all available means.\n\nIsrael further criticized the ICC for overstepping its jurisdiction in political matters, arguing that its parameters should not extend to borders that remain unresolved in peace negotiations. The Israeli military insists it has mechanisms in place to prevent misconduct, though these have faced past criticism as being inadequate.\n\nThe U.S. government also expressed opposition to the ruling. Spokesperson Ned Price stated that, while President Joe Biden aims to improve relations with Palestine, the U.S. opposes both the recent ruling and Palestine's designation as a member of the Rome Statute. Price reiterated that when Palestinians sought to join the Rome Statute in 2015, the U.S. did not recognize them as a sovereign state, and thus they should not be eligible to participate in international organizations or entities, including the ICC. He emphasized that the court's jurisdiction should apply only to nations that consent to it or are referred by the UN Security Council.\n\nBoth Israel and the U.S. have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute and do not recognize the court's jurisdiction. The Israeli government's expansion of settlements in disputed territories has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, where approximately 700,000 settlers now reside."}

This law is set to take effect no earlier than July 30, which is 91 days after the legislative session's recess.\n\nThe bill, known as the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act, was initially vetoed by Governor Asa Hutchinson on Monday but was subsequently overridden in the Senate with a 25–8 vote and in the House with a 72–25 vote. It prohibits healthcare professionals from providing hormone treatments, surgeries, or any related referrals to minors under 18.\n\nArkansas Representative Robin Lundstrum, who sponsored the bill, stated, \"They need to get to be 18 before they make those decisions.\" The legislation also affects minors already receiving such treatments, with penalties including the loss of medical licenses for noncompliance.\n\nThe bill received praise from conservative groups like The Family Council, while Governor Hutchinson expressed concern that it reflects \"a product of the cultural war in America.\" He added, \"I hope my veto will encourage my Republican colleagues across the country to resist the temptation to place the state in every decision made by parents and healthcare professionals.\"\n\nIn response, a coalition representing 67,000 pediatricians nationwide condemned the legislation, arguing it denies essential medical care to young people. Dr. Madeline Deutsch, the medical director of San Francisco’s LGBTQ Health Program, remarked that there is a \"general consensus among professionals\" about the efficacy of transition-related treatments, while Dr. Robert Garofalo from a children's hospital in Chicago criticized the bill for \"perpetuating the very things we know are harmful to trans youth.\"\n\nHolly Dickson, executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), criticized the supporters of the bill for ignoring widespread bipartisan opposition, calling it a \"discriminatory crusade against trans youth.\" She announced plans for a lawsuit to challenge the law in court, stating, \"Blocking trans youth from the care they need simply because of who they are is not only wrong, but it’s also illegal.\"\n\nThe passing of this ban follows previous anti-transgender measures in Arkansas and other states, including a bill signed by Hutchinson on March 25 that prevents transgender girls and women from competing in sports aligned with their gender identity.

The MP is stepping down to contest the upcoming Scottish Parliament election on May 6. Previously, the SNP's Gray secured the seat in the last election with 45.1% of the vote, outperforming the second place candidate, Helen McFarlane of the Scottish Labour Party, who garnered 32.0%.\n\nAmong the eight candidates vying for the position is Donald Mackay, the leader, secretary, and immigration spokesman for the United Kingdom Independence Party Scotland (UKIP). According to UKIP's website, the party has campaigned since its inception in 1993 for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, claiming that their efforts pressured former Prime Minister David Cameron into holding a referendum on June 23, 2016. Following the resignation of UKIP's leader in 2019, Peter Walker of The Guardian noted that the party was polling at less than 1%, having largely been replaced by Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party.

Gray secured his seat with 45.1% of the vote in the last election, defeating the Scottish Labour Party’s Helen McFarlane, who garnered 32.0%.\n\nAmong the eight candidates vying for the constituency is Jonathan Stanley, representing the Scottish Unionist Party. Stanley was selected for this seat in September after news of Gray's nomination emerged. He is also a candidate for the Holyrood elections, running as a list candidate for the Unionist party.\n\nWikinews spoke with Stanley about pressing issues both nationally and locally in Airdrie and Shotts.\n\nFor context, Stanley provided links to opinion pieces and press releases that informed his responses. The first opinion piece focuses on housing and suggests measures such as restricting housing access to individuals who have resided in the UK for ten years, imposing a 20% tax on houses sold to foreigners, and abolishing tax relief for \"buy-to-let\" mortgages. The second piece critiques a law passed by the Scottish Parliament, arguing that it undermines personal freedoms and compromises families' privacy and security in their homes.\n\nThe two mentioned press releases pertain to COVID-19, advocating for widespread flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and the closure of UK borders to non-medical flights from China at the pandemic's onset, as well as additional measures for the public during the crisis.\n\n**Key Points from the Interview:**\n- **Reasons for Running:** Stanley advocates for a unionist approach that prioritizes vulnerable communities. He highlights concerns regarding the potential closure of Monklands A&E and the impact on local jobs due to the decision by Teleperformance to shift to remote work.\n- **Pandemic Response:** He criticizes the government's handling of the pandemic, describing it as ineffective and economically damaging, while underscoring the lack of health professionals in cabinet positions.\n- **Transport Services:** Stanley calls for urgent road repairs in Airdrie and Shotts, arguing that approximately 90% of passenger journeys are made by car, and stresses the need to support local taxi drivers better.\n- **Support for a Second Independence Referendum:** He firmly opposes the idea, maintaining his stance as a representative of the Scottish Unionist Party.\n- **Climate Change Policy:** Stanley contends that the Conservative government should focus on promoting technological solutions to climate change, rather than adopting austerity measures, and advocates for increased nuclear energy usage.\n- **Status of Pro-Union Parties:** Emphasizing collaborative strategies, he highlights that only the Scottish Unionist Party seeks cooperative efforts with established parties.\n- **Departure from UKIP:** Stanley explains his exit from UKIP due to concerns over sectarianism and divisive tactics, and expresses his commitment to inclusive unionism through the Scottish Unionists.\n- **Local Issues:** He identifies the need to maintain services in local district hospitals, asserting that their centralization might endanger emergency care in rural areas.\n- **Legal Reforms:** Stanley aims to support legislation that provides patients with the right to seek treatment from alternative providers and to restrict public bodies from engaging in unregulated legal actions against employees or clients.\n\nThis interview highlights Jonathan Stanley's perspectives and priorities as he campaigns in the upcoming by-election."}

In the last election, Gray secured 45.1% of the vote, 13.1% more than the second-place candidate, Helen McFarlane of the Scottish Labour Party, who received 32.0%.\n\nAmong the eight candidates vying for the position is ***Neil Manson***, the Scottish regional chair of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Manson, who joined the SDP in 2019 after reading the party's New Declaration outlining its principles, has described his career as extensive across international markets in both the manufacturing and energy sectors.\n\nWikinews spoke to Manson about key issues impacting Airdrie and Shotts during this by-election.\n\n**Why did you decide to run in this by-election?**\n\"The SDP is experiencing a genuine resurgence across the UK as people become disillusioned with current party politics and seek alternatives with honest policies rooted in our families and communities—nowhere more so than in Scotland. As Regional Chairman for Scotland and a long-time resident who raised my family in Airdrie, I'm a passionate advocate for the SDP.\"\n\n**What are your thoughts on the handling of the coronavirus pandemic by Westminster?**\n\"Leading the nation through the pandemic has been a complex task, and there have undoubtedly been missteps by both the Westminster and Holyrood governments. While I believe critique can be constructive, excessive negativity doesn't help. We supported the initial lockdowns, but I have been skeptical of the ongoing 'Stop-Go' approach which did not effectively control the virus and risked undermining personal liberties, prolonging economic downturn and societal challenges.\"\n\n**What improvements do you propose for transport services in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency?**\n\"Our primary pledge is to nationalize the rail system, with an immediate focus on enhancing bus services, especially through increased funding for regional and rural bus travel.\"\n\n**Do you support the idea of a second independence referendum?**\n\"No. Constitutional matters are reserved, and the UK Parliament's agreement to a referendum previously resulted in the Scottish people's decision to remain in the United Kingdom. Any discussions of change need to occur at Westminster first.\"\n\n**Is the Conservative government doing enough to combat climate change?**\n\"Environmental issues have suffered from too much rhetoric and insufficient action under current and past governments. While the SDP is committed to meeting global environmental obligations, we advocate for sustained changes through encouraging behavioral shifts across industries and society.\"\n\n**How does the SDP differentiate itself from the SNP?**\n\"We fundamentally disagree with the SNP's self-description as social democrats; we see them as populists. The SDP embodies true social democratic values consistently—not just during elections. We're devoted to Scotland's success within a strong United Kingdom, benefiting all its citizens.\"\n\n**Do you support the establishment of an English Parliament?**\n\"Yes, I believe this would help heal divisions across the UK and counter the perception of Westminster as a solely English Parliament, with the devolved regions governed from a distance. Such a framework could reduce apathy and accountability gaps that parties like the SNP exploit.\"\n\n**What does public welfare mean to you?**\n\"The SDP prioritizes the common good in Britain's national interest. We aim to represent the welfare of all British people, advocating for a Social Market Economy where public sector and market policies can coexist beneficially without ideological distortions.\"\n\n**What local issue do you feel is being overlooked?**\n\"I am concerned about the future of sports and leisure facilities in our towns. Many of these facilities face risks due to Scottish Government funding cuts to local councils, and ensuring access for all ages is essential for physical and mental health, particularly as we recover from the pandemic.\"\n\n**If elected, what legal change would you pursue?**\n\"I would advocate for the repeal of the controversial SNP Hate Crime and Public Order Act, which could criminalize speech deemed 'hateful.' We believe the bill is ambiguous and lacks adequate safeguards, despite a recent campaign highlighting that 87% of Scots value free speech. It also raises significant concerns regarding the erosion of sex-based rights. The SDP's policy on Transgender and Biological Sex-based Rights affirms our belief in biological sex and supports clear, plain English discussions on these topics in health and reproductive care.\""}
{"title": "Chinese NPC to take control of Hong Kong electoral system", "content": "On Friday, Chinese officials unveiled a proposal that would mandate rigorous vetting of electoral candidates from Hong Kong before they can participate in elections. The plan stipulates that only \"patriots\" loyal to the People's Republic of China will be permitted to run for office. This development follows two years of protests against the Chinese government, during which 47 pro-democracy candidates, activists, and campaigners have been imprisoned under national security laws.\n\nDuring the annual work report, Premier Li Qiang emphasized the need to \"resolutely guard against and deter\" foreign interference. He addressed around 3,000 members of the National People's Congress (NPC), where a draft decision was introduced, influenced by Vice Chair of the NPC's standing committee. The proposals include amending the election process, which would grant a committee, responsible for electing the chief executive, greater authority to \"directly participate in the nomination of all legislative council members\" and establish a \"qualification vetting system\" for all candidates.\n\nPolitical scientist Willy Lam, speaking to Agence France-Presse, noted that the proposed vetting committee would likely disqualify candidates perceived as disloyal to the Chinese government. Following the announcement, Beijing's liaison office claimed support for the changes has been expressed by \"individuals from all walks of life\" in Hong Kong.\n\nLast year, national security laws were enacted that increased the Chinese government's ability to prosecute Hong Kong residents and bar them from running for office. As of Thursday, 47 pro-democracy activists and potential candidates remained in custody following an informal primary election that prosecutors alleged aimed to \"overthrow\" the government.\n\nThe situation escalated on Monday when approximately 1,000 protesters gathered outside a Hong Kong court, calling for the release of what they termed \"political prisoners,\" according to The Guardian. Many of those arrested faced charges under new laws, with 32 individuals denied bail partly due to the stringent requirements of the national security laws. In contrast, 15 defendants who faced opposition from prosecutors were granted bail.\n\neo: La Nacia Popola Asembleo de Ĉinujo ekregos la honkongan elektosistemon."}

This tremor was felt across the North Island and parts of the South Island. Following this, two additional quakes, recorded at magnitudes of 7.4 and 8.1, occurred near the Kermadec Islands, as reported by New Zealand's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). According to Radio New Zealand, over a dozen aftershocks were recorded, some measuring as strong as 5.4.\n\nNEMA issued an early warning at 9:45 AM regarding potential land and marine impacts, stating that flooding was expected along the coast from East Cape to Wellington, as well as on New Zealand's East Coast.

Ingenuity is part of the Perseverance rover's mission, which primarily focuses on exploring Mars and gathering rock samples in the search for signs of past life.\n\nIngenuity was previously housed in the belly of Perseverance, the car-sized rover that landed on Mars on February 18. While attached to the rover, Ingenuity was kept charged and warm. On Sunday, Ingenuity exited the rover, allowing Perseverance to move away and expose Ingenuity's solar array to direct sunlight.\n\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory released a statement declaring that this marks the first time Ingenuity has survived a night autonomously while being directly exposed to the Martian atmosphere. The statement noted that the success confirmed the effectiveness of Ingenuity's insulation, heaters, and battery capacity to endure the frigid conditions, which can drop as low as -90 °F (-130 °C). The helicopter utilized energy from its solar array to power a small heater, safeguarding its electronics from the extreme cold.\n\nMars has only 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure, meaning that Ingenuity's rotors must spin about three times faster to achieve flight on Mars than they would on Earth, according to ABC News. The helicopter has been designed to be lightweight, weighing approximately 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds), to facilitate takeoff. Tim Canham from NASA highlighted that \"the processor on the helicopter is about 100 times more powerful than the processor on the rover itself.\"\n\nThe next phase includes a scheduled blade movement test for today, as reported by CNN. If this test is successful, Ingenuity could proceed with its first flight test, potentially occurring by Sunday. If successful, this would represent the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. Over the next 31 days, five additional flights are planned. If these flights succeed, Ingenuity will further explore its environment, collect rock samples, and capture images of its observations, while also monitoring its temperature and battery recharge performance.\n\nThe Perseverance rover is set to transmit images captured by Ingenuity back to Earth just a few hours after they are taken. NASA reported that the rover traveled a distance of 471 million kilometers to reach its destination in Jezero Crater."}

Among those who responded, Adrian Mizher agreed to discuss his campaign and policies over the phone on March 30.\n\nMizher presents himself as a senior loan closer for a banking subsidiary based in Texas. He has lived in the state for five years and has spent a total of 16 years in the area over the last 24. A graduate of the University of New Mexico, Mizher grew up in Philadelphia and has also resided in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He aims to \"fight tirelessly for fidelity to the Constitution and promote our Conservative values,\" advocating for issues spanning from the economy to immigration.\n\nAn Inside Elections poll released on March 18 indicates that Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, leads with 21% support, followed by Democrat Josh Winegarner at 17% and Republican Jake Ellzey at 8%. With a margin of error of ±4.6%, the district is categorized as “lean Republican,” having voted 51% for Donald Trump in the previous presidential election, a decrease from 54% in 2016.\n\n**Wikinews: Could you introduce yourself and share your background in politics?**\n\n**Adrian Mizher:** My name is Adrian Mizher. I don't have a history in official politics, as this is my first campaign. However, I have closely followed political matters all my life, so I consider myself knowledgeable about current issues and historical events. I graduated in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in accounting and later became a teacher for five years before transitioning into banking, where I've worked for the last 16 years. I am married and have three children.\n\n**Wikinews: What do you see as the powers and duties of Congress?**\n\nCongress has specific responsibilities outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Primarily, it is tasked with managing the federal budget and ensuring adherence to Constitutional limitations, a duty I believe is being neglected.\n\n**Wikinews: Why do you think Texas will elect an independent candidate in this election?**\n\nI believe that once people understand my viewpoints, rooted in the Constitution and our Founding Principles, they'll recognize that my approach reflects true conservative values. Many Republicans who we elect do not consistently act conservatively once in office. My choice to run as an independent stems from a desire to clarify my message beyond simply labeling myself as Republican, which often risks misinterpretation.\n\n**Wikinews: Can you share your thoughts on the late Congressman Ron Wright?**\n\nI had great respect for Ron Wright; he was an exemplary Congressman who fulfilled his commitments and represented our district well. His passing is truly unfortunate.\n\n**Wikinews: What pressing issues would you address in Congress if elected?**\n\nMy primary aim is to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, as it is currently overly involved in our lives and beyond its constitutional boundaries. Additionally, I would advocate for election integrity—ensuring the public's trust in the electoral process is crucial. Immigration reform is also vital; we should simplify the process to encourage legal immigration while remaining vigilant about our borders. \n\n**Wikinews: Your website mentions the need for a sovereign nation controlling its borders. Can you elaborate?**\n\nWe welcome immigrants who contribute positively to our society. The immigration process should be straightforward, focusing on public safety and the willingness to integrate into our society. I envision a system where those wanting to immigrate can do so easily and responsibly.\n\n**Wikinews: How would you handle the vaccination rollout if elected?**\n\nWhile I believe vaccination distribution isn't primarily a federal responsibility, I would support rapid vaccine distribution while allowing state and local governments to manage the specifics.\n\n**Wikinews: What is your view on President Biden?**\n\nI see President Biden as adhering to a left-wing agenda that prioritizes political expediency over effective governance.\n\n**Wikinews: What about former President Trump?**\n\nPresident Trump accomplished several positive initiatives, particularly in foreign policy and economic deregulation. However, I wish he had communicated his values more effectively, which could have broadened his appeal.\n\n**Wikinews: How do you view the ongoing border crisis?**\n\nBoth parties politicize the border crisis, failing to take decisive action. We need to treat immigration requests in a straightforward manner while strengthening our border control without placing blame solely on one administration.\n\n**Wikinews: How would you address the February power crisis in Texas?**\n\nWhile I experienced the crisis firsthand, I believe it's primarily a state issue. I would encourage state officials to take appropriate measures to prevent future occurrences while resisting the urge to expand federal oversight unnecessarily.\n\n**Wikinews: What sets you apart from other candidates promoting conservative values?**\n\nI regard myself as a vocal advocate for conservative values, committed to clearly articulating these principles to dispel misconceptions about what conservatism embodies.\n\n**Wikinews: How has COVID-19 influenced your campaign?**\n\nCOVID-19 has not significantly altered my campaign approach, as I have no reference point for campaigning without it.\n\n**Wikinews: If you are not elected this time, what are your plans for the future?**\n\nAt this moment, I do not have a specific plan for the future.\n\n**Wikinews: Lastly, which historical figure do you admire most?**\n\nI hold great admiration for Abraham Lincoln for his remarkable growth throughout his leadership. Ronald Reagan also inspires me due to his ability to connect with people.\n\n**Wikinews:** Thank you for your time, Mr. Mizher."}

Alongside this election, voters will also select two members for the Board of Estimate and Taxation and nine members for the City Council. Sturm shared insights into his campaign and policies during the interview.\n\nPhilip Sturm is a U.S. military veteran who served from 1999 to 2003, stationed in Japan before participating in operations during the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. According to his campaign website, Sturm has experience in \"manufacturing and operations\" and has been involved in civic engagement, including serving as co-chair for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in District 62 in 2005 and being a member of Veterans for Kerry. His community involvement also includes volunteering as a special deputy in the Minneapolis Police Department, participating in emergency management workgroups, and serving on the 9/11 and Global War on Terror Remembrance Task Force.\n\nSturm is running against incumbent Jacob Frey, who won the last election in 2017 with 44.69% of the vote and has already announced his bid for re-election.\n\n**Sturm's Background**\n\nSturm introduced himself as a 40-year-old married man, originally from Tennessee but raised in Minnesota. He moved to Minneapolis in 2003 after being honorably discharged from the military, where he had trained as a combat engineer. He has worked in the chemical and manufacturing industries and has volunteered for community service to learn more about public safety and emergency management.\n\n**Motivation to Run for Mayor**\n\nReflecting on the civil unrest in 2020, Sturm stated he felt compelled to take action after witnessing a lack of effective leadership during times of crisis, believing that the city has been poorly managed by those he describes as \"credentialed yet fundamentally incompetent.\"\n\n**Military Service Overview**\n\nSturm joined the military in 1999 and trained in San Diego as a combat engineer. He served overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq during pivotal operations and was involved in humanitarian efforts amid military actions.\n\n**Campaign Vision**\n\nSturm advocates for a departure from the current political establishment, arguing that Minneapolis needs leadership that embraces empirical decision-making and accountability. He aims to dismantle the culture of militarism within the police and seeks reforms that will ensure they operate as part of the community, rather than in opposition to it.\n\n**Economic Disparities and Housing Policy**\n\nSturm emphasizes the need for tax reforms to address economic disparities in the city. He supports initiatives to strengthen housing protections for tenants and believes stable housing and food security are essential for improving educational outcomes for low-income students.\n\n**Political Support and Future Plans**\n\nThroughout his political history, Sturm has aligned himself with progressive candidates in Minnesota, including Bernie Sanders and Tim Walz. He underscores the importance of living wage initiatives and seeks to foster partnerships between local industries and educational institutions to enhance job opportunities within the community.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, Philip Sturm presents himself as a candidate who wants to challenge the status quo of Minneapolis governance and pursue policies that address systemic inequalities. As the election approaches, Sturm's campaign will focus on community engagement, police reform, and economic justice in a city navigating ongoing challenges."}

He stated, \"The situation is getting worse, and we have decided to suspend all flights between Brazil and France until further notice.\" A report indicated that as of March 16, Lineage P.1 represented only 0.5% of all COVID-19 cases in France. However, opposition politicians have urged the government to take further preventative measures. A member of the Socialist Party described the suspension as \"necessary and a very good decision.\"\n\nObservations from the Brazilian health institute suggest that Lineage P.1 spreads more rapidly among younger populations. The Foundation reported an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases among Brazilians in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, with rates climbing by 565%, 626%, and 525% respectively since early January, alongside a 316% increase in the overall population. This variant is reportedly 2.2 times more transmissible and has a 25–61% higher ability to reinfect individuals previously infected with other strains. According to RT TV, the Brazilian variant features two significant mutations: N501Y, which enhances transmissibility, and E484K, which potentially reduces the efficacy of vaccines and natural immunity from prior infections.\n\nFrance is currently experiencing its third wave of COVID-19, with over 99,000 related deaths reported and more than 5,900 patients in intensive care units as of yesterday, the highest number since mid-April of last year. The situation appears to be worsening, with 41,000 to 60,000 positive tests reported over the Easter weekend. The total number of COVID-19 cases in France has reached at least 5.1 million, the highest in Europe. As of recent reports, 7% of the population has been fully vaccinated, while 21% have received their first dose. Since April 3, \"restrictive measures\" have been implemented nationwide, affecting travel, movement, and in-person education, and a curfew from 7 PM to 6 AM is currently in place in metropolitan France.\n\nWhile variants originating from Brazil and elsewhere account for less than 4% of infections in France, the variant from the United Kingdom is responsible for approximately 80% of cases.

One evacuee shared with the BBC, \"[e]ven if people say we don’t need to worry about a tsunami, I won’t buy it [...] I learned from my bitter experience 10 years ago, and that’s why I evacuated.\"\n\nThe JMA suggested that this earthquake may be an aftershock of the devastating 2011 earthquake, which had a corresponding tsunami that claimed over 18,000 lives. This month also marks the tenth anniversary of that disaster, which caused radiation leaks at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Prime Minister Suga stated that \"there have been no anomalies reported from any of the nuclear facilities\" following the recent earthquake.\n\n**Headlines in other languages:**\nes: Sismo de 7,3 grados sacude a Fukushima  \nnl: Aardbeving voor oostkust Japan  \npt: Japão: Terremoto de magnitude 7,3 abala Fukushima"}
{"title": "Greek lawmakers approve contentious campus police legislation", "content": "The Greek parliament approved controversial legislation on Thursday aimed at establishing a campus police force and a disciplinary council to address violence at universities. The decision, passed by a vote of 166 to 132 in a 300-member parliament, faced strong opposition from many students and professors who argue that it threatens freedom of expression.\n\nKey provisions of the legislation include the formation of a campus police division, restrictions on entry to university grounds, and the creation of a \"disciplinary council\" with the authority to suspend or expel students.\n\nA government spokesperson referred to university campus violence as \"timeless\" and stated that \"[t]he police will drive out extremist political groups and safeguard the infrastructure, finally making the university a safe place.\"\n\nBefore the vote, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the center-right New Democracy party which initiated the legislation, questioned, \"Where else in the world do we see images [...] of historical buildings being vandalized?\"\n\nGreek universities have a history of unrest, dating back to a 1973 student revolt against the military dictatorship from 1967 to 1974, which was violently suppressed, resulting in the deaths of at least 26 people. Another protest in 1990-91 against educational reforms linked to Mitsotakis' father led to the death of a teacher. More recently, in October, a university rector was taken hostage by masked individuals.\n\nIn 2019, the government lifted a long-standing restriction that had effectively barred police from entering university campuses. Critics of the new police measures argue that they infringe upon freedom of expression—a claim the government dismisses as \"ridiculous.\" Recent demonstrations have seen protesters chanting \"Bread, education, and freedom,\" a slogan echoing the 1973 uprising against the junta. In January, police employed tear gas to disperse a protest challenging lockdown restrictions.\n\nOpposition to the proposed campus police force has also emerged from academia, with Professor Dimitris Kaltsonis stating, \"There is no need for special police to control the campuses.\" The University and College Union (UCU) expressed solidarity with Greek colleagues opposing the initiative on Twitter, calling it \"alarming and not in line with best practice.\"\n\nSome demonstrators have called for \"more doctors, fewer police.\" Eurostat data from 2016-2018 indicated that Greece had the second-highest number of police officers per capita in the European Union, which a spokesperson for the Ministry for Citizen Protection labeled as \"inaccurate.\" The spokesperson emphasized that while the government is focusing on improving the quality of education, \"[p]olice on campuses is not a choice but a necessary move.\"\n\nThe government has allocated €23 million in funding for law enforcement to better address contemporary challenges, including COVID-19 and external threats.\n\nThe left-wing opposition party has criticized the legislation, alleging it aims to render universities \"sterile and unfree.\""}

The city is named in honor of John Bradfield, the esteemed engineer behind the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the original railway network of Sydney. This decision follows a public consultation held last year.\n\nIn a press release on the New South Wales government website, Premier Gladys Berejiklian emphasized the importance of the chosen name, stating, \"Bradfield was a renowned engineer who designed and oversaw the construction of both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney's original railway network.\" She added, \"The name Bradfield is synonymous with delivering game-changing infrastructure and sets the right tone for an area we have referred to as the 'Aerotropolis Core' until now.\"\n\nThe planned city will cover an area of more than 1 square kilometer (100 hectares) north of the suburb of Badgerys Creek. Premier Berejiklian described Bradfield as a \"high-tech manufacturing and research hub\" that is expected to create approximately 200,000 jobs. She explained, \"This area will be transformed into a thriving city center, home to advanced manufacturing, research, science, and education, and we want Bradfield to be as iconic as Sydney and Parramatta.\" She added that current paddocks will eventually develop into a bustling city center offering premier job opportunities.\n\nMinister for Planning and Public Spaces also highlighted the extensive community involvement during the naming process. \"The number of suggestions the community put forward during the 'Name the Place' consultation was overwhelming, and we're thrilled with the level of participation this project attracted,\" he remarked. \"We appreciate everyone who shared their thoughts, and we will consider the remaining suggestions as names for streets, parks, and other landmarks in the new city.\"\n\nAccording to a report from Sydney Metro, the Western Sydney International Airport is scheduled to open in 2026, along with the accompanying metro system.\n\nWhile some social media users have expressed concerns about the hotter climate in the area, Wikinews analyzed mean maximum temperatures for Sydney, Parramatta, and Bradfield, revealing average annual temperatures of 23.13°C, 23.8°C, and 24.04°C, respectively, based on data from 1996 to 2020.\n\nOfficial records show that the City of Sydney was established in 1842 and covers an area of 26.15 square kilometers, while Sydney itself was first settled as a penal colony in 1788.

Fortunately, multiple sources confirmed that no casualties occurred.\n\nThe caravan, consisting of six grain barges being towed by the Chelyabinsk towboat, was navigating a route across the Danube when the incident took place around 12:54 PM (local time) near Baja.\n\nThe caravan strayed too far to the left of the navigable passage and struck a bridge pillar while attempting to turn right. Gyula Szabó, a nautical expert, attributed the collision to pilot error. An eyewitness reported to TV2 that strong winds also played a role in the accident.\n\nFollowing the collision, the barges were salvaged by boats anchored at Baja. A police inspection revealed no leaks, and the reassembled caravan departed the scene later that same day.\n\nIn a statement to RTL Klub, nautical expert Dávid Pethő noted that this section of the river is particularly challenging to navigate with such a configuration. He added that the maneuver to cross the bridge needs to begin three kilometers upstream, leaving little room for error.\n\nNo significant damage was reported to the bridge, and cross-river traffic remained unaffected.

This surge has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the holding of large political rallies for local and state elections, religious gatherings, official complacency, and the emergence of highly transmissible new variants. Government officials have cited a \"willful disregard\" for health measures as a significant contributor to the crisis. A health officer remarked, \"The number of unmasked individuals was notably higher last month. While caution has returned, many people still choose not to wear masks.\"\n\nIndia surpassed Brazil to become the second-most infected country globally as of April 12, trailing only the United States. The spread of the new variant has compelled hospitals to take drastic measures, such as accommodating two or three patients per bed and repurposing over a dozen hotels and banquet halls in New Delhi into COVID-19 treatment centers. In states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, there have been reports of oxygen shortages. The Ahmedabad Medical Association has urged the Gujarat state government for additional oxygen supplies, warning, \"If this situation persists, the death toll will rise, and doctors may be forced to close hospitals due to lack of oxygen.\"\n\nIn response to the escalating crisis, the government has shifted its priorities from vaccine exports to domestic production, administering a total of 114 million vaccine doses—ranking it third globally after the U.S. and China. Additionally, India recently approved a third vaccine, developed by Russia, for emergency use. Despite concerns, the government maintains there is no oxygen shortage and attributes challenges in vaccine distribution to over-planning rather than a supply issue.\n\nIn New Delhi, authorities have implemented stay-at-home orders and closed non-essential establishments such as restaurants, malls, gyms, and spas, allowing limited operations for movie theaters. Mumbai has taken additional measures, shutting down most industries and public places and restricting movement as laborers flock to the city. A curfew is now in effect in Maharashtra’s epicenter, allowing only essential services to operate between 8 PM and 7 AM. Furthermore, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has canceled Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams.\n\nThe crisis has also taken a tragic toll, with 1,038 new deaths reported, bringing the national total to over 173,000. India now ranks fourth worldwide in COVID-related fatalities, following the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, placing immense pressure on local cremation centers and burial grounds."}

This ruling allows landlords to raise rents, invalidating a law that had capped rent for approximately 90% of tenants in the nation. In response to the decision, protesters gathered in Berlin to demonstrate against both the court ruling and potential rent increases, with some demanding action from large real estate companies.\n\nDemonstrators filled the streets of Berlin, particularly in the Neukölln and Kreuzberg districts, with reports indicating that thousands participated in the protests. The crowd marched from Hermannplatz to Oranienplatz and then to Kottbusser Tor, prompting police to close off several streets for the day. Organizers claimed that 25,000 people joined the protests, according to the Berlin Spectator.\n\nProtesters carried signs with slogans such as \"No more rent hikes!\" and \"Fair housing for all!\" Many brought kitchen utensils, including lids from boiling pots, to make noise, leveraging the double meaning of the German word for lid, which also refers to a rent cap. Chants echoed through the streets, including the slogan, \"If you take a cover from us, we'll come back with thousands.\"\n\nThe rent cap was initially introduced by a coalition of the Left and Green parties in the Berlin Senate, aiming to address the rising rental prices in the city. The appeal that led to the recent court ruling was filed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP).\n\nThe Berlin State Government's earlier ruling had set rents at their June 2019 levels from February 2020 until February 2025. A senator responsible for urban development expressed disappointment in the court's decision, emphasizing that the federal government or individual states now have the opportunity to establish laws to regulate rental prices."}

Similar troop withdrawal plans were also disclosed by the United Kingdom and NATO.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had previously set a May 1 deadline for the withdrawal, and both the U.S. and its NATO allies are expected to commence troop reductions on that date. The scheduled end of the U.S. withdrawal coincides with the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, which initiated the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history.\n\nReflecting on the reasons for entering Afghanistan, Biden stated, \"We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.\" He emphasized the need to break the cycle of prolonging military operations in hopes of achieving ideal withdrawal conditions. Biden added, \"I'm now the fourth U.S. president to oversee American troop presence in Afghanistan—two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth.\"\n\nBiden referenced a worldwide threat assessment that indicated the Taliban might gain ground militarily and argued that American troops should not serve as leverage in foreign conflicts, deeming such a situation an \"indefinite\" obligation. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani expressed via Twitter, \"We will work with our U.S. partners to ensure a smooth transition.\"\n\nCurrently, there are about 2,500 U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO operation that includes approximately 9,600 personnel; NPR reports that around 1,000 special operations forces may also be present. Although combat operations by the U.S. and UK concluded in October 2014, this withdrawal marks a significant reduction in military presence.\n\nBiden affirmed, \"It's time for American troops to come home,\" emphasizing that the exit would be \"responsible, deliberate, and safe.\" Although NATO and the UK will join in the troop pullout, the U.S. will maintain its \"diplomatic and humanitarian work\" in Afghanistan, according to the BBC.\n\nNATO stated that its goal of preventing terrorists from using Afghanistan as a safe haven had been achieved, asserting, \"There is no military solution to the challenges Afghanistan faces.\" A NATO statement reinforced this sentiment: \"Our troops went into Afghanistan together, we have adjusted together, and now we are leaving together.\" German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer echoed this unity, asserting the importance of an orderly withdrawal.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during discussions in Brussels, expressed commitment to collaboration, emphasizing, \"In together, adapt together, and out together.\"\n\nIn announcing the British drawdown, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace emphasized the importance of a stable future for Afghanistan while prioritizing the safety of current troops. \"We must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten,\" he stated.\n\nAfter speaking with former President George W. Bush, Biden remarked on the shared respect for the valor and integrity of U.S. armed forces.\n\nIn the Senate, Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the withdrawal as \"a grave mistake,\" warning that foreign terrorists would not cease their threats simply due to a change in U.S. policy. Another Republican lawmaker described it as \"a huge propaganda victory for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.\" Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen cautioned that troop withdrawal should be based on the realities on the ground rather than arbitrary deadlines. Senator Elizabeth Warren supported Biden's plan, emphasizing that maintaining a troop presence does not enhance security. Former President Barack Obama also endorsed the decision, labeling it \"the right choice.\"\n\nThe Director of the Central Intelligence Agency warned the Senate about potential threats posed by Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan, noting a \"significant risk\" to U.S. interests."}

Among those responding was Daryl Eddings, Sr., a federal law enforcement officer and decorated military veteran. On March 30, his campaign manager, Faith Chatham, provided insights into his campaign and policies during a phone interview.\n\nEddings' background is extensive. With 26 years in the military and over 30 years in federal law enforcement, he has served in roles such as an operations officer in aviation and has extensive experience responding to natural disasters and civil unrest. He is also the founder of Operation Battle Buddy, which aims to connect over 20,000 veterans and their families. Although born in California, he maintains deep roots in Texas.\n\nHis campaign runs amid a competitive election landscape. As per an Inside Elections poll published on March 18, Republican candidate Susan Wright, the late congressman's widow, leads with 21%. She is followed by Democrat Jana Sanchez at 17% and another Republican candidate at 8%, indicating strong Republican leanings in the district, which voted 51% for Donald Trump in 2020.\n\n**Background of Daryl Eddings, Sr.**\n\nChatham described Eddings as a dedicated public servant with a remarkable military career, emphasizing his awards and honors. He has lived in Texas for years, nurtured a commitment to the region, and experienced the significant challenges facing its residents.\n\n**Eddings on Responsibilities as a U.S. Representative**\n\nEddings believes a U.S. Representative's primary duty is to advocate for the needs of their constituents, lamenting that many currently in Congress serve narrow interests rather than the general populace. He stresses a commitment to the Constitution and is disturbed by political actions that undermine democratic processes, including attempts to restrict voting rights.\n\n**Running in a Republican-Dominated District**\n\nChatham highlighted the shifting political dynamics in the district, which has been Republican-controlled since 1983. Recent trends show increasing Democratic support, particularly in Tarrant County, which has shown a shift toward purple territory. Eddings' connections, combined with a united Democratic front, position him as a serious contender.\n\n**Views on Late Congressman Ron Wright's Governance**\n\nChatham critiqued Wright’s record, arguing he pushed policies that were detrimental to constituents. She expressed Eddings’ belief that Wright failed to address significant local issues like healthcare access and economic opportunities.\n\n**Key Issues for Eddings If Elected**\n\nHealthcare, affordable housing, education, and job creation are top priorities for Eddings. Chatham elaborated that his focus is not only on increasing minimum wage but also on creating well-paying jobs and promoting accessible education and training.\n\n**Eddings’ Position on Current Political Climate**\n\nEddings shares concerns around partisanship and dark money in politics, advocating for transparency. He seeks to represent all constituents, regardless of political affiliation, and emphasizes that his dedication is to the people, not to partisan politics.\n\n**Final Thoughts on the Campaign**\n\nChatham concluded that while Eddings is committed to addressing the community's needs and fostering unity, the impact of COVID-19 has significantly altered traditional campaigning methods. She acknowledged that engaging voters and building infrastructure in the district will be vital for Eddings’ campaign, no matter the outcome of this election.\n\nThis special election on May 1 presents Eddings with an opportunity to change the political landscape of a historically Republican district."}

He will now lead a community of 12 million followers across former Yugoslav republics, including Kosovo, as well as dioceses in Australia, the United States, and beyond.\n\nIn the past, Perić has voiced conservative, pro-government sentiments, notably critiquing Serbian journalist and human rights advocate, Veran Matić, in December. He has also been a proponent of dismissing outspoken professors from the Faculty of Theology in Belgrade.\n\nA current issue facing the Church involves property disputes in neighboring Montenegro. A law enacted in 2019 requires proof of ownership for properties built before 1918, yet the Montenegrin government continues to assert its claims over all Orthodox properties, most of which the Serbian Orthodox Church currently manages.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church does not recognize Kosovo’s independence, aligning with the official stances of Russia and Serbia. Kosovo is home to significant religious sites in Orthodox Christianity and is regarded as a spiritual birthplace. Perić was ordained as a monk at a monastery in Kosovo.\n\nThe election occurred among 39 eligible bishops of the Holy Assembly of Bishops, who conducted a secret ballot at Belgrade's Cathedral. After deliberation, three candidates were selected, and Perić's name was drawn randomly, seen by believers as an expression of divine will.\n\nA thanksgiving service was held immediately following the election.\n\nOrthodox Christianity plays a crucial role in the cultural and public life of Serbia, Montenegro, and the contested region of Kosovo."}

France and Italy expressed readiness to \"promptly restart\" vaccinations if the EMA's upcoming results are positive, especially after an encouraging initial statement.\n\nAstraZeneca has maintained that there is no increased risk of blood clotting associated with its vaccine. Among the 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and the UK, only 37 reports of blood clots were received—significantly lower than expected rates and similar to those observed with other authorized COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThese recent vaccine suspensions have further complicated the EU's vaccination efforts, which are already suffering from notable supply shortages. French officials characterized their decision to temporarily halt the rollout as \"not lost time,\" justifying the action based on a few \"very unusual and troubling cases.\" Dr. Anthony Cox, a drug safety researcher at the University of Birmingham, described the situation as a \"cascade of bad decision-making\" across Europe."}

This decision came after Mitchell Stoltz, a Senior Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), sent a letter on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers. The repository had been taken down on October 23, following a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nLaunched in July 2008, youtube-dl is a free and open-source program written in Python that allows users to download videos from many websites. The RIAA's takedown notice alleged that youtube-dl was designed to circumvent copyright protection systems under 17 U.S. Code § 1201, asserting that it could enable unauthorized redistribution of music videos. The source code for youtube-dl included test cases referencing various copyrighted songs, which the RIAA claimed violated copyright laws.\n\nIn response, Stoltz clarified in his letter to GitHub that the test files referenced in the source code were only used to verify the functionality of youtube-dl and did not contain permanent copies of the songs. He emphasized that streaming short clips merely to test the software's operation is legally acceptable. The EFF attorney pointed out that facebook-dl does not decrypt video streams that are protected by commercial DRM technologies.\n\nFollowing the reinstatement, URLs to the copyrighted songs were removed from the source code and replaced with a test video uploaded by Philipp Hagemeister, the former maintainer of youtube-dl. Hagemeister had previously commented on the takedown in an interview with Wikinews.\n\nyoutube-dl operates as a command-line tool, utilizing “extractors” to manage video data from diverse sites. The EFF letter noted, “Any software capable of running JavaScript can derive the URL of a video stream,” demonstrating that YouTube’s instructions for accessing video streams are publicly available. The letter drew an analogy comparing this openness to the riddle found in \"The Lord of the Rings\": travelers must simply say the word \"friend\" to enter a door, illustrating that YouTube provides similar access to those who ask.\n\nHours after public access was restored, maintainers of youtube-dl expressed gratitude to GitHub and the EFF on GitHub, thanking them for supporting the project and enabling its continued development. Stoltz later tweeted that youtube-dl serves a vital purpose akin to that of a VCR, empowering users to control their consumption of freely available video content.\n\nThe project has a global user base and is widely employed for downloading Creative Commons and public domain material.

He argued that its purpose is to maintain power for content distributors rather than genuinely protecting creators' rights.\n\n**What is your view on the RIAA's DMCA notice regarding youtube-dl?**\nStallman expressed that the notice distorted the law and emphasized the injustice of the DMCA, which facilitates oppression under the guise of copyright protection.\n\n**Why was the DMCA introduced?**\nHe speculated that its primary motive was to grant more power to corporations while restricting sharing among individuals, particularly evident in its application against tools like youtube-dl.\n\n**Is DRM essential for the DMCA's function?**\nStallman affirmed that DRM supports the DMCA's broader intent of repressing information sharing, highlighting that both components of the DMCA work to hinder the distribution of content.\n\n**Impact of DRM on society:**\nHe noted that DRM centralizes control in the hands of a few corporations, stifling diversity and competition, and making alternatives to non-DRM solutions increasingly rare.\n\n**Legislation and Reform Proposals:**\nStallman suggested outright abolishing anti-circumvention provisions in DMCA. He argued that harmful effects, particularly on the right to repair and software control, must be addressed to restore user autonomy.\n\nThrough this discussion, Stallman underscores the wider implications of DRM and DMCA on user rights and the digital landscape, advocating for change to empower users rather than corporations."}
{"title": "European Union to reduce carbon emissions by 55% of 1990 levels by 2030", "content": "On Wednesday, the European Union (EU) announced an ambitious new climate goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. This marks an increase from the previous targets set in 2014, which aimed for a 40% reduction by 2030 and an 80-95% reduction by 2050. \n\nThe new EU Climate Law was finalized after 14 hours of negotiations and includes the formation of a 15-member independent body tasked with advising on climate policy proposals. It also emphasizes increased investment in \"carbon sinks.\" According to members of the European Parliament (MEP), these measures are expected to facilitate the achievement of a 57% net reduction target. However, this assertion has been challenged by Barbara Mariani, a senior policy officer for climate and energy, who argues that the proposed measures would only yield a 52.8% reduction in actual emissions.\n\nIn a press release from September 2020, the European Commission (EC) committed to presenting legislative proposals by June 2021, following extensive public consultation and impact assessments. These proposals will include limits on CO2 removal that counts towards the target, aimed at encouraging EU member states to reduce emissions rather than relying solely on carbon removal. The press release highlighted that adopting the new target in a timely manner would allow the EU to signal its elevated ambitions to international partners ahead of the Glasgow climate summit and set an example for other nations.\n\nThis new climate initiative also means that at least 30% of the EU's €1.8 trillion long-term budget will be allocated to climate-related measures. Notably, Poland has established its own climate strategy, opting not to commit to a broader pledge for climate neutrality. Instead, Poland has set a target to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030. The country currently derives 80% of its electricity from coal, but plans to shift towards renewable energy sources and develop its first nuclear power plant.\n\nThe EC president stated that this decision puts the EU \"on a green path for a generation.\" However, some MEPs expressed disappointment, with one member stating, \"we fought hard but achieved little,\" and describing the law as a \"big disappointment.\" Wendel Trio, the Director of Europe, noted that the target of \"at least 55% emission reduction by 2030\" does not align with the EU's goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C by the end of the century, adding that the legislation felt rushed and insufficient for leading global climate action.\n\nAn MEP and chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee acknowledged the challenges in negotiating the language of the law, stating that while the Parliament was willing to pursue more ambitious targets, the \"compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have accomplished in the last decade in Europe.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, under current measures, the EU is on track to achieve a 46% reduction in emissions by 2030. The EC’s press release indicated that greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 25% from 1990 to 2019.\n\nIn contrast, multiple reports indicate that the United Kingdom has set a target to achieve a 78% emissions reduction by 2035."}
{"title": "Irish Finance Minister Donohoe criticises OECD's global minimum corporate tax rate", "content": "On Tuesday, Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe voiced concerns over negotiations facilitated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) aimed at establishing a global tax framework. He stressed that smaller nations like Ireland \"must retain the ability to utilize tax policy as a legitimate tool to offset the significant, material, and ongoing advantages held by larger countries.\"\n\nSpeaking during a virtual seminar on international taxation, Donohoe emphasized that any new agreement should respect Ireland's established corporate tax rate of 12.5%. This rate has attracted major corporations such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, which collectively account for one in eight jobs in Ireland. In 2020, corporate tax receipts in Ireland reached €11.8 billion. Projections indicate that this figure will rise from €11.6 billion in 2021 to €12.5 billion by 2025, according to financial estimates.\n\nDonohoe highlighted that Ireland's competitive tax rates help drive job creation and investment. While he is in favor of an agreement that promotes \"appropriate and acceptable tax competition,\" he insists that any baseline rate be set below the 21% threshold proposed by the United States.\n\nHe urged recognition of the low tax rates in Ireland and other small countries, pointing out that larger nations benefit from \"advantages of scale, location, resources, and industrial heritage.\" Defending the long-standing 12.5% rate, Donohoe argued it falls within the realm of healthy tax competition, fostering investment, growth, and innovation that align with Ireland's industrial strategy. According to The Guardian, current proposals could reduce Ireland's corporate tax base by 20%, leading to tax receipts estimated to be €2 billion lower than projected for 2025, according to the Irish Department of Finance.\n\nBrian Keegan, the Director of Public Policy at the Irish Tax Institute, remarked that the issue at hand is \"not about tax change; it's about political change.\" Meanwhile, Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the OECD, noted that \"a new dynamic is likely to lead us to a resolution,\" adding that the US's willingness to address concerns simplifies the complex negotiations.\n\nAn Irish Department of Finance spokesperson told CNBC on Monday that \"political-level discussions on these issues have not yet occurred.\"\n\nThe Guardian has reported that many companies in Ireland pay considerably lower effective tax rates compared to their counterparts in other countries, with Apple paying as little as 0.005% in 2014. A European Commission ruling in 2016 mandated that Apple repay €13 billion in back taxes to the Irish government, but this ruling was overturned in July, with the court stating that \"the commission did not succeed in demonstrating an advantage to the requisite legal standard.\""}

The U.S. government defended these high rates—ranging from 9.49% to 59.72% on steel and 60.81% on transformers—by invoking the \"adverse facts available\" (AFA) provision.\n\nThe AFA requires companies accused of dumping to provide detailed information; otherwise, they face significant anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. After unsuccessful negotiations, South Korea officially filed a complaint with the WTO in February 2018.\n\nA three-member WTO panel determined that the U.S. Commerce Department failed to clarify what specific information South Korean companies needed to provide and improperly dismissed some of the information submitted. Consequently, the tariffs imposed on Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems and others were deemed inconsistent with WTO regulations.\n\nHowever, the panel did not support South Korea's assertion that U.S. authorities had an \"unwritten measure\" that encouraged the use of adverse facts to justify the elevated tariffs.\n\nThe United States has the option to appeal the decision within 60 days. However, it currently faces challenges due to restrictions imposed by former President Donald Trump, which have left it with fewer representatives than necessary for a quorum.\n\nThe European Union also participated in the case, highlighting the impact of U.S. practices on steelworkers in the UK, the Netherlands, and Italy.\n\nAdditionally, a 2018 ruling involving the United States and Canada found similar problems with the application of the AFA provision."}

{"title": "Tropical moisture ceases to cause severe floods in South East Australia", "content": "On Tuesday, heavy rainfall that had significantly exceeded average levels in New South Wales (NSW), south of Queensland and north-east of South Australia, came to an end. Over the preceding five days, these torrential downpours led to widespread flooding and posed hazards to farms and homes, with some areas receiving up to a month’s worth of rainfall in just 48 hours—most notably, 150mm reported by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe BoM indicated that the weather was beginning to improve, with rains shifting eastward; however, rising water levels and numerous active flood alerts remained a concern in affected areas. Meteorologists noted that while eastern regions might recover from floodwaters relatively quickly, areas west of the Great Dividing Range could face prolonged effects, potentially lasting weeks or even months before levels return to normal. Additionally, thick fog is expected this weekend as temperatures drop below the dew point, leading to mist formation, as per meteorologist warnings.\n\nIn NSW, ABC News reported multiple rescues of cows from rivers and rough surf, alongside a distressing incident where a homeowner's dwelling was swept away on their wedding day. A farmer on the Mid-North Coast lost both his house and livestock due to the severe weather. In residential areas, the Hawkesbury region continued to experience rising flood levels as of Monday. Ian Wright, a researcher at Western Sydney University, highlighted the dangers of flooding in Hawkesbury due to the challenging terrain and the substantial water flow from nearby rivers, referencing a related study.\n\nOn Monday, NSW Police rescued an 80-year-old woman trapped in a car on River Road in Wyong, Central Coast, moments before the vehicle was swept into the river. Local authorities urged residents to avoid flooded areas, and the BoM issued a Road Weather Alert for Sydney and its suburbs on Monday. Government agencies, including Simon Oliver, a disaster recovery officer from the Department of Primary Industries, announced plans to assist flood victims with emergency provisions, including fodder and support for displaced livestock.\n\nThe BoM anticipates improved weather conditions on Wednesday as a warmer, drier air mass moves in, accompanied by a coastal low. \n\nSince March 16, the Australian BoM has issued various severe weather, marine wind, hazardous surf, and flood warnings for the affected regions.

In her presentation, Johnson emphasized the importance of these societies as \"repositories of information for the council\" and highlighted the necessity for them to \"remain alive and viable\" to provide essential services when needed. \n\nJohnson's address came during an unscheduled council meeting, which was called following the release of the council's draft budget on April 12. A 28-day period was allowed for submissions on the proposals contained in the draft. Johnson opted to elaborate on her written submission on behalf of the Latrobe Combined History Group during the meeting.\n\nIn her speech, Johnson pointed out rising communication costs, noting that postage expenses have doubled in recent years. While historical societies have attempted to cut costs by transitioning to digital communication, she stated that this still incurs expenses for internet access, software, and web development. Additionally, societies must maintain their equipment, with the Traralgon Historical Society facing annual expenses exceeding A$250.\n\nJohnson highlighted how each society has had to adapt to increasing costs and demands, using the Traralgon Historical Society as an example. The society has reduced its bulletin production and ceased outsourcing this work to local businesses, which Johnson argued detracts from the local economy. She concluded by stressing that historical societies must endure to benefit future generations.\n\nIn her written submission, Johnson requested A$1,000 per society, confirming to Councillor Dale Harriman that this would increase the council's expenditure by A$3,000 compared to the current funding. Harriman acknowledged the significant contributions historical societies make to the council and the broader community, pointing out that the A$500 grant has not changed in seventeen years.\n\nHarriman also inquired about the fees charged by historical societies for their services. Johnson cited an instance where Traralgon and other societies provided maps for identifying asbestos in residential homes, charging A$400 for this service. Harriman remarked that A$400 was \"less than it would cost to actually chase up and find them.\"\n\nThe Latrobe Combined History Group, represented by Johnson, encompasses six historical societies from Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, and surrounding areas."}

This season, Chelsea has accumulated only 29 points in the Premier League, trailing eleven points behind league leaders Manchester United."}

Known in the Wikinews community as Pi zero, Dr. Shutt was the platform's top contributor by edit count and ranked third on English Wikibooks.\n\nHis elder sister, Barbara Shutt, informed Wikinews of his death in an email early Friday. She reported that their mother called emergency services after Dr. Shutt experienced difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, by the time the ambulance arrived, he was unconscious. Barbara noted that the doctors operated on him for two hours, but Dr. Shutt ultimately succumbed either to blood clots or a series of heart attacks.\n\nDr. Shutt was a highly active editor and administrator on Wikinews, contributing under the username Pi zero since September 2008. He became an administrator in July 2010 and a reviewer in August 2009. Over the years, he peer-reviewed and published more than a thousand news articles on the platform, with his last contribution made just a day before his passing. He accumulated over 160,000 edits and more than 120,000 log entries on English Wikinews.\n\nIn addition to his work on Wikinews, Dr. Shutt held reviewer and administrator privileges on English Wikibooks, where he contributed to several titles, including \"Kotlin Programming\" and \"Algebraic Structures.\" He also created a sorting mechanism for the project's content.\n\nBeyond his contributions to Wikimedia projects, Dr. Shutt occasionally blogged on his platform, \"Structural Insight,\" and had a keen interest in constructed languages (conlangs). He was an avid reader, particularly enjoying the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nReflecting on his experiences with Tolkien's literature last year, Dr. Shutt shared, \"I read *The Hobbit* when I was a teenager. I read it again a few months ago...

The bill was amended twice to address concerns from some hesitant Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe new law establishes a Class 6 felony, the least severe designation, for seeking or performing an abortion based on \"a genetic abnormality of the child.\" This is defined as \"the presence or presumed presence of an abnormal gene expression in an unborn child,\" but excludes what is classified as a \"severe fetal abnormality\" deemed \"incompatible with life.\" Additionally, intimidating someone into getting an abortion or soliciting financial assistance for this purpose is classified as a Class 3 felony.\n\nThe legislation also grants the unborn child's father, or a maternal grandparent if the mother is under 18, the right to sue. It applies Arizona law to \"an unborn child at every stage of development,\" which could potentially expose individuals, including the pregnant person, to charges of murder, manslaughter, or child endangerment for actions leading to a miscarriage.\n\nFurther provisions of the bill include a ban on the delivery of abortion-inducing drugs through courier services, a restriction preventing public educational institutions from performing or assisting with non-life-saving abortions, and prohibitions on utilizing public or state funds for university research involving fetal remains or for organizations that provide abortion services. The law also mandates that all fetal remains must be either buried or cremated.\n\nGovernor Ducey, known for his anti-abortion stance, expressed in a statement, \"There's immeasurable value in every single life, regardless of genetic makeup. We will continue to prioritize protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives.\" He emphasized that Arizona is committed to being a leader in pro-life advocacy.\n\nSupporters of the bill, including Senator Nancy Barto, stated, \"We need to protect our most vulnerable, especially those with treatable genetic conditions. They are beloved members of our community, integral to Arizona's identity.\" Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, commented, \"Today, Arizonans win.\"\n\nHowever, critics have condemned the legislation. Representative Palma stated her disappointment, highlighting that Arizona is disregarding the needs of doctors, women, and families for an extreme political agenda. Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding called it \"disturbing and wrong\" that the legislature is not focusing on policies to support women while instead restricting fundamental freedoms related to family planning.\n\nIn response to the bill, the United Campus Workers union urged university leaders, including the presidents of Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, to publicly oppose SB 1457, describing it as \"a blatant attack on reproductive freedom.\""}

In response, the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus, prompting several air carriers, including Austrian Airlines, to avoid Belarusian airspace and airports.\n\nAn Austrian Airlines spokesperson stated that the airline \"has suspended flights over Belarusian airspace until further notice,\" necessitating a change in the flight route from Vienna to Moscow. However, Russian officials did not approve the revised route.\n\nThe spokesperson referred to a recommendation from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which published a Safety Information Bulletin on May 25 urging operators to \"avoid operations in [Flight Information Region] Minsk\" unless absolutely necessary. The bulletin emphasized that third-party operators authorized by EASA should also adhere to this guidance when flying to, from, and within the EU until an international investigation into Protasevich's arrest is completed.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Air France also canceled a flight from Paris to Moscow for the second consecutive day due to similar issues, with at least four flights from Paris to Moscow reported as canceled, according to the BBC. An Austrian Airlines cargo flight bound for Vienna from China was similarly grounded over safety concerns.\n\nThe Guardian noted that British Airways modified its routes, receiving the necessary approvals, and that other carriers have made similar adjustments.\n\nAustria's Foreign Ministry expressed confusion over Russia's stance, emphasizing that all flights heading to and over Russia should proceed without obstruction. In response to media inquiries, Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that the presidential administration does not control air traffic and suggested directing questions to \"our aviation authorities.\"\n\nThe United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization convened an \"exceptional session\" on Thursday regarding the initial grounding incident, as Belarus is accused of violating the 1944 Chicago Convention, to which it is a signatory.\n\nIn a May 25 report by the BBC, several European airlines, including KLM, Lufthansa, and Scandinavian Airlines, announced their suspension of flights over Belarusian airspace. LOT Polish Airlines halted flights to and from Minsk, and Ukraine imposed a ban on all carriers flying over or into Belarus. Singapore Airlines has also begun rerouting its flights.\n\nBelarus's national airline, Belavia, has faced numerous cancellations, including the revocation of its operating permit in the UK and the suspension of eleven routes to EU cities, along with flights to France and the UK until October 30, according to the BBC."}

Huntress Labs has attributed the attack to REvil, a Russia-based ransomware group. Upon discovering the breach, Kaseya advised its customers to immediately halt the use of its services.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the ransomware first infiltrated about 40 of Kaseya's clients, primarily companies that provide internet services and manage infrastructure for thousands of businesses. Security researcher John Hammond from Huntress Labs stated, \"It’s reasonable to think this could potentially impact thousands of small businesses.\" Kaseya alerted its customers of the attack late Friday afternoon and recommended they cease using its platform right away.\n\nReports indicate that REvil operates as a ransomware-as-a-service provider. BleepingComputer received a sample of the ransomware utilized in these attacks and noted that it demands a ransom of $5 million for the decryption of compromised files, although it remains unclear whether all victims received the same demand. Fabian Wosar, Chief Technology Officer at Emsisoft, reported that some affected customers were asked to pay $44,999.\n\nAmong the impacted entities is the Swedish grocery chain Coop, which had to shut down all 800 of its stores because its checkout systems were rendered inoperable due to the ransomware. Coop spokesperson Therese Knapp told Swedish Television, \"We have been troubleshooting and restoring all night but have communicated that we will need to keep the stores closed today.\" Additionally, Swedish company Visma Esscom, which provides server management for businesses, was also using Kaseya software, according to Reuters.

{"title": "130 countries at OECD summit agree to back global corporate tax rate", "content": "**130 Countries Reach Agreement on Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate at OECD Summit**\n\nOn Thursday, a significant majority of the 139 countries and jurisdictions participating in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) summit on taxation backed an overhaul of the international taxation system. This agreement seeks to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate, effectively committing most of the world's economies to a two-pillar framework.\n\nNotable jurisdictions that agreed to the primary components of the plan include regional entities such as Gibraltar, Hong Kong, and Montserrat, alongside recognized tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. All G20 countries endorsed the agreement; however, several nations, including Barbados, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Kenya, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, opted out. Peru abstained from the vote due to its current lack of government, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nThe signatories represent over 90% of global GDP. According to an OECD press release, this framework is the culmination of nearly a decade of coordinated negotiations and critiques the \"century-old international tax system\" as \"no longer fit for purpose.\" The plan has garnered support from U.S. President Joe Biden and follows a similar international taxation agreement reached on June 5.\n\nFormally called the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting,\" the plan adopts a two-pillar approach, with an implementation plan expected to be finalized by October.\n\nUnder the first pillar, multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover exceeding €20 billion and profitability above 10% will be required to redistribute tax on over $100 billion in profit from their home jurisdictions to any market where they earn at least €250,000, depending on the market's GDP. The OECD has noted that the threshold for the first pillar may adjust to encompass MNEs exceeding €10 billion in turnover, subject to a review in seven years.\n\nThe second pillar includes two \"Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules\" enforcing a minimum top-up tax of 15%, along with a treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule\" set to take effect in 2023.\n\nThe OECD estimates that the implementation of both pillars could increase global corporate income tax (CIT) reserves by approximately 1.9% to 3.2%, or between $50 billion and $80 billion. When factoring in the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the increase could range from 2.3% to 4%, equating to $56 billion to $102 billion. This move is also projected to combat tax avoidance, which the OECD claims costs countries between $100 billion and $240 billion in lost revenue annually.\n\nHowever, the OECD has indicated a \"relatively small\" negative impact on investment and economic activity, estimated at just 0.1% of GDP in the medium to long term. Concerns have also been raised about potential constraints on governments' abilities to use tax incentives for policy purposes and the challenge of ensuring compliance.\n\nCountries like Hungary and Ireland have publicly opposed the agreement, as they have historically maintained lower tax rates to attract foreign investment. Both countries, along with Estonia, currently implement corporate rates below the proposed minimum of 15%. In Ireland, the corporate tax rate stands at 12.5%, while Hungary's is as low as 9%, which could result in significant revenue losses if the new agreement is adopted.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann emphasized in the press release that this \"historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere,\" while noting that it does not eliminate tax competition but establishes multilaterally agreed limitations.\n\nPresident Biden indicated that this deal marks a step toward a \"full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom,\" which U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described as a futile competition. Meanwhile, the French Finance Minister hailed it as \"the most important international tax agreement in a century.\"\n\nIrish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe voiced reservations about the agreement but affirmed Ireland's commitment to the process, assuring the global community of Ireland's participation in achieving a comprehensive and historic agreement. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán labeled the proposal as \"absurd,\" declaring that the nation's low rates serve to attract various companies to contribute taxes rather than establishing it as a tax haven.\n\nLooking ahead, Italy is set to host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors for a \"G20 High-Level Tax Symposium\" on July 9."}

{"title": "South Gippsland, Australia local council candidate Sue Plowright speaks with Wikinews about environment, education, and other local issues", "content": "**Title:** Local Council Candidate Sue Plowright Discusses Environmental and Educational Issues in South Gippsland, Australia\n\nSince June 2019, the residents of South Gippsland, located at the southernmost tip of Australia, have been without an elected local council. Following a state government inquiry that uncovered \"high levels of tension\" within the council, administrators were appointed by the Victorian government in July 2019 to manage the shire. A local council election is now scheduled to occur by mail from October 5-22, 2021.\n\nIn light of these developments, Wikinews spoke with Sue Plowright, an independent candidate contesting for the Coastal-Promontory Ward, which encompasses towns such as Toora and Foster. The Coastal-Promontory Ward is responsible for electing three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n**What are your objectives as a councillor?**\n\nAs a councillor, I aim to achieve four primary goals during the new council's term. First, I want to leverage my skills in ethical governance to establish a trustworthy and effective council that upholds democratic values and accountability. South Gippslanders deserve representation marked by integrity, resulting in improved governance practices that can attract diverse funding for community projects, such as initiatives promoting sustainable tourism and regenerative farming practices.\n\nSecondly, I am committed to transforming the conversation around climate change into a source of excitement rather than division. Under the Local Government Act 2020, councils are legally obligated to address climate change, but I believe we must go further. For example, organisations like the Landcare have demonstrated success over the past two decades through local initiatives. I propose that the council supports a declaration of a climate emergency and develops a community-led action plan, backed by necessary resources in subsequent budgets.\n\nMy third focus is on promoting youth engagement by advocating for the creation of a full-time youth officer or coordinator within the council. This role would facilitate connections among young people and local services, generating more opportunities for our youth.\n\nLastly, I am collaborating with a group known as Mayday Projects to address the affordable housing crisis affecting many regional areas, including South Gippsland. I provide further details on these initiatives in response to other questions.\n\n**Do you think the two years of administrative governance since the council's 2019 dissolution have been excessive? Why or why not?**\n\nFrom my perspective as a newcomer to the council in 2016, it became evident by 2019 that significant changes were needed. Frequent council resignations meant that elected representatives no longer reflected the community's choices from the 2016 election, leading to a cycle of dysfunction. While I believe democratic elections should always be prioritized, the two-year hiatus has offered South Gippslanders an opportunity to rethink and rejuvenate our democratic processes. I support this cause by running for office and encouraging others to do the same.\n\n**What strategies are necessary for local businesses to recover from the impact of COVID-19?**\n\nNavigating the challenges posed by COVID-19 can be likened to a batsman facing a bowler. Some businesses have adapted and thrived, while others have struggled. As someone who embarked on my own educational consultancy in mid-2019, I can empathize with the struggle; the onset of COVID-19 effectively halted my prospects. Business recovery will require a multifaceted approach, tailored to the unique needs of individual businesses. Strategies could include mentoring programs, the revival of local traders' associations, and lobbying for targeted training opportunities.\n\n**What changes do you advocate for regarding environmental protection?**\n\nEnvironmental protection involves a balance between encouragement and regulation. I favor proactive strategies that support long-term initiatives in our natural landscape, while also acknowledging the need for enforceable regulations. One critical reform is to extend funding timelines for environmental projects, which often currently receive short-term support. A comprehensive government review of project funding that takes into account the long-term nature of environmental work is necessary, and an active council can facilitate this.\n\n**What makes you qualified for the role of local councillor?**\n\nMy qualifications for councillor stem from three pillars: experience, expertise, and energy. With over 35 years in various leadership and educational roles—including service as a social planner in a Shire Council—I have the breadth of experience that informs my understanding of community needs. My PhD in democracy, governance, and education provides a strong foundation for navigating the complexities of local governance. I am passionate about community service, evident in my leadership roles and initiatives supporting youth and women's safety.\n\n**Are there specific projects you wish to promote in your community?**\n\nI want to prioritize two key initiatives. First, the establishment of a dedicated youth officer or coordinator role is crucial. Many young people are disproportionately affected by COVID-related lockdowns, and we need to quickly provide opportunities for social interaction and fun. \n\nSecond, addressing the affordable housing crisis in South Gippsland is urgent. I support the council's proposals to the State Government’s Big Build initiative and am actively collaborating with Mayday Projects to implement targeted actions that address the needs of local families facing housing challenges.\n\n**How have you engaged with local voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**\n\nI began my campaign right before the current lockdown, utilizing both in-person meet-ups and social media to connect with voters. Given the restrictions, I transitioned to virtual engagement via Zoom meet-and-greet sessions, as well as informal online gatherings to capture diverse community input. I've also made my contact information widely available to encourage direct communication.\n\n**Have you previously run for political office?**\n\nYes, I have previously run for political office twice. In 2008, I contested the Sandridge Ward, and in 2010, I stood for a restructured seat in the same local council. Initially affiliated with a political party, I became an independent in 2012, driven by a conviction that democracy should center on community voices rather than party loyalties. I remain committed to working collaboratively with the community, other councillors, and government agencies to represent the interests of South Gippsland effectively."}

{"title": "Australia: Mat Morgan, Greens candidate in South Gippsland, talks climate, tourism, and local issues with Wikinews", "content": "**Australia: Mat Morgan, Greens Candidate for South Gippsland, Discusses Climate, Tourism, and Local Issues with Wikinews**\n\nSince June 2019, the community at the southernmost tip of Australia, South Gippsland, has been without a local council following a state government inquiry that identified \"high levels of tension\" within the council. Since July 2019, administrators appointed by the Victorian government have overseen the shire. However, a democratic council election is set to take place via postal ballot from October 5 to 22, 2021.\n\nWikinews spoke with Mat Morgan, a candidate for the Coastal-Promontory Ward, who is endorsed by the Greens. The ward encompasses towns such as Foster, Leongatha, and Mirboo North, and is responsible for electing three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n**What are your goals if elected as a councillor?**\n\nAs a councillor, my primary goals will be: \n1) Declare a climate emergency and implement a community-led climate action plan to combat climate change, reduce emissions, and invest in renewable energy sources.\n2) Provide quality services that prioritize the health and wellbeing of our community while supporting small businesses, local arts, and tourism.\n3) Safeguard our natural environment.\n4) Combat gendered violence and all forms of discrimination, promoting respect and equality for everyone.\n\n**Do you believe the two-year period of governance by administrators has been excessive, and why?**\n\nThe two-year absence of a democratically elected council has certainly presented challenges, particularly following the issues with the previous council. I believe South Gippsland is ready for a renewed governance structure with fresh perspectives.\n\n**With many tourists attracted to the Coastal-Promontory area, what measures should be taken for business recovery post-COVID-19?**\n\nTourism businesses have been hit hard during the pandemic. To facilitate recovery, we must enhance our offerings when we reopen, including more camping sites and diverse activities to encourage visitors to explore our beautiful region. Revitalizing local music scenes, promoting our remarkable food and wine, and protecting our environment from ecological decline are essential steps.\n\n**What environmental reforms do you envision?**\n\nI advocate for a climate emergency declaration, accompanied by an actionable plan tailored to South Gippsland's needs. A successful model has been established in Bass Coast, and local climate action groups like the Prom Area Climate Action team are eager for genuine leadership to implement change. I am committed to providing that leadership.\n\n**What qualifications make you a suitable candidate for local council?**\n\nLocal councils should reflect the diversity of their communities. I bring a fresh perspective, as I believe younger generations have been underrepresented at this level of governance. With my background in politics and philosophy, along with my commitment to the community, I aim to represent the interests of my ward rather than catering to entrenched vested interests.\n\n**Are there specific community projects you wish to promote?**\n\nThere are numerous commendable initiatives underway, such as the community composter and the 24/7 library in Foster. I would advocate for increased accessibility, including more footpaths and bike trails, sealing roads like Mt Best Road, and creating wildlife corridors to reduce animal presence near highways.\n\n**How have you engaged with local voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**\n\nI've been fortunate to work as a barista in Foster, allowing me to remain connected with the community throughout the lockdown. I regularly hear what residents hope for from their future council representatives. For those who prefer online engagement, I update my Facebook page daily at @MatMorganGreens.\n\n**Why did you choose to run as a Greens candidate for local council?**\n\nI support the Greens' policies and am grateful for their endorsement, which helps fund and promote my campaign. Transparency is vital to me, so I openly share my affiliation, unlike some candidates who may not disclose their party backing. I aim to bring transparency to our council's operations."}

Voting will take place by mail from October 5 to 22. A total of 24 candidates have come forward to contest the elections across the council's three wards. Since August 2019, the shire has been under the governance of administrators appointed by the Victorian state government, following the council's dismissal due to a state inquiry revealing \"high levels of tension\" within the council.\n\nWikinews conducted an email interview with Les Harmer, one of the candidates in the Tarwin Valley ward, which elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council. This ward includes the towns of Tarwin Lower and Venus Bay.\n\n**What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?**  \nI aim to improve communication between the community and the council.\n\n**Do you think the two-year period of administrative governance since the council's dismissal in 2019 has been too long? Why or why not?**  \nNo, it was necessary for things to settle down after the turmoil. I believe the Administrators have laid a stable foundation for new councillors to lead the council into the future.\n\n**South Gippsland hasn't had a passenger railway service since the closure of the line to Leongatha in 1993. Do you believe these services should be reinstated? Why or why not?**  \nOnly if they are economically viable. We must be prudent with public resources; the days of accepting unprofitable ventures are behind us.\n\n**What changes or reforms would you like to see regarding environmental protection?**  \nThe challenge lies in balancing aspirations with what can be achieved as a councillor. My personal goal is to advocate for more emphasis on renewable energy in long-term planning.\n\n**What qualifies you to be a local councillor?**  \nI possess a deep empathy for the local community and have management qualifications.\n\n**Are there any specific projects in your local community that you would like to highlight or advocate for?**  \nI believe we should work towards becoming an official tourist-friendly town, which would significantly benefit local businesses.\n\n**How did you engage with local voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**  \nI maintained contact through emails, newspaper articles, and coffee meetings when permitted, ensuring ongoing connection with local groups I'm involved with.\n\n**Have you previously run for political office before your current candidacy?**  \nYes, I ran for local council several years ago but was unsuccessful."}

A total of 24 candidates have emerged across the council’s three wards. Since August 2019, the shire has been overseen by administrators appointed by the Victorian state government, following an inquiry that revealed \"high levels of tension\" within the previous council.\n\nWikinews conducted an email interview with Rosemary Cousin, a candidate for the Tarwin Valley ward endorsed by the Greens. The ward, which includes the towns of Tarwin Lower and Venus Bay, will elect three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n**What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?**\n\n\"I am passionate about South Gippsland and committed to enhancing our community, economy, and environment. I envision a council that actively listens and engages with residents while responsibly managing resources. My key commitments include:\n\n1. Restoring public confidence in local government through transparency, engagement, and ethical practices.\n2. Involving the community in shaping council policies, particularly regarding climate change and public health.\n3. Improving the management of council operations for fairer rates and greater accountability.\n4. Providing strong leadership to boost the well-being of our community and economy.\"\n\n**Do you think the two-year period under administration has been too long, and why/why not?**\n\n\"The administration has effectively stifled public engagement in council decision-making. Elected councillors play a critical role in representing community concerns, which cannot be adequately fulfilled by Melbourne-based administrators. Important long-term plans, such as for tourism and economic development, should have involved broader community input, yet many voices went unheard. Urgent updates are needed for key council plans like the Health and Wellbeing Plan to align with current community needs.\"\n\n**Regarding the absence of passenger rail services since 1993, should they be reinstated?**\n\n\"With the railway corridor converted to a trail, it’s challenging to revive V/Line services. However, I support enhancing public transport connectivity within the shire and to regional centers, particularly to the Latrobe Valley where many locals work. Feedback indicates that while services to Melbourne are satisfactory, improvements in timetabling and additional stops are essential, along with possible feeder bus services.\"\n\n**What environmental reforms would you advocate for?**\n\n\"The Local Government Act mandates councils to address climate change, and while South Gippsland has taken steps, there is much more to do. We must accelerate community-led initiatives to tackle climate impacts and biodiversity loss. Collaborative disaster preparedness efforts involving farmers and local organizations are crucial to building resilience against natural events.\n\nFurthermore, South Gippsland's beautiful landscapes require ongoing protection and regeneration. I aim to enhance collaboration with landcare groups and improve how the council fulfills its environmental responsibilities.\"\n\n**What qualifications do you bring to the council?**\n\n\"I possess a diverse skill set relevant to local governance, including qualifications in urban and regional planning and experience across various states. My strategic knowledge of Victoria’s planning system enables sound decision-making on council matters. With a degree in public administration and considerable governmental experience, I uphold ethical standards and understand the complexities of local governance.\n\nHaving grown up on a dairy farm, I maintain strong connections within the agricultural community. My recent focus on natural resource management and biodiversity positions me well to address the economic and environmental needs of South Gippsland.\"\n\n**Can you highlight any community projects you're passionate about?**\n\n\"I’ve dedicated the past four years to supporting the Mirboo North community in preserving native forests. We expect to release a citizen-science report showcasing the biodiversity of the Mirboo North State Forest, which also supports community well-being and local businesses.\n\nI envision promoting continuous rail trails that provide unique tourism experiences, linking visitors with local produce, towns, and natural attractions.\"\n\n**How have you engaged with voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**\n\n\"I coordinated community efforts to assist those affected by bushfires and maintained connections with local farmers and customers. Throughout the lockdown, I utilized social media and virtual engagements but am now returning to face-to-face discussions to re-establish community bonds.\"\n\n**Why did you choose to run as a Greens candidate?**\n\n\"My initial concerns about environmental practices prompted me to run as an independent in the 2016 election. Disappointment with the political inaction on environmental issues led me to join the Greens, whose values and proactive approach align with my goals. My commitment to transparency in local politics will foster trust and accountability.\"\n\nCousin’s insights reflect a dedication to revitalizing community engagement in local governance and addressing pressing environmental concerns, setting the stage for a robust council election in South Gippsland."}

A Council official noted that the safety measures in place, which included social distancing and the mandatory wearing of face masks, meant that none of the other leaders were considered \"close contacts.\"\n\nIn December, several world leaders, including the prime ministers of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal, as well as the Council President, entered voluntary self-isolation after both Slovak Prime Minister and French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nInitially, Bettel reported mild symptoms, including a fever and headache, after both a self-test and a laboratory test confirmed his infection, as reported by Delano.lu.

The coalition will need to secure a parliamentary vote of confidence this week. If successful, Netanyahu's lengthy tenure—totaling twelve years out of fifteen as Israel's longest-serving prime minister—will come to an end, with Naftali Bennett, head of a right-wing party and a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, set to take over.\n\nAs per the rotation agreement among the eight parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister during the first two years of a four-year term, with Lapid stepping in as foreign minister. The two leaders plan to swap roles on August 27, 2023.\n\nThe coalition comprises parties with diverse interests, including Ra'am, the first Arab party in Israeli history to join a government coalition, led by Mansour Abbas. Significant concessions were made to secure support from Ra'am, including legal recognition for villages in southern Israel and a plan to invest $30 billion to reduce violence in Arab communities.\n\nThe coalition's majority of 62 seats in the 120-member Knesset also includes several other parties: Yesh Atid (17 seats, Lapid's party), Blue and White (8 seats, led by Benny Gantz), Labor (7 seats, led by Merav Michaeli), New Hope (6 seats, led by Gideon Sa'ar), and Meretz (6 seats, led by Nitzan Horowitz). Collectively, these parties are unified by their desire to unseat Netanyahu.\n\nIn announcing the coalition, Lapid stated, \"This government will work for all citizens of Israel, those who voted for it and those who didn’t. It will do everything to unite Israeli society.\" Michaeli remarked, \"[t]oday, we succeeded. We made history.\" Gantz expressed optimism in a tweet, describing it as \"a night of great hope.\" On the decision of Ra'am to join the coalition, Abbas acknowledged the challenges, calling it a \"hard\" decision but emphasizing the importance of reaching agreements.\n\nFormer Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked cautioned that forming a coalition from eight medium and small parties is unprecedented and will not be easy. \"We should cross our fingers and hope that this government will not only oust Netanyahu but will also be able to perform sustainably,\" she stated. Meanwhile, the leader of the far-right Religious Zionist Party tweeted sarcastically about Bennett forming a government with \"supporters of terrorism.\"\n\nNetanyahu has not yet publicly commented on the coalition, but a member of his Likud party tweeted, \"The Left celebrates, but this is a very sad day for the State of Israel.\" During a recent address, Netanyahu denounced the proposed coalition as \"a left-wing government dangerous to the state of Israel\" and labeled it the \"fraud of the century,\" accusing Bennett of self-interest.\n\nFollowing the March elections, both Netanyahu and the opposition sought to form a working coalition, as neither side achieved a clear majority. Yamina, with seven Knesset seats, notably declined to collaborate with the United Arab List, which has four seats, emerging as the coalition's \"kingmaker.\""}

The Stretton electorate includes suburbs in southern Brisbane such as Sunnybank, Calamvale, and Eight Mile Plains. In the 2020 election, Pegg secured 56.59% of first preference votes, surpassing his nearest rival, Peter Zhuang of the Liberal National Party, who garnered 30.21%.\n\nSince its establishment in 2001, Stretton has predominantly been held by the Labor Party, with only one exception in 2012 when the Liberal National Party claimed victory. Pegg entered the parliament in 2015, defeating the then-incumbent Freya Ostapovitch.\n\nFive candidates, including Andrea Wildin from the Greens, are contesting the by-election. The Greens' website highlights Wildin as a former nurse who has actively volunteered as a disability advocate during the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying as a wheelchair user herself. Wildin previously ran in the 2020 state election, finishing third with 8.71% of the vote among four candidates. In an email interview, Wikinews spoke with Wildin about pressing issues such as the pandemic, healthcare, and local concerns.\n\n**What changes do you hope to bring as a representative?**\n\nMy goal as Stretton's representative is to amplify the voices of everyday people in my community, ensuring that politics serves their interests and provides them with the resources needed for a fulfilling life. I aim to reform politics by banning corporate donations and eliminating developer influence, fostering a system rooted in grassroots democracy.\n\n**How has the pandemic affected your campaign?**\n\nThe election was called during a lockdown with little notice, creating challenges such as new city council regulations requiring campaign signs to be registered on private property. Meanwhile, major parties were already campaigning, with the LNP even mailing letters to households urging them to register for postal voting before official details were announced. This created an uneven playing field for smaller parties due to a lack of transparency, favoring those in power. However, we are committed to ensuring a safe voting environment throughout the pandemic.\n\n**What local issues would you like addressed in Stretton?**\n\nStretton is Queensland's most multicultural electorate, and it is crucial to provide services that reflect our community's diversity. We need fully funded healthcare and inclusive education. Additionally, there is a pressing need for a reliable, free public transport system and reduced electricity costs through renewable energy. Key issues include domestic violence, housing affordability, and a shortage of rental properties, but the pandemic and vaccine rollout are at the forefront of everyone's minds. I believe establishing local, multilingual health hubs can help reduce vaccine hesitancy and support small businesses during these challenging times.\n\n**What are your thoughts on the recent voluntary assisted dying legislation?**\n\nHaving worked in healthcare for 20 years, I understand the need for individuals to control their end-of-life decisions. While I empathize with concerns from various community members, including those with religious objections, I believe legislation should prioritize human rights and personal autonomy, separate from religious influence.\n\n**What is your opinion on the Premier's decision to travel to Tokyo for the Olympics?**\n\nCommunity sentiment appears largely negative regarding the Premier's Tokyo trip, especially given that many residents have been separated from overseas family members for extended periods. The disparity in travel rules for the elite versus the working class has fueled frustration. While the 2032 Olympics may bring economic opportunities, past promises of financial benefits have often fallen short, causing disruption to local residents.\n\n**What do you think about the state's requirement for businesses to register customer visits using the Check In Queensland app?**\n\nAs a public health professional, I recognize the importance of tracking visits for contact tracing. However, I understand my community's concerns about privacy. It is essential to strengthen regulations regarding data usage to ensure that personal information is not vulnerable to misuse.\n\n**What did you learn from your previous campaign as a Greens candidate?**\n\nI learned the significance of integrity and staying true to my values. Being a politician means representing the community and advocating for their betterment, a mission not all engage with genuinely.\n\n**Why did you decide to join the Greens?**\n\nI chose to join the Greens because their values align with mine—social justice, grassroots democracy, peace, non-violence, and ecological sustainability. In contrast to other parties that often prioritize corporate interests, the Greens focus on what benefits people and the environment, making my choice clear and straightforward."}

This marks the second consecutive month of record-high waiting lists.\n\nOver the past three months, the number of individuals on the NHS waiting list has surged by more than 600,000. However, the average wait time, currently just under eleven weeks, has been gradually declining since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially resulted in a decrease in hospital admissions, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nTotal admissions for surgical and routine treatments climbed fourfold from last year, reaching nearly pre-pandemic levels—up from 54,550 to 242,064 in May, according to Sky News. In May 2019, there were 295,881 admissions for routine care.\n\nThe increase in demand is largely attributed to a rise in non-COVID-related admissions, with over two million people visiting Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments last month, marking the busiest June on record. A blog post published Wednesday warned that the growing demand for urgent, non-COVID-related healthcare among both children and adults is \"putting severe and unprecedented strain on the urgent care system,\" leading to unsustainable levels of individuals visiting A&E, consulting their general practitioners, and calling ambulances.\n\nWait times are showing a downward trend, as reported by Sky News. Between April and May, the number of people waiting over 52 weeks for treatment decreased by 50,000, although this figure remains thirteen times higher than the previous year. Additionally, those waiting more than eighteen weeks fell by 83,000 during the same period, marking the first decline of the year, according to NHS medical director statements. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients receiving treatment within eighteen weeks stood at 67%, significantly below the NHS target of 92%, as noted by The Guardian.\n\nThe average wait time for elective procedures is now 10.8 weeks, a 29% decrease from May of last year, according to Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation. In a blog post on the organisation's website, he acknowledged that the \"treatment backlog of 5.3 million patients\" indicates that while waiting lists are still increasing, the rise in individuals seeking care is encouraging, as this aligns with the NHS's mission.\n\nTaylor emphasized that \"our urgent care system is operating at winter-like capacity in the middle of summer,\" cautioning that the upcoming phase may further disrupt the care the NHS provides to patients, including community services.\n\nFurther issues persist, with nearly 25% of A&E patients waiting over four hours to be seen. Just 75% of cancer patients were treated within two weeks of screening, falling short of the 90% target, and urgent referrals from GPs dipped below the 85% benchmark. An analysis reported in October revealed that 50,000 fewer people were diagnosed with cancer in the preceding year, warning that this backlog could lead to an additional 4,000 missed diagnoses monthly, totaling over 100,000 by October. Furthermore, urgent referral activity in England for August was 11% below 2019 levels.\n\nIn response to the growing waiting list and service restoration, the NHS has allocated a budget of one billion pounds, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nAdditionally, the UK reported 32,551 new COVID-19 cases and 35 related deaths on Thursday, as noted by Sky News. This marks an increase of over 4,000 cases compared to the previous week, the highest total since the week of January 27. Health Minister statements indicated that COVID cases \"could rise as high as 100,000\" ahead of the anticipated lifting of remaining lockdown restrictions on July 19, referred to as \"Freedom Day,\" according to reports from Sky News and The Guardian."}

This legislation will become effective in 2024.\n\nThe new law stipulates that \"a retail department store that offers childcare items or toys for sale shall maintain a gender-neutral section or area, labeled at the retailer's discretion, where a reasonable selection of items and toys shall be displayed without regard to traditional gender marketing.\" While the creation of separate sections for boys and girls is permitted, a common area must also be established. It's important to note that an initial proposal to include clothing was removed during the legislative process.\n\nRetailers that fail to comply with the law may face a civil penalty of $250 for a first violation, escalating to $500 for subsequent offenses. Courts may also impose costs and attorney's fees on violators.\n\nThe bill was championed by Assembly members Cristina Garcia and Evan Low, both Democrats, who introduced it into the lower house of the California Legislature. Following amendments in both houses, AB-1084 passed the Assembly with a 49-16 vote on September 2 before heading to the governor's desk.\n\nIn support of the bill, Low stated, \"Part of it is to ensure that if you’re a young girl, you can find a police car, fire truck, a periodic table, or a dinosaur. Likewise, if you’re a boy who enjoys artistic pursuits and wants to play with glitter, that should be accepted too. Why should there be stigma in expressing interests that may not align with gender stereotypes?\"\n\nOn July 25, Garcia expressed on Facebook that her experiences as a math teacher highlighted how playtime fosters essential skills, such as spatial awareness, pivotal for understanding geometry. She argued that the removal of gender labels on toys could encourage more boys and girls to explore diverse fields.\n\nOpposition to the bill came from Republican lawmakers, including state Senator who contended, \"I don't think parents need the government to step in and dictate how they shop for their children.\" The Capitol Resource Institute argued that it is inappropriate for the government to dictate how retail stores display and market their merchandise.\n\nDuring an April 6 public hearing before the Assembly's Business and Professions Committee, Greg Burt of the California Family Council criticized AB-1084 as \"impossible to comply with,\" citing the lack of clear definitions for terms like \"reasonable amount.\" He cautioned that the bill could lead to a multitude of complaints from activist groups dissatisfied with how stores market products for boys and girls.\n\nThis is not the first effort to address this issue; Assembly Bill 2826, also introduced by Low in 2020 with similar objectives, ultimately failed to pass the Legislature.\n\nNotably, retail giant has already moved away from traditional toy section labeling, having eliminated such distinctions in 2015.

Reports from CTV News indicated that officials exchanged greetings over the phone and discussed fishing activities in their disputed western maritime border.\n\nThis thaw in relations comes amid heightened tensions, as North Korea conducted several missile tests last week. One of these launches was confirmed by defense ministries to be an early-stage weapon, occurring shortly before a North Korean representative delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly, where they heavily criticized the United States."}
{"title": "Australia: Wikinews interviews Rebecca Jennings, independent candidate for Daly by-election", "content": "**Title: Australia: Wikinews Interviews Rebecca Jennings, Independent Candidate for Daly By-Election**\n\nIn the Northern Territory of Australia (NT), voters are set to elect a new Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the Daly electorate tomorrow. The previous MLA, from the Country Liberal Party (CLP), resigned in August. The Daly region encompasses both suburban areas on the outskirts of Darwin and more remote communities such as Timber Creek and Wadeye.\n\nWikinews conducted an email interview with Rebecca Jennings, an independent candidate in the Daly by-election. Jennings previously ran for election as a candidate for the Territory Alliance party in Fannie Bay, where she garnered 242 votes (5.6% of the total).\n\n**What motivates your desire to represent Daly?**\n\n\"I am a lifelong Territorian, raised in Darwin's rural areas, where I attended local schools. My long-standing involvement in the community through sports, youth advocacy, and local issues has given me a deep understanding of the Daly region, from Timber Creek to various remote areas. There's a pressing need for a robust, independent regional voice—someone unafraid to challenge the status quo and who genuinely understands the Daly community. I believe I can effectively represent our interests.\"\n\n**How would you balance the diverse interests of urban and remote communities in Daly?**\n\n\"Daly includes a combination of urban suburbs and rural communities, each with unique needs. Many areas have felt neglected in the past, and constituents have expressed frustration with previous representatives' accessibility. To best serve all communities, it is crucial to be present and accessible—whether through in-person engagement, social media, print communication, or regular forums—to make informed decisions and ensure no area is overlooked.\"\n\n**Have you run for election before?**\n\n\"I previously ran with Territory Alliance in the 2020 election for Fannie Bay after living in Darwin. This experience was an excellent opportunity to explore political engagement, supported by a fantastic team.\"\n\n**Regarding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in the New South Wales town of Wilcannia, how do you view the vaccine rollout for Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory?**\n\n\"The vaccine rollout has faced challenges, partly due to community remoteness and vaccine hesitancy. I respect individuals' autonomy in healthcare decisions, but higher vaccine uptake is crucial for protecting at-risk communities. The situation in Wilcannia highlights chronic overcrowding and healthcare disparities faced by Aboriginal communities, making them more vulnerable to outbreaks.\"\n\n**What community experience do you bring to the role of MP?**\n\n\"I have worked across various sectors, including government agencies, not-for-profits, and hospitality. My involvement in numerous community committees—such as youth and women's advisory boards—has provided me with insight into local issues and government processes. I believe that lived experience and local knowledge are vital for effectively representing the community.\"\n\n**How is your campaign as an independent candidate being conducted?**\n\n\"My campaign messaging focuses on being concise, local, and achievable, leveraging social media, local radio, and podcasts to disseminate my message. While social media has been invaluable, in-person interactions at markets and shops are warmly received and facilitate deeper discussions. Given more time before the election, I would have liked to host online Q&As to engage remote voters.\"\n\n**In what ways could health service delivery be improved in the Northern Territory?**\n\n\"Connectivity is a central theme in my campaign. We must enhance access to remote health services through improved public transport, better road infrastructure, and telehealth options for non-urgent appointments. This proactive approach would help shift the healthcare sector from reactive to regular, preventive care.\"\n\n**What are your views on the criminal justice system?**\n\n\"The criminal justice system is complex, and while I do not have all the answers, I am concerned about the lack of alternative sentencing options. Many crimes could be addressed through community service rather than incarceration, which can be detrimental to individuals and their families.\"\n\n**How are you funding your campaign?**\n\n\"I am self-funding my campaign and have been strategic with my expenditures. I've received strong support from family, friends, and volunteers. However, unlike larger parties, the absence of sponsors and donations has made fundraising more challenging.\"\n\n**What key law reform would you advocate for as an MP?**\n\n\"As an independent, passing private member bills can be challenging, but I have several reforms I am passionate about—reinstating euthanasia laws, legalizing cannabis, decriminalizing certain drugs, strengthening environmental protections, and addressing alcohol pricing issues. However, one immediate reform I would prioritize is the strengthening of the Water Act to protect our waterways and water resources, implementing stricter penalties for illegal extraction and a tighter control on licensing. The sustainability of our precious natural resources is essential for future generations.\""}

This spring, he shared insights about his campaign and policies in an interview with Wikinews.\n\nAt 29, Kostendt identifies as a member of the Republican Party, describing his campaign as \"casual.\" According to his website, he has a diverse background, having served as a cadet in the Army ROTC, a scout platoon leader with the 2nd Squadron of the Ohio Army National Guard, and a logistics officer for the 1st Battalion. His military service included deployments in Kuwait, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nKostendt is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, where he studied Finance. He distinguishes his middle name by using an apostrophe—\"Arthur O'Kostendt\"—to acknowledge his Irish roots, diverging from the more typical abbreviation with a period.\n\nA May 5 poll conducted by Cleveland Scene, which did not include Kostendt, showed Dennis Kucinich and Basheer Jones leading the mayoral race with the others trailing significantly. The incumbent mayor, who previously secured 59% of the vote in the last election, is eligible for a fifth term but announced his retirement on May 6.\n\n**Introducing Arthur Kostendt**\n\nKostendt reflected on his upbringing in an outer ring suburb of Cleveland as one of four children and noted his involvement as a student-athlete in tennis and a saxophonist in school. After earning his degree from Notre Dame in 2013, he received his officer's commission and began a career in banking at B&F Capital Markets in Cleveland. His military service spanned from 2013 to 2016, during which he also embarked on a legal education at Cleveland State University's law school, later transitioning into the legal field after his graduation in 2019.\n\n**Motivation for Running**\n\n\"I love my home, the city of Cleveland, and I envision a future where it shines as the best place to live in the United States,\" Kostendt expressed. He believes that the city currently struggles with poor governance, which has led to numerous issues such as crime and inadequate city services. His campaign aims to address these shortcomings directly.\n\n**Key Campaign Messages**\n\nKostendt emphasizes that he is a leader, not a politician, dedicated to genuine change. \"I am focused on accountability within city departments to ensure effective service for our residents,\" he stated.\n\nRegarding his military background, Kostendt spoke of his commitment to service, which he aims to carry into his role as mayor. He envisions reforms for the Division of Police and improved oversight in public schools and city maintenance initiatives.\n\n**Addressing Challenges in Cleveland**\n\nHe highlighted the urgent need to tackle urban blight and hold city departments accountable for their operations to improve living conditions. Kostendt criticized the existing administration for inefficiencies and vowed to streamline city functions.\n\nOn the critical issue of poverty, Kostendt believes that investing in neighborhoods and enhancing public safety and education will attract families and businesses, thereby reviving Cleveland's economy. \n\nKostendt's campaign prioritizes public health. \"Fighting disease starts with promoting healthy lifestyles among residents,\" he proposed, advocating for initiatives that support nutritious eating and physical fitness.\n\nLastly, he expressed a commitment to support all residents, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately affected by inadequate city services.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAs Kostendt campaigns for mayor, he acknowledges his learning curve in navigating city government but expresses optimism for the future under his potential leadership. \"I envision a Cleveland where city services run efficiently and our neighborhoods thrive,\" he concluded.\n\nFor more information about Kostendt and his campaign, visit his official website."}
{"title": "Taylor Swift's Evermore records biggest sales week of the year as it returns to No 1 on album chart", "content": "Taylor Swift's album \"Evermore\" has reclaimed the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart this week, fueled by a remarkable 8,307% surge in sales. Initially released in December, the vinyl edition of \"Evermore\" became available on May 28, with preorders accessible from the album’s release date.\n\nIn the week ending June 3, \"Evermore\" sold 192,000 copies, setting a record for the largest sales week of the year. Billboard attributed its rise back to number one to several factors, including a record-breaking 102,000 vinyl LP sales, signed CDs by Swift, and significant digital album discounts. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums in the United States weekly, factoring in both album sales and streaming.\n\nNotably, \"Evermore\" made an impressive leap from 74 to 1, marking the largest jump to the top position since Radiohead's ascent from 156 to 1. Since then, only three albums have re-entered the chart at number one, the most recent being Bon Jovi's album on the March 10, 2018 chart, prompted by bundled concert tickets. \"Evermore\" also set a new record for the most significant sales week for a vinyl album, with over 40,000 copies sold from May 28 to May 31, surpassing the previous record holder. By the end of the week, total vinyl sales had reached 102,000.\n\nThe delay in the vinyl release of \"Evermore\" was due to the extensive production time required for vinyl records. As the album was announced just a day prior to its release, it likely didn't allow enough time to produce physical editions, including vinyls. In addition to its success in the United States, \"Evermore\" also saw a boost in international markets. On the UK's Official Albums Chart Top 100, it climbed 70 spots to reach number 4. In Australia, it rose nine positions to number 38 on the ARIA Top 50 Albums chart, while in New Zealand, \"Evermore\" re-entered the Official Top 40 Albums chart at number 30, becoming one of the fastest rising titles."}

During exercise, individuals must stay within a five-kilometer radius of their homes and may only be outside for a maximum of two hours.

This marks the fifth COVID-19 lockdown for Victoria since the pandemic began, and the regulations mirror those of the state's fourth lockdown in June.\n\nABC News has linked a majority of the recent cases to a \"group of removalists\" from New South Wales who traveled through Victoria while reportedly infected. New South Wales is currently experiencing an outbreak driven by the Delta variant of the virus, and the lockdown measures in Sydney have been extended by at least two weeks as of yesterday.\n\nIn a press release, Premier Andrews stated, \"If we act now – while we're right on the heels of this outbreak – we can give ourselves every chance of getting ahead of it.

{"title": "California governor signs new state budget, eligible Californians to get stimulus payments", "content": "On Monday night, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a new budget bill totaling $262.6 billion, which includes $8.1 billion earmarked for $600 direct stimulus payments to Californians as part of the state’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The budget legislation, SB 129, along with the stimulus package, SB 139, both received approval from the California Legislature.\n\nDubbed the Golden State Stimulus II, these payments will begin distribution to eligible California taxpayers in September. To qualify, residents must have filed a state tax return for the previous year, not be claimed as dependents, and have earned no more than $75,000 in wages in 2021.\n\nEligible individuals will receive a one-time payment of $600, while households with dependents will receive an additional $500. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of Californians will benefit from this stimulus initiative, which was originally proposed by Newsom in May as part of his \"California Comeback Plan.\"\n\nNotably, Californians who received a stimulus payment earlier this year will not qualify for this additional payment. However, those who claimed dependents on their tax returns may still be entitled to the $500 add-on.\n\nThe budget also allocates $5.2 billion for rent assistance targeted at low-income residents and landlords to cover unpaid rent accrued during the pandemic, as well as several months of future rent. An additional $2 billion will address overdue water and utility payments.\n\nMoreover, $1.5 billion is set aside for grants aimed at supporting small businesses, along with $120 million in tax credits for businesses that relocate to California.\n\nThe state recorded a budget surplus of nearly $76 billion during the pandemic.\n\nIn signing SB 129, Newsom noted specific appropriations totaling $2.58 billion outlined in Section 19.55 of the bill were enacted \"on a technical basis,\" as they had been covered by the budget. In California, the governor has the authority to approve a bill from the Legislature while vetoing individual budget items, which can be overridden by a two-thirds vote from both the Assembly and Senate."}

These included limitations on the size of gatherings, restrictions on certain businesses like gyms, travel limitations, and orders requiring residents to leave their homes only for essential purposes.\n\nIn New South Wales, these restrictions were enforced as Public Health Orders, signed by Minister for Health and Medical Research, Brad Hazzard, who has the authority to issue these orders under the Public Health Act of 2010, section 7.\n\nThe interview was conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak in New South Wales, which prompted an increase in restrictions beginning June 26. At the time of the interview, residents were only permitted outdoors for essential shopping, medical care, or exercise, limited to groups of no more than two unless from the same household. On July 28, authorities announced an extension of these restrictions through the end of August.\n\nThe recent outbreak of the Delta variant was traced back to a \"patient zero,\" identified as a driver who transported international flight crews, as reported on June 16. On June 24, the driver suggested that they may have contracted the virus from a local café where another patron appeared unwell.\n\nThe New South Wales government emphasized its mission to allow citizens to live safely and freely, stating that only essential workers could leave home in designated high-risk areas in southwestern Sydney until July 30. The construction industry faced a temporary halt but resumed operations this week with a mandate for regular COVID-19 testing of workers.\n\n### Interview Excerpts\n\n**Wikinews:** Can you explain your involvement in Australian society today?\n\n**Professor Foster:** I’ve been a professor at the School of Economics at UNSW since 2009 and currently serve as the Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School. I actively engage with the community and media on economic policy issues and co-founded the Consortium for Inclusive Economics Education within the UNSW Business School.\n\n**Wikinews:** In your opinion, what does \"living with the virus\" mean, and is eliminating it feasible?\n\n**Professor Foster:** \"Living with the virus\" has become unavoidable due to its ability to transmit between species, including animals. While Australia had previously aimed for elimination, we must now focus on effective treatment options and building immunity through vaccination and natural exposure.\n\n**Wikinews:** What would change if you had control over pandemic policy?\n\n**Professor Foster:** I would ensure access to vaccines for vulnerable populations, promote the message that we can manage the virus effectively, initiate trials for treatments like ivermectin, and open borders without imposing further lockdowns.\n\n**Wikinews:** Regarding shelter-in-place orders, what did you find interesting about the data on excess deaths?\n\n**Professor Foster:** The data indicates that in island countries like Australia, excess deaths primarily dropped due to fewer traffic accidents and elective surgeries rather than because of the virus itself.\n\n**Wikinews:** How effective were restrictions on gatherings and venue closures?\n\n**Professor Foster:** These measures reveal a governance approach focused on control rather than evidence-based responses. Since the pandemic began, I have advocated for targeted protections rather than broad restrictions.\n\n**Wikinews:** How do you view contact tracing measures?\n\n**Professor Foster:** While contact tracing has its merits, the substantial cost and limited benefits suggest that it may not be the best approach for the general population, particularly when aimed at younger, healthier individuals.\n\n**Wikinews:** Do you have suggestions for challenging current restrictions?\n\n**Professor Foster:** Individuals can resist these policies by advocating for their rights publicly, sharing information, and creating community awareness of the detrimental effects of ongoing lockdowns on mental health and social interaction.\n\nIn summary, Professor Gigi Foster offered critical insights into the government’s COVID-19 strategies, arguing for a more nuanced approach that considers the economic and social ramifications of current restrictions. She emphasizes the need for informed decision-making and public discourse as Australia navigates its response to the pandemic. \n\nHer forthcoming book, *The Great Covid Panic*, is expected to be released in the coming months and aims to address these issues further."}

This followed a state government inquiry that uncovered \"high levels of tension\" within the previous council. Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, and they have been governing the shire since. However, the council is set to be restored with elections scheduled to take place by mail from October 5-22, 2021.\n\nWikinews spoke with one of the candidates in this upcoming election, Anda Banikos, an independent candidate running in the Coastal-Promontory Ward. This ward includes towns such as Fish Creek, Foster, and Meeniyan and is responsible for electing three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\n\n**What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?**\n\nAs a South Gippsland Shire councillor, my priorities will include:\n- Restoring trust in the council by respectfully connecting with individuals and organizations already doing great work in our Shire and advocating for a democratic voice in Shire decisions.\n- Acknowledging the climate emergency and planning for a sustainable future in South Gippsland that accommodates all. We need innovative and practical strategies to decarbonize our region while supporting local biodiversity and businesses reliant on our natural environment.\n- Promoting fair housing solutions, including affordable, sustainably designed public housing precincts near essential amenities and the sustainable renovation of existing homes.\n- Supporting regenerative farming by providing biodiversity and carbon credits or other rate offset options to encourage environmentally friendly practices.\n\n**Do you believe the two years of administration since the council's dismissal in 2019 have been too long, and why?**\n\nYes, two years is excessive. Although appointing administrators after the council's dismissal was necessary, I believe they should have organized new elections within a year. Instead, the prolonged period has allowed decisions to be made without transparent community engagement. I look forward to a new council that collaborates effectively with the community on future initiatives.\n\n**With the impact of COVID-19 on tourism in areas like Wilson's Promontory, what measures do you propose for business recovery?**\n\nTo aid small business recovery, our Shire could:\n- Promote our region as a tourism destination and establish public transport connections between Melbourne and Wilson's Promontory National Park.\n- Assist business groups with grant writing to secure funding from state and federal sources.\n- Streamline planning approvals and enhance services to accommodate the growing residential population.\n\n**What environmental protection changes and reforms would you like to institute?**\n\nI believe we must prioritize both short- and long-term environmental and biodiversity impacts in all planning decisions. My recommendations include:\n- Securing long-term funding by collaborating with neighboring shires to attract federal and state resources.\n- Establishing biolinks between wildlife habitats, such as completing the Lyrebird Link to connect Coastal Park with the Strzelecki Ranges.\n- Protecting the genetic diversity of Strzelecki koalas, which inhabit areas from the Strzelecki Ranges to the coast.\n- Instituting a moratorium on logging native forests within our Shire and aiding workers in transitioning to alternative jobs in tourism, infrastructure, or fire management.\n- Restoring coastal ecosystems like seagrass beds and mangroves that serve as nurseries for fish and critical carbon sinks.\n- Offering rate discounts or rebates for landholders participating in conservation programs.\n\n**What qualifies you to be a local councillor?**\n\nI have lived in South Gippsland for 30 years, moving here in the 1990s with my young family. I currently teach at Fish Creek and have experience working in various schools throughout the Coastal-Promontory Ward over the past 25 years. My background in mixed-ability education and experience caring for young people with disabilities further qualify me.\n\nI am actively involved in community initiatives, focusing on the arts and the environment. As a member of Coast Arts, I have organized numerous community arts events, including The Prom Coast Festival and The Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival. My work with Landcare and Friends of the Prom reflects my commitment to collaboration, respect, and creative problem-solving for the benefit of our diverse community.\n\n**Are there specific projects you would like to advocate for in your community?**\n\nI would like to highlight several projects, including:\n- Improving public transport to connect Wilson's Promontory with V-Line services.\n- Completing the Lyrebird Link to secure habitats for lyrebirds and Strzelecki koalas.\n- Implementing a sewerage system for Fish Creek.\n- Cleaning up the Fish Creek water catchment through the \"Putting the Fish back into Fish Creek\" project.\n- Installing signage to promote wildlife awareness on roads.\n\n**How have you engaged with local voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**\n\nConnecting with voters during lockdown has been challenging. I have utilized several strategies, including:\n- Maintaining an active presence on Facebook (AndaBanikosIndependent) and my website (andabanikosindependent.org).\n- Writing articles for local newspapers.\n- Conducting emails, phone calls, and Zoom meetings with community representatives.\n- Participating in online candidate forums.\n\n**Have you previously run for political office?**\n\nI have not run for political office before, but I am a strong advocate for the democratic process, having served as an electoral officer for the AEC and VEC. I have no political affiliations or vested business interests in our Shire. My decision to run for council stems from my passion for our community and environment and my desire to address the challenges posed by climate change while leveraging opportunities from new technologies to build resilience in South Gippsland."}

{"title": "Wikinews interviews candidate for New York City mayor Vitaly Filipchenko", "content": "**Wikinews Interviews Vitaly Filipchenko, Independent Candidate for New York City Mayor**\n\nIn early May, Wikinews invited Vitaly Filipchenko, running as an independent candidate for New York City mayor in the upcoming election on November 2nd, to discuss his campaign and policies. Filipchenko answered questions during a phone interview.\n\nVitaly A. Filipchenko, registered as an independent, is notable for being the first Russian candidate to run for mayor of New York City. Born in Tomsk, Siberia, in 1973, he is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. Filipchenko describes himself as a small business owner on his campaign website, where he shares his background in road construction and maintenance, as well as his experience running a moving services company. Acknowledging his language skills, he states on his site, “[m]y English may not be perfect - but my platform is.”\n\nThe current Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, who won re-election with 66.5% of the vote, is unable to seek a third term due to term limits. As of late April, there are 22 candidates in the race, most of whom are also Democrats. Ahead of the Democratic primary in June, a recent poll revealed that former city commissioner and borough presidents are leading the pack, with 21.1% and 20.1% of the vote, respectively.\n\n**Interview Excerpts:**\n\n**Please introduce yourself and share your background.**\n\n“My name is Vitaly Filipchenko, and I am an independent candidate for New York City mayor.”\n\n**What was your experience growing up in Russia?**\n\n“It was interesting. It was like learning about the stock market as a child, without the right guidance. People had many questions but didn’t always have answers.”\n\n**Why did you choose to run for mayor?**\n\n“I have yet to see an honest mayor. Politicians often prioritize big money over real issues, and I want to change that. I represent ordinary people, especially immigrants who feel marginalized by the system.”\n\n**Do you think being a Russian candidate will resonate with immigrant communities?**\n\n“Not necessarily, as many are fearful and disenchanted. They may not trust politicians regardless of background, feeling that their concerns are overlooked.”\n\n**Why should New Yorkers vote for you?**\n\n“I come from humble beginnings and have built my own business through hard work. I’m not backed by big corporations or rich interests. I want to bring true representation to small business owners, immigrants, and those struggling, especially in the wake of the pandemic.”\n\n**You've criticized the handling of city budgets and infrastructure. Can you elaborate?**\n\n\"As a civil engineer, I've seen how mismanagement leads to poor road quality despite high budgets. In contrast, states like Florida manage to maintain better roads with much smaller budgets. The corruption stems from manipulating contracts and budgets instead of delivering effective public services.\"\n\n**What changes would you implement to support small businesses?**\n\n\"I proposed a plan during COVID-19 that would allow the city to partner with local restaurants to provide meals for those in need while keeping the businesses financially viable. It’s about smart management and supporting our small businesses, not just offering grants that don’t address core issues.\"\n\n**How would you address homelessness and support racial minorities?**\n\n“I believe we need to generate jobs and educational opportunities tailored to the needs of our communities. Focusing on grassroots initiatives, such as urban agriculture programs, can help empower communities while addressing food insecurity.”\n\n**How do you plan to handle public safety?**\n\n\"I advocate for retraining police officers rather than defunding them. Increasing qualifications and ensuring they can effectively manage conflicts without resorting to excessive force is crucial.\"\n\n**If you couldn’t vote for yourself, who would you choose?**\n\n“I would look for a candidate who understands the immigrant experience, someone who has lived the struggles of everyday New Yorkers.”\n\nIn conclusion, Filipchenko expressed his hope to connect with voters who feel overlooked in the current political landscape. He invites those interested in his campaign to reach out for volunteering and support through his website, *vitalyformayor.com*.\n\nThis interview highlights Filipchenko’s commitment to address the unique challenges faced by New Yorkers, particularly small business owners and immigrant communities, during a critical election year."}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews Victor Kline, leader of newly registered The New Liberals party in Australia", "content": "**Wikinews Interviews Victor Kline, Leader of Australia’s Newly Registered New Liberals Party**\n\nOn June 3, the New Liberals were officially registered as a political party in Australia, allowing them to field candidates in federal elections across the country.\n\nThough the New Liberals have been around for over a year, with member Karen Porter participating as an independent candidate in the last federal election, the party formally applied for registration on December 16.\n\nThe New Liberals encountered legal challenges during their registration process. They share the term \"liberal\" with Australia's ruling Liberal Party, which characterized the New Liberals as a \"cynical attempt to piggyback\" on its name. The Liberal Party presented a Crosby Textor survey of over 2,000 voters, claiming that more than two-thirds perceived a connection between the two parties as a strategy to halt the New Liberals' registration. Ultimately, the electoral commission determined that the New Liberals’ name was \"sufficiently visually and aurally distinct\" from that of the Liberal Party, allowing them to proceed.\n\nWikinews spoke with Victor Kline, the New Liberals' party leader, via email about the party's vision, policies, and values.\n\n**Wikinews**: One of your party’s key slogans states that you are economically responsible and socially progressive. Can you elaborate on what this entails?\n\n**Victor Kline**: To us, \"economically responsible\" means leveraging economic principles to serve society. Our focus is on lifting the three million people living below the poverty line out of that situation, creating jobs and stimulating both small and larger businesses in the process. \"Socially progressive\" complements this goal, as we strive for a just society that offers everyone equality of opportunity and a sense of purpose. Our commitment to social progressiveness is grounded in our economic responsibility.\n\n**Wikinews**: Why did you choose the name New Liberals while there is already a Liberal Party?\n\n**Victor Kline**: The current Liberal Party of Australia has strayed from traditional liberal values, transforming into an ultra-conservative entity. We are currently pursuing legal action against them for misrepresentation and fraud due to their continued use of the term “liberal.” If we are successful, they could be deregistered as a political party. We represent a true liberal party in the historical sense—focused on equality of opportunity, justice, compassion, and individual freedom balanced by a responsible government role.\n\n**Wikinews**: Recently, the case of a refugee family in immigration detention has sparked discussions. They had been detained since 2018 after their protection request was denied, following five years in the Queensland town of Biloela. The family has since reunited in Perth, where their four-year-old daughter Tharnicaa is receiving treatment for a serious blood infection. What are your views on this case and immigration laws in general?\n\n**Victor Kline**: The treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in Australia over the past 30 years is a national disgrace that future generations will look upon with the same horror as slavery. We plan to drastically reform the system, beginning with the abolition of mandatory detention for asylum seekers.\n\n**Wikinews**: What motivated you to join the New Liberals?\n\n**Victor Kline**: I was one of the founding members of the New Liberals. We felt that the major parties had drifted so far right that they no longer represented the majority of the populace. Our civil liberties were under siege, and we feared our democracy might be heading towards authoritarianism.\n\n**Wikinews**: Your website mentions that you have selected 17 candidates for the upcoming federal election. How did you choose them?\n\n**Victor Kline**: Actually, we have many more candidates who will soon be listed on our website. Our selection process focused on finding intelligent individuals with a strong moral compass and real-world experience, contrasting with 80% of the current political class who have primarily worked within politics or unions.\n\n**Wikinews**: How do you assess the federal government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n**Victor Kline**: If it had been left to the federal government, we would have seen an open borders, open business policy similar to the USA, resulting in a massive loss of life. It was the state governments that implemented measures that ultimately saved lives.\n\n**Wikinews**: Is there a political issue you think is being overlooked? What would the New Liberals do about it?\n\n**Victor Kline**: There is significant corruption at the federal level, and the media does not cover it adequately. We aim to establish an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) that has the authority to investigate, charge, and prosecute corrupt politicians, judges, and bureaucrats, along with a dedicated court for such cases.\n\n**Wikinews**: What sets the New Liberals apart from other political parties?\n\n**Victor Kline**: We differ in nearly every regard, but our economic policy stands out. We propose a plan to invest in the nation by ensuring that anyone who wants a job can find one—at a fair wage that suits their skills and interests. If no job is available, we will provide training for appropriate work while compensating them fully during their training period.\n\n**Wikinews**: Your charter includes a commitment to \"promote Australia's environmental health by acknowledging that care for the environment and good business practices are complementary.\" Can you elaborate?\n\n**Victor Kline**: For instance, the government can invest in renewable energy, which not only supports environmental sustainability but is also good business practice.\n\n**Wikinews**: How would you characterize your leadership style?\n\n**Victor Kline**: My primary focus is to always communicate the truth, regardless of the consequences. I believe this fosters confidence in a leader. I strive to have the courage to call out injustices and hold those responsible accountable while also being willing to admit when I’m wrong."}

President Moon expressed that if North Korea is willing to cooperate, \"we will proactively pursue assistance with COVID-19 vaccine supplies\" for the country.\n\nAustrian President Van der Bellen echoed Moon's sentiments, emphasizing the importance of global collaboration to combat the pandemic. He stated, \"Should we receive any signal from North Korea seeking help, we would, of course, offer our assistance.\"\n\nThe current status of COVID-19 in North Korea remains unclear, as the regime continues to assert that it has no confirmed cases—a claim that many international observers find dubious. Reports indicate that North Korean military officials are reportedly \"scrambling\" to secure vaccine doses to immunize their troops, with sources suggesting that up to 25% of military personnel are in quarantine.\n\nFurthermore, the use of Chinese medical supplies has reportedly been prohibited in Pyongyang hospitals following the death of an official who received a Chinese-made injection. This exclusion may extend to Chinese-produced vaccines, according to the same articles.\n\nThis visit marked a historic moment, as President Moon is the first South Korean leader to visit Austria since the two nations established diplomatic relations in 1892.

The attack, which occurred at a checkpoint outside the General Dhegobadan Military Camp, was claimed by Al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda affiliate operating in the region.\n\nArmy officer Mohamed Adan informed Al Jazeera that the bomber disguised himself among army recruits, estimating the death toll at \"about 15\" but indicating it could be higher. A witness for Reuters also confirmed the figure of fifteen, while the army chief, who survived a 2020 assassination attempt by Al-Shabaab, initially stated that at least ten people had died, with twenty others wounded.\n\nReports indicate that dozens of people were present at the site where the injured have been transported.\n\nThis incident marks one of the deadliest attacks in Mogadishu since a truck bombing in December 2019, which killed 85 people and was also attributed to Al-Shabaab. That attack provoked retaliatory airstrikes by the Somali government, according to CNN.\n\nAl-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the latest attack through their radio station, Al Andalus. The group, which aims to overthrow the Somali government, frequently targets soldiers, military facilities, hotels, and security checkpoints, as reported by Agence France-Presse. Despite a series of military defeats and losses—estimated at 600 militants this month alone—the group remains active and dangerous. Recently, six villages used for recruiting youth and manufacturing explosives were captured by Somali forces.\n\nIn response to the ongoing violence, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 2551 in November, condemning Al-Shabaab's attacks and implementing a ban on the sale and transfer of components for improved explosive devices to Somalia. Additionally, in February, the UNSC placed sanctions on three senior Al-Shabaab members, including Maalim Ayman, the leader of an Al-Shabaab unit operating in Kenya and Somalia."}

The incident occurred near the end of the sixth inning, prompting the game to be suspended until the following day.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the shooting took place outside the ballpark's third base gate on South Capitol Street. One woman was shot, while two individuals sought medical attention on their own. Fortunately, all three victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The Washington Post's Sam Fortier reported on Twitter that stadium employees indicated the shooting appeared to be a drive-by incident.\n\nD.C. police confirmed that the gunfire originated from one vehicle directed at another. Initial reports suggested four individuals were injured, but this was later corrected to three.\n\nIn a joint statement, the D.C. Mayor and the Nationals' ownership noted, \"While MPD's investigation is ongoing, it appears the incident stemmed from a dispute between individuals in two vehicles. MPD does not believe the Washington Nationals, the ballpark, or the fans were the intended targets.\"\n\nThe sound of gunshots was reportedly heard within the stadium, causing confusion among fans, many of whom rushed to leave. Players quickly exited the field, and some spectators fled through the park's gates. Padres players, including Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado, opened the gate to the field to help direct fans to safety, as reported by The Washington Post's Andrew Golden.\n\nInitially, spectators were instructed to stay inside the stadium but were later advised to exit through the outfield. The park was fully cleared by 10:05 PM (0205 UTC).\n\nIn a statement, the Washington Nationals expressed their appreciation for the calm and supportive behavior displayed by fans during the incident: \"You handled yourselves admirably. You remained calm and helped one another. We have always known we have the best fans in baseball, and last night proved it. Our fans are our family. Thank you.\"\n\nAt the time of the suspension, the Padres were leading 8-4. The suspended game resumed Sunday at 1:08 PM EST (1708 UTC), with the Padres ultimately defeating the Nationals 10-4 after adding two runs from the previous night.

{"title": "Australia: Sunbury railway line slated for five days of 24-hour upgrades", "content": "**Victoria Government Announces Major Upgrades to Melbourne's Sunbury Line**\n\nLast Thursday, the Victorian state government announced a significant series of upgrades to the Sunbury line in Melbourne, set to take place over five days with round-the-clock work. From 10 PM on September 3 until the last service on September 8, buses will replace trains on this line. \n\nThe upgrades will affect several key railway stations, specifically focusing on platform enhancements at selected sites, while \"signalling, communications, and power infrastructure\" will be installed along the entirety of the Sunbury line. Additionally, overhead line structures will be improved at the future entrance to the Sunbury Station, and power upgrades are scheduled for an electricity substation in the area.\n\nImportantly, the level crossing at Gap Road in Sunbury will be removed. A press release from the Premier of Victoria's office highlighted that \"Gap Road/Station Street will be lowered under the existing rail line to preserve the heritage-listed Sunbury Station, improve safety, and alleviate congestion, particularly with an expected increase in train services on the Sunbury Line.\" The project will also include the construction of new shared paths for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nDuring the upgrades, rail services on the Sunbury line, including the Craigieburn, Upfield, Bendigo, and Geelong lines, will temporarily operate as coach services from September 4 to 5. These enhancements are part of the ongoing Sunbury Line Upgrade, which began in 2019 and is slated for completion in 2023. The government describes the upgrade as providing \"major improvements in capacity, reliability, and frequency of services on the Sunbury line.\"\n\nAccording to the same press release, the Sunbury Line Upgrade aims to \"create space for 113,000 additional passengers during peak periods each week once the Metro Tunnel is operational.\" The Metro Tunnel project will establish a direct link between the Sunbury line and the existing railway lines.\n\nIn light of these forthcoming improvements, Victorian Minister for Transport, Jacinta Allan, stated, \"We’re committed to delivering these crucial upgrades to the Sunbury line, enabling larger, more modern trains to operate, which will enhance the public transport experience for passengers. These upgrades will benefit commuters, road users, and residents, supporting the demands of our growing western communities.\"\n\nAdditionally, a spokesperson for the Public Transport Users Association remarked to Wikinews that \"it's encouraging to see these upgrades moving forward. Once the Metro Tunnel opens, they will facilitate the introduction of new services on the Sunbury line, significantly alleviating crowding. The removal of level crossings will further enhance safety and improve service reliability.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the positive impact of the infrastructure upgrades, Bowen emphasized the need for further improvements in train services, especially advocating for more frequent services throughout the day to reduce waiting times. \"Passengers currently experience waits of 20 to 40 minutes for trains outside peak times – this is inadequate for Melbourne's rapidly growing north-western suburbs,\" he said.\n\nJack Medcraft, the Deputy Mayor of Sunbury and a local councillor, expressed optimism about the upgrades via email to Wikinews, stating that \"these improvements to the Sunbury line are long overdue, and I believe the ongoing work will greatly enhance future services. Sunbury residents will appreciate the new underpass and the improved rail services.\"\n\nHowever, Medcraft raised concerns about other transport infrastructure issues, particularly the planned duplication of Macedon Street and Sunbury Road. He noted that the two-lane roadways would culminate in a one-lane bridge in Bulla, potentially leading to significant traffic bottlenecks and complicating an already congested area. He also criticized the lack of a smart bus route connecting Sunbury to the airport, noting that around 30% of local residents work in the airport vicinity but do not have reliable public transport options available.\n\nOverall, the Sunbury Line Upgrade represents a crucial investment in Melbourne's public transport infrastructure, aimed at improving service capacity and reliability for the region's growing communities."}

In a joint press release, officials described this initiative as a \"construction blitz on the line\" with the aim of providing nine daily return services between Melbourne and Shepparton. Currently, as of January 31, the railway operates five return services to Shepparton on weekdays.\n\nFrom September 4 to September 12, coaches will replace trains to and from Shepparton while stage two works continue on the line. As part of the third stage upgrades, the crossing loop at Shepparton will be extended by 1.1 kilometers, allowing two six-car trains to pass each other.\n\nIn addition to the above timeline, stage three will encompass the construction of a new train stabling facility in Shepparton, along with signaling and track enhancements on the Shepparton railway line. The contracts for the stabling facility and loop extension, along with stage two upgrades, have been awarded to Coleman Rail and KBR. The completion of stage three is anticipated by the end of 2023.\n\nMinister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, and Local Government, spoke about the upgrades, stating, \"The Australian Government has provided the funding for stage three to deliver the services Shepparton passengers have been waiting for, and now we’re ensuring this work gets underway. Our historic $110 billion infrastructure investment focuses on delivering projects that will benefit both the community and the economy.\"\n\nLocal MPs also commented on the project, including National Party federal MP for Shepparton, who noted, \"These upgrades will provide Shepparton with the fast and frequent rail service it deserves as a major regional center.\"\n\nThe Victorian state member for Shepparton emphasized that \"delivering four extra services to and from Shepparton each day will offer residents in communities along the line more travel options and a train service they can depend on.\"\n\nNorthern Victoria MLC expressed satisfaction with the investment, stating, \"I am very pleased to see the Victorian Government actually invest in rail infrastructure to benefit Northern Victorian communities. More efficient and reliable freight and passenger transport will boost the city’s economy and help alleviate road traffic.\"\n\nQuilty highlighted Shepparton's status as a vital regional center, asserting that the investment should enhance transport links. \"With nine passenger services a day, many Northern Victorian towns will envy the service Shepparton is set to have,\" he stated. However, he also raised concerns about the government’s repeated announcements, remarking, \"One has to wonder how many times they can announce the same project before the next election.

The sanctions also address ongoing \"repressive practices\" by the Belarusian government.\n\nThe coordinated action aims to exert pressure on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's regime, citing \"continued assaults on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law.\" The joint statement condemned the \"politically motivated\" detention of Protasevich and Sapega and expressed support for the \"long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people.\" It called for Belarus to cooperate in investigations into the incident, release all political prisoners, adhere to recommendations from an expert mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and engage in dialogue facilitated by the OSCE between the government and opposition.\n\nThe events surrounding the forced landing of Ryanair flight FR4978, traveling from Lithuania to Greece, remain disputed. Belarusian state media claimed the diversion was prompted by a bomb threat; however, this assertion has been described as \"dubious and still unverified\" by various reports.\n\nThe sanctions vary between the involved nations and regional organizations. Canada has targeted 17 new individuals, bringing the total to 72, as part of ongoing actions due to the government's \"disregard for human rights.\" The EU expanded its sanctions to include 78 individuals and eight entities, resulting in a total of 166 individuals and 15 entities affected. Those impacted—comprising judges, business leaders, university rectors, and government ministers—will face asset freezes and travel bans, and EU citizens and companies are prohibited from providing financial support to these designated entities. According to the Associated Press, the EU's foreign policy chief asserted that these measures would significantly harm the Belarusian economy.\n\nThe United Kingdom also built on its previous sanctions from September, targeting eight Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko and his son, and introducing new restrictions on 11 individuals and two entities, which will also face asset freezes and travel bans. Notably, petroleum exporter BNK (UK) Ltd is among those sanctioned; its 2019 report indicated it provides intermediary services to the oil sector in Belarus. The UK Foreign Secretary stated that \"cutting off oil export revenue streams\" was a strategy to hold the Belarusian regime accountable.\n\nThe United States, through the State Department and the Treasury Department, has implemented visa restrictions on 46 Belarusian individuals in key positions, adding 16 individuals and five entities to its sanctions list. The U.S. cited concerns about \"transnational repression,\" \"violations of international norms,\" and the \"fraudulent\" nature of the Belarusian elections as justification for these sanctions.\n\nThe timing of the sanctions has raised questions, with Belarusian state media commentator Nikolai Shchekin noting their coincidence with the anniversary of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, also known as the \"Great Patriotic War.\" According to CNN, the U.S. intended to publicize its sanctions earlier, prior to a meeting between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but was delayed by the EU's processes."}

He earned his Master's in Estate Management from the United Kingdom and qualifications in Urban Design and Town Planning from Dublin, alongside a second Master's in Literature from KU Leuven, Belgium.\n\nDespite Ireland's overall increase in wealth over the decades, the cost of renting and homeownership has steadily escalated. According to Daft.ie, the average monthly rent in Ireland has surged to €1,443. Dr. Sirr identified several factors driving this trend.\n\n\"One major reason for the rent surge over the last decade is the government's strategy of increasingly relying on the private rental sector for social housing. Traditionally, the state provided housing for those in need by building homes. However, they've shifted to placing families in the rental market, which has heightened demand while constraining supply, thus inflating rental prices,\" he explained.\n\nDr. Sirr noted that another contributing factor was a 2019 government policy allowing annual rent increases of up to 4%. \"Once you put a ceiling in place, it tends to become a target. Landlords often raise rents by the maximum allowable amount, leading to a cumulative effect over the years,\" he added.\n\nWhen considering proposals from the opposition, who have suggested a temporary ban on rent increases, Dr. Sirr expressed mixed feelings. He acknowledged that while a rent freeze would benefit tenants, it could jeopardize the stability of the rental sector. \"If landlords can't achieve a reasonable return, they may exit the market, which could exacerbate the housing crisis.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the constitutional challenges associated with implementing a rent freeze, referencing a 1982 court ruling deeming such measures unconstitutional. Commenting on COVID-19's impact on construction, Dr. Sirr expressed surprise that housing completions remained robust during the pandemic.\n\n\"We had anticipated a significant dip in construction numbers, forecasting around 12,000 completions last year, yet we actually recorded approximately 20,000, similar to 2019 levels,\" he said. \"Linking rental prices to inflation, as introduced today, may have broader implications for tenants and landlords, although it’s a more nuanced approach than a flat cap.\"\n\nDiscussing Ireland's Rebuilding Ireland initiative, Dr. Sirr critiqued its performance, citing failure to meet targets across its five pillars. He emphasized the need for improved planning practices and greater integration with national policies.\n\nFor the upcoming Housing for All strategy, he argued for a focus on quality over quantity, suggesting that the government should harness existing lands and address the issue of vacant properties rather than merely setting ambitious numerical targets.\n\nDr. Sirr proposed promoting affordable housing that prioritizes community needs over profit-driven methods. \"We need to empower local authorities to make housing decisions based on specific regional requirements rather than imposing centralized directives,\" he stated.\n\nHe expressed concern over the increasing presence of international investment firms in the Irish housing market, fearing it may undermine small landlords and further imbalance the market in ways that disadvantage renters. \n\nAdding to the complexity, he noted, \"The financialization of housing creates an environment where the advantages of homeownership perpetuate social inequality, making it crucial to reevaluate our broader approach to housing in terms of economic stability and societal implications.\"\n\nThe conversation underscored the urgency of addressing Ireland's housing crisis through strategic, community-focused policies while recognizing the interconnectedness of various economic and social factors."}

The explosion occurred on East 27th Street in South Los Angeles, injuring 17 individuals and damaging various vehicles and properties.\n\nIn response to the incident, five members of the LAPD’s bomb squad have been reassigned from their duties, according to Chief Moore.\n\nThe incident began when LAPD officers discovered over 32,000 pounds (approximately 14,500 kg) of illegal fireworks at a South Los Angeles residence. Bomb disposal technicians reportedly placed around 16.5 pounds (7.5 kg) of explosives into a \"total containment vessel\" (TCV) for detonation. However, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) later confirmed that technicians actually detonated 42 pounds (19 kg) of explosives. The containment vehicle failed to properly contain the explosion, resulting in injuries to 17 people and damage to 13 nearby businesses, 22 residences, and 37 vehicles.\n\nThe TCV's recommended capacity is 15 pounds (6.8 kg) for repeated use and 25 pounds (11 kg) for a single use, according to Chief Moore. The truck had been in service for a decade, marking its 42nd use during the June 30 incident.\n\nThe ATF has launched an investigation into the actions of the LAPD. They anticipate concluding their findings in the next one to two months.\n\nArturo Ceja III, the 26-year-old homeowner where the fireworks were discovered, was arrested by LAPD on suspicion of unlawful possession of destructive devices and child endangerment. Possession of fireworks is illegal within the City of Los Angeles and surrounding unincorporated areas. Ceja was released after posting bail set at $500,000 and is scheduled to return to state court in October.\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged Ceja III with the illegal transportation of explosives without a license, alleging that he purchased the fireworks from Area 51, a dealer located in Nevada near the California border. He was released on a $25,000 bond pending arraignment, which is scheduled for August 2.\n\nL.A. Councilmember Curren Price expressed outrage over the LAPD's handling of the situation, stating, \"It’s clear there was negligence involved and this instance shows zero regard for the people that reside in our South LA community. Every individual that I have talked to, including myself, wonders if this would have been acceptable protocol in more affluent areas of the City.\"\n\nIn response to the incident, the city has opened a resource center for affected residents located on East 28th Street. Here, residents can file claims against the city and access mental health resources.\n\nOn Tuesday, L.A. City Attorney Hydee Felan reported that her office has received 56 claims related to the explosion. \"We're trying to speed this up as much as we can [...] this is an all-hands-on-deck effort to ensure that anyone who suffered due to that explosion gets relief as quickly as possible, because they deserve it,\" she stated.\n\nDuring a Tuesday meeting, callers urged the police department to provide reparations to affected residents and businesses.

This status allows the councils to access various forms of support from the government, including the COVID-19 disaster payment, help with contact tracing, and personal protective equipment from the National Medical Stockpile.\n\nReg Kidd has been an Orange City Councillor for 28 years and became the city’s first popularly elected mayor in 2017 while running as an independent candidate. He has hosted talkback radio since 1989. In an email exchange with Wikinews, Kidd discussed the COVID-19 lockdown measures, the upcoming local government elections in New South Wales, and his motivations for a career in local government.\n\n**Q: Do you think the New South Wales government has taken the right approach in managing the COVID-19 pandemic?**  \nA: Yes, a lot of people like to play the \"blame game,\" which often creates more issues! There have been only about 60 deaths in NSW since the onset of COVID-19. When you calculate that as a percentage of the population, it’s relatively low. More people have died from road accidents, heart attacks, and drugs.\n\n**Q: How has the lockdown impacted the council's activities and meetings?**  \nA: No, we have been live-streaming community meetings for some time now, and we conduct Zoom meetings, which have been very successful.\n\n**Q: What motivated you to enter local politics?**  \nA: I decided to enter local politics to give back to a community that has supported me immensely. I believe in being proactive and striving to be part of the solution rather than the problem.\n\n**Q: Given the impacts of COVID-19 in New South Wales, do you think any changes should be made to how the upcoming local government elections (scheduled for September 4) are conducted?**  \nA: Yes, they should be postponed until at least March next year. This change can be done without needing full parliamentary debate. Due to the shutdowns, traditional electioneering has become very challenging. We also have more pressing issues to address right now, particularly COVID-19 and vaccination efforts.\n\n**Q: Is there a message you would like to send to local residents amid the COVID-19 lockdown?**  \nA: Yes—let's work together and avoid the blame game. It’s essential to listen to proper expert advice, get tested, and make sure to get vaccinated. Please don’t fall for misinformation or media hype about the AstraZeneca vaccine. My family and I are finished with this struggle, and many expert medical professionals in Orange are frustrated by how some media outlets seem more invested in political narratives rather than real solutions."}

While not all identified excess deaths can be directly attributed to COVID-19, this metric serves to gauge the pandemic's overall impact. \n\nThe study authors indicated that the actual death toll \"is likely to be far greater than the official count\" and could \"number in the millions.\" According to co-author Vikram Subramanian, the perception that India had avoided the worst after the first wave, which exhibited a more gradual increase in cases, fostered a culture of complacency due to underreported deaths. He noted that the second wave, marked by distressing imagery and experiences, prompted society to seek a clearer understanding of the death toll. Subramanian also pointed out that their figures only include data up to May and do not capture the entirety of June or any of July, suggesting that the true death toll may still be underestimated.\n\nOfficial records indicate that India has reported over 414,000 COVID-19 deaths, ranking third-highest globally.

The report highlights that around 50 defectors were recently returned to North Korea after being arrested by Chinese authorities.\n\nAn anonymous witness informed that “the Dandong customs office was opened specifically for today, and about 50 North Korean escapees were sent back to their home country on two buses.” The witness also noted that “dozens of police officers were stationed outside the customs office to prevent public access and ensure that no one was filming the process.”\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-19, North Korea completely closed its borders, which halted the repatriation of defectors. This recent repatriation marked the first since January 2020, when North Korean authorities closed the borders to safeguard the nation from the pandemic. Prior to this, such repatriation actions were commonplace for defectors who had crossed the Tumen and Yalu rivers into China.\n\nThe situation has drawn concern from the U.S., with a spokesperson stating that \"we are particularly troubled by reports of nearly 50 North Koreans being forcibly repatriated.\" The spokesperson urged China to \"fulfill its international obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, as well as the UN Convention Against Torture.\"\n\nRadio Free Asia reported that among the 50 repatriated individuals were former soldiers and pilots who had served in the North Korean military. Sending these individuals back to North Korea, where they may face imprisonment and torture, constitutes a violation of the United Nations' 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol, and the UN Convention Against Torture. Human Rights Watch's article indicated that approximately 1,170 North Koreans are currently held in various prisons across China's Jilin and Liaoning provinces, facing deportation after being charged with criminal offenses.\n\nDespite the serious implications of this situation, China and North Korea maintain a friendly relationship; leaders from both nations exchanged greetings on July 11, as reported by state media. A bilateral border protocol signed in 1986 mandates the deportation of all defectors and other North Koreans illegally residing in China.\n\nAccording to data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, only two North Korean defectors reached South Korea between April and June of this year—the lowest number recorded since the ministry began tracking defector inflows. This decline in defector numbers is largely attributed to North Korea's strict border closures in response to the pandemic, which have effectively halted any movement in and out of the country, all while the regime continues to assert that it has no COVID-19 cases.\n\nNorth Korean defectors typically transit through China on their way to South Korea or other safe countries, as crossing the Sino-Korean border is often easier than traversing the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The nearest defector-friendly country accessible by land is Vietnam."}

During a forum in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He described the financial risks as controllable. The chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) acknowledged the need to manage excessive debt while ensuring that the situation would be handled appropriately.\n\nOnce considered China's top real estate developer, Evergrande has accumulated about $305 billion in liabilities, equivalent to approximately 2% of the country's gross national product. The company's value has plummeted by 80%, attributed in part to dwindling resources. September data indicates that home sales in China by value dropped nearly 17% year-on-year, raising concerns that Evergrande's financial turmoil is contributing to a slowdown in China's GDP growth, which fell to a year-low of 4.9% in the third quarter. Two crucial negotiations for property sales, valued at $2.6 billion and $1.7 billion with rival developers China Vanke and Yuexiu, were reportedly suspended due to the lack of approval from the Guangdong provincial government overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.\n\nNews of Evergrande's wire transfer led to a surge in its shares, which rose by as much as 7.8% this morning after a two-week trading halt related to the anticipated sale of a 50.1% stake in Evergrande Property Services Group, offering some relief to bondholders. James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management, called the update \"a positive surprise\", suggesting, \"If Evergrande pays this time, I don't see why it won't pay the next time.\" Jun Rong Yeap, commenting for Asia, stated that the report \"overturned\" the expectation that Evergrande would struggle to secure cash.\n\nAdditional missed payments are forthcoming on October 29 and November 11, following similar grace periods; when including yesterday's $83.5 million payment, nearly $280 million is owed to bondholders.\n\nStocks for many leading Chinese developers have plummeted: Reuters reported that Sinic Holdings has seen its stock price drop by 87.8% year-to-date and is currently classified as being in \"restricted default\" following a missed bond payment of $246 million due on October 18. Evergrande’s stock has fallen by 80.2%, while E-House, Kaisa Group, and others have also experienced significant declines in stock prices.\n\nEstimates suggest that the real estate market in China comprises between 16% and 25% of the country's GDP. President Xi Jinping's strategy aims to transition the economy from debt-fueled growth to one focused on quality and sustainability. As part of this strategy, regulations were instituted to limit developers' borrowing capacity.

{"title": "Tunisia's president dismisses prime minister, suspends parliament", "content": "On Sunday, Tunisian President Kais Saied dismissed the country's Prime Minister, Hichem Mechichi, and announced the suspension of parliament in response to widespread nationwide protests. These demonstrations were fueled by public dissatisfaction over the economy and the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant criticism aimed at the largest parliamentary party, Ennahdha.\n\nSaied declared that he would assume control until a new prime minister is appointed, and confirmed that parliament would remain suspended for 30 days, during which parliamentary members’ immunity would be lifted. He invoked Article 80 of the 2014 Tunisian constitution, which allows for the assumption of executive power in circumstances deemed as posing \"imminent danger to the institutions of the nation.\"\n\nThe Speaker of Parliament, Rached Ghannouchi, stated that Saied did not consult with him or Mechichi prior to making these decisions, as required by the constitution. Although the constitution provides for a special court to resolve such disputes, it has yet to be established.\n\nIn response to the violent protests that have erupted across Tunisia, Saied convened an emergency meeting and subsequently announced the dismissal of Mechichi and the suspension of parliament. In a televised address, he stated, \"We have taken these decisions [...] until social peace returns to Tunisia and until we save the state,\" adding that any further violence would be met with an armed response from the country's military.\n\nIn the capital, police enforced roadblocks on Avenue Bourguiba, and security forces were stationed around the parliament building to prevent access. Clashes ensued in Tunis, where police used pepper spray against protesters who were throwing rocks in opposition to Mechichi.\n\nGhannouchi, a prominent member of the Ennahdha party, condemned the president's actions as \"a coup against the revolution and the constitution,\" asserting, \"We consider the institutions to still be standing and supporters of Ennahda and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution.\" He indicated that parliament would continue to function despite its suspension.\n\nReports indicate that Ghannouchi arrived at the parliament building early Monday morning but was barred from entry by military personnel. Other parties within parliament also denounced the dismissal as a coup. According to Al Jazeera, tensions between Saied and Mechichi have escalated over the past year amid a severe economic crisis and ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 18,000 lives in Tunisia, a country of 12 million people."}
{"title": "'Each makes the other more difficult to recover from': University of Sussex professor L. Alan Winters speaks to Wikinews on trade, COVID-19, Brexit", "content": "**Title: \"Impact of Brexit and COVID-19 on UK Trade: An Interview with Professor L. Alan Winters from the University of Sussex\"**\n\nEarlier this month, Wikinews interviewed L. Alan Winters, a respected professor of economics at the University of Sussex, to discuss the implications of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU) and the ongoing negotiations surrounding trade. Winters has extensively researched both Brexit and its impacts, and he is also the founding director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO).\n\nWith a career spanning over 15 years that includes key roles at the World Bank and as an advisor to various international economic organizations, Winters has authored several significant reports, including \"COVID-19 Will Reinforce the Brexit Shock\" and \"The Costs of Brexit.\" He was honored with the title \"Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath\" (C.B.) in 2012.\n\nDuring our conversation, Professor Winters reflected on recent developments in UK trade policy and the challenges posed by both Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Wikinews:** You expressed in your December 2020 report that Brexit would significantly impact UK-EU trade. Do you believe the government made a mistake in their negotiations with the EU?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** I have always opposed Brexit and maintain that it was a poorly conceived economic move. While the government argues it has regains some sovereignty, the execution of that sovereignty has remained unclear, and overall, I believe the UK would have benefited more from a closer relationship with Europe that would have minimized trade costs.\n\n**Wikinews:** You noted earlier that the pandemic would exacerbate the economic shock from Brexit. Is that still true a year later?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** We've secured a trade agreement with the EU, but the haste in concluding that agreement has resulted in less favorable terms. The intertwining of government debt, which likely increased due to Brexit impacts, complicates the financial landscape for the UK. Disentangling the effects of Brexit and COVID-19 remains a complex task, but it's clear both crises will hinder recovery.\n\n**Wikinews:** You previously suggested the challenges of recovering lost export markets during Brexit, enhanced by the pandemic's effects. Can you elaborate on that?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** Export markets are difficult to regain once lost, and the interplay between Brexit and COVID-19 creates additional challenges for recovery. If trade conditions deteriorate, as we have witnessed, regaining those markets becomes even less likely.\n\n**Wikinews:** Many advocates propose that the UK can replace its EU trade with new agreements with countries like Australia and Canada. How feasible is that approach?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** I find that perspective unrealistic. The EU comprises roughly half of the UK's trade, and no other market can replicate that. Integration with the EU took years and provided deep trade agreements. While new FTAs can help diversify trade, they will unlikely compensate for the losses incurred from Brexit.\n\n**Wikinews:** Fishing rights posed a significant point of contention during Brexit negotiations. How do you assess the agreement reached?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** The deal provides limited additional quota and still binds the UK to EU regulations. This means that while the UK has gained some control, it must navigate complex rules to maintain access to the vital EU market. The realities of exports in the fishing industry further complicate the situation.\n\n**Wikinews:** Regarding recent trade agreements and statistics that claim they will create significant opportunities, what's your view?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** Claims about \"newfound sovereignty\" and significant increases in trade volumes often overlook the fact that many of these agreements are mere rollovers of past arrangements with the EU. The predicted economic impact from them is minimal.\n\n**Wikinews:** Looking ahead, what implications do you foresee for UK trade negotiations and relationships following Brexit?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** It is crucial for the UK to build a constructive relationship within the global trade framework, particularly through the World Trade Organization (WTO). The focus should be on repairing multilateral trade systems instead of merely pursuing individual trade agreements.\n\n**Wikinews:** In summary, what are your final thoughts on the UK's trade policy and recovery?\n\n**L. Alan Winters:** Trade policy should prioritize stability, realistic agreements, and strategic relationships, particularly with neighboring countries. The end goal should be to create a trade environment that supports long-term growth while also grounding any policies in thorough domestic discussions. It is essential that the government takes a more sustainable and thoughtful approach to trade moving forward.\n\nThis conversation highlights the intricate relationship between Brexit and COVID-19, shaping the future of the UK's trade landscape and economic recovery."}

{"title": "UK pay freeze on public sector employees will end next year", "content": "On Monday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced in a media briefing that he will formally end the partial pay freeze affecting 2.6 million public sector workers, a measure introduced last November. This announcement, expected to be confirmed in his budget at noon on Wednesday, will also include a pay raise of 6.6% for these employees.\n\nSunak previously cited the drop in wages during the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for the pay freeze, which largely affected teachers, police officers, civil servants, and other public sector workers, while excluding 2.9 million NHS staff and those earning under £24,000 per year. While a general pay increase is planned for spring next year, specific details are still pending consultation with independent advisers and pay review bodies. The Guardian reports that approximately 5.7 million public sector employees could see a wage increase.\n\nAdditionally, around two million minimum wage earners, some of whom fall within the aforementioned 5.7 million, may benefit from upcoming increases to the national minimum and living wages. According to reports from iNews and The Guardian, the National Living Wage for those over 23 is set to rise by 59p to £9.50 per hour starting next April, translating to an annual increase of about £1,000 for full-time workers, following recommendations from an independent advisory board. The National Minimum Wage for individuals aged 21 to 22 will rise by 82p to £9.18 per hour, while the Apprenticeship Rate will increase by 51p to £4.81 per hour.\n\nHowever, Tom Waters, a senior research economist, noted that while full-time minimum wage workers would see their earnings increase significantly, those on universal credit could experience only a £250 rise in disposable income due to tax increases and reduced benefit eligibility. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP Bridget Phillipson deemed the proposals \"underwhelming,\" asserting that much of the increase would be offset by tax hikes, cuts to universal credit, and rising energy costs. UK inflation was reported at 2.9% for the year ending in September, according to official figures.\n\nPhillipson contrasted Sunak's approach with that of a potential Labour government, which promises a \"new deal for workers,\" a minimum wage of at least £10 an hour, and measures to combat exploitative practices. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Sunak is contemplating raising the National Living Wage to £10.50 an hour and lowering the qualifying age from 25 to 21 by the next general election in 2024, aligning or surpassing Labour's commitments.\n\nDuring the media briefing, Sunak defended the previous pay freeze, attributing it to the economic impact and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, stating that these measures helped to protect livelihoods during a critical time. With the economy recovering, he asserted that it is appropriate for public sector workers, including nurses and teachers, to receive pay increases.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier expressed a vision for a \"high-pay, high-skill economy\" post-Brexit; however, experts suggest that it may take years for wage growth to keep pace with rising financial pressures.\n\nAnalysis from The Guardian highlights that those affected by the pay freeze earned nearly 8% less than their private sector counterparts, with the disparity widening to 0.6% among all public sector employees, including those exempt from the freeze. The Office for National Statistics reported private sector wages increased by 8.3% from June to August 2021, compared to just 2.5% growth in public sector wages."}

Voting will take place by mail between October 5 and October 22. A total of 24 candidates have stepped forward to contest positions across three wards of the council. The shire has been under the administration of officials appointed by the Victorian state government since August 2019, following the council's dismissal due to a state inquiry that highlighted \"high levels of tension\" within its ranks.\n\nWikinews recently interviewed one of the candidates, Lindsay Love, via email. Love is running for a position in the Tarwin Valley ward, which elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council and encompasses several local towns. In addition to addressing questions from Wikinews, Love shared her thoughts on the council's current state:\n\n\"The Council's satisfaction ratings have been alarmingly low for over a decade, spanning multiple council terms and the period of Administration. The one consistent factor has been the Administration itself. This suggests that to improve the culture, we must initiate change at the administrative level. The council needs to function more like a corporate board and provide clear directives to the CEO to implement meaningful change.\"\n\n**Key Issues and Candidate Insights**\n\nWhen asked about her goals as a councillor, Love emphasized the need for an open, transparent Administration that actively engages with the community: \"I want to foster greater public input in decisions that affect residents’ lives.\"\n\nOn the duration of the administrative governance since the council's 2019 sacking, Love criticized the impact of the Administrators: \"Their management has been detrimental to the Shire. While the pandemic may have compounded issues, we have lost the essence of 'local' in local governance.\"\n\nRegarding the absence of passenger railway services in South Gippsland since 1993, Love expressed skepticism about the return of such services. \"The Administrators had a chance to retain the railway and develop a rail trail but neglected that opportunity. Now that the line is gone, it’s highly unlikely a train service will return, especially with state priorities focusing on more prominent projects.\"\n\nWhen discussing environmental protection, Love noted that while the responsibility largely lies with the state, effective local governance should maintain efficiency in administration and focus on core responsibilities.\n\nLove highlighted her qualifications, citing her extensive involvement with local issues, diverse professional background—including experience as a farmer, business operator, and civil engineer—and a decade spent working in local government.\n\nShe also identified several specific projects she would advocate for if elected, including:\n\n- Promoting the development of a vision for new community facilities.\n- Advocating for a water supply to enhance community resources and support a bike trail from that area to Yanakie.\n- Proposing the creation of a state Significant Mountain Bike Park around the reserves.\n- Supporting accessible facilities for disabled individuals at local landmarks.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Love maintained community engagement by monitoring council actions and issuing press releases that provided alternative perspectives to those from the council.\n\nThough this is Love's first candidacy for council, she served as the secretary for the South Gippsland Action Group Inc., which worked towards reducing rates and improving hardship policies until the Administrators’ appointment stymied their efforts.

I believe I can advocate for the 'Quiet Majority', which includes employees, farmers, small business owners, tradespeople, retirees, and holidaymakers. We have been represented for too long by individuals with narrow agendas, and I will focus on local community issues rather than distractions from Federal and State Government. My priority will be ensuring resources are allocated effectively so that residents feel they are receiving value for money from the Council.\"\n\n**Do you think the two-year period under administration has been too long, and why?**\n\n\"Yes, the two-year period of administration has been excessive, and I believe the Administrators have fallen short in listening to community concerns and needs. Many decisions were made against community wishes, leading to wasted resources on reviews and consultants without yielding beneficial outcomes.\"\n\n**With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting local businesses, what measures do you think are needed for recovery?**\n\n\"The Prom isn't the only tourist attraction that has suffered due to COVID-19; we have also neglected other valuable sites in favor of it. I'm currently assessing the Council's $2 million community support package, which has largely not reached small businesses. Immediate support is needed for outdoor community activities that businesses wish to pursue. We need to streamline processes and reduce bureaucratic hurdles, allowing for innovative solutions rather than just compliance checklists.\"\n\n**What changes and reforms would you like to see regarding environmental protection?**\n\n\"We need to acknowledge that our farmers are vital environmental stewards. Supporting them through rate relief for environmental initiatives is crucial. I advocate for the establishment of Habitat Corridors to connect wildlife communities and enhance biodiversity across the Shire, linking coastal reserves to the ranges through a comprehensive master plan.\"\n\n**What qualifications do you bring to the role of local councillor?**\n\n\"I bring extensive experience in small business management, community involvement, and people management. My education in Economics, Finance, and Small Business, along with studies in Climatology and Coastal & Fluvial Geomorphology, equips me for this role. I pride myself on my listening skills, patience, and empathy. While not all decisions will be popular, I commit to delivering them with honesty.\"\n\n**Are there specific projects you aim to advocate for in your community?**\n\n\"I will advocate for a better allocation of resources to small communities, ensuring value for ratepayers. This includes enhancing services at community and health centers, and improving support for the elderly to help them stay in their beloved communities. Additionally, I would push for the Masterplan of Habitat Corridors in collaboration with the farming community.\"\n\n**How have you connected with local voters during the COVID-19 lockdown?**\n\n\"I reach out through local businesses and hospitality venues, while also utilizing social media as a vital tool for sharing ideas, advice, and information with the community.\"\n\n**Have you run for political office before?**\n\n\"This is my first time seeking a political position; I have never run for office prior to this election.\""}

A reward of 200,000 RMB (approximately 31,284 USD) had been offered for information leading to the defector's capture, as noted by Business Insider. Zhu had escaped from Jilin prison on October 18 by climbing onto a storage shed and then jumping over a wall.  \n\nZhu initially fled North Korea in July 2013 by swimming across a river that serves as a natural border between North Korea and China. Before his escape, he worked as a coal miner in North Korea.  \n\nNorth Korean defectors face the threat of imprisonment and potential torture if caught in China. A bilateral border agreement established in 1986 between China and North Korea mandates the deportation of all Korean defectors apprehended by Chinese authorities back to North Korea."}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews RSL Australia for Remembrance Day 2021", "content": "**Wikinews Interviews RSL Australia for Remembrance Day 2021**\n\nWikinews reporter J.J. Liu reached out via email to the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) to discuss the upcoming 102nd observance of Remembrance Day, which honors the end of hostilities in World War I (WWI) on November 11, 1918.\n\nOriginally referred to as \"Armistice Day\" during its first celebration in 1919, the day was renamed \"Remembrance Day\" after World War II (WWII) to honor not only those who died in that conflict but also in subsequent Australian military engagements, as stated on the RSL website. In 1997, Governor-General Sir William Deane issued a proclamation urging all Australians to observe a moment of silence.\n\nAccording to the RSL website, 61,630 Australians lost their lives during WWI, between August 4, 1914, and March 31, 1921, making it the deadliest conflict in Australian history. From a population of five million, 416,809 Australians enlisted in the war, with approximately 155,000 sustaining injuries and 8,000 succumbing to post-war conditions.\n\nThe interview featured RSL Ambassador Pete Rudland, a veteran who served from 1989 to 2017 with deployments in Cambodia, Iraq, East Timor, and Afghanistan—where he was injured in a helicopter crash that claimed four lives.\n\n**How has Remembrance Day changed over the years?**\n\nRudland remarked, \"In the beginning, Remembrance Day had a profound impact on a significant portion of the global population, as many Australians were touched by the war. Over 60,000 Australians were buried in foreign lands, and the nation grieved collectively.\" \n\nHe emphasized that the RSL offered a platform for families of the fallen to mourn and heal together, reflecting a shared experience of war. While modern conflicts may not affect the same number of Australians, the RSL remains dedicated to providing support for soldiers and their families, just as it did a century ago.\n\n**What role should organizations play in Remembrance Day?**\n\n\"Remembrance Day is essentially a collection of stories about those who sacrificed everything for their beliefs,\" Rudland explained. \"Organizations must ensure these stories and the lessons from them are preserved, especially as our demographics evolve. Ex-Service Organizations are the guardians of our collective memory.\"\n\n**What role do you believe governments should take on Remembrance Day?**\n\n\"Politicians lead nations to war, but the impact is borne by soldiers and their families,\" he noted. \"Governments should take the initiative on Remembrance Day, recognizing that soldiers do not decide to go to war; it is the responsibility of elected officials. Acknowledging significant days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day reinforces the bond between the military, government, and citizens.\"\n\n**Why is Remembrance Day still important, over a century after the Armistice?**\n\n\"For Australians, WWI marked a pivotal moment where we defined ourselves as a nation, not just colonies,\" he reflected. \"Australians take pride in what our young nation achieved, both domestically and on the battlefield. The sacrifices of soldiers and their families have shaped our history, making it crucial for contemporary Australians to grasp the connection between the past and present.\"\n\n**What lessons from WWI are relevant to veterans' affairs today?**\n\nRudland emphasized, \"War is complex, and its consequences extend far beyond the cessation of hostilities. The wounded need ongoing rehabilitation, and the families of those lost must feel their sacrifices were meaningful. This applies to all conflicts.\"\n\n**Why should Remembrance Day be commemorated alongside ANZAC Day on April 25?**\n\n\"ANZAC Day represents the beginning of a legendary narrative in Australian history—a testament to triumph over adversity,\" Rudland stated. \"Remembrance Day serves as a reminder of the profound human cost of WWI and the challenges faced by a young nation striving to establish its identity. Together, ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day encapsulate the collective journey of all Australians.\""}

The general was en route to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) along with 13 others, including his wife and several senior defense personnel. The aircraft involved in the accident was an Indian Air Force Mi-17V5 helicopter. The military later confirmed that all but one of the 14 individuals on board perished in the crash.\n\nThe helicopter took off from Sulur Air Force Base and was headed to the DSSC in Wellington, Tamil Nadu, where General Rawat was scheduled to address the college's faculty and student officers. At approximately 12:08 PM IST, the helicopter lost contact with the base, shortly before it crashed near a residential area occupied by tea estate workers on the outskirts of Nanjappachatiram, within Bandishola Panchayat.\n\nEyewitness Krishnaswamy described the scene to the BBC, saying, \"Even the electric poles shook. Trees toppled. There was smoke everywhere, and flames raged above the trees.

Their relationship has faced significant criticism from the Japanese public due to its unconventional nature and the way it challenges longstanding social norms. The couple's arrival at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport attracted considerable media attention and involved tight security.\n\nMako, a former princess and niece of the Japanese emperor, relinquished her royal title to marry Kei, her college sweetheart. Although Japan is modern in many respects, the status of women and family values are often rooted in feudal traditions; Japanese royalty are prohibited from marrying \"commoners.\"\n\nNew York was chosen as their new home because Kei has secured a position at a law firm, although he has yet to pass the New York bar exam. The Associated Press has reported that this detail has been seized upon by Japanese media to undermine his credibility, despite the fact that it is common for many to not pass a bar exam on their first attempt. Observers have noted parallels between the scrutiny faced by Mako and Kei and that of other public figures who challenge societal expectations."}

{"title": "Grand jury indicts former White House advisor Steve Bannon for contempt of Congress", "content": "Steve Bannon, a former political strategist for former President Donald Trump, has been indicted by federal authorities for contempt of Congress. This indictment follows Bannon's refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the U.S. House of Representatives, which was investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. The House had voted last month to refer the matter to the Department of Justice for further action.\n\nBannon faces two counts of contempt related to his failure to appear for a scheduled testimony and for not producing subpoenaed documents. The inquiry has also indicated that former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows may face a referral to the Department of Justice for similar noncompliance.\n\nIf convicted, Bannon could face up to one year in federal prison and a fine of $100,000. However, contempt of Congress is a challenging charge to prosecute; the last successful conviction occurred in 1974 against a conspirator involved in Watergate. This marks the first time since 1983 that an individual has been charged with contempt of Congress."}
{"title": "Glasgow Climate Pact deal struck; nations to reduce coal usage", "content": "The 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) has concluded with the signing of the Glasgow Climate Pact, marking a significant milestone in global efforts to address climate change. This pact represents the first international agreement explicitly aimed at reducing coal usage, which accounts for approximately 40% of the world's annual emissions and is the most significant source of greenhouse gas emissions among fossil fuels.\n\nHowever, BBC News reports that the commitments made during the conference may not be sufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to a 2018 study, the differences between limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees are profound. While 1.5 degrees would help mitigate the worst effects of climate change, a rise of 2 degrees would significantly worsen its impacts around the globe.\n\nInitially, there were plans for a complete phase-out of coal; however, India's climate minister highlighted that this goal would be unrealistic for developing nations still grappling with developmental challenges and poverty eradication. This concern shifted the conversation from total elimination of coal to focusing on gradual reduction.\n\nCOP26 President expressed deep regret over the weakening of the pact, explaining that it was necessary to ensure the agreement’s overall viability. Switzerland's environment minister voiced her \"profound disappointment,\" noting that the adjustments made to the pact would not bring the world closer to the 1.5-degree target, but rather complicate efforts to achieve it."}

He held prominent positions, including Honorary Vice President.\n\nIn a brief article, the current leader, Kim Jong-un, expressed his condolences by sending a wreath, commemorating Kim Yong-ju's contributions to the nation. The article characterized Kim Yong-ju as someone who \"devotedly struggled to implement the lines and policies\" of the regime and played a role in advancing socialist construction and the development of the Korean-style state social system.\n\nThe announcement of Kim Yong-ju's death came just two days ahead of the ten-year anniversary of his nephew Kim Jong-il's passing. While he was initially seen as a potential successor to Kim Il-sung, Kim Yong-ju gradually \"faded from the political scene,\" according to the Associated Press, with his last public appearance recorded in a television report in 2015, where he was seen casting his ballot.\n\nThroughout his life, Kim Yong-ju received the Order of Kim Il-sung and the Order of the State, the two highest honors in the country, along with the title of Hero of the Republic, the highest honorary title in North Korea.\n\nThis event occurs shortly before the ten-year mark of Kim Jong-un's rise to power, a significant moment as it parallels the status of both his grandfather and father."}

Over 300,000 individuals were evacuated as the storm made landfall, resulting in roofs being torn off, concrete power poles being toppled, and significant disruptions to communication and electricity services. As of today, officials report that more than 75 lives have been lost due to the storm.\n\nThe island where the typhoon made landfall was described as \"totally devastated\" by the local governor. Typhoon Rai was classified as a powerful storm, and many areas were left without electricity or communication, as downed power lines and fallen trees rendered numerous roads impassable. Many buildings were severely damaged, leading to a widespread impact in the affected regions.\n\nOn December 17, authorities declared a state of calamity in the province of Bohol due to the extensive damage caused by the typhoon. The governor of Bohol also announced the same status for the province of Cebu. Concerns were raised about the potential disruption to the storage of Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine kits amid ongoing power outages. President Duterte indicated that he would tour the affected areas, including Bohol, Cebu, and others, to assess the situation firsthand. Access to food and clean water has become increasingly limited for those impacted by the storm.\n\nTyphoon Rai also caused significant damage to Vietnamese-held islands in the region. An observation tower reported sustained winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph) and gusts reaching 200 km/h (124 mph) on the afternoon of December 18, before being knocked down by the storm.

{"title": "New Zealand raises interest rates in second straight month to 0.75%", "content": "**RBNZ Increases Interest Rates in Response to Rising Inflation**\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised its official cash rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 0.75% during its final policy meeting of the year, responding to a consumer price inflation rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, the highest level recorded since December 2007.\n\nThe rate hike was largely anticipated by economists and market analysts; 21 out of 23 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll conducted from November 15 to 19 predicted the 25 basis point increase, while two forecasted a 50 basis point rise to 1%.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, New Zealand's approach to managing COVID-19 involved significant fiscal and monetary stimulus, akin to strategies used by other major economies. This response has contributed to a record low unemployment rate and the highest inflation in over ten years. The combination of stimulus spending, low interest rates, and a housing shortage has resulted in home prices doubling over the past seven years, making New Zealand the least affordable country among OECD nations, as reported by Reuters.\n\nThe RBNZ highlighted that the \"near-term rise in inflation [is being] exacerbated by higher oil prices, rising transport costs, and supply shortfalls,\" warning of the potential for broader price increases, according to ABC News. The central bank projects that rates could rise to 2.5% by 2023 and even higher by 2024, although median forecasts from a recent article suggest the OCR may only reach 2% by the end of 2023, below levels seen in 2014.\n\nRecent predictions vary, with economist Ben Udy suggesting the OCR could hit 2% by mid-2022, while Westpac's acting chief economist, Michael Gordon, anticipates a peak of 3% by Q3 2023, including a 0.5% rate hike during the RBNZ's next meeting in February, as reported by The Guardian.\n\nThe announcement follows a previously anticipated rate hike in October, where the OCR was raised from 0.25% to 0.5%—the first increase in seven years—as part of the RBNZ's tightening cycle that was delayed due to the Delta variant outbreak and lockdown measures in Auckland. Senior market strategist Jason Wong remarked at the time, \"We're on a path towards a series of rate hikes and the market is well priced for that.\"\n\nRBNZ Governor Adrian Orr explained to reporters that the bank believes a gradual approach—taking steady steps of 25 basis points back to levels just above the neutral rate—is the most balanced strategy. While the bank considered various options, including a 50 basis point hike, it ultimately opted for the smaller adjustment.\n\nOrr also addressed housing market concerns, cautioning that \"homeowners who have recently entered the market with very high levels of leverage need to be particularly careful and must prepare for higher interest rates.\" He noted that previous taxation on property investors had not succeeded in curbing escalating house prices, which the RBNZ views as unsustainable and at risk of correction. While he defended the necessity of stimulus, he acknowledged the subsequent rise in household debt.\n\nGlobally, many countries are beginning to wind down pandemic-related stimulus measures. In the U.S., inflation recently surged to 6.2%, the highest in 31 years, prompting pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to expedite the tapering of monthly bond purchases, as reported by the Associated Press. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) are facing scrutiny over anticipated inflation pressures, according to Reuters and The Guardian.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde cautioned the European Parliament on November 15 against unnecessary tightening of financial conditions, stating that such measures could hinder economic recovery. She emphasized that \"if we were to take any tightening measures now, it could cause far more harm than good,\" as reported by Reuters.\n\nIn contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is holding firm that interest rates are not expected to rise until 2024. RBA Governor Philip Lowe indicated to an Australian Business Economists lunch last week that current data and forecasts do not support an increase in the cash rate for 2022, stating, \"[t]he economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario.\"\n\nSeveral central banks, including those in Norway, the Czech Republic, and South Korea, have already raised rates prior to New Zealand's move, with South Korea expected to announce another hike at its meeting today.\n\nFollowing the RBNZ's announcement, the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% as some investors anticipated a more significant hike. Additionally, both 2-year and 10-year government bonds declined by 10 basis points each."}

However, a leader from the Indian Farmers' Union declared that protests would continue until the laws are fully revoked in Parliament.\n\nThe Indian National Congress, the primary opposition party, welcomed the government's decision.
