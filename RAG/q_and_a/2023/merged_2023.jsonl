The following is the interview with Tilley.\n\nFirst, can you briefly explain what you see as the main problem(s) with Oklahoma's current marijuana laws?\n\n Oklahoma currently allows residents to apply for a medical marijuana license, with a doctor’s referral, from the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. This means that marijuana is illegal for adults to consume or possess for non-medical purposes. \n\nState Question 820, which the people of Oklahoma will vote on this March 7, 2023, proposes to safely legalize, regulate, and tax recreational marijuana for adults over 21 years of age. \n\nLegalizing marijuana for adults over 21 would have a significant and positive economic and fiscal impact for the state. Passage of SQ 820 would lead to the collection of tens of millions in new tax revenue in the first year of implementation and hundreds of millions in the first five years. This revenue could offer a significant boost to Oklahoma’s underfunded public schools, law enforcement agencies, mental health programs and other priorities. Furthermore, local economies, in every town, large and small, would benefit from good paying jobs and new sales tax dollars that will stay in local communities. \n\nPassage of SQ 820 would also represent a positive alignment of Oklahoma’s public safety priorities: Law enforcement would be able to devote their limited resources away from low level marijuana offenses, focusing instead on serious crimes. Meanwhile, Oklahoma would become a more just state, because 820 allows Oklahomans with old convictions for low level marijuana crimes to remove those offenses from their criminal history, making it easier to find gainful employment and move on with their lives. \n\nFinally, SQ 820 would provide a sensible and safe regulatory framework. Under SQ 820, all marijuana products would be tested, safe, and only available to adults aged 21 and older (unless you have a medical marijuana card). Each product will be analyzed to determine potency and screened for unsafe contaminants. All marijuana and related products will be tracked, traced, and accurately labeled in an inventory system from seed to sale.\n\n What would Initiative 820 do to rectify these problems?\n\n See above\n\n How would you respond to claims that legalizing marijuana would create a \"slippery slope\" towards total legalization of drugs, and, in fact, do you think that would be a bad thing?\n\n SQ 820 does not propose to legalize any substances other than marijuana. \n\n What or who are some businesses, organizations, or individuals supporting Initiative 820 who voters might not expect to support it, and why are they?\n\n State Question 820 is supported by:\n\n Oklahomans who want a significant source of new revenue to support important public priorities like education, health care, and transportation needs. This includes parents who want more resources for their kids’ schools, patients concerned about the cost or availability of health care resources, and people who don’t want to run over potholes on the way to work; \n Businesses and families who know their communities can benefit from the good jobs and investment of a multi-billion dollar industry; \n Members of the legal and law enforcement community who are tired of wasting their time and resources on low level marijuana offenses instead of fighting more serious criminal activity; and \n Adults interested in using cannabis for non-medical purposes.\n\n Lastly, why do you think Initiative 820 will succeed?\n\n SQ 820 will succeed because Oklahomans want more resources for priorities like education; we want the economic boost that comes with supporting a new, multi-billion dollar industry; and we want to reap the public safety benefits that come with refocusing law enforcement on dangerous criminal activity instead of minor marijuana offenses. This is a commonsense proposal that will help make Oklahoma a stronger, more prosperous and more just state.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of State Question 820 that voters in Oklahoma will decide on March 7, 2023? \n\nA) To legalize marijuana for medical purposes only  \nB) To establish a new tax on all drugs  \nC) To legalize, regulate, and tax recreational marijuana for adults over 21  \nD) To maintain the current marijuana laws"}

{"title": "Sydney, Australia woman who \"spontaneously\" murdered boyfriend in \"fatal explosion of emotion\" sentenced", "content": "On Friday, Jackline Sabana Bona Musa, a Sydney, Australia woman who fatally crushed her adulterous boyfriend in 2020, received a 20-year prison sentence, including time served; she is set to be eligible for parole in 2034.\n\nSentencing Justice Richard Button described the murder as \"spontaneous and not premeditated\", but also a \"grave example of an extremely grave offence\".\n\nHe continued: \"As I have said, the offence was spontaneous and not premeditated. The intention to inflict serious harm existed for only a matter of seconds. One cannot be satisfied of an intention to kill.\n\n\"On the other hand, the life of a fellow human being was violently extinguished in a place where he was entitled to feel safe. His final ordeal was short, but terrifying, and he surely died in enormous pain. What occurred was a deeply self-centred imposition of violence on a fellow human being.\"\n\nButton called Musa's early life and childhood \"grossly deprived and traumatic\".\n\nHe said: \"[Musa] was born in Sudan in north-eastern Africa […] She grew up in a village that, for example, had no running water. Her family was often short of food. Her father died when she was very young, and her mother, a deeply religious woman, devoted herself to the care of her large family in poverty-stricken circumstances.\n\n\"I accept that she suffered many traumatic, indeed horrific experiences over the years. By way of example, whilst she was part of a convoy fleeing the fighting, the vehicle in front of hers was blown up, and other persons were injured and killed before her eyes.\"\n\nIn 2004, Musa arrived in Australia as a refugee, with many of her family members dead from poverty and war. She was, by that time, afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder and fluctuating levels of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe justice also noted the former aged care worker had \"been employed consistently\", \"cared for her four children and her aged mother\" and \"completely abstained from drugs and alcohol\".\n\nConcluding his sentencing remarks, Justice Button said: \"This case is a tragedy from many perspectives: primarily, from that of the deceased, of course, and those who loved him and honour his memory; but also from the perspective of a previously law-abiding offender, her family, and Australian society generally.\n\n\"In short, a life was taken simply because a fellow human being was exercising autonomy in romantic matters […] Deplorable violence was inflicted upon him, whereby he was crushed to death. There is no remorse on the part of the offender, even now. To be weighed against those matters is that, after an early life of great deprivation and disruption, the offender made a successful fresh start in this country, something especially to her credit in light of the psychological problems that had been inflicted upon on her. They played their part in this fatal explosion of emotion.\"\n\nButton said: \"I believe that, many years from now, the offender has a good chance of becoming a valued member of the community again. By way of my sentence, I seek to balance and reflect that multitude of countervailing factors.\"\n\nThe killing occurred on June 27, 2020 in the suburb of , at a garage along Hill Road and near Half Street.\n\nAccording to Button, that morning Musa thought her boyfriend, 31-year-old Payman \"Paul\" Thagipur, was economically abusing her, feeling \"cut off\" from him.\n\nAn acquaintance told her to send Thagipur a text message; the then 44-year-old Musa texted him: \"Hi, how are you? Am concerned and worried. I just wanted to know that you're not hurt or sick. If there's something I did wrong, I would like to apologise. Please get in touch\".\n\nThagipur did not respond.\n\nIn the early evening, Musa unsuccessfully searched for Thagipur in several cafés and restaurants in . She then drove to his apartment in Wentworth Point. After several failed attempts to enter the secured garage, she tailgated another vehicle through the roller door, which struck the roof of her  SUV.\n\nAfter parking in her usual space, next to Thagipur's allocated one, she told a resident inspecting the damaged roller door she lived in \"apartment 201\", Thagipur’s unit and her key fob was \"not working\". Musa asked to be let into the building and the resident obliged.\n\nThagipur answered the door for her in his underwear and Musa entered to see another woman sitting inside.\n\nMusa asked the other woman, \"is it your turn today\" and spat in her boyfriend's face, before returning to her car, with Thagipur entering the garage behind her.\n\nButton argued that, over \"several seconds\", Musa \"spontaneously formed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury\" on the victim.\n\nMusa sped forward and crashed into the 31-year-old Thagipur, continuing through a bollard, before colliding with and pinning him against a brick wall. Musa approached Thagipur as he was \"gasping for air\".\n\nAfter about one minute, she called emergency services, telling the operator: \"I kill someone here. It was a terrible accident. I didn't mean it […] I just hit him and he's dead.\"\n\nPolice treated Thagipur at the scene until paramedics arrived.\n\nIn footage released by , one officer says: \"Mate, keep breathing, keep breathing. Don't stop breathing.\" Another says: \"You're doing well mate, you're doing well. Stay with us.\"\n\nLeading Senior Constable Steve Nevill told the Supreme Court he saw Thagipur lying on the ground, and \"there was a lot of blood on the ground underneath him.\" Nevill said Thagipur was making gasping-like noises, but these were postmortem sounds, not breathing.\n\nMusa claimed, \"I was driving out and he came in front of me […] This person is my boyfriend. The whole week I am trying to get hold of him, he never reply […] He stopped talking to me […] I was hurt inside as a woman.\"\n\nMusa was arrested and taken to  under police guard for mandatory testing. \n\nAt her murder trial last year, defence counsel Madeleine Avenell  did not dispute that Musa had driven at Thagipur, but insisted that she did not drive towards him with murderous intent or in an unlawful manner amounting to manslaughter.\n\nAvenell said: \"What is in dispute is that Ms Musa saw Mr Thagipur before colliding with him, that she deliberately drove at him as he walked through the car park and that she intended to cause him grievous bodily harm or intended to kill him.\n\n\"She denies the allegation of murder […] She denies that the circumstances were such as to amount to an unlawful and dangerous act of manslaughter.\"\n\nProsecutors argued that the homicide was committed in a \"state of anger\".\n\n\"The crown case is the accused, seated in the driver’s seat of her car, [was] very angry about what had just happened – seeing the deceased in his underpants and seeing another woman in the apartment,\" Crown prosecutor Emma Blizard told the court.\n\nBlizard continued: \"In this state of anger, she drove her car out of the parking spot very quickly, she drove her car at the deceased deliberately as he walked towards her through the carpark.\"\n\nOn December 12, Musa was found guilty of murder by a jury.

From 2015 to 2021, the number of 'most extreme' events, among the 30 wettest or driest, increased to four from three per year.\n\nMonday's study noted an increase in the wet-to-dry event ratio from 15 to 20° N, and a decrease in three areas between 15° N and 50° N, supporting the hypothesis that wet and dry areas are inversely affected by extreme events.\n\nThe most intense dry event observed was a record-breaking South American drought from 2015-2016, while the greatest  had been ongoing since 2002 through 2021, affecting most of sub-Saharan Africa above 10° S and leading to flooding and  to rise to its highest levels ever in 2020, inundating homes and infrastructure. \n\nRodell, the lead author, told the Associated Press (AP): \"I was surprised to see how well correlated the global intensity was with global mean temperatures.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, he explained: \"We thought, well, maybe this is related to global warming, because we do know the past seven or so years have been the hottest on record [...] Sure enough, there was a significant correlation between this total worldwide intensity of these events and the temperature record.\" \n\nAbout the study's reliability, he said: \"What I feel more confident about is that as the world warms, we’re going to see the greater global intensity of all the wet and dry events increase, meaning they’re going to be more frequent, larger and more severe in total [...] What happens in a regional sense is a little bit more difficult to say with certainty.\n\n\"The study is another way for people to recognize that climate change affects everyone [...] It’s not just about the temperature rising on average around the world, it’s the actual weather events that have severe impacts on people that may be increasing in intensity and frequency.\"\n\nRichard Seager, a climate specialist of Columbia University's , told the AP: \"Looking forward into the future, in terms of managing water resources and flood control, we should be anticipating that the wetter extremes will be wetter and the dry extremes will get drier [...] everything’s going to get amplified on both ends of the dry-wet spectrum.\"\n\nOn Rodell and Li's use of metrics from GRACE, he said: \"This study uses novel [satellite] data to confirm that human-driven warming is driving the climate system to more extremes of extended both wet and dry episodes.\"\n\nPark Williams, a University of California, Los Angeles , told the AP: \"It’s incredible that we can now monitor the pulse of continental water from outer space [...] I have a feeling when future generations look back and try to determine when humanity really began understanding the planet as a whole, this will be one of the studies highlighted.\"\n\nMeanwhile, CNN cited climatologist and Brown University Institute for Environment and Society Director , who called the study \"a new lens on our rapidly changing water cycle, linking many of the headlines about droughts, floods and wildfires to this global analysis.\n\n\"This finding really reinforces the trends that we see from analysis of rainfall data and climate model output, and in that sense adds significant evidence to inform emergency planning and response, infrastructure planning, agricultural practices, and water resource management under continued warming.\"\n\nRodell has been the Acting Deputy Director of Earth Sciences for , , and  at Goddard since 2021.\n\nLi has been an assistant research scientist at the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard, and at the  since 2017.\n\nIn its 2021 report, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported a 70% increase in the frequency of droughts that would typically occur every ten years and a 30% increase in the frequency of comparable flooding.\n\nMoreover, scientists have said global warming could amplify the occurrence of 'weather whiplash', rapid swings between extreme conditions like in the US state of California, which recently experienced heavy rain and snowstorms after a megadrought.\n\nThe  estimates 20% of annual extreme weather-induced losses in the US economy stem from droughts and floods.", "question": "What was the primary conclusion of the study published by NASA scientists Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li regarding extreme weather events?\n\nA) The increase in global temperatures is unrelated to the severity of weather events.  \nB) The occurrence of extreme weather events has decreased in the past two decades.  \nC) Rising temperatures are strongly linked to an increase in the severity and frequency of hydroclimatic extreme events.  \nD) The number of wet events is outpacing the number of dry events globally."}

Obviously, the US has had three and a half years to investigate this matter\". \n\nHe added: \"And all I'm going to ask, Your Honor, is the opportunity to fairly defend our client.

The clashes injured Gonell, who retired; he noted to the Associated Press this was \"the same court in which hundreds of rioters have been sentenced. It's the same court former President Trump is being arraigned in today for his alleged involvement before, during, and after the siege.\"\n\nOther attendees included the court's chief judge, , who presided over the  secret proceedings. Also attending were Judge Randy Moss and Judge , who has criticized Trump when sentencing participants in the attack.\n\nProviding counsel for the defense were Lauro and Todd Blanche, also working for Trump in other court cases, while Trump lawyer  attended in the audience.

He said: \"This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican [Party] primary and leading Biden by a lot [...] So if you can't beat 'em, you persecute 'em or you prosecute 'em. We can't let this happen in America.\" He has maintained his innocence.\n\nAsked at a campaign stop press conference in Iowa on Friday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican contender in the 2024 election, if he believed the 2024 presidential election to be \"stolen\", he said: \"I've said many times the election is what it is [...] All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true. But what I've also said is the way you conduct a good election that people have confidence in, you don't change the rules in the middle of the game.\"\n\nProsecutors asked Chutkan to issue a protective order under which Trump could not release sensitive evidence from discovery, after he wrote on his social media website  earlier in the day: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" They said that could be interpreted as meaning he could attempt to chill witnesses.\n\nTrump's lawyers submitted a response Monday, conceding some documents should remain private, but \"the need to protect that information does not require a blanket  over all documents produced by the government.\" Basing their argument upon the US Constitution's provision safeguarding free speech, they continued: \"In a trial about  rights, the government seeks to restrict First Amendment rights.\"\n\nThe government responded, noting the other side's counsels had been spoken about the case on broadcast media. Chutkan later scheduled a hearing on the matter for Friday.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump declared on Truth Social: \"There is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge 'assigned' to the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case [...] Everybody knows this and so does she!

He called the election \"crooked\" before flying to D.C. for the arraignment on social media.\n\nAware his statements were false as Vice President Mike Pence and other advisors and appointees informed him, the indictment charged, \"the defendant repeated and widely disseminated them anyway — to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate, to create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger, and to erode public faith in the administration of the election.\"\n\nThe indictment described Trump trying to persuade state administrators to alter election results, unsuccessfully attempting to convince Pence he could prevent Congress from counting the votes of , who states appointed consistent with the local popular vote, and, with unnamed and unindicted accomplices, assembling groups of \"fraudulent electors\" to vote for him and send their votes for Congress to count.\n\nTrump and accomplices, the grand jury continued, disseminated these statements in a rally on January 6, after which some attendees and others .

Was there a specific inciting event?\n\n Yes — it was during the first year of the pandemic when we were relying more on online orders and deliveries. I needed to buy some household items from Argos. Argos require customers to select a title to complete a purchase, but they don't offer Mx as a title option. As a non-binary person this was immensely frustrating. Instead of just sending an angry tweet about it, I decided to dedicate who knows how many days a weeks to a whole campaign encouraging major brands such as Argos to add Mx.\n\n How often do companies respond positively to the campaign? Are there any that have responded negatively?\n\n I'd say it's about 50/50. The campaigns that do respond more often say they will 'look into it'. Argos has been 'looking into it' since about 2011. No companies respond in a particularly negative way. \n\n Which company do you think has handled adding the Mx title the best?\n\n  and  were the best big brands in terms of their responses to the campaign.

In a statement the campaign said: \"The timing of this latest coordinated strike by a biased prosecutor in an overwhelmingly  jurisdiction not only betrays the trust of the American people, but also exposes true motivation driving their fabricated accusations.\" He previously repeatedly asked for her disqualification based on her public remarks on the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, he wrote on his social media website, : \"A Large, Complex, Detailed but Irrefutable REPORT on the Presidential Election Fraud which took place in Georgia is almost complete & will be presented by me at a major News Conference at 11:00 A.M. on Monday of next week in , New Jersey\".\n\nOn Thursday, he announced he would not stage the press conference, posting to Truth Social: \"Rather than releasing the Report on the Rigged & Stolen Georgia 2020 Presidential Election on Monday, my lawyers would prefer putting this, I believe, Irrefutable & Overwhelming evidence of Election Fraud & Irregularities in formal Legal Filings as we fight to dismiss this disgraceful Indictment\".\n\nThis fourth case followed indictments of the former president in New York City, on state-level charges of  to conceal hush money payments, the first indictment of a US president Miami, Florida, on federal charges of purposeful retention of classified documents; and Washington, D.C., on federal charges of \"[pursuit] of unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting\" the 2020 election.\n\nUnlike impeachment and conviction by the US Congress, a criminal conviction unrelated to insurrection would not have legal effects on Trump's campaign, but, as the charges were state-level, a US president could not pardon those, if any, found guilty or remove state prosecutors.\n\nIn its 98 pages, the indictment mentioned 30 more involved in the conspiracy, but did not charge or name them. It said Trump and associates, including lawyers Rudy Giuliani and , both indicted alongside him Monday, unsuccessfully attempted to persuade state officials involved in the certification of the results.\n\nIt described Trump asking Governor  and the Georgia secretary of state, , both Republicans, to interfere with the results —  to ask him to \"find\" votes so Trump could overcome Biden's victory and  employees to pronounce the results \"corrupt\".\n\nIt said Trump made false claims of election fraud in, without success, petitioning courts to undo the results in lawsuits against Georgia.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Trump organized individuals to present themselves as legitimate , including state Republican Party chairman  and Cathleen Latham; some said the Trump campaign told them they would cast their presidential votes only if Trump's legal efforts to overturn Biden's victory were successful. The grand jury indicted Shafer and , another alleged participant in the scheme, who worked on Trump's 2020 campaign.\n\nThe indictment continued Trump attorneys three times attempted to convince members of the Republican-majority  to present their election fraud allegations.

Rosie answered Wikinews emailed queries after it ended.\n\n What inspired you to get into your subgenre? I discovered J-pop music and idol culture on the internet one day, and I instantly fell in love. The cute outfits and upbeat songs made me so happy, and I wanted to share that happiness with everyone. It was very different from everything I had been used to up until that point, as I was a slightly tomboyish child, but when I felt the energetic cheerful vibes of J-pop music for the first time I knew in my heart that it was the path I was meant to follow.\n\n \"Meowgical Rosie\". What's the story behind the name? I've always been a huge lover of cats, so I knew I wanted to incorporate that somehow. I also wanted to encompass that joyful, almost magical feeling I get from J-pop. The word 'meowgical' seemed to have that vibe I was going for, and my name is Rosie, so I became Meowgical Rosie! \n\n What do you hope to accomplish with your music? One of the biggest messages I try to share is to not be afraid to follow your dreams and to do what makes you happy. Too often I see and hear of people making fun of others for having unconventional hobbies and interests — it happened to me when I was first starting out as a performer, a lot of people made fun of me for it. It breaks my heart to hear of those who have given up the things that bring them joy because of taunting and bullying. I feel as long as it's harmless, we should be able to enjoy the things that make us happy without fear of what other people think. But of course, I understand it isn't always easy to have the confidence to do so, and that's why I want to help others find that confidence in themselves like I did! I hope that as a performer, I can inspire others like me to be unashamed to follow their hearts and their dreams.\n\n Was this your first time at Animeleague Birmingham? Do you plan to come back?'''\n\n It was not my first time there, I've performed at that event a few times now and it's always such an energetic crowd! Some have come to my performances on multiple occasions now and it's always wonderful to see familiar faces, but also meet new ones each time I'm there! I definitely hope to return next time.\n\nAt 12:00 BST (1100 UTC) on August 27, LELE performed at the convention. LELE, a J-pop idol who has performed in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom, has released a few albums and , as well as three . LELE answered Wikinews emailed questions after the convention concluded.\n\n What inspired you to get into music? I come from a very musical background, both of my parents are musicians and myself and my siblings are also musically trained. However, I didn't actually begin to take music seriously as a career choice until I was about 20. I've always been a huge fan of anime and it was actually the opening theme songs that inspired me to begin singing in Japanese. I wanted to write and produce music that I enjoyed listening to myself, but I also wanted to write something that sounded like it could be a 'theme song'. Often when I write music, I create an anime in my head that would fit with it and it sort of helps to keep me writing within a theme. : Anime.\n\n Do you have a favourite song of yours? At the moment it would be my most recently released song, Hello Goodbye. You can listen to it [...] on [.] I feel immensely proud of it. When I write music, I'm a bit of a perfectionist and if I can't make it sound the way I hear it in my head – sometimes I'll end up shelving a song for months – even YEARS, before I decide that it's worth working on again. But with Hello Goodbye, I wrote it, recorded it and polished it off in thirteen hours from start to finish! Everything sounded right to me. When I wanted to add in a little chime or jingle here and there to fill out the sound, it fit in just right. I really feel like this song was meant to be written the exact day I wrote it. But that might just be some 'musician superstition'.\n\n Was this your first time at Animeleague Birmingham, and do you plan to come back? I believe this may be the fourth performance I've done in Birmingham and I certainly do have plans to come back and perform here again! I love the energy here, everyone gets involved and it makes the show that much more enjoyable!\n\n What is the best part about performing? For me, the best part is when the crowd joins in. I love it so much and it gives me such an energy boost when people come up to dance with me at the front of the stage. Historically I've performed in clubs and music festivals, so the convention scene was very different for me with the crowd sitting in chairs rather than standing up and dancing. I always encourage my viewers to come and join me, jump around, be silly and let loose.. because I just want everyone to have as much fun as I am!\n\n What are your plans for the future? My plans include more live shows, both local within the UK and internationally— I have another six or seven shows this year, and still in the process of organising my 2024 performance schedule! I'm also collaborating with some other international artists and producers, so please keep an eye out for those announcements!\n\nThe event's \"Big Gaming Quiz\" was to occur at the same time as LELE's performance.

After approximately half an hour's flight,  data indicated the plane plummeting at almost 8,000 feet per minute by 6:19 PM (15:19 UTC) and ceasing to report its altitude, after rapidly alternating between gaining and losing altitude from a cruise at about 28,000 feet.\n\nThe Federal Air Transport Agency said \"[a]n investigation has been launched\", reporting others recorded aboard were Sergey Propustin, Evgeniy Makaryan, Aleksandr Totmin, Valeriy Chekalov,  — an agent of military intelligence who became a Wagner field commander, Nikolay Matuseev, and on the crew Commander Aleksei Levshin, Rustam Karimov, as copilot, and Kristina Raspopova, as a flight attendant.\n\nToday, Russian government spokesperson  declared Moscow had nothing to do with the crash: \"There has been a lot of speculation around this crash [and] the tragic deaths of the plane's passengers, among them Yevgeny Prigozhin. Of course, the West presents all this speculation from a particular angle. All of that is sheer lies [...] One should rely on facts. For now, there are not many facts, they have yet to be established in the ongoing investigative procedures.\"\n\nPutin, on television yesterday, offered \"sincere condolences to the families of all the victims\", including Prigozhin, a \"talented businessman\" he explained he first met in the early 1990s: \"He [Prigozhin] was a man of difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life [...] He achieved the results needed both for himself and when I asked him about it - for a common cause, as in these last months.\"\n\nAccording to a US official who spoke to ABC News United States today, the working theory is an explosion, perhaps from a bomb, occurred on the Embraer and prompted its crash, while another expressed strong leanings toward a bomb being responsible.\n\nBrigadier General  of the US yesterday said the \"initial assessment, based on a variety of factors\" of that nation's intelligence concluded the Wagner head was \"likely killed\" in the crash, but added the military \"doesn't have any information to indicate right now\" a  was responsible.

He began a twelve-year sentence for robbery and fraud in 1981; authorities freed him in 1990.\n\nIn a comment to Sky News, the ' Samantha de Bendern described: \"He very quickly got onto the private property/private enterprise bandwagon and ended up being a hot dog seller [...] And this is where things become very mysterious because he transformed himself from hot dog seller to restaurateur to the grand and great of the new post-Soviet Russian elite.\"\n\nHe, his mother, and his stepfather started a hot dog business out of a flea market in the city. Governments awarded him contracts for food provision to schools and the army, and other government enterprises.\n\nThe US brought an indictment against him in 2018 over alleged financial aid to the , which the  accused of perpetrating a conspiracy to \"defraud the United States...for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016,\" including impersonating US citizens.\n\nAccording to Prigozhin — who previously denied connection to the organization and sought court relief from journalists suggesting such — he started Wagner in 2014. Wagner participated in the War in Donbas alongside pro-Russian rebels against the Ukrainian government, and has fought in Mali, Mozambique, and Sudan, among other African nations.\n\nBy UK and US sources' estimates, in late March 2022 Wagner had 1,000 fighters in Ukraine after the Russian invasion, and 50,000 in December, the US estimating prisoners composed all but 10,000 of the 50,000.\n\nPrigozhin said in November \"[a] dog receives a dog's death\" of the sledgehammer killing of a Wagner deserter, and the  has accused Wagner of war crimes.\n\nAs Wagner fighters engaged in combat in , Prigozhin demanded on social media: \"! !

In a video, near the corpses of Wagner fighters, he said: \"These are someone's fathers and someone's sons [...] The scum that doesn't give us ammunition will eat their guts in hell.\"\n\nOn June 23, Prigozhin demanded military leadership resign, ordering his forces to advance on Moscow and \"destroy anyone who stands in our way\", prompting clashes that killed perhaps fifteen government soldiers. He had Wagner turn around from 120 miles from Moscow days later; he mentioned a desire for peace. The Russian government announced Belarus secured a deal under which Prigozhin would stand down and he and Wagner forces would depart for Belarus, in exchange for freedom from legal repercussions over the rebellion.\n\nOn July 3, Prigozhin said on social media his intent had been \"fighting traitors and mobilizing our society\": \"I think we have achieved a lot of it.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Tatton Spiller, founder of political news service Simple Politics", "content": " \n\nOn October 13, Tatton Spiller, the founder of online news service Simple Politics, answered queries from Wikinews reporter Ash Thawley. The organisation, as of today, had 829,000 followers on , 233,000 on Facebook, and 83.7 thousand on Twitter, with posts covering political news within the United Kingdom, including policy, quotes from politicians, and collations of headlines.\n\n What prompted the creation of Simple Politics? Have your goals for the account changed over time?\n\n Well, it was a feeling that we weren't doing politics very well, we weren't trying to explain it. I worked at Parliament for a bit, and Parliament couldn't do anything 'cause they were too worried about impartiality, like they couldn't say anything 'cause they were so worried about it. Um, and also, honestly, I had a total, uh, breakdown, [...] I was a teacher at the time and I couldn't really do teaching anymore and so I needed a project, and so I got stuck into this thing, um, and I didn't really know where it was gonna go. The idea was to explain  as they went through; as each bill went through Parliament, I wanted to tell people what the changes to their lives would be, I wanted to make people aware.\n\nSo it started off as a website, and it started off straight after David Cameron won his , and the goal then was to...just get-I-I-I-I don't know what the goal was. Like I say, I was very very ill at the time, um. But no-one was coming, it was a website, and no-one was coming to the website, because who goes to websites, right? So someone told me I had to go onto social media, so I [...] went onto Twitter, and then I realised that I wanted people to see it on Twitter, and then I launched on Facebook, and so the goals I suppose then were growth, 'cause the more I grew, the more I could explain stuff. Um, and then Instagram came along a lot later, I didn't want to go on Instagram, my colleague Hattie said that I had to go on Instagram, and I said \"fine, you have to do it and set it all up\", and then obviously, well, Instagram is where [...] it's all taken off.\n\nUm...I mean, aside from growth, [...] it's very difficult because our aim, the aim of SP, is to help people have better conversations about politics — they're more informed, more understanding of the people to whom they're talking, less abusive, all that stuff — and that's impossible to measure. Absolutely impossible to measure. Then over [the] COVID[-19 pandemic], I suppose, the goal was just to help people, because it was this awful time and we could help. We were in a fortunate position to be able to help and [...] that was an absolute privilege. And now, [...] we just trundle along each day trying to help people understand what's going on, I suppose.\n\n What do you think is the most important attribute for a journalist to have? Do you think Simple Politics displays it well?\n\n I think that, um...well, [...] clarity's got to be the most important part of journalism, because if you're not getting your message across, then [...] you're lost. Doesn't matter how clever or important your story is, if you're not communicating it, then [...] you know, you're not starting. I think we do clarity quite well. I think, the other thing, [...] I'm always impressed by actual-I'm not an actual journalist, um, what impresses me is their ability to listen to a whole speech, for example, and then work out exactly what the story is from it. [...] Isolating the biggest story from...well, life, I mean, it comes down to clarity again. There's so much going on all day, every day...that it's really hard to work out what the story is. [...] Simple Politics does it okay, 'cause we have to ask ourselves \"what's the story for our readers\", and we have quite specific demographics so [...] we're less good at that. We're very good at being clear, sometimes we don't get the story right.\n\n With your short-form style of content, it is easy to fall into sensationalism. Do you think you avoid it? What steps do you take to do that?\n\n Mostly. We mostly avoid sensationalism, because [...] we don't refer to speculation in the press. When the press are saying \"oh, this might happen, this might\", we [...] ignore it, even if the story, is, like, it would do really well on social media to say that, you know, \"on Tuesday, [Prime Minister] Rishi Sunak's gonna resign\" 'cause some junior  said that, and there are other sites that do that. We want people to know they can trust what we say...and sometimes we have to sacrifice a bit of , we have to sacrifice some likes, I suppose, um, to do that. Do we do it sometimes? Well, sometimes, I just find stories exciting, and, uh, maybe I get overexcited, and maybe a little bit sensationalist — it's not really, I don't think. It depends  what you mean by sensationalism.\n\n What type of news do you think works best with your content style? What can't you easily report on?\n\n Um...what works best is policy announcements, is when we can get ideas, [...] because that's-that's our . One politician wants to do this, here's a problem, here's what one person says, here's what another person says. That's perfect for us, we love that. Um...I mean, in terms of UK politics, sometimes what's hard is sometimes, like, a speech will be an hour long, and we have to pull out three or four things and there's not quite space, and it's harder for us to do. And sometimes we're all like, \"what are we adding\", if it's about analysing [...] it's hard to know what SP adds. \n\nWe can't be, we're [...] never gonna be The Times journalism. So, what is good about our content is that we can make it pop, and we can get complicated ideas and make them simple, but it does mean that sometimes we have to miss out  detail, or context, or, you know. [...] The team and I, [...] we talk a lot about what we're going to include, because you've really got a maximum space here. And if you put too much text in, nobody's going to read it anyway, even if you go \"oh, do you know what, it's really important to have all of this\", and you make it a small font size, no-one's going to read it anyway. So that, we struggle with that, I suppose.\n\n Is there anything you'd like to improve in regards to Simple Politics?\n\n I mean, everything. I think everything we can improve. Um...we often aren't doing much work [...] 'cause we're just us, we don't do much work at the weekend when some stories come out. I think that we could certainly do better at working out when not to post, 'cause we're nerds, and we often think \"oh, this is really exciting\", but actually it's not. So we could work out when not to post more, we can work out the optimum amount of time-time we can adverti-I mean we only advertise our own stuff, we don't just take any money from anywhere else, um...but when can we advertise without annoying people, but so we still sell things, and we also ask for donations, that's-it's really hard to get that line right, so you're not ignoring people.\n\n What do you think is in the future for [Simple Politics]?\n\n Well the future is . Next year, we have a , and [...] we've never had a general election in SP's time where we've had so much of a following. And I feel the [...] responsibility, I suppose, I feel the responsibility of-of that election quite strongly, how we can be truly impartial, how we can help people have better election conversations, and whether that's going round the country talking to people, whether that's doing shows, whether that's doing videos, whether that-I mean, we need to really start thinking from the ground up [...], um...what can we do to help people look at policy and understand why people disagree with each other, why some-one policy is better, all-all that stuff. [...] That's where we go, and after the election, the May after the election, SP will have been together, I'd have been doing it for ten years, so I don't know, I need to think about the future after that, what, what, what. But for now, it's all about the election next year.

The organisation cited the \"convenient location close to Wolverhampton's shopping district\" as a reason to keep that stop operational. The stop was to close until \"later this autumn\" for work, according to a press release from the West Midlands Metro.\n\nThe extension was originally to be finished in 2019, but faced delays. \n\nThe Metro said its service's extension to  was now a focus.\n\n How do you think this extension will impact the people who live [along] the Metro?\n\n I think it makes the tram a more attractive option as there is now better  integration of public transport. The  was previously closest to Wolverhampton's train station but now the tram serves the station directly, so anyone living or working near the tram route now has a greater incentive to tram in rather than [ride] the bus if their onward journey includes .\n\n There's currently the tram extension underway from  to Brierley Hill, do you expect that that will have a big impact too?\n\n Probably in absolute terms it will significantly contribute to the local economy, but I think proportionally not so much.  already has good bus links to Wolverhampton and Birmingham, the tram line will not take a direct route to either of the big cities as it must pass through Wednesbury. One benefit of the tram is decreased impact of traffic, but the tram is much more expensive than the bus so I don't know how it will affect intra- journeys.\n\n Do you think the fare price of the system is something the council should be mindful of?\n\n Absolutely. Better  is essential! Today I paid 5.00 for an all-zone  day ticket on the tram only. On the train it costs between £5.20 and £6.90 for a return (or between £3.40 and £4.55 with a ) and takes approximately ⅓ of the time. As you can see, for Birmingham ↔ Wolverhampton journeys there is little incentive to take the tram. The main target market of the tram, though, is to serve communities between Wolverhampton and Birmingham such as  and . An all-day bus pass costs £4.00 (or £2.00 for a single) so one would have to have a good reason to take the tram as it is more expensive than the bus at £4.10 for, [in] any two zones, [a] day ticket or £4.60 for any three zones. Better fare integration, such as a London-style  would work better... this is what the  should be used for. Today I opted to buy just an all-day ticket on the tram, and I chose to walk seven miles to and from the tram stop as I didn't want to pay the extra money for a bus fare. Better integration might have meant I chose to spend a little more for the added convenience of a hop-on, hop-off network.\n\n I see! Thank you for sharing your opinion. Is there anything you think  [Transport for West Midlands] could be doing better more generally?\n\n I think they're doing a good enough job, although to be honest I'm not very familiar with them as a company as I mainly use the train or the bus which is not fully under their jurisdiction.
