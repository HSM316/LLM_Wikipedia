The president had previously called it \"a matter of public health\".\n\n\"[W]ithin the next 10 days, I will present a bill for the voluntary interruption of pregnancy that legalises abortion at the initial time of pregnancy and allows women to access the health system when they make the decision to abort\", Fernández said.  Thousands of people had gathered outside the National Congress with slogans supporting the legalisation of abortion of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion of pregnancy is currently illegal in the Catholic-majority country, and is permitted only in two cases: if the pregnancy was a product of rape, or if it poses a risk to the woman.  Fernández said the law has \"condemned many women, generally of limited resources, to resort to abortive practices in absolute secrecy, putting their health and sometimes their lives at risk\".\n\nEstimates by the Argentinian government state about 350 thousand illegal abortions are carried out in the country each year.  Illegal abortion is a crime punishable with a prison term in the Latin American country since 1921.  Saying , President Fernández elaborated, \"A state that is present must protect citizens in general and obviously women in particular.  \".\n\nFollowing the president's announcements, the director of Argentina's Amnesty International, Mariela Belski, said the president had \"heard the demands of women, adolescents and girls\".\n\nThe proceedings of the abortion rights was criticised by  Monsenor Jorge Eduardo Scheinig.  Calling it a \"culture of death\" the archbishop said \"We need to pray so that in Argentina, the yes to life is stronger than death.\"\n\nUruguay, Guyana and Cuba are the other Latin American countries where abortion during the early weeks of pregnancy is legal.  Back in 2018, the Argentine congress approved a bill legalising abortion, but it was dismissed by the senate.\n\npt:Projeto de lei que legaliza o aborto será enviado ao Congresso Nacional da Argentina", "question": "What was the purpose of the bill announced by President Fernández of Argentina?  \n\nA) To ban all forms of abortion in the country  \nB) To legalize abortion at the initial time of pregnancy  \nC) To restrict abortion to cases of rape only  \nD) To increase penalties for illegal abortion"}

Reportedly he injured a man and two women on , London. Armed plainclothes officers, already surveilling him for counter-terrorism purposes, chased him on foot. The officers eventually shot him dead, reportedly outside a  store, at around 14:00 local time in what the police declared a \"terrorist-related\" attack.\n\nAn eyewitness described for news agency  how the attack unfolded, stating, \"I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer [...] The man was then shot. I think I heard three gunshots but I can't quite remember.\"\n\nTwo women and a man were injured, according to the reports. The man was briefly listed in critical condition. A woman had minor injuries reportedly from glass shattering after police discharged their firearms, and the remaining woman was in \"not life-threatening\" condition.\n\nThe attacker, identified as Sudesh Amman, 20, was placed under police surveillance after being released from prison a week ago. He was imprisoned in 2018 when he was 18 and served half his sentence for 13 separate terror offenses. Amman, who was described as \"knife-obsessed\" by the police, sent his girlfriend videos of beheadings and extremist text messages, and advised her to kill her \"\" (non-Muslim) parents. He told her on one occasion: \"If you can't make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, , sound bombs or a car at night and attack the tourists (crusaders), police and soldiers of  [idolatry], or western embassies in every country you are in this planet.\"\n\nAlexis Boon, the head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, said about Amman: \"His fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his 'life goals' in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to 'Jannah' — the afterlife. It's not clear how Amman became radicalised but it is apparent from his messages that it had been at least a year in development. Whatever the circumstances, this case is a reminder of the need to be vigilant to signs of radicalisation and report it.\"\n\nPolice also recovered a bomb-making guidebook in his position and, on investigation in his family home in London, a black flag and an air gun.\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, thanked \"the police, security and emergency services staff for their swift and courageous response\".\n\n\"Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life,\" said Khan, \"here in London we will never let them succeed.\"\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, tweeted: \"Thank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related.

So combining everybody, it was around fifteen people.\n\n How rare is it to have all-women crew running the train?\n\n Yeah, it is really rare.  Actually, we are in a process of a ten-day campaign for International Women's Day and we have lined up one activity each day.  So this initiative was a part of that campaign.\n\n  Was it the first time an all-women crew ran the train in the Southern Western Railway?\n\n  No, not really.  It has been done in other divisions as well.  Mysore, maybe the first time.\n\n Has it ever happened before in any other regional divisions which you are aware of?\n\n I think in Bangalore they did a little bit.  Whether it was all-women, but they did run a train.  And all-India basis also they have done.\n\n Could you please tell us more about this feat, and when was this planned?\n\n As I told you, that we have a ten-day campaign running for International Women's Day, the theme of which is \"Each for Equal\".  And \"Each for Equal\" is basically each of us can contribute in creating a gender-equal world.  Each area they [women] are working, it is not getting highlighted at all.  There are basically male-dominated areas where earlier women were not coming.  But nowadays, we see in large number, the women come.  And in railways, these are [rare] works: loco pilot, working as a keyman; keyman means basically it is designation \"keyman\" but when woman works, it could be keywoman: they have to patrol on the tracks.  So there are these people who are working so hard, [?] checking the trains completely.  So that is why we decided to give it publicity and make it an all-women crew.\n\n Was this event planned by the Southern Western Railway, or was it an Indian Railways initiative?\n\n This was an initiative of Mysore Division.  Mysore Division is a part of South Western Railway.\n\n What has the Indian Railways planned for this International Women's Day?\n\n They have given a theme of different things to be done.  The campaign theme, as I told you, \"Each for Equal\", which can significantly and collectively, each one of us can help create a gender-equal world.\n\nAnd from 1st of March to 10th of March we have to celebrate, then we have to organise some talks, lectures; then, basically, anything which comes in the public purview to highlight the steps taken by Indian Railways for the empowerment of women, enhancing the role of women in all fields.  And [...] basically take steps for the female staff of our division.  Social media posts we have to do of whatever we are doing [for the celebration].  Women-specific videos, we have to add.\n\nWhat we are doing in Mysore division, we did a couple of activities: [...] we had a medical check-up, specifically screening for cervical cancer.  Not only for the staff working in the office, but also for the contract staff.  The cleaning staff which you see on the station, they are not permanent employees.  And they don't have access to good health.  There are a lot of ladies working there.  Today, I took a lot of ladies who were working in the division office as well as our field for a trek to .  So we went [in the] morning there.  And tomorrow we have some event planned.\n\n Could you please tell us about this year's theme, the celebration of Women's Day, and how is it different from last year's?\n\n Last year, it was basically focused on the particular day, 8th [March] alone.  The idea of spreading it over ten days is very significant.\n\n What are the activities planned in this phase?\n\n Basically our aim is to encourage lot of participation by women employees in different activities other than their office work, so they get a break.  This is for our own employees.  Promote them.  Encourage them.  Create awareness about their own talent.  Like, within the office, we organised \"pick-and-speak\" or some things like that and a lot of such events, where we found that even our Group D staff are so talented, some of them.  So basically giving them a break from their routine.  That was one for our female employees.  And we are trying to take care of the staff that are working at the station as well as to the women passengers providing enhanced security.\n\n Would you call this event a success?\n\n Yeah, so far, yes.\n\n What are the challenges faced by women working for Indian Railways?\n\n Challenges, I would say, are the same as you find in the society.  For a women to achieve something, is not as easy as it is for a man.  They have to put double the effort, and the recognition comes very late.  And then women are multi-tasking everywhere.  So a lady who comes to work in the office: first sees her house and then she comes [to work] and then again she goes back and she does [household work].  So she is much more pressure, and I find them very sincere.  Despite all the pressure, I find them extremely sincere and dedicated.\n\n What are the possible remedies to these issues?\n\n Issues are basically: celebration of Women's Day and all these events, they do bring women in focus.  But what is required at large is a change in the society and the mindset, which should begin in each house.  And if we have boys in the house and we have male colleagues, we have to sensitise them more.  And so that, once we have the support of these people and their mindset changes, and that is how we can influence the collective consciousness.\n\n What is the gender-distribution ratio at the Mysore Division branch?\n\n Mysore Division, we have ten percent only women employees.  Out of a total of, say, 6900 [employees], we have around 650.  So that is around ten percent.\n\n Are you happy with this number?\n\n Yeah, it is okay.  See, the idea is: each according to their choice.  The people who have chosen [to work here] have gotten.  I personally don't believe in this too much of gender-bias.  They are all individuals.\n\n Has this number been improving in the past years?\n\n It has improved.  It has improved, it was around seven or eight percent, over the two years it has increased.  More number of women getting into technical fields has been a big change.  Earlier it wasn't coming.  You would find in office staff, okay, which is a ministerial cadre.  But now, getting women employees in loco pilot category, in station masters, as guards, as pointswoman: they are all working [on] track, as carriage and wagon helpers.  So yes, there has been a change.\n\n[Women] loco pilots are coming in a big wave.  And it is not a very difficult job.  The duty hours is eight-hours.  So once they cover eight hours, they change.  So it is not that in some remote areas they have to drive.  No.  Eight hours, their shift changes.  So if a loco pilot starts from here, maybe at  or some place, they will change.  So we have something called running rooms, where the have all the facilities.  So they deboard there, and after taking due rest, they take a train back to their home place.  So yes, ladies are coming in a big wave.\n\n What are the steps Indian Railways is taking for improving this number?\n\n There is not [gender-based] reservation per-se, [from] what I know, but Indian [Railways] has been very open about it.  Now you see DRM's, I am sitting here.  There was a time when the number of ladies who'd become DRM was very less.  So now, we have around 60 division, maybe eight are women.  So the numbers: everywhere it is going up.  It has been very positive about it.\n\n Can you brief me your role as Mysore Divisional Railway Manager?\n\n As Divisional Railway Manager, I am in charge of all the operations, all the train running, and my division is around 1300 route .  It extends from .  It goes right up to, just short of  up to .  And on the other side, next to .  It starts and then goes up to  this side.  Including  and some more branch lines are there which goes up to  and goes up to .  So this is my jurisdiction.  I have a set of 30 officers with me.  A lot of supervisors and other staff.  Total staff, I told you, is around 6900 for Mysore division.  And controlling everyday basically taking the team along, taking decisions, small-small decisions which help in running of the train, carrying out all the initiatives and directions of the ministry is my job.\n\n For how long have you been working here as the Mysore Division Railway Manager?\n\n I will be completing my two years' tenure in April.\n\n Can you please brief me about your career highlights so far?\n\n My career highlights have been opting for civil services at a very young age, in my first attempt was [the] first important step in my career.  Otherwise in my student days there were many things that I did.  I was a student leader.  I had other achievements.  But coming to the career, and thereafter, I [had] initially joined .  But then came down to South, and I worked in different capacities.  Then, after a few years into the service, I was selected for the Chevening Fellowship in [the] UK, where I did my advanced masters and postgraduate in .  That was a big achievement because very few years into service having been selected for that: it was a completely scholarship programme, I did not have to pay for it.  So that was a big achievement.  Then, while I was posted in the construction wing, making a software programme for: making means piloting a  system [which was] Oracle-based for project management.  It was integrated with  personal management system as well as store's .  So piloting that completely, that I would call it as a big highlight.  And then getting posted as a Divisional Railway Manager: there were a lot of challenges.  Challenge was: the railway station which you see, it was a big project.  Working station, improving that, improving the circulating area and then retaining the heritage, and enhancing it faced a lot of flak and opposition also.  Because when we do the work, everything looks like in the stage of construction.  So you get all type[s] of things.  And then still continuing to do; and I have taken a few more challenging works in the division.  One is adjacent to our sports ground, there is [an] area which is not very clean.  So I have decided to clean it up and make it an ecospace.  That project we are working on.  The railway museum, which is a must-visit for people, and it's been a 40 years old museum.  [In 19]79-80 it was established in a small area.  After that, it has not been taken care of so much that the condition was not good.  And this was a sanctioned project ten years back.  But work had not happened.  It was very very challenging what we have done.  And we are soon going to open it on 14th.  [...] Even Mysore Yard remodelling.  We were not able to push our trains from all the platforms towards -side.  And we were not able to simultaneously receive train from Hassan-side and SBC ()-side.  If a train from Bangalore-side is coming, that would stop.  So there were a lot of yard changes which had to be done.  Including our interlocking software.  This was also very challenging which required a year of planning.  We did this successfully.  So like this, there were small-small works which were all pending, and which were not done.  So we have done a very comprehensive work.  But credit will go to the team also.\n\n How is South West Railway and Mysore Division taking precaution against the spread of coronavirus?\n\n My CMD [Chief Health Director], I have been talking to her everyday.  We have an isolation ward in the hospital but at the station, I think, we are playing a clip about the precautions to be taken.  If we come to know, we should take more cautions.  Basically the citizens have travelled to these places: like China, South Korea and people from the far East have been coming.  So we should announce and we should isolate them.  We are yet to put a segregated space in station.  That we have not done.  But I think, announcements and all we are doing.  And if I come to know here, masks and all: we are distributing.  And more important is here, the staff who is dealing with the public on a daily basis like out ticket collectors and guards and all, they have been given masks.\n\n Thank you very much.  That would be all the questions I had for you.\n\n \n\n ", "question": "What is the theme of the ten-day campaign organized by Indian Railways for International Women's Day 2023? \n\nA) Women in Leadership  \nB) Each for Equal  \nC) Empowering Gender Diversity  \nD) Bridging the Gender Gap"}

He also noted that the  rejected the demarcation, and that Greece and Turkey might end up before  in the Hague if talks would fail. Mitsotakis underlined they keep channels to Turkey open for dialog and that he would be \"very-very happy if Turkey were to reconsider its overall approach\".\n\nLater on Tuesday Mitsotakis met with the International Monetary Fund, then with President Trump, where he denounced the border agreement again. In regard of clashing  claims, he noted \"it is important to point out that the agreement signed between Turkey and Libya infringe upon Greece’s sovereign rights\". \n\nOn last Thursday, the delegations of Cyprus, Greece and Israel had met for their seventh trilateral summit, that time in Athens at the , to sign an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting was attended by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and energy minister , Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and energy minister , and Cypriot president  and energy minister Georgios Lakkotrypis. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers.  Greek daily  said Greece and Cyprus had to speed up to counter possible Turkish interference with the project.\n\nEarlier that day, the Greek gas producer  signed a letter of intent on selling two billion cubic meters of gas per year to the Greek gas supplier . The planned pipeline capacity is 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has committed 1.7 billion dollars in the Karish and Tanin fields.\n\nWith this forming of political and economic alliance with Hellenic countries, Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline to end their \"fringe country\" status.

The United States expressed its support via the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill, a July 25 quadrilateral meeting in Washington, and sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the trilateral meeting of EastMed countries on March 20 last year.

The federation announced their decision although Dorsa Derakhshani had previously decided and informed the chess federation she did not wish to play for Iran.\n\nDorsa Derakhshani is currently 21 years old and holds the  (IM) as well as  (WGM) titles.  Her brother, Borna, plays for the  and holds the  title.\n\nDorsa Derakhshani was banned since she did not wear a hijab, an Islamic headscarf, while competing at the  in January 2017.  Under the laws of Islamic Republic of Iran, hijab is a mandatory dress code.  Her brother Borna Deraskhsani was banned for playing against Israeli  (GM)  at the same tournament.  Iran does not recognise the existence of Israel, and previously, Irani athletes have avoided playing against Israeli athletes.\n\nMehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, the president of the country's chess federation, explained the decision to ban the players saying,   He further stated, \n\nIM Dorsa Derakhshani, who currently studies at  in the United States and plays for the , discussed her chess career, time in Iran and the 2017 controversy, and her life in Saint Louis with a Wikinews correspondent.\n\nIM Dorsa Derakhshani grew up in Tehran, and she had learned to read and write at a very young age because her parents were \"persistent\" about her education.  She remarked lack of chess tournaments in a country where \"women are seen as second-class citizens\" was one of the challenges she'd faced living in Iran.\n\n Could you please tell us something about yourself?\n\n I'm a professional chess player and right now I'm a  student at Saint Louis University.\n\n What interested you in chess and who taught you this game?\n\n I got interested in chess because of my dad.  He used to play in high school before the .  But since after the revolution chess was banned for about ten years.  So he couldn't play in public, so he would just play in the house and I remember he used to play with my mom.  And, yeah, that's how I learned chess.\n\n What do your parents do?\n\n My dad is a doctor, he is a pædiatrist and family medicine.  My mom is a psychiatrist.\n\n How was your childhood like?\n\n I was the first child, so they, my parents put a lot of effort into teaching me a lot of different skills.  So, for example, my parents really wanted me to start writing and solving puzzles as soon as possible.  So when I was two-and-a-half, I finished first grade.  I could do maths and read the books and write.  And they kept going.  So when I was a little over four, I finished fourth grade.  And so they wanted me to start fifth grade when I was five but the government didn't really have any protocols for this so they didn't allow me to skip classes.  And so my parents tried to fill my time with other activities such as , painting, music, swimming, and eventually chess.  And chess was the one thing that I [jumped for consistently] because I really liked puzzle-solving and I really liked the winning, the competition.\n\n How did you train as a kid?\n\n I always wanted to be the best at everything I was doing, and chess had the clear category of what I was best at.  And I really liked that.  Because for example in ballet or in painting, I was good, but, I wasn't sure what I was good at, just, was I good just for a kid my age, was I good just for the class I was in.  And in chess, one of the first tournaments that I played, I won the Girl's Under-8 National Championship.  So I knew clearly, I felt like clearly I was best at that.  And, yeah, I was very ambitious and competitive, I don't know why.\n\n When did you realise you were a serious talent?\n\n  My middle and my high school, I went to the organisation which is called  .  It's an acronym for, hold on, let me look that up.  It's called the National Organization for Extraordinary something.  I will look that up in just a second.  So I knew that I had the ambition and I had the brain because I used to be a TV host when I was a kid and it was always very easy for me.  It wasn't very stressful.  I didn't have to do too many preparation because of the confidence that my parents gave me.  Ah, the name of the school that I went to, on Wikipedia, it's National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents.  So we had to do an exam, somewhat like an , in fifth grade.  And we would get into these schools and it was very hard to balance school and chess.  And that's around the time that I stopped playing music and I stopped giving concerts and just started to focus on school and chess.\n\n Who inspires you in chess?\n\n I really liked the three sisters of Polgár, 'specially .  Just because she kept on going and she didn't just want to be the best female chess player.  She was in top 10.  She was one of the first to break the barriers of gender, especially in chess society.  So yeah, she would be.\n\n Tell me about your most memorable tournament.\n\n She [Judit Polgár] played so many.  She hasn't been playing much in [the] past few years because she is focused on family, which I also respect a lot because I am a big family-person myself, so I completely understand that.  Her most memorable, it's really hard to pick.  She played so many high class tournaments.\n\n I meant your most memorable.\n\n Oh.  My.  I want to go with my first time, the first tournament that I won.  The Iranian National Championship for girls Under-8.  Because that was one of the changing moments and I remember I wore like a princess dress and a  because it felt like a very powerful time for me.\n\n What is your favourite game?  Could be yours, or could be someone else's.\n\n Favourite game.  Um, I play a lot of online chess and lot of good positions and good tactics happens there but I don't really know the name of the opponents.\n\n Tell me about the challenges you had faced as a chess prodigy living in Iran.\n\n Well one of the big challenges was that there weren't enough tournaments.  Because in Iran, women are seen as second-class citizens,  so, I wasn't allowed, and women weren't allowed to play, in open tournaments.  And there weren't enough women chess players to organise a big event.  And so when I was growing up and I was eight, we started — my parents started to request that okay, she is a good child, she should be able to play in male-based tournaments, basically.  And they weren't even female tournaments, they were just tournaments.  And so when I was eight, and when I was ten, they allowed the children, like the girl childs to play, which was kind of awkward.  And then they came up with more flexible rules, like if you are in the national team, you can play whatever tournament you want, if you win your category.  But still.  It was very .\n\n You mentioned you were a TV anchor as a kid.  Tell us more about that.\n\n Oh, so, one day I was singing and dancing in a mall, just, I don't know why, I liked that, when I was two.  And a TV producer saw me and really liked my confidence.  So they gave me the opportunity to co-host a TV show for kids.  And to try [to] inspire and motivate them to read and write to do other activities.  And I did that up until I was six years old, a little over two months and I was six.  And I quit because they wanted me to change the way I was dressing and start wearing hijab and start not wearing dresses and stuff.  And I thought that was stupid.  So I didn't go anymore and my parents fully supported my decision to stop the co-hosting.\n\n You also learned to read at a very young age.\n\n Yep.  Yeah that was all due to my parents.  They were very persistent with my education.\n\n How was your personality like, in your childhood?\n\n Oh, my mom sometimes makes fun that I was like a child robot, that I was always saying what I was thinking.  And I was always very confident and just talking and trying to, I quote, she said, \"boss people around\" — as a two-year-old, which was kind of adorable. [laughs]  But I was always very competitive and, yeah: that was something that my parents gave me.  My parents [... to] have that potential to want to inspire other people.\n\nHaving won multiple tournaments as a kid, IM Dorsa Derakhshani decided not to play for the Iranian Chess Federation saying \"it wasn't a good fit\" for her.\n\n Early in your life you had decided you didn't want to play for Iran.\n\n Yep.  I made that decision around [...] two-thousand, so 2011, 12, 13, 14 were the years that I won Asia National Championships and Youth National Championships.  And I just didn't really fit with any of the teammates or any of the people from my federation.  And they all expected so much time and energy to try and, for the lack of better words, kiss their asses.  I just don't have a better word to put there.  And so I refused to do that because I was busy with school and busy with chess, and I refused to go there and sit and have weekly meetings about I don't even know what, not chess-related.  So it wasn't a good fit for me.\n\n And I was looking for immigration even before that because most of my family lives outside of Iran.  Not my immediate family but my aunts and cousins from both of my parents' sides.  So we were looking for immigration from early on, but I wanted to see if I could grow as a chess player within chess in Iranian Chess Federation but, when I was sure that it was not a good fit, is when I started to look for another federation and decided not to play for Iran anymore.  And the last time I officially played for Iran in an official tournament was 2015.  And in 2016, I immigrated to Spain to see if that federation and country would be a good fit for to live in and play chess for.  But when I was trying to make a decision if I should transfer my federation to Spain or stay with Iran, I received scholarship offers from US colleges and I decided to immigrate here and play for US federation.\n\n If Iran did not impose the compulsory observation of the headscarf, would you have, in that case, chosen to play for Iran?\n\n I don't think it was about the headscarf because that's just a piece of clothing.  I mean, every job has a dress-code.  So it wasn't just about the headscarf, it was more about the way the society viewed women and how hard I as a woman had to fight.  I had to work like ten times harder than a man just to be seen as half as good as him, while I understood more and it should have been different.  It should — I mean the women face inequality in so many places but I decided instead of fighting in a country where I wouldn't have enough voice, I would immigrate to another country where I would have a better voice and a better future.\n\n Back then, did your younger brother Borna also decide not to play for Iran?\n\n He also wanted to immigrate, but he wanted to see which country.  He wasn't sure — Because my family still do have a pending immigration case to come to the US.  So he wasn't sure if he would want to wait until after immigration to start playing for the US, or he would want to play for a European Federation.  But since he is going to boarding school in UK, he switched his federation very quickly.\n\n When did you inform the Iranian Chess Federation about your decision?\n\n Early 2016.  Because they wanted me to play different tournaments for them, team tournaments.  Because I would be their solid second board because I was Women Grand Master and then International Master in 2016.  So they wanted me to represent their country.  And I flat completely refused and I said that I'm in Spain and I'm working to transfer federations and I don't want to play for Iran anymore.  So I was in, for example, in 2016 [chess] Olympiad in , I refused to play for Iran National Team and I chose to work as press for the French Chess websites.  And I was there.  I just didn't play for the team.  I went there on my own and I met with my family.\n\n So how long did you represent Iran at the chess tournaments?\n\n Well, I stopped representing them in 2015.  And, well, I did play in an international tournament in 2006.  So I played World Youths in 2006, so I would say nine years?  Less that ten years, yeah.\n\n Had the federation ever warned you to cover your hair?\n\n Well, I quote, they said \"Even if you are not wearing the headscarf, like on your head, at least have it around your neck\", and I just thought that was extremely stupid because they [the Iranian Chess Federation] wanted this to cover their asses.  So if there was a picture, they would say, \"Oh, it [the head covering] just fell\".  And it was like, if I don't believe in something, why would I bother faking it?  And that whole idea of, like, \"put the scarf around your neck and if somebody sees, just, like, put it up, put it down\".  That was extremely stupid.  But that's something that other female chess players in the team have been doing for years.  And most of them have already immigrated out of Iran anyways.\n\n Were there any other regulations [Iranian] female chess players had to adhere to?\n\n Oh yeah, well the classic \"no parties\", \"no alcohol\", \"no contact with men\", blah blah blah, which we all broke anyways, but.\n\n After deciding you won't play for Iran, what did you do?\n\n I, in 2015 I was trying to figure out which federation to go, which country to represent.  Switzerland was one of my choices.  But it [fell] through just because — it was very complicated.  I did want to represent the country of Switzerland, and they did want me to represent them.  So I would be their highest female [rated player].  I would be their board one.  But it was really hard to fit a good educational system for me and I didn't speak other languages besides English and I needed to be able to speak German or French or something else in Switzerland to be able to live and that was a big problem for me.  So I ended up moving to Spain and seeing if that would be the country I would keep living in and I only lived there for a year before I decided to move to US.\n\n How was your time in  Chess Club?\n\n Very nice.  They were very nice people.  They helped with a lot of things.  They helped me find a place.  They helped me find good tournaments.  They had good tournaments themselves.  I think one of the big tournaments didn't happen last year, but hopefully it will happen this year.  Yeah, it was a very growing chess club.\n\n After immigrating to the US, have you been to Spain again?\n\n No I haven't had the chance because mainly I am very busy with studying because I am pre-med student and the other problem was that I didn't have my  at the time.  I got my green card last summer.  And I went to South America for a tournament: Panama.  I also went to Munich for the  talk last summer, and no I haven't been to Spain.\n\n Tell me about your success at the Iranian National Youth under-8 tournament.\n\n I don't really remember much from the games.  But I do remember I scored eight wins and one loss.  And that's how I won the tournament.  I didn't really have a coach while the other girls did.  And I don't really remember anything else besides the closing ceremony and how much I scored.\n\n Tell us about your participation in the Asian Junior Championships.\n\n That's actually around the time I started to think of chess as more possible career.  So the first, 2011, was in Philippines.  I got the first runner-up.  Second one was 2012 in Sri Lanka, I believe.  Yeah.  And I won that one.  The third one was in Iran.  Yeah, in 2013.  I won that.  '14 was in India: New Delhi.  After I won that, I just didn't play in the Asian Championship in 2015 anymore, just because I kind of won it a few times already.\n\n Were you supposed to observe the regulations of Iranian Chess Federation at the Asian Junior Championships as well?\n\n Yeah, because those were the years that I was trying to figure out if this lifestyle is for me or not.  So, yeah.\n\n What are some of your career highlights?\n\n One of the big things that I actually realised yesterday when I was reading another article was: in 2016, I got my FIDE trainer title.  And even to this date, I am the youngest FIDE trainer in the world which is kind of cool, because that was like four years, almost four years ago.  I received the titles of Woman Grand Master and International Master in 2016.  2016 was a big year.  And I won so many [...] prizes in international tournaments.  I played for different leagues, European Leagues, such as Switzerland, Belgium, Spain.  And I am a part of the British League.  I just don't really think it is safe to travel right now, otherwise I would be playing for tournaments.  Ah, let's see, I did play in  2018 and I will be playing in US [Chess] Championship this year, but it has been postponed because of the [COVID-19] pandemic.  But I am supposed to play in it when we know the dates, anyways.  I think those are some of the ones that I run over just right now.\n\n What is your strategy while playing against players rated 2500+ points?\n\n It really depends on the colour and the preparation that I do.  But I usually just try to play solid and wait for opponent's mistakes while trying to put my pieces in the best places possible.  So that's something that I do regardless of who I'm playing.  But the opening preparations might change depending on the opponent's rating.\n\n How has your strategy and game improved over the years?\n\n Well, my  is really improved when I started to read 's books.  And, those really helped.  But I still have a long way to go to feel completely confident in my endgame skills.\n\n What is the opening you prefer?\n\n I really do like to play against .  Just I've always had a pleasant position and I just have so much space and it really fits with my style.  So yeah, I really like to play against French Defence.\n\n And which chess opening you really don't like?\n\n When I am black and they play something like  against me because it is such a boring and without-any-soul position.  I can't really get that creative and everything is just, well sitting and waiting, basically.\n\n Who is the toughest opponent you ever faced?\n\n It's kind of hard to say, let me keep thinking for a little.  I played the Muzychuk sisters  and  in a  tournament in late 2016.  They were, I think they were one of the toughest ones.\n\n Do you prefer over-the-board games or ?\n\n A mix of both.\n\n Which  do you prefer?\n\n Standard.\n\n How do you prepare for a tournament?\n\n   It kind of depends.  Because sometimes the tournament is really, the one thing I try to do is to match my time.  So for example, US Championship is going to be held everyday at 1 pm sharp, so I try to do lot of trainings at 1 pm.  Just because I want my brain to be prepared for that 1 pm chess-time instead of 1 pm nap-time.  So I think that's one of the big things that I always try to do.  If I have an important tournament and if I have the chance on the time to prepare for some of the physical and mental habits like this, I try to always do those.  I also try to find a coach that I am comfortable with, and who has enough time for me, and just figure out my issues and try to fix them.  Like if there is an opening issue, endgame issue, just something that I am missing about how to be better in chess.\n\n What do you think of the prevalence of ?\n\n They're good but I think it's kind of also disturbing to some extent because when you are analysing a line, you don't use your own brain as much anymore and you just rely on the computer's brain.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing but it just kind of takes away the beauty of putting your brain to work.\n\n What do you think is the future of chess?\n\n It's kind of hard to say.  I'm hoping that — I have a lot of different suggestions from different Grand Masters and Women Grand Masters about the fact that in FIDE's rules there is a difference between woman title and open titles and not everybody is a big fan of that.  And we were having a discussion just in the kitchen at the Saint Louis Chess Club with the other Grand Masters about the pros and cons and they were saying that, as pros, some of the women in developing countries when they achieve the titles, that is like a really huge deal for them even though it is a woman title and it doesn't make sense to call something like a Woman Title and another Open Title.  So there are a lot of controversies going around, so that as a pro that these women are being helped because they achieved the title.  And another con is that, well, this doesn't feel right.  It seems you are telling women that you are only good enough for women titles and that's — it's really wrong because it creates the ideas that men think better, men make better decisions, blah blah blah.  I talked a lot in my TEDx talk last summer, that that's not true and this is just something that we have been told by society and by history.  And that is something we should work to change but I hope that chess society will be able to come up with better ideas 'cause if I had an idea about what to do about chess society, I would find the right person to pitch it to, I just don't, right now.  But I know there is a problem, I just don't have a solution for it.\n\n Which current players influence you the most?\n\n I am a big fan of both  and  because there are both really great chess players.  And Fabiano Caruana, he does live in Saint Louis, so I know him more than I know Magnus Carlsen.  And their personalities: like how different their personalities are and again, and at the same time, how they both are number 1 and 2 in chess and they're both the best players of this generation.  That's something really interesting to me: not just their game, but how they think, and how they behave and, yeah.  I tend to analyse people which gets me in trouble sometimes. [laughs]\n\n Who is your favourite opponent?\n\n My favourite opponent?  My brother.\n\n How is he doing by the way?\n\n He is good.  He helped me install an anti-virus on my laptop yesterday, so, kudos for that!\n\n He is in England right now, right?\n\n Yes.\n\n Okay, tell me about the Gibraltar Chess Tournament.\n\n It was a really good tournament.  I played very well.  There was just one game where I could have played better.  But I had very good results.  I was drawing higher-rated Grand Masters and I was winning the lower-rated opponents, and I had a very nice tournament.  It was a very high-class tournament and the organisers were super nice.  And I was there with my mom and my brother, which made it even more nice.  What else?  I just really liked the atmosphere.  I would like to go back and play again when I get some chance, but unfortunately, it's been during my exam every single year so far.  But yeah, it went very smoothly.  I played very well, I really liked it.  It was just really great.\n\n Were you satisfied with your performance in the tournament?\n\n I feel like I could have done a little bit better, but yeah, overall I was, I played very well, and I really liked it.\n\n But it appears [as if] more happened in the media outside the tournament\n\n Oh yeah.  Yeah, well, that's been kind of... interesting.  Well, it wasn't right after that.  It was, I played another tournament in Portugal right after, which I got sick during and I couldn't really play to my best.  But I did get the best woman, anyways.  Anyways, after that, I went for a vacation for about a week.  And after that I went to play in tournaments in Austria right after.  And that's when, I remember I didn't have Internet connection for a few hours because I was in a train ride from [...] I don't remember, a city in Germany to Austria.  And during that time, during that hours I was offline, the whole hell broke lose.  Well, yeah it did.  And my phone started to blow up when I got Internet connection again.  Just with  followers and my friends messaging me where am I, if I were in Iran, if I am in Iran I should get out, and I was like, I am not in Iran, I haven't been back in Iran since I moved out in 2016 to live in Spain.  But okay, I am not there and I start to follow news.  And the next morning, my mom and my brother got to the hotel that we were staying at.  And I explained to them what was going on and we were all extremely shocked.  Because it's the timing of it, was extremely suspicious.  Because the tournament [Gibraltar] happened weeks before and I was a resident of another country for more than six months.  So the timing of it was extremely suspicious because the  was happening in Iran at that time, and all of the Iranian female players who were playing in that tournament got eliminated and the Federation was under huge scrutiny from the Iranian government and the people.  And they were like, \"Well, if you don't have good enough players to actually win this thing, why did you host it and why did you make us spend so much money on it?\"  And because a lot of the best women chess players in the world refused to play in that tournament because of their values.  And they didn't want to go to a country where they are required to have a certain dress code and they wanted to be comfortable when they were playing the tournament.  So that was a whole big mess.  And when the story about me broke out that I was not wearing a scarf and I was representing, whatever they were saying, all of the attention shifted to me and my brother instead of the Iranian Chess Federation mistakes in hosting the tournament.\n\n You weren't living in Iran at that time.  You weren't representing Iran.  You had made it very clear you didn't want to play for the federation.  And yet they decide to sensationalise this banning of yours?\n\n Yep.  That's why it was very idiotic and seemed more conspiracy rather than they actually were offended by my actions.  Because they knew I weren't there.  They knew I was living in another country and looking to change federations and I've told them that I won't be representing them in official tournaments any more and the whole thing was very idiotic.  And more like a trying for a distraction rather than being actually offended.  Because if they were actually offended, I would have probably understood that, I guess?  But they weren't, because there was no reason to be offended.  I wasn't in the country, I was a resident of another country and that was very interesting the way they dealt with it.  And the fun fact is that if I was actually in Iran when the news broke, I would most likely still be in jail for I don't know what.  So even if I was the resident of another country, citizen of another country, because the laws in Iran don't really follow much of human rights.  Yeah, most likely I would still be rotting somewhere.  Yeah.\n\n How did you cope with that?\n\n With the fact that I would never go back to the country I was from?  I kind of expected that anyways, because I am against the government and everything it represents.  I don't have enough power to speak up to more authorities and do much.  So I just decided to leave the toxic environment.  And to live in somewhere that I'm respected for my beliefs and my values rather than being told to shut up and just deal with [the world] as it is.  So I didn't like living in Iran because of the Government anyways.  So I was okay with my never going back when I moved out to go live in Spain.  But, yeah, I still miss it.  I still have dreams about my home and a lot of the places in Iran that I went to.  But I accepted that I am never going back.\n\n How did you parents react to this?\n\n My mom is a huge planner.  So she had planned for something to happen because she always likes to have a plan A, B, C, D, be like just continuous — she is a huge planner.  And so she had somewhat prepared for the media scrutiny.  And we decided not to give any interviews, because we didn't know at the time what was going to happen.  My brother hasn't completed his immigration for his boarding school at that time.  He was still working on it.  And they probably realised that, all right, I was living in Spain anyways, so I would just live the life as I had.  And staying focused on finalising my brother's immigration process.  And we all decided to talk to one media at that [time]: .  And I told that I am not ready to talk anything political, I want to be respectful and I want to just tell my side of the story.  And they said they really liked that I agreed to just talk to someone.  But after a few months, I was ready to talk about the political aspects of things.  And I felt that I understood that more.  So I wrote a piece for The New York Times and I talked to more media outlets about this whole thing.\n\n Did the Iranian chess players reach out to support you?\n\n Very very few.  And that was something that I expected to be more.  Because all of my high school friends, actually most of my high school, just the class that I had: they reached out and they have a group chat and they were really supportive, my high school friends.  But from the chess players, I think, Iranian Chess players, very few, maybe not even five or ten reached out to show their support which was very shocking to me.\n\n Your younger brother was also banned by the [Iranian] Chess Federation at the same tournament, playing against an Israeli Grand Master.  He was fourteen.  He was just a kid.\n\n Yeah.  They keep making a big deal about playing against Israel.  But the funny thing is that that tournament was in 2017 but in 2015, we both played against Israel in another tournament and nobody seemed to care, in the old tournament.  I don't understand why they make it such a big deal.  I understand that they don't recognise Israel as a country, which is super idiotic to me but anyways.  And just because they don't recognise it, they want to pretend that it doesn't exist.  So we are not supposed to play with it.  Something like that.  Which just doesn't make any logical sense.\n\n I just feel he shouldn't have been dragged into this [situation].\n\n Yeah.  That's completely true.  He shouldn't have.  Because they just wanted a story and, well, the thing is that the first interviewer who talked to the [Iranian] Chess Federation's president, he questioned about my brother first.  And then put me in as \"And her sister also doesn't wear a scarf\".  But my story became more popular because it was something more relatable to the people outside of chess.  Because just playing with Israel doesn't really make much sense why is a big deal to other, to foreign people rather than not being banned for not wearing scarf.  But yeah, they made a big deal about him first, and then me, in Iran, in the interview that they had.\n\n Do organisers of the chess tournaments take measures not to pair Israeli players against Iranians?\n\n They used to, but, they stopped that since —. Yeah, they used to, and they used to call it \"forbidden pairing\".  But I think in about a year or two ago, when one of the Iranian chess players refused to play [against Israeli player] and when he went back to Iran, he became like a national hero.  He didn't win the tournament.  He didn't really do anything.  He just refused to play against an opponent which is very wrong in any sportsmanship manner, but anyways.  He became a national hero.  He scored a lot of financial and media attention.  He met with like the Iranian Government.  Yeah, it was like, just because he didn't play, he gained so much from it.  And so that's something that the FIDE refused to play by anymore and they, FIDE, made this rule that, yup, you can't play, we are not going to help you with your not playing against the opponent and then going back to your country and scoring all this financial, and attention.\n\n In 2016, in a Swiss Chess tournament at Basel, Iranian Grand Master  refused to play against an [Israeli] player.  Do you remember that?\n\n Yeah, I was there.  I was playing the same tournament.  From what I remember, he faked showing up late.  He showed up few minutes after the time control has already made the opponent win by time and pretended he was late for whatever reason and, blah-blah.  They tend to fake illnesses and get some doctor notes.  And that's what they did, some of the boys did in World Junior Championship.  And, yeah, it's an ugly situation.  Because for the players, it's a lose-lose.  If you don't play, you won't be respected as a chess player in the chess society.  But if you do play, you'd be under huge scrutiny from the country; the government.  So it's a lose-lose.  And that's, from what I understood that was one of the deal breakers for  and that's why one of the reasons that he immigrated and stopped representing Iran as well.\n\n I must say, on  he [Alireza Firouzja] has been terrific.\n\n Yeah!  I have seen him playing a lot of online tournaments and  and he's very cool, I'm very glad for the kid.\n\n Does your family still live in Tehran?\n\n My family, yeah.  They still do.\n\n What are the things you miss the most about living in Tehran?\n\n The food.  I really really really like Persian food and it is kind of really hard to find it here.  And I miss my mother's home-cooked meals rather than restaurants.  And she can't just ship me food.  It would be awesome if she could.  [laughs]  Um, what else?  I really like spending time with family and friends.  Which, right now, everything is just online.  So.  I still do have some connections.  But.\n\n Why did you choose to leave Spain, and what would you have done if you hadn't received the scholarship?\n\n Well, I really knew that I would continue in education, 'cause I didn't want to play chess and not go to university.  I wanted to have an option.  But I didn't want to play chess because I didn't have options.  That is a big thing for me: I wanted to have gone to college and have a degree and see if I want to pursue a career out of chess or to choose chess.  So I wanted to have that choice.  So I was looking into going to universities in US anyways, and before I did my SATs, I talked to two different universities: Saint Louis University [SLU] and  [University of Texas at Tyler].  And they both offered very great scholarships.  And the one factor that I, kind of like made my decision was the summer housing.  Because I wouldn't have anywhere to go and live.  I don't have the luxury of going back to my family for a summer.  And I just hated the idea of every summer having to find a friend and just like being living with someone for three months.  So SLU offered to cover the summer housing and I would be on campus dorms — apartments — and that was the big decisive factor for me.\n\n Did the Iranian Government cause any trouble when you accepted the scholarship or decided to play for the US Chess Federation?\n\n No.  No; well, they didn't really have a say in this switching the federation part, specially because I talked to FIDE.  I emailed FIDE and I informed that I would like to switch federations without Iranian being involved because they already disrespected me enough and I don't want to have to face them and FIDE agreed.  And I simply switched federations first to FIDE, and then from FIDE to US.\n\n Previously you had mentioned, \"no federation is perfect\".  Is there anything that Iranian Chess Federation gets right?\n\n Well, I think you are referring to the interview, that video interview that I had in Baku.  Well, I wasn't ready to talk realistically about the Iranian Federation and I didn't want to be disrespectful because at the time, they hadn't disrespected me.  And I wanted to keep decent relations with them.  And that's why I said \"no federation is perfect\".  I was hoping that someone would read between the lines and see that I am not happy with the federation.\n\n How was the federation in treating their athletes?\n\n Well, not very good.  Most of the student athletes didn't really have financial support or coaches.  So it was just like you were basically on your own.  And there was some help to send people to tournaments but it was no where nearly enough to see who has what potential.\n\n Should elementary schools teach and encourage students to play chess?\n\n Yes, definitely.\n\n And what are some of the advantages in doing that?\n\n One of the biggest things is that you learn to plan.  You learn to strategise.  You learn to think ahead.  And I think that those are some of the basic things you learn from chess.  If you want to win at any game in chess, you need to be able to have confidence to actually  your opponent.  You need to have time management.  And you need to be able to strategise and plan ahead, see what you opponent want to do.\n\n What are some of the chess strategies you have applied in your real life?\n\n Oh, this one I did say in my TEDx talk; I'm gonna use that.  I strategically manuevered and removed myself from the toxic environment of the Iranian Chess Federation and I moved to Spain and then US.  That was good strategic maneuvering.\n\n What is the one thing, other than chess, that you are an expert in?\n\n My cat.  I am very good with animals.\n\n What are the key things you learned living in Iran?\n\n I learned to fight for what I want.  I learned that nothing actually comes easy.  You have to work for it.  And I learned that even though a lot of thing seem like basic human rights and logic, that's not how everybody sees it.  And those are some of the things I have been struggling to deal with here in college, because for most people: they are Americans, and their families are here.  And probably the most horrific thing that's happened to them was maybe they had to put a dog down.  Which is sad.  I understand.  But still, you can't compare that to not seeing your family for years, and not being able to go back to your country.  I feel like I'm like a hundred years older than the kids my age here.\n\n How has the atmosphere changed since moving to the United States?\n\n I have learned, that it is okay to be myself.  I don't have to fake it to please people.  I hate being a people-pleaser.  I am still trying to adjust to how people see the world, because not everybody is always analysing and calculating things the way I am, because that's how I grew up.  And that's how I grew up doing chess.  And that's something I am still adjusting because sometimes it can be too much for my friends.  [laughs]  That I am always trying to see moves ahead of what they're going to do, what's going happen in their lives.  And, yeah, I can understand how that might not be a pleasant thing for my friends.  Because nobody like a smart-ass, so.\n\n How is life at the Saint Louis University?\n\n I have a lot of great friends.  I really enjoy studying with them.  I really enjoy just meeting up with them.  And, I really like it here.\n\n How do you train these days?\n\n Well, everything is online.  So we have been training and playing a lot of online games.\n\n Tell us about your team at the Saint Louis Chess Club.\n\n Well, the chess club is slightly different than Saint Louis University's chess team.  Because the club and the team do collaborate, but the team is slightly different than the club. [...] For the first time last year, we had an all-girls team.  And that was very empowering to me.\n\n Who coaches you there?\n\n Alejandro Ramírez.\n\n Well, how is it to have Alejandro Ramírez as your coach?  How is he in person?\n\n He is very friendly.  I was friends with him before I came to this college.  The year we played a tournament in Denmark, 2014.  And he was always a very nice person and always looking out for his friends.  And yeah, he was always very nice to everybody.\n\n How do your fellow teammates describe you as a person and as a player?\n\n Everybody is quite respectful, but the ideas of gender-inequality do exist.  Mainly because they are not informed enough about the biology and how human biology actually works.  So I did receive questions about my TED talk and to me it seemed like they simply wanted to understand the topic more than criticise it.  So they had questions like \"But by statistics, men drive better, men are better in maths, men are better in chess\".  And I was like, so you are saying that men think better and make better decisions basically.  And, they were like \"I don't know enough about it, but it seems that way\".  And I was like, well, answer this question: If you are dying, if you are bleeding out and they take you to an emergency room and your doctor is a female, would you be like \"No no, I want a male doctor.  Female brain doesn't work as well.\"  Well, you don't say that.  You are glad that the woman is there to fix you.  So if you can trust your life with a woman, why can't you trust a woman do think as good. [...] It is not about the gender who thinks better.  It is about each individual.  And they were very respectful to these topics.\n\n You had applied for the US citizenship.  Has it been approved?\n\n Yeah!  I got my green card last year.\n\n What is your major at the Saint Louis University?\n\n I am double majoring in biology and clinical health sciences.\n\n How do you manage to train and participate in chess tournaments with ongoing academic curriculum?\n\n Well I haven't been able to participate in as many tournaments as I would want, because I have so many exams and different classes.  But I play as much as I can and the teachers are very cooperative.  Because they understand that I am a professional chess player and I need to, I kind of have to play.  It's like if I don't play then it's — well some of the team tournaments that we play also are university sponsored.  Well, most of the tournaments we play are university sponsored, so the teachers do their best to cooperate with that as well.\n\n What is the biggest decision you have made since moving to the US?\n\n Biggest decision.  Wanting to be a surgeon.\n\n Have you participated in the ?  And are you looking forward to participating in them?\n\n I am looking forward to participating in them; I haven't represented any country because I didn't want to represent Iran, previously,  and I did tell you that I was there working as press in 2016, .  But I refused to participate for Iranian Federation.  But I hope that some day I will be able to represent US in Olympiads.\n\n Are there any advantages of playing for any federation?\n\n No.\n\n Apart from the Olympiads, I guess.\n\n Well, here I have better stability and it's more welcoming than Iran would ever be.\n\n Did the Iranian Chess Federation ever support you, back in the days?\n\n Yes.  They did send me to different tournaments.  And they did provide me with some coaching in 2012–13.\n\n How is the US Chess Federation different in that aspect?\n\n Well, right now, I am more supported by the University and the Chess Club rather than the Federation as a whole.  But the US Federation has been always supportive of my decisions to speak up.\n\n How can the problems at Iranian Chess Federation be improved?\n\n I don't think they can until [while] the government is the same, or, shares the same values and is unwilling to do the basic human rights.\n\n Tell me about the time you got the title \"International Master\".  And which title: Female Grand Master or International Master gave you more joy?\n\n So, I have received all of the female titles.  I started from Women Candidate Master, Women FIDE Master, Women International Master, Women Grand Master, and ultimately men International Master.  It was approved in Baku, the same 2016 Olympiad.  And it was very pleasant.  I expected it to be approved anyways, because that's just their normal routine.  But it was very nice because at that time, as soon as it got approved, as soon as I officially hold the titles, my family were in Baku at the same time.  So we went out, and we had a nice celebration.\n\n You had previously mentioned in your TED talk, you are curious about the human brain, and would like to study more about it.  How is that going to affect your chess career?\n\n Yep, that's true.  Well, I feel like the more information I have about how anything works, it helps me become a better human being.  And more mature, and I have seen the way I think about chess has changed compared to when I was, let's say eighteen, just because I am more mature right now and I am more honest to myself.  It's easier for me to see certain moves and certain patterns whereas when I was a teenager.  So I hope the more information I get anywhere helps me become a better human and better chess player.\n\n Are the gendered titles and segregated events bad in the long run?\n\n I think so, yeah.  But at the same time, that is not a problem they can fix immediately, because if they take away all of the women titles, so many women will be harmed by that.  Because they are receiving benefits from their governments and from the chess federations.\n\n Earlier this year,  an [Iranian] Female Grand Master in a tournament in Moscow: she chose not to wear [a] hijab.  Iranian Chess Federation President announced she was now banned from the Iranian Chess Team.  Iranian chess arbiter Shohreh Bayat decided not to return to the country after a photo of hers was circulated by the Iranian press in which her headscarf was not visible.  What do you think of this situation?\n\n I mean, I am glad that they're finding their voice.  But they were not supportive when I found my voice.\n\n What was the President of the Iranian Chess Federation Mehrdad Pahlavanzadeh like?\n\n At the time I thought he was nice and genuine, but the more I got to know him, it felt like he was very power-hungry and a lot — really fake.  I just don't really have better words to put.\n\n Why does the federation take these actions instead of looking at the player's performance?\n\n Well, the other problem is that they are under big scrutiny from the government because the government expects the women to behave a certain way and to dress a certain way.  So it's not just about what the federation thinks.  It's also a lot on the government.\n\n What message would you like to give to Iranian chess players?\n\n Be true to yourself.  If this isn't the right fit for you, find the right fit.  And if you do believe and you are happy where you are, nobody should be able to tell you not to be happy and to disrespect your beliefs.\n\n Back in 2017, the  was held in Riyadh [in Saudi Arabia‍] and Israeli chess players were denied visa.  Iran hosted the  and it was boycotted by [WGM]  due to the mandatory hijab.  What is your say in organising events in these countries where players are either forced to adhere to a dress code, or denied visa altogether because of their nationality?\n\n That's very wrong to give tournament organisation to these countries.  They shouldn't do that.  Because these countries aren't following the basic human rights.  And we shouldn't support and encourage them to just keep treating women as they are, and giving them organisation, giving them publicity will just encourage that [what] they are doing is right which they aren't.\n\n Back in 2017, even [GM]  tweeted, \"To organise a chess tournament in a country where basic human rights aren't valued is horrible. Chess is a game where all different sorts of people can come together, not a game in which people are divided because of their religion or country of origin.\"\n\n Yes, I completely agree with that.\n\n Well, what are you favourite places to play chess?\n\n Switzerland.\n\n What are you favourite chess books?\n\n I really like the Mark Dvoretsky books.  I also really like the five books by Kasparov, .  Another book that I really like is .  A lot of people don't like it, and I probably wouldn't like it right now, but it was a huge deal for me when I first read it.  The way that they explain it and the way they inspired me to think was different than what I was doing.  So I learned a lot from it.\n\n What are your favourite non-chess books?\n\n Non-chess books.  Um, I really like to read books by  [], and he's a doctor here in the US who writes different books and explains how he felt on his experience, on his intake.  So I really like that.\n\n Who helped you get where you are today?\n\n My parents.\n\n What important truths do a very few people agree with?\n\n  I think one of the things that's kind of, people are still trying to learn is respecting everybody's beliefs.  Because people can be extremely judgemental.  I can be judgemental sometimes, and I have to talk myself and explain to myself that, okay —  people are allowed to do what they want and it is not my place to judge everybody.  And sometimes we all need that reminder.\n\n What do you do to relax when you are not playing chess?\n\n I really like to watch TV shows, about different careers, 'cause I am never going to be a lawyer but just watching a law-related TV show helps me understand that aspects too.\n\n What according to you makes chess beautiful?\n\n Sometimes it feels like chess is like you are hearing the music that the pieces are making and you're dancing, the pieces are dancing, to it.  And then you figure out a beautiful tactic.  I really like that analogy.\n\n What motivates you to play chess?\n\n Well, I'd like to show people that you can do different things with your life.  And the idea that you can play chess and still study and still have a life outside of chess.  I think that's one of the big things for me.\n\n How much time do you spend behind analysing your own games?\n\n Quite a lot actually.  It kind of depends on the game and ideally if I have the time, I would like to go back and talk to my brother or another chess friend.  And get their inputs.\n\n What advice do you have for new chess players?\n\n To figure out what they want and to find a book and find a coach who cares about them.  Well the book shouldn't care about the person, but the book should be able to speak to the person, because sometimes you just look at the books and look at the positions just because of the positions.  But sometimes when you are reading the book, you are actually feel that you understand this, and it is more than just a book to you.\n\n What are some of the bad traits that hold a player down?\n\n Feeling like you are not good enough.  And feeling like your opponent is better than you, or, lot of these feelings that you are not good enough, you can't do it.  Because if you have any of these thoughts going into a chess game, you are not gonna come out it very happy.\n\n What is the best advice given to you?\n\n My mom, she always encouraged me to be true to be myself and to find the best way of expressing myself.  Because I went through a period when I was extremely straightforward with everybody and it was kind of hurtful.  Because I just didn't want to pretend anything.  I didn't want to fake anything.  And then my mom helps me realise that it is not about being straightforward or faking it.  It is actually finding the right words to put in, because sometimes what you say is hurtful but what you mean is not.  So that smooth transition between matching what you say and what you mean, I think that was one of the biggest advice I've got.\n\n In future what do you want to achieve in the game of chess?\n\n I would really like to be in US top five.  And I would also really like to be involved in chess as much as I can.  I do have my FIDE trainer title, and I would really like to be able to teach more kids.  I do have a few students and it seems to be going good, so far.  But I would like to understand better how to fix and help the players.\n\n Those were all the questions I had for you.  Is there something you would like to add?\n\n Um, no I am good.  Thank you.", "question": "What was the reason for Dorsa Derakhshani being banned from representing the Iranian national team in 2017? \n\nA) She did not win any tournaments  \nB) She refused to play against Israeli players  \nC) She did not wear a hijab during competition  \nD) She wanted to join an international chess federation"}

The study stated the black hole is about 1010 ± 195  (310 ± 60 ) away from the , meaning it is the nearest known black hole from the .  The nearest previously known black hole —  — the study noted was usually estimated at more than 3000 light years away.\n\nThe black hole described in the study is located in the   of Telescopium constellation, making it the first system visible to the  to contain a black hole.  HR 6819 contains two stars, and they are visible from the .  The astronomers started observing the system in 1999.  Initially, they thought it was just a binary system, consisting of two stars.  However, upon examination, the researchers concluded there was a third unseen object in the system.  One of the two stars in the HR 6819 system is close to the black hole and orbits the black hole in just 40.333 ± 0.004 days.\n\nThis newly discovered black hole does not have an .  A black hole forms an accretion disk when a significant amount of matter orbits the black hole, as depicted in the image.  Accretion disks often emit  .  Since this black hole does not have an accretion disk, researchers had to rely on the gravitational effect of the black hole on the nearby star in order to discover it.\n\nResearchers used the  to conclude the black hole had a mass of at least 4.2 M☉ (; 1 Solar mass = mass of the Sun).  Its companion star, which orbits the black hole in about 40 days, is classified as a .  The outer star is classified as a .  Be stars rotate very quickly around their axes.  Since the outer star rotates so rapidly, the star is not exactly spherical, but instead , bulged at its equator, forming a gas disk around the equator.\n\nThe research suggested HR 6819 was very similar to another system .  The HR 6819 system is estimated to be between 15–75 million years old ().  The inner star has estimated mass of at least 6.3 ± 0.7 M☉.  Using the mass and the speed at which the inner star rotates, the researchers concluded the black hole had an estimated mass of 5.0 ± 0.4 M☉.  Researcher and co-author of the study Thomas Rivinius told Wikinews the inner star and the black hole are closer than the Sun and the Earth (1; 150 million km; 93 million ).\n\nThe researchers dedicated the paper to Stanislav Štefl, one of the fellow researchers who died in a car accident in 2014 in Santiago, Chile.\n\nWikinews caught up with Thomas Rivinius to discuss about this discovery.\n\n Thank you agreeing for this discussion by the way.\n\n I would like to ask you about the discoveries that you and the team made.  And about the future investigations.\n\n  Ah, well yes, do you have any specific question?  I mean, the future investigation is to make sure that it really is a black hole and we will probably do that by means of .  What we ultimately want to get is: you probably have seen the animation, it is a sequence of images that looks like this animation.  The two  moving around: not around each other, but with a third object.\n\n What prompted your interest in astronomy?\n\n Oh, astronomy in general.  That is very long.  You see, when I was maybe ten years old, I was already very interested in astronomy and started observing from backyard with a .  It's actually that got me into physics and mathematics, and then I studied physics.  There was a time I was not sure if I would end up in astronomy or  or something else.  But in the end, I always decided to continue the astronomy path.\n\n Could you briefly explain this discovery and its findings?\n\n  Well, it is a long story indeed.  Because originally we thought it was a  — just two objects — not three.  And that would have been interesting because these two stars are similar in many senses.  Like they have a similar mass.  They are similarly old.  They are consequently of similar temperature, et cetera.  But in one aspect they are very different.  Namely, one is rotating very very fast.  It is a so-called .  Which means it is rotating so fast that it is almost flying apart.  There's actually material flowing off the equator.  And the other is rotating rather slowly.\n\nSo the original investigation was to figure out why two stars, that are so similar — that must have formed together — why they would be they so different.  And now this is not something we could answer in the end because the distant system is of a different structure.  But instead we found that it is of a different structure and there are three objects, but only two of them visible.  And that means, if you put the data we get into  and  and the rotation, you find that the third object must be very massive.  And if you don't see it but it is very massive, that means it cannot be a star.\n\n And that is how you concluded it was a black hole?\n\n Yes.  How we concluded it's a black hole is we derive the mass from these 's and 's laws.  And then we see if, given the quality of data we have, if it would be possible to detect the star with such a mass.  And we went through several options down to the faintest possible stars we could imagine, with such a mass, and there is no such object.  Our data is good enough that we would have seen such a thing.  And therefore, if it is , it must be a black hole.\n\n What drew the team's attention to this stellar system, , in the ?\n\n Well in the first place, because it was in a catalogue of these extraordinarily rapidly rotating stars: the Be stars.  They are really so rapidly rotating that they are .  They are not round, not  anymore, but they are oblate.  And they have a gas disk that is flowing off the equator because they rotate almost at .  And that is basically my research, in what is forming this.\n\n Why did the team start observing HR 6819 specifically?\n\n As I said, because it's a Be star.  There are about 100–200 Be stars which are of that brightness.  And maybe 150 visible from the southern .  And so over the many years, we have taken, not all, but a fair fraction of them, and we started off with relatively few , with only ten spectra.  And with this, we slowly sought our way through which are interesting and which are not and at some point, this [system HR 6819] did strike us interesting because we thought it was binary.\n\n And when did the research team start observing?\n\n The first observations, these few spectra were taken 1999.  And the second set of spectra was taken 2004.\n\n What was the most fascinating aspect of this finding?\n\n Well, for me, it's the realisation that  black holes are very common.  I mean, I knew the numbers: that you get about one black hole per thousand stars.  But that actually means there must be some black holes rather nearby.  And originally, you would expect most of them single, so that you would never find them, because they are very small, very black.  Nothing to see there.  But when they are in a multiple system, then you can see them through their gravitational influence on the other stars.  And, so that basically was, I think, the best finding, that it is a multiple system — a stable multiple system.  Many stars are in multiple systems.  But when a black hole is formed via  , you would actually think that many of these systems get destroyed: disrupt[ed] by the explosion.  This did not happen.\n\n What technologies were used for this discovery?\n\n .  In other words, spectroscopy is a technology by which you spread the light, you resolve the light into the individual .  And then you can see the signature of the chemical elements as they form in the star.  And these signatures — you usually assume they have a fixed wavelength.  If you observe them at a slightly different wavelength, this is due to the .  And so with this doppler effect, we could see that one of the stars was moving, not at a constant speed, but it was moving back and forth with a relatively high velocity.  Amplitude of 60/s [about 37  per ].  And a long  of 40 .\n\nAs I said, with the combination of Kepler's and Newton's law that is called the , you can use these numbers to get a mass of what it must orbit about.  It's a principle, the same technology we use for finding planets, which is called .\n\n How did you get involved in this study?\n\n From the very beginning.  As I said, I was interested in Be star[s].  Actually most of the team [...]  We were originally arranging this observations of many Be stars and it just turned out this one was particular very interesting.\n\n Apart from [the] European Southern Observatory, which other observatories were involved in this discovery?\n\n Uh, none.  So only European Southern Observatory plus the observatory at La Silla.  Two different telescopes.\n\n Okay.  Which were the two telescopes?\n\n The 1.52 and 2.2.  The point is we always use the same instrument but it was moved at some point from ESO 1.52 to the 2.2m of the .\n\n Were all the observations made from the La Silla Observatory?\n\n From La Silla not.  There are other observations available, but we have not used them yet in this study.  There are observations available that were made by , there's a data based of amateur spectroscopy, there are observations in the archives that were made from the .  So at some point, we are going to look at all those observations, but for the discovery purpose, we only used the observations that were taken from La Silla.\n\n How many people were involved in this discovery?\n\n Right now the paper has I think five co-authors.  And there is a sixth person, Stan Štef, who some years ago died in a car accident.  And I believe — the paper is dedicated to him.  He is not on the co-author list because this particular paper was written completely new.  And if he never had a chance to actually even read the draft, then someone should not be co-author.\n\n What were the roles of the people involved in the discovery?\n\n Marianne Heida and Dietrich Baade were the ones that originally triggered the idea.  Well, it's a long study because originally, we studied if for a different purpose.  In this different purpose, it was me, Dietrich Baade, and Petr Hadrava.  And we wanted to study it as a binary.  Robert Klement was a student of Petr Hadrava and he then also later and now assisted in the study of binary parameters.  And Marianne Heida is an expert on X-ray binaries, which have a lot of black holes.  So she was originally putting us on the track by presenting another paper on a black hole.\n\n What was the timeline of this study?\n\n Well, it took 20 years, as I said; we started observing in 1999.  This is a typical scientific discovery: you find something you are not looking for.\n\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n\n Well, what took the most time was basically to realise that there is something that unusual in it.  As I said, we originally thought it was something different.  And then analysed it.  Found it was not what we had expected and so on and all that drags it out.  And then of course there's that Stan Štefl was a major driver in the study. He died in 2014 which basically stalled the study after that until now.\n\nIt was now that we picked it out because there was another paper appearing on a similar object, which, looking at that paper, I realised that HR 6819 must be of the same type.\n\n What was the most difficult part of this investigation?\n\n As it basically is for any investigation: you very early on have an idea what it might be.  And it is always, the most difficult part is to always to make it sure in such a way that also the colleagues would believe it.  You have to explore any other options, any possibilities and exclude them one-by-one.\n\n What was your first reaction when confirming the unseen member of the triplet was a black hole?\n\n Well it depends.  I mean, the first suggestion that it was a black hole surfaced in 2010.  But then we were very cautious.  Because we were not quite sure.  At that point we hadn't really excluded everything else.  And so, this was a very cautious time.  And then Stan died, but when I looked at it back in 2019, I managed to convince myself relatively quickly now, whatever I had learned in the past six years.\n\n How old is this system?\n\n Judging from the two other stars that still exist in there, these two other stars must [be] between 15 and 70 million years old ().  Probably closer to the high upper end.  Probably closer to 70 million years.  That is probably the age of the system.\n\n How rare is the occurrence of the stellar systems with black holes?\n\n Well, when we are talking about black holes of the , not supermassive black holes like are in the hearts of the galaxies, only 50 of them are known.  And most of them are in binaries.  Because, as I say, a single black hole is almost impossible to find.  It is, however, one of the first we are certain of, or at least the one we are most certain that it is not in binary — one companion — but a triple, with two companions.\n\n How different are the stellar systems with black holes as compared to the ones without it?\n\n Well, black hole is the end phase of the .  So every triple system that has a star with higher than 12 solar masses, at some point must have a supernova explosion that results in either a  or a black hole.  The question is not — these progenitor systems, they are very abundant, they exist everywhere.  The question is how frequently they survive these explosions.  That is something completely unknown.  But I suspect there are quite many of them.\n\n This black hole does not have an accretion disk.  What does this tell us about the system?\n\n Not very much.  It will eventually acquire an accretion disk.  The two other stars are not very evolved.  They are still small and compact.  As soon as they start evolving — in particular, the inner one — it will grow, and once it has grown enough, the black hole will start to accrete from it.  But there is a couple of million years to go still, at least.\n\n Tell us about the orbits of the two stars in HR 6819.\n\n Well the inner orbit is relatively fast.  It's 40 days.  That's not an unusual , for two stars.  But, the amplitude is very high: the speed with which they orbit each other is high: it is 60 km/s.  And together with the 40 days, that makes a minimum mass of the other object.  The outer orbit we don't know.  It is very far away.  It's probably, judging from the similarity to other systems [...], it is probably several decades.  It could be even long[er].\n\n How close do these stars get? \n\n Since the orbit is circular, they will always stay at the same distance — at least the inner two, the black hole and the other star.  For now, they will stay at the same distance.  They will not get closer or farther from each other.  They are about as far as, closer than the  and the  (1, 150 million km (93 million miles).  The precise value is not known because it depends on the  of the system: whether we see the system edge-on, or whether we see it face-on.\n\n Is the black hole assigned an official name?\n\n For naming, naming is the job of .  So.  Traditionally you would call it as Component A, Component B, Component Aa: something like that.  But even that, I am not entirely sure how that would go.  Because whether you do this by mass, or sometimes you call the \"A\" which the most massive, sometimes you call \"A\" which is the most brightest, so.\n\n Does the team refer to the name by an unofficial name?\n\n No.  Not really.\n\n What are some of the properties of this black hole?\n\n Ah, black holes don't really have properties.  It's mass.  That's it.  It has at least the mass of 4.3 Solar [Mass], which means it has a diameter of maybe about 30 km (18.64 miles).  That's about it.  There's not many more properties a black hole can have.\n\n When I asked about the properties of the black hole, I was hoping you would remark on the spin,  and the charge.\n\n The radius is about 15 km (9.3 miles), as I said. Nothing is known about spin or charge, but it is likely that charge is zero or close to that.\n\n What do we know about the history of this black hole?\n\n Only that it comes from a supernova, and that the triple system still survives.  That is basically telling us something about the explosion must have been symmetric in a sense.  Because if it had been asymmetric, the system would have been disrupted.\n\n What are the affects of the black hole on the star closer to it?\n\n None.  It's pulling — the gravity — but another star would just pull the same.  So it has no radiation.  It has not accrete.  It is only forcing it into an orbit.  Nothing else.\n\n What were the challenges the team faced to discover this black hole?\n\n Well, as I said before, it is basically to make sure that you have excluded all other options.  It's really: science is really about excluding the alternatives and, so that finally only one possibility remains.\n\n How are the black holes with the accretion disk different form those which don't have one?\n\n Ah, if they have something to accrete, then something falls into the black hole.  And in that process, they produce all sorts of emission.  They produce X-ray emission, .  And ours does too, but it really is just black.\n\n As you mentioned, x-ray emission helps detecting the black holes with accretion disk.  What are some of the other ways we can detect black holes without accretion disks?\n\n Ah, I don't think there's many other ways.  You wouldn't get them unless they have another object which you can detect.  And then you have to infer it from the gravitational effects, like its orbit.\n\n Do these stars orbiting the black hole have any known planets?\n\n Ah, no, and considering their type, it is rather unlikely.  These kinds [...] as far as I know don't really have planets.  They are too violent, the deformation process is too massive.  Planets are normally around older or less massive stars.\n\n The report mentioned the spectroscopic time series of HR 6819 was similar to LB-1.  Tell us more about the system LB-1.\n\n It's basically the same.  This was a press release form the Chinese National  in November.  And back then they claimed it is only a binary, one is a normal star, the other is a black hole.  It has an accretion disk.  And from this they infer it could have had very high mass.  But from a technical point of view, this type of analysis is incorrect.  It was, at least to me, looking at the system it looks fairly clear that the effect they ascribe to the black hole which they thought was an accretion disk must be an outer object — a third star nearby — of this Be type, which makes the emission line.  So it is basically looking at the paper and realising that they are not right in their result but I know what it is, and that realising I have something similar just in my drawer.\n\n In what ways are LB-1 and HR 6819 similar and dissimilar?\n\n They are similar in almost every aspect.  The inner , as far as we can tell at the moment.  The B star that is close to the black hole [of LB-1] is rotating even slower than in HR 6819.  It could be that it has been a bit modified: that it already has either transferred mass to the black hole or the progenitor of the black hole has transferred mass[...]  For [HR] 6819, there's no such indication.  But otherwise, we believe they are essentially the same.\n\n In what ways would the  be different if the Sun was in the inner star's orbit, orbiting this black hole?\n\n It would not exist.  As I said, planets simply would not form around such a massive binary.  Planet formation around binary in principle is possible.  But the inner star would have been a star with at least 12, maybe 20 solar masses.  And these stars form very quickly, burn very quickly, die very quickly.  Planets would simply not have had the time to form along such an object.\n\n No, considering our Solar System was there.\n\n Right now?  Well, if you just put a Solar System there, that exists, it would probably destroy Mercury, it wouldn't exist, it would be not in a stable orbit.  Probably also Venus would not be in a stable orbit.  In the region of Earth, the orbit could be stable.  So maybe Earth could just so barely exist.  The  would be different.  There would be a strong 40-day modulation, which makes every 20 days — or every 40 days you get a lot of radiation.  Every 40 days, you get only much less radiation.  So it would be very hostile to life.\n\n What were the different radiation emissions observed in this system?\n\n There is only visible light so far.  We know of no other [].\n\n What are some of the other observed systems that have similar radiation emission?\n\n As I said, this is from the point-of-view of the stars, these are just normal stars.  And the black hole does not contribute anything to the emission of the radiation.\n\n What does the future of these stars look like?\n\n The outer star will just evolve very normally just like any other star of its mass.  The inner star will become a  as well.  But when it ends its supergiant phase, it will be big enough to get accounted into the black hole and then the black hole will start accreting.  It is hard to say what happens then.  It may get big enough for the black hole to actually fall into the star, and then shortly after the star falls into the black hole, or it might end with the accretion.\n\n So you are saying there is a chance the black hole may create an accretion disk feeding on this inner star?\n\n It will certainly.  But it will take another few million years.\n\n Were you expecting a black hole to be so close to the Solar System?\n\n Ah yes, as I said, there must be many black holes.  I mean, there are certainly black holes which are closer.  It's just not very likely to find them.  They are not infrequent objects.  They are interestingly very frequent objects.  There are just very hard to find.\n\n What future investigations is your team planning for?\n\n With interferometry, we want to image that, and maybe we want to look in the catalogues if we can find a similar system.  We are looking for candidates where we might reasonably expect that it might be similar and then we can have a look in detail.\n\n What lies ahead in this system to be discovered?\n\n Well, basically what we still have to do with this system is to make the numbers certain.  Right now, what we have is limits.  We have a lower limit for the mass.  But what we can do is we get precise value for the mass.  We only have a rough distance, we can get a precise distance.  We can measure the chemical composition of the stars that still exists, if they in any way have been altered or affected by the original primary, when the most massive star went supernova.  So it should tell us a lot, in principle, about heterogeneous systems about how such massive stars evolve.\n\n Are there any plans to observe the nearby binary stars for black holes?\n\n As I said, we are looking into the catalogues.  If we can find similar systems that could give us hints, that might be promising candidates.  But even if they are frequent, they are not that frequent that we could observe every star and just look for black holes.  That is not an efficient use of telescope time.\n\n Are there any other observations you have been working on?\n\n Ah, well, there's a lot of things I'm working on.  But they are unrelated to this particular project.\n\n What is your role at the ESO?\n\n At the ESO, I am a science operations astronomer.  Which means that I run the telscopes; I support other astronomers when they come here to conduct the observations, and when they cannot come, or do not want to come which also happens, I do the observations for them.  And I do this about 60% of my working time, I work for the observatory in this capacity, and one third of my working time I do my own research.\n\n Well, those were all the questions I had for you.  Is there something you would like to add?\n\n No, I think that was fine, thank you.\n\n Thank you for agreeing for this interview.  It had been a great pleasure discussing this with you.\n\n Thank you.

This is more akin to the spread of flu[.]\"\n\nEfforts to contain the SARS outbreak, which took place in 2003, mainly involved preventing the spread of the virus within hospitals. If these findings are accurate, scientists say, containing COVID-19 may require a different approach.\n\nThe R0 number for SARS-CoV-2 — the number of other people to whom each infected person transmits the virus before either dying or becoming noncontagious — has yet to be calculated. R0 can change over time as populations become more resistant, more vaccinated, or more careful. For context, SARS-CoV has a basic R0 estimated in the range 2–4 and influenza in the range 2–3. The  R0 is about 12–18.  and  have R0 values of about 2.

The survey was reportedly to be published in .\n\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the , said, \"Superficially, frogs may look similar, but when you look at their skulls, you see drastic differences [...] Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as a shield, or in a few rare cases, are venomous. Their skulls show how strange and diverse frogs can be.\"\n\nSome scientists had previously suggested smaller frogs would tend to develop spiky skulls, but that is not what this study reports.  Here, researchers evaluated  on 158 different species. They found frogs that had similar ecological niches — meaning they either acquired food in the same way or defended themselves from predators in the same way — tended to develop skulls with similar grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints .\n\nAccording to the study, skulls with spikes, grooves or ridges — called  — often accompanied frogs eating very large prey relative to their own body size.  The strong, spacious skulls would allow the frogs to have very big mouths with which to catch birds, rodents, reptiles and other frogs.  Spikes sometimes coincided with venomous frogs. The researchers speculated the spikes make it dangerous for predators to hit the frog's head, as the spikes would break venom sacs under the frog's skin.\n\nOther bone formations included projections resembling fangs or lower teeth  that different species of frogs use for catching prey and fighting. Very few frogs have true lower teeth.\n\nOne of the study's authors, herpetologist David Blackburn, told  the frequency of spiky skulls evolving in otherwise unrelated frogs suggested some deep pattern frogs fell into as circumstances arose: \"Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their .\"\n\nSince 1973, when frogs skulls were last comprehensively surveyed, scientists have documented enough new species to double the number known to humans.

{"title": "Neuroscientists tell Wikinews about empathy and harm aversion observed in lab rats", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Neuroscientists tell Wikinews about empathy and harm aversion observed in lab rats}}\n\nIn findings published last month in the journal ,  from the  examined harm  in  for  — rats not wanting to hurt other members of the same species — and reported which region of the brain was crucial for it.  Wikinews caught up with Dr  and Dr Valeria Gazzola, two of the authors who contributed to the paper.\n\nFor the experiment, the rats were put in a container with two levers.  The rats were trained to develop a preference for one of the two levers: each delivering one pellet of .  One of the two levers was harder to press.\n\nAfter developing a preference, the preferred lever was wired to deliver a shock to another rat in a neighbouring compartment, while delivering a single pellet of sucrose.  The study showed the actor rat, which pressed the lever, tended to switch the lever to avoid shocking the other rat.  The rat receiving the shock was called a victim rat.\n\nAversion of harm to fellow rats was reported to be equal in both male and female rats.  If the actor rats were previously exposed to the shocks, their degree of harm aversion for others was heightened, the study revealed.\n\nThe investigation reported the rats avoided pressing the preferred lever to shock another rat, even if that lever delivered two sucrose pellets and the no-harm lever delivered only one.  However, this was not the case when the rats were given three pellets by the shock lever.  Most of the actor rats did not switch when they received three pellets pressing the lever, which also delivered an electric shock.  Dr Gazzola called it a \"tipping point\" and said it was a \"cost-benefit\" function.\n\nThe study also revealed the importance of the  (ACC) region of the rat's brain for harm aversion.  The scientists tested harm aversion for conspecifics in the  after deactivating the ACC using .  Muscimol was injected in the rats belonging to the test group, while saline water was injected to rats in the control group.  The observations showed without the active ACC due to muscimol, the active rats in the test group were no longer averse to harming the victim rats, but degree of harm aversion did not drop in the control group rats.\n\n Thank you for agreeing for this discussion, by the way.\n\n Um, hmm.  Our pleasure.\n\n So, I would like to discuss about the study, the observations you've made and what lies ahead to be discovered in this field.\n\n So, what prompted you, and your interest in studying about this harm aversion?\n\n So half of the lab works on .  And half on , right?  So, the main topic of the lab is really to try to discover the brain mechanism that allow us to be , basically.  That's the main theme.  So in particular, from the human research what we are interested is really trying to see whether embodiment: so these processes that these brain regions have become reactivated when we see somebody else in pain, for instance.  You know, the regions normally involve[d] in [making] pain also reactivated when you observe somebody else [in pain].  Whether these, the activity of these regions is essential to motivate us for instance not to hurt other people.\n\n And one of the biggest limitation[s] in particular of the human research is that you can go so far in understanding the brain mechanism.  Because we cannot, we don't have tools with the correct  in terms of, for instance, understanding what a single cell does, in these processes.  And that's why, for many years, we developed, we tried to develop a model in animals where all these techniques are more available that would allow us to investigate similar processes to those in humans.  So processes basically that are involved in perceiving the other['s] distress also in animals.  And, that's basically the main reasons why we move towards this research and then we started from coming up with the experiment in which we simply measure the distress of an animal in reaction to the distress of another.  Which what we call , for instance.  And we made it more and more complex in order to reach slowly a degree of complexity that can be comparable to processes in humans.  Emotional contagions: you can compare it, for instance, that the level of humans when you are in a crowd, or when you are baby, that as a crowd you are contaged by the emotions are around.  And, but then, we wanted to go a little bit of a step forward: okay now I am contaged, what does it mean to be contaged?  Can I use this information to, for instance, avoid hurting other people.  And that's how we came about, more or less, so.\n\n I mean, one other motivation we have is that in the past we've also been interested in people that seemed to lack the aversion to harming others.  I mean, with that , sometimes they're called  as well.  And so, a couple of years ago, we made this study in which we identified psychopathic criminals in high-security institutions.  We brought them to the lab, and we scanned their brains while they witnessed the pain of other individuals.  And what we saw was that if they don't have any particular reason to empathise with others, they really have reduced activity in their own pain regions while they witness the pain of others.  So, of course, that's interesting and it may suggest that perhaps, the reason why if they can make some money, for instance, they don't mind to harm other people is because they don't activate their own pain much while they witness the pain of others.  The problem like Valeria was saying, is that in humans we can see that the brain region is active while you see the pain of others, but you can't easily change the activity in the brain region to see whether that would change the way that the psychopathic criminal would act.  I mean, ideally, what we'd like to do is increase the activity of these pain regions in psychopaths and see that now suddenly they would really care to not harm others anymore.\n\n Although it's not yet, it's also not yet very clear that we need activity of these regions to avoid the harm, right?  At that point, that's how we came about to run the experiment, because the first question was: is it really necessary.  The activity of these regions.  So, you start with okay, you want to manipulate these regions to reduce psychopathy.  But the field could not even prove that this activity was necessary to reduce harm.\n\n And so, that was really one of the strong motivation behind the -experiment, because rats have a very similar  to what humans have.  It is really a core part of the brain that is involved in feeling your own pain.  So, if you don't have a cingulate cortex and you hurt yourself, you still feel that you've cut yourself, but you don't mind.  And so you are not going to do a lot to avoid being cut again.  So this region exists also in the rats and it is a relatively deep brain region.  So therefore, we turn to the rats, and figure that in the rat, we can change the activity in the brain region and see whether that would then change how much the rat would be aversed to harming other rats or not.\n\n Could you briefly explain this study and its findings?\n\n Ah.  So very briefly, what we do is we give a rat a choice between two  that the rat can press.  Both of these levers will provide the rat with one little pellet of sugar which they really like.  So, they are happy to press these levers to get the reward.  In the main experiment, what we do is that one of the two levers is a little bit more difficult to press than the other one.  So most of the rats start to prefer the easy lever to press.\n\nNow, as soon as they have developed the preference for the easy lever, what we do is that now, still both levers give one pellet of sucrose.  But now the preferred, the easy lever, also gives a shock to a rat that's in the compartment next door.  And so then, the rat that presses the lever not suddenly hears someone next door, kind of, in the protesting with the pain-squeak about the shock that he just got.  And what we see is that the, about a little bit less than half of the rats will now stop to use their preferred lever because it gives a shock to the other one, and they would start to press the harder lever to avoid to shock to the other rat.\n\nNow after we found that, we could do is go to the cingulate cortex, which is the region that we saw was less active in the psychopathic criminal, and is normally active when you feel the pain of other people.  And what we saw was that when we deactivate this region with muscimol, which is a bit like a local anesthetic, which you can inject the part of the brain, now suddenly, the rats that continued to use their favourite lever even when it harms another rat.  So now, what we see in there mainly are kind of two big findings.  One is it shows us that humans are not the only animals that don't like to harm other animals.  Rat also do that.  And second is the fact that they use the same brain region, which is the cingulate cortex that humans use while they witness the pain of other people, as a necessary part of this harm aversion.\n\nAnd the fact that it's the same brain region that we see to be active in humans tells us that in a way, it's not just the case that rats and humans have independently developed harm aversion.  It suggests that there is kind of a common ancestor that already had this ability, and that was then given to both the rats and the humans.  Which means that kind of harm aversion and not wanting to harm other people is at least 100 million years old, because that's more-or-less when our  separated from rodents like rats and .\n\n And that also what we see is that there is variability in the responses of the observers, of the rats that make the choice between the levers.  And these variabilities also present in humans: when you do tasks that are rather similar, you see that not everyone acts socially, preferring the social lever.  But you also have individuals that would go for the reward more often.  So this is also another similarity between the animal world and the human world.  And on top of that,  I think that the other things we've learned from that experiment is that, the decision is a  function, basically.  Because, we have a condition for instance where we increase the reward for the animal, for the observer.  And when you increase the reward, they are less willing to switch to the other lever.  So that also another similarity with human world and shows that maybe that it is a bit of complex, a tipping point, and it is like a function that really weighs the cost and the benefit of that particular context.\n\n Because when Valeria says that we increase the reward, we increase the difference between the two levers.  So in the main experiment, the only difference is that one is harder to press than the other, but they both give one pellet.  Then in two other experiments, what we did was that now that two levers are equally hard to press; but one of them gives you two pellets, the other one just one pellet.  And then rats are still willing to switch away from the two-pellet to the one-pellet to save the other one from pain.  But when we made it three pellets versus one pellet, then, none of the rats were willing to give up the three pellets to prevent the shock to the other person.\n\n Yeah, and then, the last, I think, result I kind of like in a way is that, as in many human studies, also in the animal world we did not find significant difference between .  So both, the female and the males acts in a similar way.  And in this type of , is also often the case in humans.\n\n That's true.\n\n So that's also interesting.\n\n What is the most fascinating aspect of this finding?\n\n Well, in a way, I would say, to really show — I mean, I always believed it that animal performed these choices too.  And that they do it to a certain extent to at least care or at least perceive what goes on in the other, right.  It can't maybe specifically speaking of voluntarily care about others, but at least they perceive what goes on and I think this is something that the study shows pretty well that they do perceive, and that based on these perception[s], they make a decision.  And I think it is a complex — I mean, to me it was in a way trivial, because I always believed that, you know, if you are a \"\", whether you are a rat, or a person, we are still animals, right?  They must develop behaviours that take advantage, or that they adapt to the fact that it's a social environment that involves more individuals.  But [...] the field keeps discussing, right?  Whether animals also have emotions, whether animals also can take this sort of decision.  And to see, slowly that evidence accumulates in favour of processes similar to what we call   or .  You know, similar: not exactly the same, but similar processes also are present in animals, to me is sort of reassuring also.  And I think it allows us to learn from how evolution evolved as well.  Maybe apart from knowing exactly how it works, but we start having some models where we can think, oh, evolutionary: maybe this process was already there, and then it developed further, more complex for the humans, but still is there to a certain extent.\n\n Yeah, and I think the fact that it's really the same brain region as well that seems to be involved kind of gives us some confidence that prosociality in caring about others is really deeply ingrained in our biology.\n\n What technologies were used to conduct this study?\n\n Yeah so in many ways it's a relatively simple study.  So we didn't need to use anything very high-tech in this case.  Because to alter brain activity, we use the injection of muscimol, which is a GABAA blocker.  It is a very simple pharmacological agent.  So it's really technologically a very simple study.  Nothing fancy.\n\n How did you get involved in this study?\n\n Oh, we brainstormed about it.  We started, as I said, we did a lot of research on, since our early ages, let's say in all our scientific career is based on embodiment, and activities in these areas and slowly we kept wondering more and more, on the role of these areas.  And then, the way it goes, we normally speak about a topic and include other people and keep brainstorming, and I think, that's how it goes.  At least for us.  And in humans, we are also developing similar paradigms, so it just came one plus one equal to two. [laughs]\n\n What were the roles of other people involved in this study?\n\n So, Julen Hernandez-Lallement, the first author of the study, was the one that basically made the vast majority of the experiments.  And he was helped by the other two: [Augustine Triumph] Attah: who did part of the other animal groups, and then Cindy [Pinhal] and Efe [Soyman] helped to analyse the data.  And basically Valeria and me have been kind of help designed this study initially and helped to analyse the data and wind up the study.  So we kind of lead the lab, but it's the other people that really manipulate the rats and do all the hard work.\n\n What was the timeline of this study?\n\n Well, it was long.\n\n Yeah, I would say, four years?\n\n (Wow!)\n\n Yeah, because the behavioural part is the longest one.  Because you need to understand the best way to teach the animal, first to manipulate the lever, then to manipulate two levers, and then, before the lever, there is also another action that they need to do; and everything needs to be done within a certain time.  So you need to let the animal the time to learn and for you that you run the experiment, you need to learn what's the best way, what's the best way to teach them to do the task?\n\nYeah, behavioural experiments of animals: they normally take quite some time to develop, specially more complex ones.\n\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n\n Yeah, I think that Valeria just said what's really important in these studies is to understand what kind of situation you can create for the rats that they are really understand and which they can in a way, show you what they're capable of.  So, kind of fine-tuning all the elements of the task, kind of how long do you let the rats develop the preference for one lever.  Because if you give them too much time to get too used to one lever, they are not so willing to switch anymore.  So the, most of the time is really involved in trying different versions of the paradigm, understanding what the rats really understand, and then analysing all the behaviour.\n\n What were the conditions did you test the hypothesis on?\n\n Yeah exactly; so the three kind of conditions we looked at was the hard vs the easy lever, and then seeing whether they switch to the harder lever when, to prevent the shock to the other one.  And we tried the two pellets versus one pellet and, then the three pellets versus one pellet.  And then finally, to test really whether the cingulate is necessary for that, we compare the condition in which we inhibit the activity in the cingulate using muscimol against the condition where we just inject salt water into the same brain region which doesn't have any effect.\n\n So, you mentioned the study took four years.  So you started back in 2016?\n\n Correct.  Yeah.\n\n Yeah, more or less.  I don't know the date.\n\n What was the most difficult part of this study in these four years?\n\n I think it was really again the establishing the behaviour.  And in particular because we, at first — so the paradigm itself, we took it from a previous study, that was run years ago, do you remember?\n\n Yeah, in '69, so that's kind of 50 years ago.\n\n Fifty years years ago, so the idea of the two levers.  And so and at that time, the articles' level of detail were not so many.  The articles were not giving as much information as we now have to write down.  And so we had to guess some parameters over there.  And, the fact that the rats would prefer the easy lever was also not so straightforward.  So we thought \"oh, they are gonna prefer the easy lever, and that's it.\"  But at the end, you know, some rats, some animals develop a preference on the side; like they prefer their right lever, or the left lever, or others, they prefer the heavy lever.  Right?  And that was also a bit puzzling at first.  We said, okay, so what do we do?  We find that a couple of rats prefer the hard lever, is that meaningful or not?  So we have to discuss a lot, how to adapt the paradigm to make it work, and this is also why we came about in using this switching index, because for our purposes, at the end, as long as the rat is able to switch a preference, right, whatever preference is developed is irrelevant, right?  And before the beginning of this study, we were more thinking: oh, they have to develop the preference for the easy lever.  And that's what is bringing us a bit out of the main purpose.  And we realised: okay, but, what preference they develop at the end, it doesn't matter as long as we have a preference that we can show they can change because of the shock.  So, I think this was one of the longest part[s], I would say.\n\n Were you anticipating this outcome?\n\n Yes.\n\n Yeah, I would say yes.\n\n For once.\n\n [laughs] Yeah, for once, yeah.  I mean, there was some evidence around and previous work was already bringing us towards that direction.  And, yeah, I mean we could not anticipate the proportion of animals that they would switch.  But, we surely were expecting the rats to switch.\n\n We were hoping for the cingulate to be necessary, so.\n\n So what was your first reaction after confirming the hypothesis was true?\n\n .\n\n We were happy.\n\n Yeah.\n\n How many rats were used, roughly speaking, for this study?\n\n I think it's written in the paper, but my guess would be something like, I'd say, 70.\n\n How distantly were the rats related to each other?\n\n Yeah, so that's interesting, in this study we really find that there is a lot of variability between the rats.  So like I was mentioning, we have about 40% that were ready to switch when they witnessed other one getting shocked.  And about 60% that do not switch, so as a group, we really see that they do switch.  But then only a proportion of individuals really show that sensitivity, and others do not.\n\n Or did you mean how close they were in terms of familiarity?\n\n I meant in .  How genetically close they were?\n\n So they're not genetically related.  They're not brothers or sisters.  And what we have is we have, we made one of the experiments with rats that didn't meet each other before, and it [the experiment] works.  And we had other cases in which they were living in the same home cage, and so they [would know] each other very well.  And the effect was not stronger.  So, amongst our rats, we really noticed that they care even about the fate of a stranger.\n\n So, if it fair to say there was no change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor and the victim were mates?\n\n Correct.  Well, mates as in cage mates.  Yeah, there was no sign of a difference.  We did look at it and it was not the perfect comparison because the two groups were slightly different in the paradigm as well.  But, it didn't look like there was a big difference.\n\n So, do you think the degree of harm aversion would have been greater if the actor-victim shared some sort of kinship?\n\n So we're actually going to test that very soon.  And it is up for grabs.  But in the past we've looked at whether a rat shows more freezing when it sees another one get a shock.  Which is a form of emotional contagion.  And there we compare a kind of rats from different strain,s even.  So one of the albino rats against a  rat, versus, that had never seen each other before, or ever seen a member of that strain, the one end.  And on the other end, really the rats have spent five weeks together and knew each other very well.  And we didn't see any difference there.  So I think the most robust findings is really that they care even about what happens to a stranger.\n\n Yeah, we are testing it again now, in the future.\n\n Exactly, specifically whether a mother would do more for her own kids than for...\n\n Kids of somebody else.\n\n Yeah.\n\n Well, that would go on to support Richard Dawkins' .\n\n Correct.  Right.\n\n Yeah.\n\n How was the functioning of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) deactivated in the rats?\n\n Yeah, what you do is you place a .  So you put the animal in a stereotact which is a system where you can go to a very specific position in the brain.  We place a cannula, which is like an injection needle just where we know the cingulate to be.  Then you let the animal recover with the cannula cemented in place.  Then, on the day of the experiment, you basically inject a little bit of muscimol, which is an agent that blocks .  Then by doing that, you can reduce the activity of the cingulate for about one hour.  And during that hour, you can make the experiment.  And then the control group is the same thing, but instead of injecting the muscimol, you inject some salt water.\n\n What are the affects of muscimol on the rat's body other than deactivating the cingulate?\n\n Nothing really.  Because you inject a very small quantity, that should only spread about 1 mm in the brain.  So it really just affects the region that you — and you don't see any change in behaviour.  So we also tested, for instance, whether they move more or less, whether they press the levers quicker or slower, and there was no difference.  The only difference is that they didn't learn to not press the one [lever] that shocks the other.\n\n And for instance, when you inject with muscimol, in case you see doing a normal  paradigm.  So whether you are still shocked to the sound, and then you present the sound.  In that case, the rat behaves normally.  And it still freezes.  So, it does suggest that the muscimol effect is not impairing the normal behaviour, but specifically impairs the social behaviour of feeling...\n\n ...of feeling for others.\n\n Exactly.  That was also the interesting part of the ACC that we believe to contribute really, to including the other [animal] into your decision-making.  Because for a normal fear conditioning paradigm, you don't need to go through the ACC.  They are made to be self-sufficient.  But, if you do a fear conditioning basically that involves another individual instead of sound, like of pain, then you do need to go to the contribution of the ACC.  So there seems to be two slightly complementary pathway for fear-detection.\n\n After the effect of deactivating the ACC wore off, was the degree of harm aversion of the actors back to the previously observed level?\n\n Yeah, that we didn't measure.  So, in that study, the muscimol animals were only in the behaviour with the ACC deactivated and the other ones were only with their ACC intact.  So, but this is something that we plan to test in the future as well.  To really see whether the ACC is necessary to acquire the aversion versus to maintain it.\n\n Okay.  So it is not a permanent loss of empathy.  Right?\n\n We don't know, but I think there is no reason to assume that when the muscimol wears off, they would not become normal again, right?  So that's most likely.  What we don't know is whether if we had for instance, because there's three days of experiment, right, where we develop the aversion.  And what we didn't try is for instance, give muscimol on Day 1 and Day 2 and then stop it on Day 3, and see whether on Day 3, they would then suddenly stop using the lever that gives shocks on the other days.  So that we don't know whether it's necessary for learning or for recall; we just know that if you don't have it at all, you don't learn at all.\n\n Did any of the actor rats choose to switch when they were on muscimol, and their ACC was deactivated?  Did any one of them switch?\n\n It's a good question.  I would need to look in the paper.  If you have the paper there, perhaps you can see it.  But I can have a quick look to see if I have the paper somewhere.  Yeah, so if you look at the Figure 4c, you can see the behaviour of each individual animal.  And what you will notice is that there are some animals like some of the red animals which are the muscimol group that did switch, but the majority didn't switch.  So I see there is one and only one animal in the muscimol group that really did switch.  But what happens is that when you make those experiments, you never know for sure that when you inject the muscimol, that it has the desired effect.  Because of course you have a cannula that's in the brain, and the cannula could become clogged also.  So it can be that that one animal switched because the muscimol wasn't effective for some reason.\n\n Did the team test the change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor rats were given psychoactive drugs?\n\n No.\n\n No.  Could be nice, but we didn't.\n\n Exactly.  Yeah, and in particular, there is a drug called Ecstacy that you may have heard of.  So, some people reported that Ecstasy for instance, increases the feeling of empathy amongst humans.  And I think that there is somewhere a study suggesting that if you give that to animal, there is also an increase in the sensitivity to what happens in another animal.  So we didn't test that.\n\n Did you also conduct the test with only one lever delivering the food also the electric shocks: how far the rats were willing to starve before they chose the victim should suffer?\n\n Yeah, no so we didn't do that.  That is a very old experiment from .  I think in the 50s, he did that experiment kind of with rats and with monkeys.  And he sees that the rats will use the lever less.  So even if you just have one lever, they'll use it less if it causes pain to others.  But in monkeys, that was a very strong affect.  Some of the monkeys really would rather not eat anything than to shock another monkey.  So it's an interesting experiment, but we haven't done it.\n\n In that diagram, we can clearly see the difference between contingent harm of males is lesser as compared to the females.  Even though it is somewhat similar.\n\n Yeah, what you see here is the two lines: the dark green and the light green that represents the males and the females.  For harm aversion, for that you should look at how much it changes from the baseline through the three shock sessions.  And the change is exactly the same in males and females.  But the difference between the two curves that you see is the fact that the females started off with the higher preference than the males did.  But the reduction in preference is same across groups.\n\n Tell us more about the observed differences between these rats.\n\n Between which rats?  Rats, you mean, in general in the experiment?\n\n In general, like the rats, which were on the extremes, how extreme were they on the case-by-case basis?\n\n Well, that you can see, if you look at Figure 3b in particular, you can see that some examples on the top of 3b of rats that had started off with a very strong preference for that were around 100 on the baseline session.  And it stayed at 100.  So they absolutely didn't care at all.  And in the other case, if you look at the bottom panel, you have some animals that initially had a preference around kind of 80%.  And by Day 3, they really go down to 0% of the shock lever used.  So it's really a very substantial difference; some changes much as they possibly could and some don't change at all.\n\n What could be the possible reason for this?\n\n Yeah, it's a good — if we knew that, we would be very happy.  I think the things that we did look at and didn't play major difference is actually the reaction of the demonstrator.  So the first thing we figured perhaps you have demonstrators that really squeak a lot, and others, that don't give a lot of pain signals, and that could could explain the difference.  Then we quantified the reaction of the demonstrators, we saw there were no major differences there.  Where we did see really, big differences is in the reaction of the observer.  So we saw that there is some observers for instance, when they realised that they had shocked the other one, they really stopped to do anything for a while, and took longer to go get their food and ate the food very quickly.  So they really showed that they were disturbed by these shocks.  And those were the ones that switched.  And then were other rats that didn't seem to mind at all, they just kept eating their food as if nothing had happened.  And those ones were the ones that didn't switch.  So we feel that there's really just a striking difference in how much attention as well the agent paid to the harm signals of the other person.\n\n But the causes are not known.  The causes of these are not: could be different brain activity, it could be the relationship between the distress that the observer perceives from the other that stops them to do anything, or actually motivates the other.  I mean, there are a lot of factors that could play a role.  And we are trying to think of it: how to test and untangle this aspect apart.  But it is not easy, but it is definitely a topic we are interested in.\n\n How much do we know about the evolution of harm aversion?\n\n Yeah, well we don't know that much.  So from a kind of biological point of view, kind of it's only over the past, I would say, 10-20 years, that evolutionary biology is really paying a lot of attention to kind of  and .  Because if you read kind of traditional and evolutionary kind of books, they underline the selfishness of individuals.  So the idea that you mainly need to survive yourself, and that other animals are really competitors.  And then more slowly, people started to say, \"well of course, you care about your kids, because they have a lot of your  and therefore, that makes sense\".  And it's only quite recently that people start to really see that even if you are not really related to another animal, but kind of you help each other, your whole kind of herd or group ends up better-off.  And the individual ends up being better-off.  Because often, rats actually, or animals have a sense of mutualism.  So if someone was kind to you at some point, you're more likely to be helped by that person in the future.  So that helping others is a way to facilitate being helped by them in the future.  And so, it still is a relatively young field of research that really acknowledges the fact that kind of in social animals, that live in groups.  And individuals will really do things for others kind of and that this is beneficial for evolution.  So it's really only starting to be explored.\n\n Is the ACC responsible for harm aversion in other vertebrates too?\n\n Yeah, so what we know is that for instance, in monkeys, the cingulate seems to be necessary as well to, for instance, decide to work, to give juice to someone else.  So, in the  they have some paradigms where you see a symbol on the screen that means that if you now do something, there can be juice for yourself.  And a different symbol if you work will give juice to another monkey, and a third symbol if you work that one, there'll be juice that's delivered in an empty glass.  And what you see is that monkeys that really work hard for themselves, but they're also willing to work a little bit to give juice to another monkey.  And that's more than they are willing to work if the juice is just gonna get wasted in as glass.  And there as well, the ACC seems to be important to motivate the monkey to work for another monkey and that's the other example that we know.  In mice, there is some evidence that if you disrupt the cingulate, then the mouse will no longer freeze when it see[s] another one getting shocked.  But that's it.  As far as I know, there's no other animal that has been explored.\n\n Are there any ethical considerations around conducting this study?\n\n Yes, of course!  So, we ourselves, of course do not particularly like to have to give shocks to one animal.  So the only reason we really do these experiments is that we feel that harm aversion is such an important phenomenon.  Because in human society, when people lack harm aversion, they really cause a lot of damage to society.  Both because they harm people, and they end up in prison and that has a huge cost; but as well for the fact that these individuals really erode trust and they harm in a way the interaction that all of us have with each other.  Because we are always afraid that the person we have in front of us might be someone that will take advantage of you and harm you.  So I think, in understanding how that works in the brain is really really important.  And because of that, we feel that it's important to really understand how it works.  And currently, working with animals is the only way that we can really modify brain activity and see if it changes behaviour.\n\n In future, might you test this hypothesis with different species?\n\n Yes, we might do it in mice.  So, of course, for other people, rats and mice are pretty much the same thing, but kind of there is a difference between them.  And ultimately, we hope we can do this in humans.  But for that, we need techniques in which we can modify brain activity in deeper brain regions.\n\n You can do it once in a while in patients that already suffer from  and normally the surgeons inserts electrodes to measure, to find out the source of epilepsy, and you can at times stimulate to see whether the region is essential in some of the normal behaviour.  So at times, you can have access to these patients and ask them to participate in our task and we have a couple of collaborations, that we hope that will help us to tell something more about the role of the ACC and the  in these type of tasks.  And we are also currently trying to develop methods that are human-friendly, in the sense that they are not invasive, and to be used in active participants to try to disrupt the activity of these regions as well.  Nowadays it's not easy to do because the TMS that [is] normally used to simulate the brain in humans, the , is not very well suited to reach deeper structure.  Like the ACC goes really inside and it's a bit curved as well.  You can reach with TMS, but it's not the cleanest way.  So we are also trying to see whether we can use, for instance,  stimulation to do it and test it directly in humans.  Of course, it will also make use of data that comes from patients that show damages in the ACC.  And it was a study from Ralph Adolphs in the past that did confirm that some of these regions like insula for instance, are important and essential for discriminating emotions for instance, so, you can also test in these patients: use our tasks and test these patients.  So there are bit, some ways, to do it in humans, but it's quite small so we are investing, but the results take longer.  And of course, when you use patients, you always have the problem of reorganisation of the brain structure that you are looking at, possibly, so.\n\n Is there a way to increase the degree of harm aversion in anti-social beings?\n\n Yeah, that's the question we are really interested in, and we don't know.  And that's why we are interested in finding out whether a particular region like the ACC is necessary for the development, or for the behaviour to occur.  Because once we know, we can confirm that in humans as well, what you could think are several ways.  You can manipulate plasticity in that region, so, ask the participants to go do certain tasks where they learn something.  And while you are modifying for instance, the {w|neuroplasticity|plasticity}} of the brain with current or magnetic simulation.  Or you can think of targeted therapies, for instance like , when you project the activities of the areas where the participants doing a task and the participants can directly modify through visual feedback the activity of these areas coming up.  So that if I now project on the screen the activity, real-time, the activity of the particular regions, I can tell you \"okay, try find a way to modify that region\".  So you would come up with thinking of something, you know, it's just a random process, but you could come up with a task saying like, \"Okay, if I think of how my friend is feeling now, I see that manipulated region\".  And then you can practice and practice to the point that it becomes automatic kind of things and that activity of that region now is modified based on your exercise and your activity.\n\nSo there are ways that we hope we may be able to use in the future to see whether we can use, can maybe improve or help these people to care more about.  But again we need to identify not just the region that is involved, but also at what point of the decision-making is happening.  So is it the motivation that is lacking, is just the attention, or is the general level of activity of that area, I mean, we don't know yet.  What is the reason why harm is done or you don't care to the other.  And if you consider that these decisions are always or in most of the cases this balance between a cost and a benefit, what you need to do is we need to readjust the cost-benefit balance which complicates the thing a little bit more.  But that's the way we want to go but it's the future.  So you also have this ethical aspect like, so it depends what — if somebody, like, with psychopathy, is just in the tail of the normal distribution right, so it is not just the specific dysfunction, but it's just a normal variability that went to the extreme, right, then where would you put the line and say, \"Okay, now I intervene to change these and when I don't\".  Because we know that certain traits or certain aspects of psychopathy can be useful in society as well.  So, then it becomes an ethical problem of when do we actually intervene?  And do we want to intervene early in kids that already manifest aggressive behaviour, or do we need to let them experience it and then act later on.\n\nSo there are a lot of considerations before doing interventions on these topics.\n\n Are there any future plans to explore more on the harm aversion and its evolution?\n\n Ah, yes there are a lot of plans and, roads, let's say.  One of the plans we have is to really understand a little bit even more in details what is happening in the brain, at the cellular level and which are the inputs of these  are involved, what type of neurons are involved and all these aspect[s], we are also interested in trying [to] understand the developmental curve, what is happening, for instance, if you are exposed to a very stressful life when you're young, what kind of consequence it has on harm aversion later in life.  And we are interested in seeing how it is also transmitted through generations, like if you have these variabilities between individuals, with some individuals having higher propensity to be prosocial, or whether, you know, you select individuals that are mostly prosocial, would this selection be brought forward in the next generation.  So we also want also to see how much is learned and how much is more genetically encoded.  So all these aspects, we are trying to tackle with different experiment.  And let's hope we — of course the other aspects are very early at this stage.\n\n What are the other research you are currently working on?\n\n [laughs] You want them all?  No, okay, so as I mentioned from the animal's point-of-view, we are doing, we want to do  on the, a bit more of the physiology, and up the genetic to discover the role of the ACC and each single cell of the ACC, as I mentioning before.  So, is it for instance, let's say, what type of cells is involved in mapping the other pain into my own pain.  And where the information comes from, so what is the circuit that is involved, and how the other things change the information: this is one aspect of one of the experiments we're gonna run.\n\nIn humans, for instance, we are also, we've been implementing a lot of learning paradigms, similar to the one in this paper where people are faced with two symbols: they have to understand what are the consequences of choosing one versus the other and one symbol most often brings you higher reward, monetary reward, but also you would also see the other be more in pain, and the other symbol is the opposite.  And we again want to understand whether the circuit that is involved is the same as we see in the animal and vice-versa.  And again, whether we would like to simulate some of the areas we find, to see how the causality between this particular brain activity and the behaviour.  And we are also curious to see whether it matters, whether you see the other person being in pain in front of you, for instance, compared to simply receiving a message that the other person is in pain.  Because we believe that the embodiment component mainly comes into play when you see the other person.  You can also recall some embodiment processes through text.  But whether there is a difference between the two, we don't know.  So we are also interested in that aspect, and also interested in differentiating whether when you encounter such a type of conflict, whether there is a negative consequence like pain vs money as a reward; whether you value the pain of the other similarly to how much you value the pain for yourself.\n\nAnd this is just a glimpse on all the things we are are doing.  I would say, on this aspect.  We also are interested in experiments that are trying to see how [we] ourselves encode emotions, do we have cells that code for happiness and cells that code for pain, painfulness or sadness or the cells simply encode the negative and positive aspect towards how strong it is.  Independently of a specific emotion.  So these are also other questions we have.  Unless you want to mention more, but I think it is plenty.\n\n Yeah.\n\n Yeah.\n\n What is your role at the ?\n\n Yeah, so we basically are both of us department heads, so that means that we each have a a group of people we basically manage.  And of course we really work very very closely together.  So our two groups kind of together form what we call the Social Brain Lab which is basically investigating how our brain processes the emotions of others and reacts to them.\n\n Well, that were all the questions we had for you both.\n\n Okay.  Very good.\n\n Is there something you would like to add?\n\n No.\n\n No, I think it was quite thorough.  Yeah.\n\n Thank you very much for agreeing for this [interview].  It was great pleasure discussing this with you.\n\n You are welcome.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Thank you. B-bye.

{"title": "Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti discusses observation of birth of potential exoplanet with Wikinews", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Astronomer Anthony Boccaletti discusses observation of birth of potential exoplanet with Wikinews}}\n\nIn March, a study conducted by astronomer Anthony Boccaletti and other researchers reported potential signs of formation of an exoplanet around the star .  Exoplanets are those planets which are outside the .\n\nThe host star AB Aurigae is a young star, roughly five million years old, Boccaletti told Wikinews.  In contrast, the  is approximately 4.6 billion years old.  Located in the , AB Aurigae is about 520  away from the .  The astronomers observed the  around the star.\n\nThe astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's  in Chile to study this system.  Boccaletti told Wikinews the twists they saw in the protoplanetary disk of gas and dust could be the formation of either a humongous planet, bigger than Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System; or it could less likely be a star, or a .\n\nThe disturbance in the twist is located around 30  — one astronomical unit is the distance between the Sun and the Earth — from the host star.  That is almost the distance from the Sun to .  However, the host star AB Aurigae is more massive than the Sun: about 2.4 times the .  AB Aurigae is classified as a  star, which are known for their brightness.\n\nBoccaletti and his team started observing the system in 2019.  Boccaletti said the researchers would like to follow up the study to confirm the observed twists are indeed the birth of an exoplanet.  \"[I]f we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up\", he said.\n\nThere exists multiple theories of exoplanet formation, however, the formation of an exoplanet has never been observed till date.  Discovered in 2016,  is one of the youngest exoplanets known so far, and it is about 9.3 million years old.\n\nBoccaletti, who works at the , discussed his findings with Wikinews last month.\n\n Thank you for agreeing to discuss your findings on formation of exoplanets.  I would like to discuss the study, and the inferences; as well as what lies ahead to be studied.\n\n What prompted your interest in astronomy?\n\n Why I am interested in astronomy?\n\n Yeah.\n\n Uhh... [laughs] because it's fun.  [laughs]  Because it's — it's about objects that are very far from us, and which we never observed before.  So it's always very challenging to understand astrophysical objects which are very distant from us; and very different from what we see in the , for instance.\n\n How did you get involved with this study?\n\n I was involved because I also took part in the building of the instrument.  So the instrument that we used at the Very Large Telescope; instrument is a  [Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research].  And so we started the design of the instruments back in 2005, I would say.  So I was involve[d] already at this step.  And then when the instrument was implemented on the sky, on the telescope, I was also involved in the survey, that was accomplished with this telescope.  And, in addition to the survey — in addition to all the observations that the  of people who built the instrument was running — I also had my own programs with other colleagues.  And this result is part of these other programs.\n\n Was this instrument built specifically for this research?\n\n It was built for imaging exoplanets and also .\n\n What drew your attention to  in the  in the first place?\n\n Well it's because it was already observed before, of course, so we knew that there was a  around the star.  And the most recent images were obtained with Alma: the .  It's an  working in .  And from this telescope, we already had a suspicion that there might be a planet in formation in this disc.  And this is why we decided to use SPHERE to observe this system.\n\n Could you explain this study and its findings?\n\n Yes so: so AB Aurigae is a star which is more massive than the , but also very very young.  The Sun is like 4.5 billion years old; while AB Aurigae is probably only like 5 million years old.  So very young.  And around young stars, we expect planets could be very bright because we are observing in the .  And so we knew that there was a protoplanetary disc around AB Aurigae.  That means a system with a lot of gas, and a lot of dust.  And so when we see this, you can find out that this gas and this dust will evolve into planets.  So this is what we focused on.  We decided to observe with SPHERE in order to observe the very details in the protoplanetary system of AB Aurigae and try to identify if there was [a] planet in the system.  And so what we find is that we have a lot of structures.  And we call these spirals because they have  shapes and these spirals are in fact gas, which are taking this shape.  And usually, when we see a spiral, we can infer that there is an object which is  the gas.  The gravitation impact of an object in the gas produces a spiral.  So when you see a spiral in a disk, you try to find which object has triggered the spiral.  Because you know that it's produced by an instability.  So this instability could be anything, but it could be also [a] planet: [a] planet in formation.  So we try to identify if some of these pattern[s], structures in the disk could be related to the presence of a planet.  And so, when we get the images from SPHERE, we find that one of the spiral[s] was twisted.  And it's not a perfect spiral, you have a kind of structure at the tip of one of the spirals, which looks like a twist.  Like if the spiral was twisted.  And this is exactly what we expect from modelisation, from .  When you ask people doing modelling, what looks like a system in which a planet is forming, and if you have gas in this system, what the image looks like, and they will give you an image which resembles a lot what we observe in AB Aurigae.  So we did not observe a planet, okay? We never detect[ed] a planet.  We detect[ed] a structure which could be the impact of a planet on to the gas.  On to this spiral.  So this is indirect: indirect\ndetection.\n\nThe other problem is that we don't know which mass is creating this structure, this spiral.  So we see the spiral, we see the structure, we have theories indicating that it could be [a] planet.  But we are not able to measure the mass of the object.  So, we concluded that it could be a planet, but it could be also something more massive than a planet.  Like maybe a  for instance, an object a little bit more massive than a planet.  So it's still a study that is ongoing.  We are continuing the observations in order to determine if this is actually a planet in formation, or if it is another type of object.\n\n What was the timeline of the study?\n\n Oh, the timeline was typically we started by asking telescope-time.  So, requesting telescope-time like a year\nago; last year, basically.  The request for observing time was accepted.  And then, the observation were executed in December 2019.  Last year.\n\n Were you initially looking for signs of formation of an exoplanet specifically?\n\n Yes, definitely.  This is exactly why we are observing very young star.  Because we know that the planets are forming when a star is very young; so when it's like one million or five million years old.  And it took about probably a million year for a planet to form.  So it is important to look at very young planet, if you want to understand how the planet forms, you need to look at very young systems.\n\n How many countries were involved in the study?\n\n Countries! Oh, so we have some people from France, people from US, people from Taiwan, and people from Belgium.  So we have four countries.\n\n And how many people were involved in this study?\n\n Let me check exactly the number of people if I can.  I think we were like ten people?  I can check directly.  There are one, two, three [counts].  We are eleven people.\n\n And what are their roles?\n\n Oh, the roles of the other people? Okay, so the other people contributed to the interpretation of the data, mostly.  So once we have done the observation, we need to understand what we are observing.  So we need to compare the observation with models for instance.  So, a lot of people contributed to this comparison.  Some people contributed to making a link with the previous data we have with ALMA.  And that's basically the role of the other people.  And some of them also contributed to the writing of the paper.\n\n From which observatory were the observations made?\n\n They were made from the Very Large Telescope in Chile.\n\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n\n That's a good point.  [laughs]  I think it's definitely the last: the last phase, of writing the paper.\n\n And what was the most difficult part of this investigation?\n\n Well the most difficult was to be convinced that we are actually looking at something which is very new, so we need to convince ourselves that it's valuable for scientific publication.  It's not specifically hard, but it requires to be convinced, so to make sure that you have done the analysis correctly.  You don't make any mistake, et cetera.\n\n What was your first reaction when you concluded it is likely to be the formation of an exoplanet?\n\n I think it was very exciting, even though we don't have an image of an exoplanet directly.  Having even a suspicion that it could be a planet-forming, since it is very new; it was very exciting.\n\n What was the most fascinating aspect of this study?\n\n Well again it's about the same question but, I think it gives it gives some perspective in the work.  So it's a system for which we will re-observe, ask more telescope time to perform more observation, because if we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up.  So to monitor the system, make sure that it's a planet, make sure that it rotates around the star, et cetera.\n\n What were some of the challenges the team faced during the study?\n\n The challenges?\n\n Yes.\n\n Um.  Well the challenges [are]: first, to get very good observation; and, well you know, when you observe at the telescope, sometimes the conditions are good, sometimes they are not so good.  And I think we were very lucky to have very good — extremely good condition, in fact.  So the fact that we see very clearly something is also related to the quality of the data, the quality of the telescope, of the instruments.  So that's the first challenge to get the data with a very good quality.  And then the second challenge is to compare the observation with the models.  Because there are many models.  Some are more or less complex.  Some are very detailed.  Some are less detailed.  And you have to figure out which one is the most appropriate for the comparison.  Because you don't want to make an interpretation that is too far.  You don't want to conclude something that is not very correct.  So you need also to make sure that you use the right model.  And so, you use one of the models that exists.  It's not the most sophisticated.  It's the one, on the opposite, which is almost the simplest.  Because it's enough to interpret the images, in fact.  So now, of course we need to think about models that are more detailed in order to explain the observations.\n\n Which technologies were used on this study?\n\n So we use a technology called  which is something which is integrated into the instrument which is able to correct for the .  So, when the light from the star cross[es] the  of the , it becomes blurred.  And we are correcting this blurring in order to have very very fine detail on the images.  So that's one of the one of the technolog[ies] we are using.\n\nThe second one is .  So exactly like a system which is able to observe the  .  So you block: when you block the Sun and you try to see around the Sun, well it's the same sort of technology but applied to stars instead of the Sun.  So all the stars — and so the stars are much smaller — and this system is able to block the light from the star, so you can see everywhere around, and look for planets, look for discs, look for structures.  These are the two main technologies we used.\n\n Why were these two technologies ideal for this study?\n\n Oh, um yeah, it's not the only ones but yeah, they are necessary to perform this study, definitely.  Yeah.\n\n What makes this study unique?\n\n Well, it's not unique because we have already many observation of planetary systems.  We have a lot of observation of disks — protoplanetary disks — and especially SPHERE has observed a lot of them.  We also have images of planets.  And we know that planet are forming inside disks: inside protoplanetary disks.  And we know that planet should generate structures like spirals in a disk.  So we knew from the theory that planet and spirals are connected, but we never ever made the connection between the two.  So we never observed in the same system a planet and the spiral, ok.  So here, we don't have exactly observed that because we did not detect the planet, but we detected the presence of the planet in the structure of the spiral.  So we are getting one step closer to making the connection between the planet and the spirals, and the structures in the disk.\n\n What is currently the best explanation for the formation of exoplanets?\n\n There are several scenarios for forming exoplanets and we have only — we never witness planet formation, so we only have theories, which are based on a lot of observations, of course, including observations of the Solar System, planet in the Solar System, et cetera.  The analysis of rocks on the Earth as well in the Solar System.  But we [have] never seen a planet forming.  So, there are several theories.  One of them is that you have rocks forming into the system.  And these rocks are colliding, they are making bigger rocks. Bigger and bigger.  And when this rock has reached a mass which is large enough, like maybe ten times the mass of the Earth, then this big rock, this big planet, starts to accrete the gas.  And it becomes a giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  So that's the theory for forming a giant planet.\n\nThere are other way to form  planet, rocky planet, like the Earth.  But here, in fact, the [case] we were talking about — if it is a planet, it's necessarily a planet that is big like Jupiter, or maybe even bigger.  So we believe that the planet form first: the rock of the core of the planet is forming first.  And when the core is formed, then it accretes the gas, which literally falls on the core of the planet, and it makes a bigger planet: which is a  planet.\n\n So what kind of exoplanet will this be if this planet forms?\n\n It will be a giant planet, really.  Maybe even bigger than Jupiter.  Maybe 10 times the mass of Jupiter.  But it couldn't be a planet that is like the Earth.  If it were a planet like the Earth, it wouldn't make this kind of spiral.  The spiral would not be detectable, in that case.  So it's necessarily a very big planet.\n\n So, is it safe to conclude that it could be a ?\n\n No, it's not a hot Jupiter.  Because, well hot Jupiter means two different type[s] of planets.  Jupiter can be hot if it is very close to the star.  And this is usually what we refer when we say hot Jupiter.  But, when a planet like Jupiter is forming, then the temperature is very high.  It's like one thousand, maybe two thousand degrees.  So, it's also a hot Jupiter.  But not because it's close to the star: because it's young, okay.  So here, we are talking about a young Jupiter planet which is probably very warm.\n\n What do we know about the planetary system that is being formed?\n\n Well we don't know much, in fact.  [laughs]  We know we know a little bit about the edge of the system.  We know the quantity of gas and dust that is there, and which will form planets anyway.  But we don't know yet how many planets are formed; if this planet will survive, et cetera.  So there's still a lot to be understood about this system.\n\n Why do you think this planet may not survive?  [...]  As you mentioned we do not know if this planet is going to survive.\n\n Yeah, because some planets: some planet form in the disk, okay.  If you have a planet forming in the disk, then the disk is made of gas.  And when the planet rotate[s] around the star, then there is a friction with the gas.  And so the planet slow[s] down.  And when it slow[s] down, it gets closer to the star.  And eventually, it can be a hot Jupiter.  And sometimes, it can even disappear into the star: swallowed by the star.  So we know that some planets are forming in systems and they finally end up merging with the star.  They disappear\ninto the star.  So we don't know if all planets survive, in fact.  Well this one is probably like 30  [an astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, about 150 million km; 93 million miles] away from the star.  So it's very far away.  There's not a lot of change for this planet to migrate very close and disappear in the star.  But we know that it can happen.\n\n Could you tell us more about the host star?\n\n The star is more massive than the Sun.  It's 2.4 times the mass of the Sun [mass of Sun = about 2×1030 kg].  It's also very young, as I said, only a few million years.  Yeah.  Essentially that's the two parameters.\n\n And what do we know about the history of the system?\n\n Not much.  [laugh]  Unfortunately, not much.  No.  We don't even have an exact measurement of the age.  Because it can be between like one and five million years old.  So it's not very accurate.\n\n This host star is a  star, right?\n\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n What are some of the typical characteristics of a Herbig Ae star?\n\n They are very bright.  Because they are very massive, so it's essentially the mass of the star which makes it an Herbig star.  And they have also a lot of emissions.  So, when we started observing star with , we realised that it had signatures in the spectrum, and in fact, the reason why they have signature is because they have an environment of gas.  So, the light from the star is traveling through the gas, and creates some absorption, or emission in some cases.  And we see this is a signature in the spectrum.  So, the fact that it's a Herbig Ae star means in fact, that it is surrounded by a disk.\n\n How common are these stars?\n\n Oh, I don't have a clear idea of that.  [laughs]  [I] cannot answer.\n\n And how often do Herbig stars have orbiting planets?\n\n I don't know if we have already example.  I don't think we have many example[s] of planets around the Herbig Ae star.  It could be it could be one of the first, in fact, yeah.  Not many.\n\n As you mentioned, the spot formation of this potential planet is quite far from the host star — 30 astronomical units — what does the distance between this spiral and the star tell us?\n\n Well it tells us that planet[s] can form at 30 astronomical units.  That's already: I mean if it is really a planet in formation then it forms at 30 astronomical unit.  Which is not of use, in fact.  And, in fact, we never, as I said before, we never witnessed a planet at formation.  So it tells us that really, a planet can form at such a distance from the star.  In the Solar System, 30 astronomical unit is very far.  It's the orbit of .  But this one is not the Solar System; it's not the Sun.  It's more massive than the Sun.  So, 30 astronomical units — it's far away, but not not as far as in the Solar System, okay.  But at least we see that it's possible to form as a planet at this position.\n\n In what ways will this distance affect the planet formation?\n\n I don't know.  Well, we don't have a clear idea of that.\n\n Were there any unique traits in the orbit of the system?\n\n The orbit?  No.  Well we don't have the orbit yet.  I mean, we just have an image, and we don't have the full orbit yet.  So, we don't really know yet what is the orbit.\n\n When did you first consider the possibility of it being a birth of an exoplanet, rather than being something else?\n\n Well, as I said it's when we started to realise that the image was very similar to the models.  So, it's a suspicion that it should be a planet forming.  Although it's not a firm conclusion, of course.\n\n What other plausible hypothesis of what this twist might be?\n\n It could be a more massive object.  It could be a .  It could be a star also; it's unlikely, but it could be a star.  It could be also just what we call  in a system.  So not always related to planets.  But other sort of instability.  A planet is somehow an instability because, while it rotates in the disk of gas, it disrupts the disk, the gas and create an instability.  But an instability can arise also for other reasons than a planet.\n\n And how do they rule out the other possibilities?\n\n Well, we're not completely ruling out the other possibilities.  If it were a star, it should have been visible as a star.  So, we believe it's not a star.  Well, at least it's not likely.  And this is why we believe it should be a planet.  Something that we don't see directly.  We don't detect it.\n\n Is there a possibility this system might form multiple exoplanets?\n\n Yes, definitely.  Definitely.  Because we see a lot of spirals.  And if each of the spiral was actually a planet, then that means a lot of planets.  So in principle, when a system from one planet, there is no reason for not forming other planets.\n\n And how many exoplanets are we talking about?\n\n Oh, we don't know. [laughs] We don't know at all.\n\n What does the analysis of radiation emission spectrum of the system reveal?\n\n In fact it's difficult, because it's not straightforward to measure the emission because of the disk.  So the disk has a lot of structures and so it's difficult to measure the  from the planet.  And in fact, we believe that we are not able to detect the flux of the planet.  And this is why we conclude that we don't see the planet.  So we see only the flux from the gas and the dust in the system, but not from the planet directly.\n\n What do we know about the composition of the dust and gas in the spiral?\n\n Well, we know that there are molecules in this system; like , for instance.  Certainly also a lot of , of course.  And for the dust, it can be any kind of dust because we don't have very strong constraints.  So in fact, the dust that we see with SPHERE is different than the dust that we will see with another telescope, because we are not using the same .  So with SPHERE's near-infrared we are sensitive to dust that have sizes of a few  [1 micron = 0.001 mm] — little grains — and we don't see the other big grains, in fact.  It doesn't mean that they are not there.  It means that we don't have the sensitivity to see it.  So there's a whole distribution of dust; dust sizes.\n\n What kind of atmosphere will this potential planet [be] likely to have in future?\n\n Well certainly a gas planet; so with an atmosphere of hydrogen and , in majority.\n\n How many spirals were observed?\n\n So in the central part we see at least two big spirals.  But in fact, all these spirals have little structures, so we see a lot of them.  But mostly in the very inner part.  And then, if you look at the very outer part, then you see a lot of a lot more spirals.  But we believe that these ones are not due to planets, but more to instabilities.\n\n Were these two spirals interfering?\n\n  Um, yes, probably!  Probably.  Yeah, if you have more planets in the system, then they all launch spirals.  And all of them interfere.\n\n How big were these spirals?\n\n How big?  They can be several several hundreds of astronomical units.\n\n What does the next few million years for this system look like?\n\n Probably that in one million year the planet will be formed.  And most of the gas will be dissipated.  So, all the disk we see in the image will disappear and we will be left with planets.  Or maybe it will take more than one million year.  Maybe five or ten.  That's the point.  We don't know exactly.\n\n If that is the case this will make it the youngest discovered exoplanet so far, right?\n\n Yes, if it is an exoplanet, then it's the youngest, yeah.\n\n When do astronomers use  of the stars?\n\n Well we use an infrared because it's the wavelength where we can use adaptive optics also.  So with adaptive optics, we can provide very detailed images.  And we need to resolve the very central part of system so we need adaptive optics.  So near-infrared is interesting because you can use adaptive optics, and also because it's the range where you expect a planet to be very bright.  If you look in the visible [light range], the planet will be very faint.\n\n How do you test your hypothesis?\n\n How do we test the hypothesis?  Of what — Of the planet?  Of the object being the planet?\n\n Yes.\n\n Well, again I think it's: at the moment the only test is to compare with the models.  That's the only thing we can do.\n\n What is your role at the ?\n\n I'm a researcher.  And I work on exoplanets and protoplanetary disks.  Yeah, mostly I work also on design of instruments.  I'm doing instrumentation and observations and interpretation of observations.\n\n Is your team planning to study more about this system?\n\n Yes definitely.  We already asked for more telescope time to re-observe AB Aurigae.\n\n And what do you expect to find about the system this time?\n\n We would like to confirm first that the structure is still visible.  To see if it rotates around the star in a .  And if the the shape of the spiral is stable or evolve[s] over time.\n\n What lies ahead to be discovered about exoplanets?\n\n A lot of things.  [laughs]  Many many many things, yeah.  [laughs]  It will be too long to describe what has to be done on exoplanets.  It's really a young science.  So, in particular, we need to understand how they form.  And what they are made of, also.\n\n Are we be likely to find more instances of planet formation in the near future?\n\n Yeah, yes.  Definitely. We've instruments like SPHERE or  [Gemini Planet Imager] or other instruments that are installed on 8-meter telescopes.  Also with the next Space Telescope, , you will find out more planets.  The next big telescope on the Earth will be the  which is a 38-meter telescope.  So also we expect to find more planets.\n\n How can this discovery influence what we already know about planet formation?\n\n  Again I think it's really because it's a very young system.  So we never really observe this stage with SPHERE.  We have done that with ALMA — with the instrument ALMA — we can observe very young system, but we don't see the same thing.  We see mostly big dust, and gas.  But with SPHERE, it's really new to be interested in very very young stars.\n\n What do we now know about planet formation that we didn't know before?\n\n What we learn is typically that a planet could form at 30 astronomical unit from a star, that is more massive than the Sun.  And that it has an impact on the distribution of the gas and the dust.  That's mostly what we learned.  And of course, this system is a cornerstone, and we'll probably observe more systems like AB Aurigae in the future.\n\n What are some of the other studies you are currently working on?\n\n That's typically on other systems that are a bit older than AB Aurigae, in fact.  Usually the stars we are observing with SPHERE are like 10 or 20 million years old.  It's basically — less than 50 million years old.  Between 10 and 50, say, million years.  And they have gas and dust around, so we can detect discs.  And so we are performing a survey of hundreds of stars to detect new planets.\n\n Well, those were all the questions I had for you.  Would you like to add anything?\n\n No. I think we we already covered the subject very much.  Thank you for your questions.\n\n Thank you for agreeing for this interview.  It has been a great pleasure discussing this with you.\n\n Oh, me too.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Constitution and Libertarian parties as well as the chosen  of the leading Green Party presidential candidate. \n\nAt the beginning of May, with the Coronavirus Pandemic ongoing and s easing in some states, presumptive US Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent US President Donald Trump of the Republican Party in the  average of head-to-head opinion polls, 47.4 percent to 42.1 percent.  In an    poll with then-US Libertarian Party presidential candidate Congressman  included, Biden led Trump 47 percent to 40 percent with 5 percent for Amash. \n\nCongressman Amash, who changed his party registration to Libertarian, contended for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, but dropped out of the race just ahead of the party's online . At the convention, the party's  vice presidential nominee, , won the presidential nomination.  Podcaster  received the vice presidential nomination.  In other third parties, at its own online , the US Constitution Party nominated a ticket of businessman Don Blankenship for president and Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman  for vice president.  For the US Green Party, former Minnesota   joined the party and had signaled an intent to run but ultimately decided against it.   Labor activist  broadened his lead among pledged Green Party delegates, approaching the number required to secure the nomination at the online , scheduled for July 11. Hawkins, who is also the presidential nominee of the , had his hopes of a left-wing coalition dashed when it was reported the ballot-qualified Peace and Freedom Party of California and the  of Vermont chose  presidential nominee  as their presidential nominee.   Hawkins selected 2016 Socialist Party USA vice presidential nominee  to be his running mate.     \n\nBiden first addressed the  from former staffer Tara Reade, on television program .  When confronted with the accusation he penetrated Reade, against her will, using his fingers under her clothing in 1993, Biden told host  \"No, it is not true. I am saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn't. It never happened.\"  Meanwhile, a new allegation surfaced from a woman, a niece of Biden's  opponent , who claimed Biden commented on the size of her breasts when she was 14 years old.  The campaign called the statement \"absolutely false.\"  An organizer said Biden was not at the event specified.  O'Donnell defended her niece's claim, saying it may have taken place at a different time. \nBiden searched for a female running mate.  candidate  of Georgia, Congresswoman  of Florida, Senator  of Illinois, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and   were mentioned as possibilities.  Biden said he planned to announce his choice around August 1.  Continuing a trend from earlier months, Biden made a couple of  in May.  First, he juxtaposed numbers, claiming 85,000 Americans were unemployed and millions had died from coronavirus.  More consequential, he told African American radio host  \"if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.\"  Backlash from the statement led Biden to express \"I shouldn’t have been so cavalier [...]  No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.\"  In another incident, as Biden remarked on investigation, shortly before President Trump took office, of then--designee General Michael Flynn, Biden failed to mention his own request at the time to unmask Flynn's identity.  The unmasking came to light shortly thereafter in a release of documents related to alleged  abuse,  which President Trump described as \"Obamagate.\"  An analysis of anti-Biden memes showed \"Dementia Joe\" as a popular characterization of Biden. \n\nPresident Trump made several controversial statements in May.  Early in the month, he received additional fallout from a statement he made in late April about the use of disinfectant inside the body to treat coronavirus.  He hinted that the  would be disbanded, but later reversed himself.  Nevertheless, the task force's daily press conferences did cease.  Trump said he himself took the drug , which he promoted early in the pandemic as a counter-measure against coronavirus, despite reports about the side effects.  He tweeted support for the protests to end statewide shutdown orders despite it undermining his own guidelines.  He also promoted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory suggesting Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a Congressional intern in 2001.  When Trump tweeted that state plans to use  to allow people to vote from home would result in voter fraud, Twitter placed a disclaimer \"fact checking\" the tweet.  In response, Trump issued an  making social media that exercises editorial control open to liability.  Twitter continued to edit Trump's tweets.  Trump tweeted about the  that followed the death of , an African American man who died in Minneapolis while a police officer restrained him.  Part of Trump's tweet included the statement, \".\"  Twitter disallowed comments and likes and placed a warning over the tweet alerting viewers it promoted violence.  Trump later said he meant looting leads to somebody getting shot, perhaps by rioters.  The phrase itself has historic, racial overtones, of which Trump claimed to be unaware.  Meanwhile, Trump attended the joint NASA-  and delivered a speech to mark the occasion.\n\nBy the end of the month, with coronavirus deaths surpassing 100,000  and protests and riots related to the death of Floyd spreading throughout the nation, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of opinion polls, 48.4 percent to 42.5 percent. \n\nAt the Constitution Party's 2020 National Convention conducted online May 2, the party nominated businessman Don Blankenship for president on the second ballot.  For vice president, the party unanimously chose  — the Constitution Party's affiliate in Michigan — chairman William Mohr. \n\nWhile Blankenship has been widely covered for his role as CEO of  during the 2010  that resulted in the deaths of 29 miners, his subsequent conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, his one year imprisonment, and his unsuccessful  for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia,  Mohr is relatively unknown. He was a candidate for  in every election from 2006 to 2014.  He received 3 percent of the vote in his 2012 run and 2.3 percent in his 2014 run.\n\nIn 2016, the Constitution Party ticket of  for president and  for vice president received 203,091 votes (0.15 percent)  with ballot access in 24 states.   For 2020 the party is currently on the ballot in 14 states. \n\nWith Wikinews, Mohr discussed how his nomination for vice president came about, his role on the Blankenship/Mohr ticket, and the prospects for the ticket.\n\n How did your nomination for vice president come about? Did you seek the role or was it thrust upon you?\n\nMohr: I neither sought the office, nor was it thrust upon me.  My good friend, Darrell Castle, asked me to run and nominated me for the position.  The nomination was immediately supported by many who know me well.  Given the support I received in voice, text, those within the national delegates, and that I was chosen by Don Blankenship for his running mate, I decided to accept.  I am humbly honored to serve my party and the nation in this capacity.\n\n What are your thoughts on presidential nominee Don Blankenship? How do you complement him on the ticket?\n\nMohr: Don Blankenship is a good man with vast knowledge in the political field.  He stands firm on his positions, aligns well with the party platform and has an abundance of ability to lead this nation in the direction it needs to go.  His political history demonstrates his ability to influence leaders around him.  He has a backbone superior to most men and will be the strongest President we have seen in decades.\n\nCombined with my longtime message on the need for a return to morality in our states and nation, I am convinced that the Blankenship/Mohr ticket will simply be the best thing that has happened in Washington in a long, long time.\n\n With the coronavirus pandemic hampering ballot access efforts, is it possible to improve on the electoral performance of 2016 presidential nominee Darrell Castle?  What can you do to improve the visibility of the ticket?\n\nMohr: The American people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are being ruled by tyrants.  Times are changing in our nation. Many current elected officials are promoting false information and gaining much power and control by using this virus as their vehicle. The so-called pandemic has enlightened the masses to the point of large demonstrations and protests.  In recent years Constitution Party vote counts have increased considerably and we are winning more and more offices, small and large.  Recent actions by elected leaders have only led the masses farther away from the big two parties.  I expect to see a large increase in voters searching for alternatives, which will certainly create yet a greater increase in visibility for the Constitution Party.\n\nOn May 23 at the online Libertarian National Convention, the Libertarian Party nominated  psychologist Jo Jorgensen, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, for president on the fourth ballot.  The next day, the party nominated podcast host Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen for vice president on the third ballot.  Cohen, who went into the convention as the running mate of performance artist Vermin Supreme, was not the candidate Jorgensen initially backed for the vice presidential nomination.\n\nCohen, who goes by his nickname \"Spike\", which he has explained derives from a character on ‘’’’, was initially a  but shifted to libertarianism.  In 2016, he was diagnosed with . He is co-owner of Muddied Waters Media, which features his podcast (((My Fellow Americans))).\n\nWith Wikinews, Cohen discussed his journey from neoconservatism to libertarianism, his role on the Jorgensen-Cohen ticket, and how to improve on the performance of the party's 2016 ticket of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld for vice president, which received 4,489,235 votes (3.27 percent).\n\n What was it that turned you away from neoconservatism to begin your transition to libertarianism?\n\nCohen: First it was seeing how the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq actually played out, and that made me re-examine what I believed and actually form a political philosophy.\n\n How would you describe your role as vice presidential nominee?  How do you complement Jo Jorgensen on the ticket?\n\nCohen: I think the role of VP nominee is to help complement the ticket for the party faithful, to support the POTUS candidate, to promote her policies and beliefs (which isn't difficult to do because they're mine as well), to broaden the appeal of the ticket to the public, and generally to support her in running for President. I believe that Jo and I present a unique opportunity to reach voters across many age groups, and to campaign in both traditional and dynamic, cutting-edge ways to a public that is more open to an alternative to the Republicrats and their nonsense than ever before.\n\n How can you improve on the performance of Johnson-Weld in 2016?\n\nCohen: Gary and Bill largely relied on outside agencies and beltway media connections to do their campaigning. A lot of complaints that I've heard from Libertarian activists and downballot candidates is that they felt completely left behind and unsupported in 2016.  We are running an across-the-board, homegrown Libertarian campaign that is designed to lift up the whole party. We also aren't relying on corporate media to tell our story, but instead are going to focus on viral marketing and social media reach to create earned media exposure that will force the mainstream media to pay attention to us, on our terms. We believe that will get us the 15% we need in the polls to get in the debates, and when that happens, we have a serious shot to win. Imagine having the two buffoons with a long history of contributing to our problems, and who are now barely able to form a coherent sentence, debating against an accomplished, self-made, brilliant leader who will be able to debate circles around them. And imagine me debating Mike Pence and...whoever has the misfortune of being Biden's running mate.\n\nOn May 5, US Green Party presidential frontrunner and the presidential nominee of Socialist Party USA, Howie Hawkins, announced his selection of a running mate for the 2020 presidential race.  Hawkins, a union leader and co-founder of the Green Party approaching securing the delegates required for the Green Party's presidential nomination, tapped Socialist Party USA's 2016 vice presidential nominee Angela Walker. \n\nWalker, a truck driver who currently resides in South Carolina, first met Hawkins in 2014 while she was running for Sheriff of , Wisconsin as an independent socialist and Hawkins was  for  for the Green Party.  Walker received 20 percent of the vote in her race  and Hawkins received five percent in his.   That showing was Hawkins' best in three successive runs for governor — , 2014, .  In 2016, Walker was 's running mate with Socialist Party USA.  The ticket received 2,705 votes.\n\nThe Green Party, which received 1,457,226 votes (1.06 percent) with the 2016 ticket of Jill Stein for president and  for vice president, is to nominate its ticket officially at its online national convention July 11.\n\nWikinews reached out to Walker to discuss how her past experience impacts the current race, why Hawkins/Walker is the best choice for leftists and socialists, and what goals she has for this campaign. \n\n How does your experience as a nominee for vice president in 2016 help in the current campaign? How is your role the same or different from 2016?  \n\nWalker: It's my pleasure to be the Vice Presidential nominee for the Socialist Party of the USA in 2020, as I was in 2016. The roles are the same: we want both the Green Party and the Socialist Party to grow and be welcoming spaces for people of color, people with disabilities, people along the LGBTQIA rainbow, people who have been wondering where they could fit into a party. Also, getting our platforms and party principles into communities is important. Marginalized communities in particular need to know that they have options outside the party duopoly we have in this country. Being part of a campaign I can believe in helps me reach folks in those communities.\n\n Why should leftists and socialists support Howie Hawkins over Gloria La Riva or the Bernie Sanders-backed candidate Joe Biden?\n\nWalker: Many on the Left are very excited about the concept of . They are interested in reversing climate change, and they're interested in having a  available to them. They are also interested in social justice, making sure people are housed and fed and not abused by the state. All of these things are in our campaign platform. All of them. In detail. I can't speak for the LaRiva/ campaign platform, as I haven't read it. They are people who have my respect. And as to Biden, the fact that he does not support any of the issues people are asking for makes him a nonstarter. His cavalier statements and treatment of marginalized communities is also very problematic. Howie Hawkins is offering a platform that would improve the lives of everyone in this country while helping to reverse climate change. That is something I feel people can be confident about supporting.\n\n What are your goals for this campaign?\n\nWalker: My goals for this campaign are to help both the Green Party and the Socialist Party be welcoming spaces for marginalized people, and to get people politically educated around the country. Another goal is to help build true unity throughout the Left. We might not agree on everything, but there are many places where Leftists of different ideologies intersect. I want us to meet at those intersections and build from them. There is still a pandemic happening. There is an uprising happening. It is in the hands of the people how we help each other going forward, and I am looking forward to being helpful in those efforts.", "question": "Who was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party at the online national convention held on May 23, 2020?\n\nA) Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen  \nB) Jo Jorgensen  \nC) Gary Johnson  \nD) Bill Weld"}

Additionally, he delivered his final plea to voters ahead of Election Day.\n\n: Which past  do you most admire and why?\n\nBlankenship: .  Put his life where his mouth was.\n\n: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?\n\nBlankenship: I have dealt with the government and know its flaws.  I have been poor.  Rich.  In federal prison.  Defamed.  And I have beat the evil of the establishment over and over.  I know what we need to do if we are [to] save America from the politicians.\n\n: How would you describe your style of leadership?  How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?\n\nBlankenship: My leadership is based on truth and conviction.  I set the example by standing for what is right when what is right is not popular.\n\n[Neither] Trump nor Obama are leaders.  They are misleaders.\n\n: If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?\n\nBlankenship: I would have insisted that those with symptoms be quarantined.  I would have protected the elderly and allowed the youthful strong to work. \n\n: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?\n\nBlankenship: The pandemic greatly limited our opportunity to gain ballot access.  It is hard to get petition signatures when you cannot get within six feet of someone.\n\n: In 2016, Constitution Party presidential nominee  received 203,091 votes, a record for the party.  Based on your general feeling on the ground, about how many votes do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?\n\nBlankenship: We should do some better.  But were we on the ballot in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; we would have gotten twice the votes we will now get.\n\n: What would a Blankenship administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?\n\nBlankenship: It would look smaller as we would have fewer cabinet positions.  The cabinet would be made up of individuals who have not worked in government before but rather individuals from outside DC who have had to reckon with the government.\n\n: Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court?  Would you apply any ?  Should the number of justices remain at nine?\n\nBlankenship: Constitutional loyal judges.  The only litmus test would be whether their prior decisions were based in law or politics.  \n\n: As president, how would you work with Congress to avoid  and pass your agenda?\n\nBlankenship: Common sense pressure.  No drama allowed.  No  allowed.  Facts not fantasy.\n\n: What should be done, from the government's perspective, to combat global climate change?\n\nBlankenship: Nothing.  Our country has much more pressing and certain challenges than climate change.  We need to save America before we engage in preventing a half degree increase in temperature in the next century.  \n\n: What are your views on the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?\n\nBlankenship: We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs.  We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries.  Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues.\n\n: Are you concerned about the  and  censorship of notable  and ?  How would you address this issue as president?\n\nBlankenship: Free speech has to be fully protected unless it endangers others or is clearly defamatory.  Social media platforms should be just that.  They provide electronic assembly of the people.  They enable what the Constitution calls freedom of assembly.\n\nThere should be no censoring other than profane and similar talk.\n\n: What can you do, as president, to improve  in the United States?\n\nBlankenship: Stop granting \"privileges\" to one race which impede on the \"rights\" of another race. Equalize education but by neighborhood not by race.  Recognize that there are more poor white people than black people.  Accept that the problem is mostly a black issue not a race issue.  Use facts, not drama and rhetoric, as the basis for action.  End illegal immigration.\n\n: Election Day is quickly approaching and early voting has already started in some states. What is your final plea to voters?\n\nBlankenship: My final plea to voters is to understand that all your rights, your American way of life, your medical care, and your kids' future depend on America's survival.

Saturn reached out to Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons of Colorado to discuss Hammons's 2020 campaign for President of the United States.\n\nHammons, a former  manager and owner of the website \"Bill's List\", founded the Unity Party in 2004 with supporters of General 's unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. The party, which describes itself as , advocates in its constitution for, among other things, a , elimination of the , tax deduction for health care costs, a global minimum wage for fair trade,  for Congress and judges, lowering the voting age, , and expanded .\n\nHammons has grown the party with various campaigns for public office.  He ran for US Congress in 2008 and 2010, US Senate in 2014 and 2016, and for  in 2018.  Last year, Hammons embarked on a presidential campaign and became the Unity Party's first presidential nominee. Engineer Eric Bodenstab, the party's 2018 nominee for  was picked to be his running mate. Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews last August. The Hammons-Bodenstab ticket has qualified for ballot access in Colorado, Louisiana, and New Jersey.\n\nWith Wikinews, Hammons discusses his background, campaign, the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Supreme Court, and Black Lives Matter, among other issues.\n\n: Which past  do you most admire and why?\n\nHammons: .  Our first President set so many precedents, most important among them not making the Presidency any more powerful than it absolutely needs to be.\n\n: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?\n\nHammons: I am the Founder and Chairman of the 42-State Unity Party of America, as well as a former Manager at  Magazine (one of the joys of that job was reading both Newsweek and Newsweek International cover-to-cover on a weekly basis, and that reading gave me a firm foundation in knowledge and understanding of national and international affairs).  I am also the owner of Bill’s List, a website which has received as many as 17,000 visitors on a single day, and knowledge of how to reach the most Americans possible without relying on the all-too-fickle media is a crucial skill.\n\n: How would you describe your style of leadership?  How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama? \n\nHammons: I am a , with the attitude that all sides need to be listened to, even if I disagree with them.  It’s important to understand where someone else is coming from before you work to meet their needs and persuade them to work with you.\n\n: If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?\n\nHammons: Where do I begin.  We need to massively ramp up use of the -era  to produce all the materials we need to fight this Pandemic, a Pandemic which has already killed twice as many Americans as died in  and  combined.  Taiwan, a democratic nation of tens of millions directly across the  from China, has had exactly seven deaths from COVID, and we can do even better.  We need to be testing widely and constantly, and can boost our economy by hiring an army of federal Contact Tracers with the ability to call, text, email, and message via  each and every American who has been exposed to the deadly virus.  The CDC can work with Facebook and other Social Media companies to aid Contact Tracing outreach and build confidence (e.g., Contact Tracers can be given Social Media accounts with official badges, explanations of the tracing process and why it’s so important, etc.).  Hotels currently lying empty can be rented out for quarantining those who have been exposed and who don’t want to expose their families, and local restaurants can be contracted to provide contact-free room service for those quarantined.  Further, Federal unemployment insurance benefits can be offered to all Quarantiners to ease the financial impact of having to remain isolated for weeks at a time.\n\n: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?\n\nHammons: Before the Pandemic hit, I was knocking on doors on behalf of other Uniter candidates, and that crucial means of engaging with voters (many of whom still haven’t heard of the Unity Party) is gone until further notice.  Since declaring for the Presidency, my own campaign has instead been reaching out to voters with a top-notch text and phone call effort with some modest success.\n\n: Based on your general feeling on the ground, about how many votes do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?\n\nHammons: My vote count has been on a hockey stick graph trajectory for several years now, and I have no doubt that trend will continue through the 2020 election, along with Unity Party voter registrations which have gone vertical this Fall.\n\n: What would a Hammons administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?\n\nHammons: My model will be ’s “Team of Rivals” (it just so happens that Lincoln was another  candidate who came out of nowhere from the heart of the country, literally and symbolically, to win the Presidency).  I’ll bring on the Best and the Brightest, preferably individuals driven less by ideology than by a sincere desire to see a country run smoothly with a minimum of drama.  I’ll look for a mix of dedicated Civil Servants with the brass tacks experience of how government works along with turnaround types from backgrounds outside government who know how to get the impossible things done.\n\n: Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court? Would you apply any ?  Should the number of justices remain at nine?\n\nHammons: The only litmus test will be a nominee’s Common Sense desire to reach legal conclusions in keeping with both a strict  interpretation of the Constitution and the best interests of the country.  The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a  to prevent future , and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.\n\n: As president, how would you work with Congress to avoid gridlock and pass your agenda?\n\nHammons: The election of the first Unity Party President will be an earthquake certain to set off tectonic shifts across the American political landscape.  As a Uniter, I’ll use my freedom in the Center to force both sides to compromise or be tossed into the .\n\n: What should be done, from the government's perspective, to combat global climate change?\n\nHammons: We need to take a look at what no less than Bill Gates and scientists from  have been working on recently, and explore sending cooling dust (on a limited and experimental basis) into the atmosphere to lessen temperatures and thus buy the planet time for a long-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to have its own impact.\n\n: What are your views on the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?\n\nHammons: The United States could go a long way towards regaining the international stature it has lost with its inept COVID response by negotiating a resolution to yet another conflict with its roots in the ineptitude of the Soviet Union (the old  in everything but name).  The US could offer to impose peacekeepers, and warn both sides they will experience severe sanctions if any peacekeepers are harmed in any way.\n\n: Are you concerned about  and the censorship of certain views on social media?  How would you address this issue as president?\n\nHammons: I sincerely believe Facebook and other social media companies are doing the best they can to balance freedom of expression with protecting the democracy which has given us that same freedom of expression.  We could learn a lot from Germany, a distant mirror of a nation which was rebuilt from scratch by the US and others after World War II: German admirers of Adolph Hitler and  have many of their freedoms restricted, and, partly due to those restrictions, Germany has been a thriving democracy for decades.\n\n: What can you do, as president, to improve  in the United States?\n\nHammons: I can help the Black Lives Matter movement principles get a Bismarckian translation into reality ( was the one who observed that “Politics is the Art of the Possible”).  “Black Lives Matter Too” would be a title that would put a dent in the “” counterargument.  “” should be retitled “Refund the Police” (along with “Refund ,” for that matter) and we as a nation can take a sober look at how we can be a more harmonious nation going forward where all sides are respected and heard.", "question": "What position did Bill Hammons run for in the 2020 election as the Unity Party's first presidential nominee?  \n\nA) U.S. Senate  \nB) U.S. Congress  \nC) President of the United States  \nD) Governor of Colorado"}

The Lord Mayor election in the Australian city is scheduled to take place this week.\n\nTseng runs a firm called eTranslate, which helps software developers to make the software available to the users.  In the candidate's questionnaire, Tseng said eTranslate had led to him working with all three tiers of the government.  He previously belonged to the Australian Liberal Party, but has left since then, to run for mayorship as an independent candidate.\n\nTseng is of Chinese descent, having moved to Australia with his parents from Vietnam.  Graduated in Brisbane, Tseng received his PhD in Melbourne and has been living in the city, he told Wikinews.  Tseng also formed Chinese Precinct Chamber of Commerce, an organisation responsible for many \"community bond building initiatives\", the Lord Mayor candidate told Wikinews.\n\nTseng discussed his plans for leading Melbourne, recovering from COVID-19, and \"Democracy 2.0\" to ensure concerns of minorities in the city were also heard.  Tseng also focused on the importance of the multi-culture aspect and talked about making Melbourne the capital of the aboriginals.  Tseng also explained why he thinks Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030.\n\nTseng's deputy Lord Mayor candidate Gricol Yang is a Commercial Banker and works for .\n\nCurrently,  is the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, the Victorian capital.  Capp was elected as an interim Lord Mayor in mid-2018 after the former Lord Mayor  resigned from his position after sexual assault allegations.  Doyle served as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne for almost a decade since 2008.\n\n Can you tell us something about yourself?\n\n [I am an] Australian Citizen of Chinese descent [and] fluent ,  and  speaker.  Born in Vietnam and migrated to Australia with parent in the 1990s.  Graduated as a  in Brisbane and received a PhD in Melbourne.  Lectured in  before launching [my] firm eTranslate.\n\nI authored two teaching texts: Open Learning, Introduction to Project Management and Open Learning, Introduction to Assembly Language.\n\nThe firm which shares the same name as the USA firm eTranslate (but not related) specialises in language expertise and language information technology.  The firm has two arms — The technology arm focuses on services to help developers to create language variants of their software.  The language/cultural services arm provides cultural communication services to local government.  Australia is a lot of ethnic minorities speaking over 120 languages and over 80 cultures.\n\nAs the firm grew, I spent more [...] time in the cultural communication services arms.  There I served as the principal consultant leading a team which delivered consultancy services to all three levels of government in Australia.\n\nI also founded the non-profit organisation Chinese Precinct Chamber of Commerce which was responsible for a lot of Australia first Chinese and Australia community bond building initiatives.  I have a passion for community activities that leads to the betterment of Australians.\n\nIn 2014 I invented the Australian Chinese Zodiac which matches the Chinese zodiac animal with the Australia local wildlife.  The design was aim[ed] to promote better understanding between Chinese and Australian community.  It went viral.\n\nI always have been active in politics.  [I] was a member of the Australian Liberal Party and participated in a federal election.\n\nDuring my time in politics, I saw the limits of Australia's .  This system was designed by the  to be used in its  in 1842.  It assumed that the colonies do not have their own ideals and follow just one single set of social values.  The system only allows a government and an opposition.  These are often occupied by either the Progressive — The LEFT () and the Conservative — the RIGHT (the Liberal Party).\n\nHowever, 21st Century Australia is much more culturally diverse.  There are different ideals and social values.  Australian[s] can not see themselves fit into either the LEFT or the RIGHT ideology online.  The people of Australia is more comfortable with fit for purpose policies or CENTRE.  The current system does not support a third centre party.\n\nIn fact, Australians have become more cynical about the two major parties (LEFT and RIGHT).  They are well educated and well informed.  They believe they can offer the government so much in input and suggestions.  They want to have more say in the governing of [...] Australia.\n\nI have since come to the belief that direct vote or participating democracy is the key for the next stage of the country's evolution.  This is [a] movement overseas in terms of direct vote or direct democracy.\n In UK, the  — The council begin to use direct vote in some of the council decisions.\n In Iceland — they rewrote their constitution through public submitting and voting.\n In New York — The city review its city budget through direct vote.\n\nIn Australia, I believe introduction of direct voting needs to be [a] gradual process.  Laws needs to be enacted to allow direct voting.  But before this, the public and [sitting] government needs to see the benefit of direct democracy.\n\n What made you decide to run for the Melbourne City's Lord Mayor?  Why do you think you should be the Melbourne's Mayor?\n\n In [the] 2020 Melbourne local government election, I was nominated for the Lord Mayor of Melbourne.  I hope to use the election as a platform to seed public awareness on participating democracy.\n\nI advocated for the creation of a platform called Participate in Melbourne where the people can begin with submitting their issues/concerns, offer suggestions, hold public debate and send those conclusions to elected councillor to deliberate and vote.  [I] hope once the benefits are known, the council will enact laws to allow direct vote.\n\nI have founded an organisation called eTranslate that has offices in different countries.  Over the years, [I] have gained a considerable amount of business and life experiences which are important in public life.\n\nApart from my professional life, I have always engaged in community work.  I have a passion to enter public office and serve the community in a larger capacity.\n\nI have always been active in politics.  I was a member of the Australia Liberal Party and participated in a federal election.\n\nDuring my time in politics, [I] understood the inner workings of major parties and the Australian political system.\nMost importantly, I have lived in Melbourne since 2000 and understand the city intimately as a business operator and as a resident.\n\n [C]ould you please explain what are the powers of Melbourne's Lord Mayor?\n\n Unlike the City of London where its local government administer  [Central Business District] and greater London, the City of Melbourne is divided in 76 areas and the  only administer the Melbourne CBD and two surrounding residential areas,  and .\n\nWhile the area Melbourne City Council administer is small, the Melbourne CBD (second only to Sydney) is the engine of Australia's Economy.  So [while] the scope of power is limited, the policies are wide-ranging.  The Lord Mayor of Melbourne is partly a ceremonial role and partly a directorship role.  It is like the Chairman of a company.  The CEO of the council has all the executive powers.  But the mayor and the councillors are like the board of directors and the chairperson.  The only difference is that this chairperson sets the agenda for the CEO to implement.  The chairperson drafts the agenda based on the wishes of the people — the voters.\n\n Tell us about your team Zorin.  Tell us about your partner Gricol Yang.\n\n As required by the .  All candidates that contest for the seat of Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor must form a team for ease of identification.\n\nSo I choose Team Zorin as a name that represented me, Wayne Tseng — Lord Mayor Candidate and Gricol Yang — Deputy Lord Mayor Candidate.\n\nI chose Zorin because I also have another company called Zorin Industries which specialise in Robotics.  The name will only last until the result of the election is known.\n\nGricol Yang obtained a degree in commerce and worked in the  as a Commercial Banker.\n\n You ran in an election as a representative of the Liberal party in 2010 — why did you quit the party?  What have you learned since leaving the Liberals?\n\n I quit the party so I can run as an independent in the council election.  I am pursuing direct democracy which is not an element of the Australian Liberal Party platform.\n\nHowever, during the time as a member of the Liberal party, I have learnt so much about...\n\n Australia political systems\n The workings of 3 levels of government\n The political party machinery\n The relationship between the government and its people\n The change in Australian sentiment and;\n The limitation of the current Australia democracy in address[ing] change.\n\n Tell us about your company eTranslate.\n\n I founded the firm eTranslate which shares the same name as the USA firm eTranslate (but not related).  We specialise in language expertise and language information technology.  The firm has two arms — The technology arm focuses on services to help developers to create language variants of their software.  The language/cultural services arm provides cultural communication services to local government.  Australia is a lot of ethnic minorities speaking over 120 languages and over 80 cultures.  We have offices across Australia and in selected countries.\n\nSome of our past achievements include:\n During years 2000 we launch world first Multilingual Olympic Games Information Website.\n We launched world first Web Content Information System that support multilingual content.\n We launched world first e-commerce platform that support different languages and different currencies.\n Now we launched a new services to assist Robotics developer to create different language human robot interface.\n\nWe also won a number of awards for our innovations.\n\n In the Candidate Questionnaire and Answers, you had listed operating eTranslate has given you expertise in undertaking the role of Councillor.  How?  Can you please explain?\n\n As the firm grew, I spent more of [my] time in the cultural communication services arms.  There I served as the principal consultant leading a team which delivered consultancy services to all three levels of government in Australia.\n\n[A] politician needs business and life experience so they can make decisions that address real business and life situations.\n\nSo I do believe after years of growing and operating a business in so many areas, I could be of a service to the city.\n\n What do you think of the current governance of Melbourne's Mayor?\n\n The current mayor, , entered mid-term when the previous mayor  was outsed for  allegation.\n\nI do appreciate the hard work Sally did to bridge the political divide in a council chamber she inherited.  This year the pandemic has made her work even harder as for any other leaders.  But what she fall short off is to stand up to the State Government (provincial government) which [has] restricted the city ability to take its own decisive action to better protect the city.\n\nShe is Labor aligned so she can not compromise too much of the Labor State Government reign.  But a local government needs to be separate [from] State government so it can exercise its power to protect [its] constituents.\n\n Could you please [tell] us about the 'Precision Policies'?\n\n Team Zorin pledge to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber.  We will deploy an online platform to let Melbournians participate in the running of the city.  You can post issues in your area, submit your solutions, raise alerts about wrong doing, rate your councillors action and comment on council decisions.  It's called Participating Democracy.  We pledge not only [to] formulate policies for the majority, but also [to] formulate precise policies for the minority.  We called this Precision Policies.\n\nYou see the majority rule in current democracy.  If you are in the minority, you will not be in luck.  Our participating democracy platform ensure[s] that the needs of everyone includ[ing] those in minority group are captured.  The government should work harder to ensure there are policies that precisely addressed the needs of everyone including minority group.  Thus Precision Policies.\n\n What are some of the things you can bring to [the] table if you were to be elected as the Lord Mayor?\n\n Many other candidates in the election only advocate big spending and relief in payment of taxes.  Just like the  that shaped the 20th century, COVID-19 is shaping our time and the city is ill prepared for the post COVID world.  Our council processes and bureaucracies are still paper base, our revenue model is not flexible to enable rapid recovery and take advantage of new opportunity.\n\nMy strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.  There is a comprehensive plan for recovery in all sectors from business to residents.  See attached document.\n\n What does Melbourne lack under Sally Capp's Mayorship which you plan on improving?\n\n Sally['s] current strategy is to spend to recovery.  While this is necessary, fundamental reforms are needed.\n\nMy strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.\n\nKey Reforms include:\n\nMake Melbourne a full digitally transformed city with intelligent systems.\n\nMelbourne needs an efficient platform to recover and to seize new opportunities.  Some of our processes and bureaucracies are still paper base.  The tech needed are already available and proven models of digitisation are easily accessible.  We should move towards full digitisation plus installation of intelligent systems.  In simple jargon, these intelligent systems can enable efficiency projects such as:\n\n Freeing up unused public car park spaces, so enabling higher utilisation.\n Broadcast CBD traffic information to cars so to redistribute traffic around the CBD.\n Give Melbournians direct access to council services via their mobile.\n Expand the existing \"Participate Melbourne\" to allow Melbournians to post issues, submit suggestions, hold virtual forums, vote on a solution, and submit to council for deliberation.  If laws are enacted, allow direct vote.\n Give an automated platform to engage with local Melbourne suppliers.\n Offer an easy \"e-engagement\" platform for new industries to engage Melbourne and Melbourne businesses.  The country Estonia has this for the last 8 years.  Skype came from Estonia.  Singapore has its  system to engage any overseas enterprises in just 24 hours.\n A permanent system to monitor COVID and any future outbreak (See below Bug Busters) team.\n\nThis new platform will be Melbourne \"Digital Railway\" to recovery.\n\nMake Melbourne the first to reform council rate calculation.\n\nPost COVID Melbourne will see many empty shops, office floors and rental apartments.  This is in addition to the many heritage-listed and old CBD properties that are not rentable but incredibly valuable.  The current council rate calculation which is based on property value will send these owners off the cliff.\n\nOur team advocate a fundamental change to how council rate is calculated — based on yield and property value.  A property of high value that remains vacant can receive lower rate bill.  This will give relief but also give incentive for the property to attract new tenants.  For commercial property where the tenant pays for the outgoing, the reduced rate bill will help to attract new tenants and relief for the tenant to grow their business.\n\nThe same applies to heritage-listed properties and residential rental properties.  The list of beneficiaries is long.\n\nMake Melbourne an active Jobweaver.\n\nIn some of candidates' campaigns have been alluded Job — Job — Jobs; unfortunately, reality is we know old industries including retail will not return the same number of jobs.  So where will new jobs come from.  Local government should enact policies and implement initiatives to attract new industries.  While the federal government hands out Job Maker financial assistance, local government should implement \"Job Weaver\" initiatives to attract new industries.\n\nWhile one candidate stated he has attracted a billion-dollar project to Melbourne, little of this money trickles to small businesses and local workforce.  Melbourne's well-educated workforce can attract industries such as Robotics, AI Systems, Smart Financial Services and Accreditation Services.  The key to attract these new industries is the development of the e-engagement platform.\n\nAustralia [may] enter a new NATO style trade pack with US, Japan, India, and other friendly nations.  With so many Indian students and professions in Australia, Melbourne can seize the opportunity to be the business and finance center to administer these new alliances.  Again, an efficient digital e-engagement platform is the key to seize these opportunities.\n\n On Team Zorin's website, you wrote \"Melbourne is too precious to be used as a test lab for half-baked policies.\"  What are some of the current policies that are under-serving the residents of Melbourne?\n\n  There are many current policies that are not working and under serving.  Here are two examples:\n\nThe Melbourne city council [...] advocate for more residential towers and approve[d] a lot which is under construction.  But there are no essential services in these areas to service residents.  Essential services such as doctor, dentist, child care, mental health services and women's health services are almost non-existent.\n\nHere is my advocacy: There is little on other candidates' platforms for Melbourne as Residential Precinct.  There is a Chemist Warehouse in every block.  But where to go when you are sick at night.  Our team propose to attract essential services (such as 24 hours super-clinic) to service Melbourne residents including GPs, dentist, childcare, radiology, mental health, men's health, women's health and crisis management.  We have over 50,000 students in Melbourne; however, they are not entitled to free medical at  even with a medical insurance.  Gary Morgan rightly said, young family will settle in CBD, but where do they send their children for childcare, early learning, kindergarten, primary and secondary schools.  Schools will lift apartment resale value.  New apartments are being approved but with little green space and essential services.  This will be failed.\n\nMelbourne City council advocate to re-open business but there is not enough measure to make sure the premises are COVID safe.\n\nThis is my advocacy: Make Melbourne the first to install a city-level outbreak detection team.\n\nA hard COVID lesson learnt is that outbreak needs to be contain fast.  COVID-19 will not be the last.  There are also frequent gastro outbreaks.  Our team propose Australia first city-level Rapid Response, Virus education / awareness, Outbreak Detection and Containment Team (jokingly called Bug Busters).  While we may not like to mention it, China's city level Bug Busters are key for them to contain outbreaks.\n\nIn addition, we advocate installation of health check gates at shopping centers and places of high people concentration.  These gates will not only measure temperatures but will have regularly updated features to detect other symptoms.  Just like security check points, they will become part of the post-COVID world.  They may be integrated as part of security and drug checks.  (The technology is already in used overseas).\n\nThink again, this along with PPE when mandated and social distancing is the key to safe opening.\n\n On your website, you wrote \"Team Zorin pledges to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber\" — how do you plan to do that?  How will this affect people of Melbourne?  What technologies would you require to achieve that?\n\n The phrase bring all Melbournians to the council chamber is a metaphor.  The reality is that all Melbournians will have their opportunity to submit their issues and their suggestions into the digital democracy platform.  They can participate in virtual debate and trials.  Those findings will be submitted to the council chamber for formal debate.  Now even if the laws do not allow direct vote, the platform has online polls to allow the people to vote.  The elected councillors can see the \"wish\" of the people and voted accordingly.  Thus — \"Bring the Melbournians to the council chamber\".\n\nTo a number of Melbournians who have been so stressed and depressed, it will take sometime for them to appreciate the opportunity to have their say.  At the same time, so many Melbournians are tired and fed up with the current mayor for the lack of real solutions and the state government errors and mistakes, they will look for alternatives.\n\nI believe instead of installing another leader who is not going to be any wiser or someone who just want[s to] offer sensationalism just to win power, this is the time where we open the pathway to collective governing.  The direct democracy or participating democracy (depends on who is framing this concept) will allow Melbournians to work collectively, find out solutions, TRIAL solutions, hold [...] forum and see what really works and then tell their leader to consider these well-founded solutions.\n\nIt does not affect the people of Melbourne other than giving them a new avenue to seek their answers.  It will put the elected official on notice that people demand more, want to take part in the process of governing.  Also the demand for greater transparency.\n\nThere are emerging technologies for participating democracy.\n\nMiVote is one prominent technology using  to enable secured voting.  Since the model on how direct democracy is going to unfold, the technologies are catching up with the needs of the people.\n\nFor the first time in digital revolution, it is technology that is catching up with the people.  In this case, it is the digital democracy platform trying to the catch up with the inspiration of the people.  Other less sophisticated ones include  with template UpVote.\n\n What do you think of one's right to privacy?  Will the people of Melbourne have to compromise a part of their privacy to accommodate to your plans for the city?\n\n Australia has a very strong privacy protection law. By participating in the democracy platform, the people would not disclose much of their details other than:\n Their entity;\n The fact that they are [enrolled] as a voter for that electorate and;\n detail of their experience and their views.\n\n How would you ensure the digital platform you intend to deploy for residents to participate for the running of city is not misused?  In what ways will you ensure only the residents of the city can use it?  Will the platform use user's privacy respecting software?\n\n The model in which how this participating democracy works itself will also be debated.  Of course, I will seed the initial model.\n\nThe initial model do not allow anonymous posts or vote.  Every one [who] contributes must verify that they are registered voters against the voters roll in the election authority.  The voting itself are base on block chain which is the most secure we now have.\n\nThe software will respect Australia privacy law.\n\n How do you plan to help those Melbournians who are in the economically weaker category?\n\n The homeless and people living below the poverty line are part of the Melbourne community.  On policy, the council will rent back empty home to give temporary shelter to the homeless or reduce rental for those who are economically weaker.\n\n Statistics show number of crimes reported in various cities in Australia including Melbourne have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.  How do you plan on handling the COVID-19 pandemic?  What policies would you introduce to reduce the rate of crimes in Melbourne?\n\n On my policy platform, we have advocate[d] for night safe zones, additional CCTV and patrols.  We will work with the police department (run by the state government) to ensure they monitor the parts of the city that pose higher risks.\n\n Why do you think \"Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030\"?  What are some of the things necessary for ensuring that comes true?  What are some of the current barriers which may prevent that from happening?  How would you remove those barriers?\n\n Australia is an island continent.  It has the world largest , ,  and  reserve[s].  It has the most agriculturally sound land.  It has every geographical [feature] you can find [on] earth.  There is enough land to support a population of 2 billion.\n\nMelbourne like Sydney is a business, administrative and cultural centre.  Yet it does not have the financial burden of being the largest city in Australia.\n\nMelbourne can seize the opportunity to be administration centre of the new opportunities.  From new opportunities comes [new] found wealth and city development.\n\nBut what is stopping the city is its old paper base bureaucracies.  This is why I advocate full digital transformation of council processes and install new smart systems.  I also advocate the development of a[n] e-engagement system which allow[s] new industries from overseas to quickly engage with the City of Melbourne.\n\n Tell us about \"Guided Governing\".  How would that play out?  Your campaign talks about Democracy 2.0.  What are the things where democracy is currently failing?  How do you plan to fix it?\n\n In the Democracy 1.0, the majority rules.  If you are a minority, you[r] needs may not be addressed.\n\nMelbourne is so much more than those issues raised by the mayoral candidates.  The recovery needs to include everyone, not just those whose needs are on the candidates' policy platform.\n\nMelbournians will no longer accept that if your needs are not on their agenda, [bad] luck try again in 4 years.  A lot can happen in 4 years.  One COVID-19 lesson is to address issues head on, fast and with well-founded solutions.  We can see from Stage 4, there were mistakes — 50 mistakes as the  reported.\n\nWe understand politicians are human, there is a limit to how much they know — especially career politicians.  Melbournians as a collective can offer so much.  Take my extensive policies.  In fact, the list is much longer.  These are real issues submitted by people at the ground level including suggestions by the people on my mini digital democracy platform.\n\nFor example, when Sally advocated for the expansion to Southbank Boulevard and big events, residents in Southbank already unhappy at sound levels rejected this completely.  They advocate that the council should enforce a quiet zone after 10pm at residential areas.  This is on my platform.\n\nMelbournians can submit their observations of any failures.  One election issue is the self-injecting room (I know it is the state government who put it there).  While every candidate concedes having one near QVM [] and near residential towers is bad, no candidate mentioned that there are dealers hovering 150 meters away supplying the goods creating an epicentre of drug deals around the self-injecting room.  Chinese students living in  on   reported this on my platform even if they are not voters.\n\nYou see citizen participating can also stop bad policy in its track, this is guided governing.\n\nMelbournians can offer topics/suggestions that the candidates don't see.  As a collective they have a greater foresight.  In my policy document, topics discussed include:\n\n Reform how council rate is calculated — So many Melbournians discussed this topic and offer justification why it works and give real life examples.  It is like having a virtual forum and running a proof of concept exercise.  No other candidate discussed this.  It is on my platform.\n Job, Job and Jobs. Most Melbourne business owners know old industries, particular retail will not return the same number of jobs.  We need to attract new industries.  Council can play a role in attracting new industries.  We call this Jobweaver.\n The need for rapid digitisation and the establishment of an e-engagement platform to attract new industries and new business from overseas.  Melbournians do business overseas like in Singapore.  They experience the quick and easy way to establish presence in the city.\n Also a local city level outbreak detection and control team — Bug Busters.  They saw such in , HK [(Hong Kong)] and Singapore.  [They] attribute to [it] keeping their numbers down.  COVID-19 will not be the last.\n\nThese potential ideas and virtual forum findings can be submitted to the council chamber for councillors to debate guided by the evidence presented.  Of course the current laws do not allow citizens to directly vote on council decisions.  But Melbournians can conduct their votes on online polls.  The result will show the councillors in the chamber the wish of the people.  If they do not vote reflecting the wish of the people, they will know their [fate] come next election.\n\nIf I was to be elected, I will take gradual steps to introduce a platform for participation and direct vote.\n\nMy plan is to expand \"Participate Melbourne \" to empower Melbournians to\n submit their issues.\n submit their suggested solution.\n offer other ideas for the betterment of Melbourne.\n hold virtual forums.\n participate in online committees (Dan already legalise[d] online meetings for committees).\n participate in trials or proof-of-concept exercises.\n\nIt goes further:\n comment on council's own initiative or agenda.\n rate the performance or action of a councilor.\n report on policy failures (Herald Sun report of a socall park gate was a classic).\n While [they] can not directly vote on council decisions, they can vote in online polls to tell councillors the wish of the people.\n\n Why do you plan to make Melbourne Australia's capital?\n\n Melbourne was Australia capitol until 1927.  Then it was moved to Canberra.\n\nThe  do have rights.  But their identity and their rights are either suppressed or not encouraged.\n\nI want to use Melbourne public space to be a place where the First Nations (Indigenous) people can hold their discussion forum.  I want to have the map of their different tribes displayed in Town Hall.\n\nI also want a day where we have the Indigenous festival.\n\n You have plans to create a city level disease detection swat unit and to install temperate and health check gates — how much time would it take to do it all across Melbourne?  How much resources and funds are you planning to put behind the disease prevention of the city?\n\n I am [not(?)] privy to council records.  So I don't have all the tools to calculate.  But because the area that Melbourne City Council is small.  I can work out the budget.  I may budget to be the same that the city is spending now controlling the outbreak.\n\n Your manifesto also mentions reviewing \"animal management plan\" — could you tell us more about it?\n\n Pets are not support[ed] and unwanted in City of Melbourne.  The current animal management plan advocates if lost pets are not claimed within a certain number of days they are killed.\n\nMany people who moved from the suburbs to the city often left their pets on the streets.  This is sad.\n\nI think we should be compassionate.  I will definitely review the pet plan and called it \"Creatures big and small care plan\".\n\n How do you plan to preserve the indigenous art and support multi-cultural aspect of the city?\n\n  Mining companies frequently blasted sacred aboriginal sites destroying precious aboriginal artwork.  Some of their art work are actually dumped in shipping containers.  Melbourne has so many public galler[ies] and museums. They can be commission to preserve, store and exhibit aboriginal artworks.\n\n Given the owners profit from pairing up with Airbnb which hikes the house rent — what is your stance on Airbnb and similar short-stay rentals and their long-term effect on affordability?\n\n  and similar short-stay rental are [an] important source of income for city apartment landlords.  Yet they are also a source of disturbances for residents.  Residents deserve peace and enjoyment.\n\nSo Airbnb needs to be regulated.  My plan is to have public consultation where all stakeholders get to have a say on the digital democracy platform and hold a virtual forum.\n\nSome of the initial key consideration[s] include:\n\n [Give] building management greater powers to set standards.\n Apply standards to Airbnb and other booking agencies.\n Ensure new building[s] have setup for Airbnb access and landlord to meet strict requirements.\n\n What are some of the strongest criticisms you have received for your plans for Melbourne?  How did those criticisms change your views?\n\n My policies for the city of Melbourne have been collectively suggested by talking to the people of Melbourne through my digital participating democracy platform.  So they are populist policies.  Few actually criticise them.\n\nHowever, there is one major challenge.  The current tension between Chinese and Australia fuel public speculation about why so many Chinese candidate.  They are worried about foreign infiltration.  While I enjoy pretty good coverage, many other Chinese/Asian candidates are being teased or harassed.  Overall, this does not give a good public image for all Chinese/Asian candidates.  Any voters who [do] not know me, may not vote for me because I have a Chinese face.\n\n If you had to vote for the current candidates other than yourself for this year's election, which three candidates would you vote for?  Why?\n\n Sally Capp — She has the experience as mayor and can ensure continuity of city's affairs.\n  — He was the deputy mayor and he is willing to stand up for the city's benefits from the next level up government — The State Government which has more over-arching power over the city.\n  — they are a popular party in Melbourne city CBD, their policies [have been] becoming less radical and more mainstream.\n\n What are some of the reasons people may not vote for Team Zorin?\n\n Reasons:\n We do not belong to the major parties (Liberal or Labor).\n We are not from the social elite (traditionally mayors were from big business person, link to major parties or social elite).  The current mayor Sally Capp comes from political heritage linked to the Liberal Party.  This is where this model does not fit the modern world.  It is not fair that the seat of mayor always goes to the elite.\n We may be seen as inexperience[d] as none in our team have administer[ed] the City of Melbourne. \n\n In case if you do not win the election, what would be your next plan of action?\n\n [My] goal is to leverage on the friend and networks [I have] developed to further advance participating democracy in Australia.\n\nDuring the time as a candidate, I have used any publicity available to promote the concept.  I have written to the following part[s] of society:\n\n To all Australia sitting politician and candidates,\n To all Australian media includ[ing] TV, radio and newspapers,\n To different cultural community groups,\n To different community and non profit organisation[s].\n\nI hope to promote the concept to all level[s] of society so they will become more educated and understand its benefits.  So when future government can enact direct vote, the great people of Australia can easily follow.\n\nI will formally form a party called Zorin Australia which will attract member[s] across Australia through the democracy platform.\n\nWe will also gradually establish a nation-wide democracy platform where the great people of Australia continue to post their issues, solutions, vision, hopes and advise the government on the course of governing.\n\nThe various champions on the platform can be great candidate[s] to represent the people come next election.\n\n What do you think of world dominance?\n\n I do not believe in world dominance.  The whole point of the participating democracy or Democracy 2.0 is to give the power to determine by the people.\n\nThe people collaborate in their own community.  The different communities collaborate in a city.  Cities collaborate in a state/provinces.  Provinces collaborate in a country.  Countries collaborate together as part of one cohesive entity.\n\nOf course, this is a utopia that is not going to happen anytime soon.  But it is a model that we hope where countries at different stage of readiness will adopt.  Step by step humanity improves.\n\nImagine we have a new martian colony.  What kind of government will we want to be there.  We will likely want something like participating democracy, everyone['s] needs are address, everyone collectively decides.  So if this is what is in the future, why can['t] we start to slow[ly] adopt this model today.\n\n What does the demographic of Melbourne currently look like?\n\n According to 2016 census:\n\nChildren aged 0–14 years made up 3.8% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 5.1% of the population.  Of people in Melbourne (State Suburbs) aged 15 years and over, 23.7% were married and 5.8% were either divorced or separated.\n\n0.5% of the population, or 24,062 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.  Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas.  In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia.\n\n How do you plan on making Melbourne the Repository for Cultural Artefacts and Knowledge?\n\n I always believe knowledge is humanity['s] biggest achievement.  Yet they are constantly be[ing] destroy[ed] by successive regime who see certain part do not align with their ideology.  It happens all around the world.\n\nBut I [don't] want to be racist.  I am Chinese.  So I can comment on China.  For a millenni[um] each imperial dynasty aim[ed] to destroy the knowledge and culture of those that were not compatible with their regime.\n\nThe biggest destruction was [by] the  when he unified China.  Even to this day, the Chinese  has further destroy[ed] what was traditional China.\n\nWe see it in ,  and even in Australia.\n\nThere are a large part of Australia society which love truth, knowledge and fairness.\n\nAustralia for the time being is very stable politically.  The country geographic is stable with no earthquakes and volcanoes.  Humidity is low and weather stable.\n\nTo sum it up, it is a country suitable to [store] artefact[s] and knowledge that are at risks in their host country.  The benefit for Australia is that the world will come and see, bring[ing] tourism.\n\nThe artefacts will only be preserve[d] here with consent of the traditional owners.\n\n Are you aware of the  (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum) outreach project run by Wikimedia?  Do you look forward to facilitating the outreach for mutual benefit?  How would you facilitate that?\n\n I did not know until now.  I understand what is GLAM.  I think it can serve as a great preservation of culture, artefact while Wikipedia is for the preservation of knowledge.  I will look into it in the future.\n\n What according to you is more important: Representation of minorities in the council or minority citizens getting a platform to express their needs, and grievances?  Why?  What are your plans to achieve that?\n\n It's democracy in Australia.  The City administration changes after each election.  Certain administration may be pro-minority, some may not.  Some administration may have good minority representation, some may not.\n\nSo it is important that there is a platform which empowers the minority to post their needs and discuss their preferences.  [By] law if issues are known, they need to be addressed by the government.\n\nSo it will be ideal that we get both good minority representation in government and the platform to support them.  But the former can not be guaranteed.\n\n Why did you start eTranslate? What type of advice does it provide to the three tiers of government?\n\n eTranslate has two arms — the Technology arm — which focus on empowering technologies to support multicultural user needs and multilingual content.\n\nThe other is multicultural communication services — It is a like a Public Relation service but focus on ethnic groups.  So our team provide this multicultural PR services to government.  We empower the government clients with language resources, cultural expertises and ethnic media channel to interact with their ethnic minority constituents.\n\nSo we work with all levels of government.\n\n What are some of the problems ethnic minorities face in Melbourne?\n\n Due to low fertility rate, Australia has [to] constantly embark on increasing migration to top up its population.  As such, there is a diverse set of ethnic minority groups in fact over 80.  Australia treat[s] its minority well compare to other OECD [(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)] countries.  But when you have so many group[s] competing for government priorities, it is hard to find a balance.\n\nMost of the time, the larger minority group[s] gain more access to resources.  This is why my participating democracy platform helps to ensure the needs of all minority groups are identified and addressed — Thus Precision Policies.\n\n What percentage of residents in Melbourne and Victoria are aboriginals?\n\n Melbourne 0.5%, Victoria 1.6%.\n\n Aboriginal population in Melbourne and in Victoria is very low as compared to other states. Why? And would it make sense to make Melbourne capital of Aboriginals when there aren't enough of them in the city?\n\n The distribution of indigenous people depends on a lot of factors.  These again due to historical reasons that we can go on forever.  The are tens of indigenous tribes across the country.  Sadly some were hunted to extinction in the last century, particularly in Tasmania.\n\nMak[ing] a location a capital for the First Nations people will be symbolic rather than totally enshrine[d] in law.  Ideally it would be best in the .  But unless I was a mayor there, it may not happen.\n\nSo having [it] in Melbourne does allow some symbolic and provide a forum for the different tribes to gather and have open discussions.\n\nThe \"capital\" can rotate from city to city periodically if other cities allow.  But ultimately it will be up to the elders to approve.\n\n How [do] you envision Melbourne would look like by 2025 under your mayorship?\n\n Each mayor term is 4 years, that takes it to 2024 at the latest.  Realistically, Melbourne and Australia being a much smaller economy will take longer to recover from COVID-19.\n\nSo to be practical, we hope the city will attain the following by 2024-25:\n\n Melbourne recovers from the pandemic;\n Most business restored;\n City finances recover from the massive debt incurred;\n City fully digitised and ready to take on new opportunities;\n Residents can enjoy a safe, healthy and livable environment;\n Tourism flourish[es] again;\n New industries invest in Melbourne;\n Arts and Culture restored.\n\n If elected, what would constitute a successful mayorship for you?\n\n I believe what constitute a successful mayorship are\n\n To maintain the integrity and high standard expected from the office of Mayor;\n Implement the pledge made during the election;\n Be consultative to the community;\n Be proactive in responding to issues;\n Monitor the changing force at state, national and international level and prepare the city to meet those challenges;\n laid the foundation necessary to grow the city and protect it against unsavoury forces.\n\nWayne Tseng also shared his insights on various things on how collaboration between the members of society,\n\n Just [to] summarise:\n\nSince I was 10, I watched how the ant[s] collaborate.  I asked how we people can collaborate further.  In school, I appreciated competition bring creativity.  But I also believe collaboration ensures not only creativity, but accountability, responsibility, integrity and productivity.\n\nWhen I was in university, my computer studies focused on collaborative computing.  My post graduate research was on software globalisation — again global collaboration.\n\nMy company eTranslate really aims to empower companies to go global while in Australia assist all ethnic minority groups collaborate and co-exist in harmony.\n\nIn politics, I seek to find a solution where we can reach consensus.  It does not have to be LEFT or RIGHT, black or white.  Democracy is one system that endures, but it is no longer acceptable to just say majority rules.  This led me to participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.\n\nOnce can say — So my life experience really led me towards participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.\n\n Democracy 2.0:\n\nWhen I gave presentation, I always said if there is a  now, what kind of political system or government would you prefer: Authoritarianism, Communism, Fascism, Monarchy or Democracy?\n\nIf Democracy, do you want to be squeeze[d] to either the LEFT or the RIGHT or only majority rules?  Or may be you want a collective government where the needs of everyone is addressed.  So that's participating democracy.  Now if that is the future, why don't we progress towards this TODAY.\n\nI have developed an index to measure to what degree a country has adopted participating democracy.  I share this in the future topic.\n\n Society 1.0:\n\nWhile developing the model for participating democracy, I saw many institutions have refined processes and some have matured to a point where it is like a car.  The [model], functions and overall attributes of a car is matured.\n\nImagine that we put all the attributes of an institution whether a health system, a hospital, a school or an education department in a bottle.  We can deploy this to other countries that have [not] yet got such a matured setup.\n\nNow imagine we got a whole matured community or city setup in bottle, this can be deploy to new city setup in the dessert or new settled land.\n\nNow imagine after exchanging and further developing these setup.  Eventually, like a car which is quite mature, we have a setup or definition of a city or SOCIETY that is almost universally accepted.  I call this SOCIETY 1.0.\n\nDemocracy 2.0 can lead to SOCIETY 1.0.  The ongoing debate of how to govern a society will lead to a universally agreed FORMAT/SETUP/DEFINITION of a SOCIETY.\n\nDuring COVID-19, the ability of different medical centres to collaborate in the development and trialling of different vaccine candidates showed the need to standardise setup of clinics, hospital and even the health ministry.  Those that are compatible and matured progressed further.\n\nIt will take a moment to sink it.\n\n Collectivism 1.0:\n\nCollaboration and Collectivism if well structured or modelled can be the next BIG step in human achievement.\n\nWe see collaboration between students.  Let say this has a productivity factor of 4 (where 1 is a person working on his own)\n\nWe see collaborat[ion] of different team[s] working together each focusing on a part of the problem.  This has the productivity factor of 16.\n\nHowever if there is [a] well defined guide to community collaboration where the high number of participants can explore all different permutation[s] of a problem, the productivity factor can be 256.  Add in computation power.  We are talking about a factor of 65,536.  It will expand humanity achievements.\n\nBack to my childhood observation — the numbers do count in creativity and productivity.\n\nThe holy grail is to find that magic collaboration model.", "question": "What is Wayne Tseng's primary objective in his campaign to become Mayor of Melbourne? \n\nA) To increase the size of the council and double the budget  \nB) To implement direct voting and enhance public participation in democracy  \nC) To prioritize economic recovery efforts without any public input  \nD) To strengthen ties with major political parties and advocate for traditional policies"}
{"title": "Wikinews interviews Phil Collins, U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee", "content": "U.S. Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins took some time to answer a few questions about his 2020 presidential campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.\n\nCollins is currently chairman of the Prohibition Party.  Previously, he served as a trustee of  (Illinois) and as chairman of the Prohibition Party of Illinois. After moving to Nevada, he ran for  of Las Vegas in 2019, and finished in second place overall.  He was not the Prohibition Party's first choice for the 2020 presidential nomination.  In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bill Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. Gammon assumed the presidential nomination and the party nominated Collins for Vice President the next month.  Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around August 2019 and Collins took over as the presidential nominee.  The party picked anti-alcohol activist Billy Joe Parker as Collins's new running mate.  Parker spoke to Wikinews back in July.\n\nAfter securing the Prohibition Party presidential nomination, Collins sought the nominations of the American Independent Party (AIP) and the Reform Party for ballot access in California and Florida, respectively. Despite winning the AIP California Presidential Primary in March, Collins lost the nomination to businessman Rocky De La Fuente in August. He also fell short of De La Fuente for the Reform Party presidential nomination in June. Nevertheless, the Prohibition Party has attained ballot access in Colorado, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Vermont.  The last presidential election in which the party appeared on at least four state ballots was in  with nominee .\n\nThe Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the US, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late nineteenth century. As its name suggests, the party supported the , which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the period known as  (1919–33).  Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the party has declined.  It stays afloat, in part due to the George L. Pennock Trust established in 1939, which pays the party's operating expenses.  It continues to nominate candidates for president as well.  Wikinews has previously interviewed two of those nominees:  and 2008 presidential nominee  and 2016 presidential nominee James (Jim) Hedges.  Collins makes it three.\n\nWith Wikinews, Collins discusses his background, the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on his campaign, presidential nominations, gridlock, climate change, foreign policy, and race relations.\n\n: Which past  do you most admire and why? \n\nCollins: I admire  because he was a good leader in the Civil War.  He wanted to ensure that the union was preserved, and he achieved that goal.  He chose cabinet members and generals who would serve their country very well, and he wasn't disappointed.  I admire [Ronald] Reagan because he persuaded Congress (which was mainly Democrats) to cut tax rates.  While he was president, the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and interest rates decreased.\n\n: When and why did you join the  Prohibition Party?\n\nCollins: I joined it in the summer of 2014.  I found that I agreed with most of the platform, and I knew that I could be a state leader, since I didn't think the party had any other members who lived in Illinois.\n\n: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?  \n\nCollins: I was in the navy for 21 years, including eight years in marine units and six months near Baghdad.  If I were the commander-in-chief, that might help me command the military.  I was a township trustee.  Since I have the government experience, I learned the importance of reading resolutions, especially budgets, before I voted on them.\n\n: How would you describe your style of leadership? How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?\n\nCollins: If I were president, I'd have a more constitutional leadership, by reading the Constitution, whenever I decide if I should sign or veto a bill.  Presidents Trump and Obama signed budgets that increased spending, increased the deficit, and increased the debt.  I wouldn't do that.\n\n: If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?\n\nCollins: I'd encourage the governors to help one another better.  A few states, with no , have low infection rates, compared to a few states that had mask and stay-at-home orders.  I would have asked governors of a couple of those healthy states, to have a televised press conference, at the White House, to tell what their states did.\n\n: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?\n\nCollins: In Tennessee, we paid someone to get petition signatures, for us.  When a lot of businesses were closed and many summer events were cancelled, it was hard for our workers to find people, who would sign the petitions.   \n\n: In 2016, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Jim Hedges received 5,617 votes, the most for the party since .  Based on your general feeling on the ground, about how many votes do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?\n\nCollins: I think that I'll get 9,000-11,000 votes.  I'll be on the ballots in more states, and I'll be a  in more states, compared to Mr. Hedges.\n\n: What would a Collins administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?\n\nCollins: I'd nominate people who could work well with members of the Prohibition, Republican, and Democrat Parties.  The majority of those people would be people who had political experience.  Since  was a  for a Republican and Democrat, I'd nominate him for .  Other than that, I haven't thought of anyone.  If I win, I'll ask for suggestions from other Prohibition Party officers.\n\n: Who would you nominate to the Supreme Court? Would you apply any ?  Should the number of justices remain at nine?\n\nCollins: I haven't decided whom I'd nominate.  I'd choose someone who is a federal appeals court judge who always rules according to the Constitution.  No, I wouldn't have any litmus test.  Yes, I think that the number should remain nine.\n\n: As president, how would you work with Congress to avoid gridlock and pass your agenda?\n\nCollins: I'd try to learn about each senator and representative so that I could talk to a lot of them and persuade them to agree with me.  I'd usually propose bills that obey the Constitution, so I'd tell people that my view is what the  would have wanted.\n\n: What should be done, from the government's perspective, to combat global climate change?\n\nCollins: Some scientists say that global climate change isn't caused by people and that the change is part of a cycle that has happened for at least 1,000 years.  If I'm president and I read that the majority of scientists think that people caused the change, I'd ask a few former  heads for their opinions about how we should combat it.\n\n: What are your views on the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?\n\nCollins: I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half.  I don't see any reason why the U.S. should be involved, so I think our government should be neutral.\n\n: Are you concerned about the  and  censorship of notable  and ?  How would you address this issue as president?  \n\nCollins: Yes, I'm concerned about it.  If I'm president, I'd encourage more people to use different social media sites, including , twitter, and .\n\n: What can you do, as president, to improve  in the United States?  \n\nCollins: I could ensure that recruiting ads for the federal government (especially for the military and FBI) will show co-workers of a few ethnic groups, showing that many federal workers work, well, with members of different races.

The now-extinct species used to carefully select bones from a particular animal species to manufacture their bone tools, the research showed.  The research was published on May 8 in s  journal.\n\nDr Martisius and her team used five bone tools discovered from Neanderthals' sites in southwest France for this research.  Four of these bone tools were found in a site called  and the other one was from .  These tools were just a few centimetres in size and were about 50 thousand years old, Dr Martisius told Wikinews.  Microscopy analysis of these bone tools called lissoirs (smoothers) suggested Neanderthals used these tools for working animal skin to leathers.\n\nThe study stated the fauna of the sites were primarily medium-sized ungulates such as reindeer, in one layer nearly 90%.  Despite the overabundance of medium-sized ungulates, Neanderthals used ribs of large  for making lissoirs.  Dr Martisius told Wikinews this was likely due to the physical characteristics of the bovid ribs, which were \"thicker\" and \"stronger\" as compared to the \"thin and flimsy ribs\" of reindeers.  In order to check the origins of the bone tools, the researchers used a technology called non-destructive Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry ().\n\nInstead of damaging the bone artefacts in order to discover its origins, the researchers collected  from the plastic containers in which these artefacts were kept.  Collagen is a type of protein.  These bone artefacts were kept in plastic containers: some were kept for about five years, some for just a few months.  During this time, the collagen proteins from bone tools were stuck to the walls of its plastic containers.  The collagen samples collected from the walls of the containers are broken into smaller molecules called  by using a chemical enzyme called .\n\nAfter the trypsin has broken collagen fibres into peptides, it is analysed using a technology called Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer ().  The assisting matrix is a coloured compound.  The acidic peptide is combined with the matrix, vapourised, and peptides are released.  Some of them are positively-charged particles which travel across a vacuum tube in an electric field.  Depending on the weight of the peptides, these molecules reach the end of the vacuum tube at different instances of time, forming a spectrum.  These graphs are like unique fingerprints of a species: they are different for different species of animals.  Looking at the database of such graphs, taxonomic identifications of the collagen proteins came be made.\n\nAll four bone tools from Abri Peyrony gave positive results and showed that the bones were made from large bovids, even though reindeer were more abundant during that time.  One of the advantages of using bovid ribs over reindeer's thin ribs was the bovid ribs would be more resistant to breaking during flexion, Dr Martisius said.\n\nDr Martisius said such non-destructive ZooMS analysis was previously conducted, but for tools no older than a few centuries.  She said such an analysis had never been previously conducted for artefacts so ancient.\n\nWikinews caught up with Dr Martisius to discuss this research in-depth.\n\n Thank you for agreeing to discuss your findings.  I'd like to ask you about your discovery: its findings, and the inferences of, and anything that we can do for the future investigation. That's a lot you just said out there.\n\n What prompted your interest in archæology?  Okay.  Well, I guess that goes back all the way to my childhood; it's sort of a lifelong thing for me.  My father was very interested in history.  So I think that sort of inspired me to study , I guess.  But specifically archæology: I really had no idea what archæology is.  And I think that the general public also doesn't really have an idea of what archæology is.  And so, it wasn't until I got into school, started studying it, that I figure[d] out what archæology was.  You know, it's so much more than history, or studying  to interpret history, right?  History is more so, about what is written down, what the prominent people in society wrote down, right?  And archæology is about figuring out what normal everyday people did.  So, I think it's — I think it's really cool what we can learn doing archæology.\n\n What was the initial purpose of this study? So.  The initial purpose, really, was just to find out what animals the bone — I was studying bone tools for my , and, there's all sorts of different things one can learn, studying bone tools.  But, to specifically figure out what animals these bones came from would be a little more difficult studying bone tools because bone tools are transformed, either through manufacturing or through use, or both depending on which bone tools they are.  But these were small little fragments, really really hard to identify based on morphological characteristics alone.\nSo we wanted to apply this method ZooMS to look at the — well, to study the collagen in the bone, to then assess what animals these bones came from.\n\n Could you briefly explain the study and its findings? I don't know how brief I can be, but, I'll try to be brief.  [laughs]  Like I mentioned in the previous question, I was studying these bone tools; they're specifically bone tools that Neandertals made and used; and we just had five of these.  They came from two different sites in the southwest of France.  One artefact came from this one site called , and then four came from another site ; and these bone tools were found actually across three different archæoological layers; there are two different archæoological layers at Abri Peyrony.\n\nSo, these five bone tools are all pretty similar.  They all looked very similar, they had a similar size, similar shape; they all came from some sort of animal rib, we can tell that by doing a morphological analysis — but we wanted to use Zooarchæology by Mass Spectrometry to try to assess what animal species the bones came from.  I mentioned the one, from this other site Pech-de-l’Azé: we didn't get any results from that one artefact; but then the four from Abri Peyrony, they all came back with positive results, all actually having the same ID, either coming from  or ; so, some sort of large .\n\nAnd then, there's so much more involved in the study too; those are the main results.  But then we compared the results from the ZooMS analysis to the  analysis from all of the  remains at the site.  And what was really cool was that in one of the archæoological layers, where three of these bone tools came from, the layer was dominated by , having ninety per cent reindeer remains in the site.\n\nJust thinking about that — we did a whole  too, but — just thinking about that: 90 per cent reindeer, and then three of these bone tools come from this large bovid, really really seems like Neandertals specifically chose to use the large bovid's ribs as their tool of choice; and then like I say we also did a statistical analysis that supported that as well, that Neandertals were selecting these large bovid ribs.\n\n How did you get involved in this study? So, that actually started back quite a while ago now, for me.  It was before I even got into .  It was back when I was an undergraduate student.  I got my graduate degree as well as my undergraduate degree at , so that's where I've been for a while: University of California Davis.  And as an  I took a zooarchæology course from Teresa Steele, who would then turn out to be my , and so I was doing an internship with her.  She was studying the faunal remains from this site Abri Peyrony. And she had me doing really really tedious work: just counting and weighing teeny-tiny little pieces of bone that were like two  or less [1 cm = about 0.39 ] in size.  And then when I was doing that work I actually found one of these bone tools.  And so then, one thing led to the next: I get to grad school, then I get to study these bone tools, and, well, now here we are.  But, that was like, was it ten?  I guess that was nine years ago when I first started working with Dr Teresa Steele.\n\n How many institutes were involved in this research? So, on the paper, I think it lists seven different institutes.  But two of the institutions were the main institutions I would say.  So University of California Davis, where I got my dissertation, where my advisor also is a professor.  But then, the  is where the — for the most part — where the ZooMS analysis was conducted; and then several researchers are also affiliated with the Max Planck Institute.  And then there are some other institutions that some of the other researchers are affiliated with.  But, I would say, the majority of work either happened at UC Davis or at the Max Planck Institute.\n\n What activities did this study involve? What activities.  So, the main activities I would say would be the ZooMS analysis; the zooarchæological analysis, or the study of the fauna; and then the statistical analyses.  But in addition to those, I mean there's so many different things that are involved in a study like this, things that happened even before we started doing the study: just having to  the site, and gather the artefacts, and wash them, and various things like that.  But then also, you know, writing, and brainstorming, and emailing colleagues, and data organisation; there's all sorts of different things that [go] on.\n\n What was the timeline of this study? Yeah.  It's even hard for me to remember right now actually [laughs].  But I think when we first decided to do a study like this, it would have been back in 2017.  And then from there, I think some of the first results were obtained at the end of 2017.  — When I say results, I mean the first ZooMS results were obtained at the end of 2017.  And that's when I started comparing the ZooMS results to the rest of the fauna at the site: which species of fauna [were] found at the site.  Not all of the bone tools had ZooMS results right away.  So that, trying to get more ZooMS results took several tries, several more months, and then I think by the end of 2018, we had a solid draft about ready to submit for publication.  But then; well, this is getting into a whole lot of other things.  But anyway, we had to then collect more data.  We decided to generate more ZooMS data on just the fauna from the site, to compare the results: non-destructive results from the fauna, to the morphological identifications to see if those were corroborated.  And so that was mostly done in 2019.  And then at the end of 2019, we had... pretty much our final draft — or, near-final draft — of the paper [ready] to go before it was submitted for publication.  So anyway, several years.\n\n What were the roles of other people involved in the study? So: there were, um, three researchers on this study.  The last three listed on the paper — Teresa Steele, Shannon McPherron, and Marie Soressi — they're all my dissertation advisors.  I already mentioned Teresa Steele as my main dissertation adviser but the two other, also, [were] external advisors for me.  And they helped a lot in constructing the design of the research.  So that was a big role that they played there.\n\nFrido Welker: I think it says right at the top of the paper that he contributed equally to this research as I did.  So Frido is the ZooMS expert on this paper: so I'm not. [...] I'm the bone tool expert, and Frido Walker is the ZooMS expert.  So he did the initial ZooMS analyses.  And then he also got one of his grad students involved — Virginie Sinet-Mathiot — and she did some subsequent ZooMS analyses.  And then they also had someone named Arndt Wilcke, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, he also helped with some of the ZooMS analyses.  And then, Tamara; and I always say her last name wrong; Dogandžić, I think.  She was one of the archæoologists at Abri Peyrony: so she helped with context — site context — where these bone tools came from, in the site.  And then, William Rendu worked at the Pech-de-l’Azé I site.  So he helped with context there, and the fauna there.  And then, did I miss anyone?  Oh!  Mark Grote!  He was a very important person on this paper.  He was the .  And so I worked closely with him doing the statistical analysis.  I think I got everyone.\n\n Which activity took the most time and attention?  Which activity took the most time?  And attention. Um.  I mean this might not be the answer you were looking for, but probably just coordinating everyone's schedules. [laughs] And getting everyone on the same track.  Yeah.  I mean, actually when you go and do something: one thing doesn't necessarily take all that long.  But then, it builds up to taking a lot of time altogether.\n\n What was the most difficult part of the study? The most.  Difficult.  Part.  Um.  [pause]  Well, I think it would probably have to do with validating our results.  So since we conducted a non-destructive study, then that brings in the big issue: how do we know that our results are actually what we say they are.  Since it's non-destructive, were we even testing something that came from the bone.  So really really conducting a lot of separate analyses to make sure samples weren't contaminated and making sure that our results were actually coming from the bones: I think that was probably the most difficult part.\n\n How long did it take to conduct the research?  Well, like I said, we started back in 2017.  So, with all the various aspects put together, it's probably two and a half years.  But then, like I said in a previous question, there's a lot of things that happened even before we decided to do this study.  So I don't know; it depends [laughs] exactly what you're asking.\n\n Were you anticipating this outcome?  Um.  Yeah, that's a good question.  Because — So these bone tools were found before I was even involved in this study, or, some of the bones were, right? I told you that I found one — actually found two — myself.  But some of these other ones were found before I was even involved.  And I think that the general consensus of the researchers at that time was that these probably came from medium-sized .  Ungulates would be  animals.  So like a .  And that really had to do with the size of these bone tools: they were pretty small and worn down.  But, once I started studying; and I'd looked at a lot of these similar types of bone tools from other contexts — not that were made and used by Neandertals, but that were made and used by people like you and me in more recent .  And after looking at those, I had an  that they were actually larger bovids — some sort of large bovids — but I couldn't prove it.  Just, that's what I figured at that point.  And so, it was just exciting to see that I predicted it correctly, even though I didn't say it anywhere in publication or anything but just in my mind — that's what I thought it was.\n\n What was the most fascinating aspect of this study? So.  For me it is, like, truly fascinating that we can test plastic that once touched a bone.  And so there is this transfer of collagen from the bone to the plastic: and so we can get this result — get the collagen off of the plastic — so that's just like — when I first even heard about the idea, considered doing it, it just seemed fantastical to me.  So, that was really cool.\n\n What were the challenges that the team faced during the research? Actually I think I've mentioned this in one of those previous questions, but: I think the main challenge had to do with validating our results.  And just proving that our results are what we say they are.\n\n How frequently did the Neanderthals used bones to manufacture tools? So, in general, when Neandertals were living in Europe, and in the , they didn't use very many bone tools; or at least they don't preserve well, or if they were using bone tools, the evidence of it is pretty hard to come by, so it's kind of hard to say if they were using bone tools.  So the most common type of bone tools that they used were these bone fragments that they then used to sharpen the edge of a stone tool.  We call those retouchers.  So I would say they used those fairly frequently.  Because they were using stone tools a lot.  We find lots and lots of stone tools in the archæoological record.  And so, they need to sharpen their stone tools somehow, so often they did use bone to sharpen them.  So that type of bone tool would be considered an  bone tool: you just pick up a piece of bone and use it.  But, the type of bone tool that was in this study — I don't even think I've said the name yet — , which means \"smoother\".  Those were extremely uncommon; and so far they've only been found at a handful of sites.  And I think there are some other bone tools that Neandertals used in later time periods, so the latest Neandertals before they go extinct.  But I would say for the most part they don't seem to be using, or they didn't seem to be using bone tools very frequently.\n\n You mentioned the bones were obtained from two different sites.  Geographically, how far were these sites located from each other? They're about 35 kilometres [almost 22 miles] away in this nice little quaint region of the southwest of France, on different  of a river [the ] in the southwest of France.\n\n What do we know about the history of these sites and the bone tools? So.  Both these sites were actually excavated several times.  The Pech-de-l’Azé site is actually a complex of sites; so this one is Pech-de-l’Azé I, and I believe they have II, III, IV, and V.  I'm not sure if they all have archæology found at them.  Yes, I'd have to go back and look at the literature about that.  But I know the Pech-de-l’Azé complex of sites was excavated over a hundred years ago.  And I know back in 1909, there was the remains of a Neandertal child found.  So that's probably what that site is most famous for.  And then, the other site Abri Peyrony is again, a site in a complex of sites.  But the complex there is called the Combe-Capelle sites.  I think it was originally published back in 1925; the first excavations would have happened a few years before that.  And then it was re-excavated in the 90s, and then again in — around 2010.  Maybe 2009–11, something like that.  And that was the most recent excavation there.\n\n How old are the tools that you and your team studied? So, these bone tools are about the same age at both sites: about 50 thousand years old.\n\n How did you obtain those specimens?  How did we obtain them.  Well, so they were found either during excavation on-site, or they were found after excavation when all the artefacts were being cleaned.  Once we excavate a site, we collect them all, we tag them all, and then they go with the rest of the collection.  But because they were potential bone tools, they were kept aside, and then I just needed permission from the two PIs on these two different sites.  And so, the two PIs were; I mentioned them earlier; Shannon McPherron — when I say PI:  — Shannon McPherron is the PI on Abri Peyrony.  And Marie Soressi is the PI for Pech-de-l’Azé I.\n\n You mentioned the result from one of the sites did not give any positive results.  What could be the reason for that? So, most of the time, it has to do with just collagen preservation.  So that particular bone likely did not have enough collagen left in it to then test.  I guess I can't say that with 100% confidence because we didn't destructively sample that one.  Maybe we would have had result if we actually destructively sampled it.  We just did the non-destructive method and we couldn't get results.  So, chances are it did have less collagen than the other ones.\n\n What do we know about lissoirs?  And do we know how neanderthals manufactured lissoirs?  So, lissoir: we can say that's the typological — type of tool.  So it's a category of tool that Neandertals made and used.  This particular category of tool was actually found in archæoological sites that are a little younger than these Neandertal sites.  So it was known for a very long time in some of these other sites made by  — so not Neandertals: Homo sapiens, people like me and you.  So in general, what we know about lissoirs is that they're these elongated pieces of bones — often made on ribs, but not always, sometimes they're made on the long bone of an animal, like a leg bone of an animal.  But most often they're made on ribs.  And they have this rounded  working end that often exhibits polish.  So these Neandertal-made ones, found at this Neandertal site, fits really well into this category [with] these other ones used by Homo sapiens in subsequent time periods.  And we know that they were manufactured because if you use a  to look at the surface of these bone tools you will see  — parallel striations — at the tip of the tools, and along the edges of the tools that are consistent with scraping and grinding against a stone tool.  So a stone tool would have been used to shape the end of it.\n\n How did you confirm the lissoir was used for working animal skin to leather? So.  There was a study back in 2013 that I was actually a co-author on, but I hadn't done any of the analyses on the bone tools yet at that point.  There were other people doing the analyses on the bone tools at that point.  And so, one of the co-authors on that paper, back in 2013, that was published in , did what they call a  of microwear analysis on the Pech-de-l’Azé I piece.  And so, she used a high-powered microscope and compared the  of the bone tool to a microtopography of an experimental tool that was used on leather.  And they looked very very similar.  So in general, the changes that happen to the surface of the bone looked very very consistent with use on something soft and  like leather.  And then, since 2013, for my dissertation I have done a very similar study myself and would say for the most part the other tools look pretty similar.  Yeah.  That stuff isn't published yet.  But hopefully, it will be published soon.\n\n Do we know how Neanderthals used the leather? Um, no.  And that would be really really difficult to get it.\n\nI imagine it was used as clothing.  And probably even footwear.  Maybe turned into shoes of some sort.  This clothing and footwear would be pretty simple.  We know they didn't have anything sophisticated, like needles for sewing anything tailored.  But probably some sort of clothing, I would say.\n\nBut the leather probably was used for other things as well, like you know: you could make a bag out of it.  Or you could use it as shelter over a cave opening or something.  Um, a blanket yeah, when they were sleeping.  There's probably all sorts of different uses.\n\n Which technologies were used for the study? So do you mean specifically to study the artefacts?  Technologies on the artefacts?\n\n Yes. For this study I would say no, it was just the ZooMS that was done on the artefacts.\n\n Could you briefly explain how ZooMS technology works? Sure.  ZooMS analyses the collagen from ancient bones.  Collagen is an organic  that degrades over time;  so depending how well this collagen is preserved, in this archæological bone, you may or may not have enough collagen to study.  But then, if you do have enough collagen — ZooMS can basically be used as a chemical fingerprint to identify a species that the bones came from.\n\nSo the collagen gets broken down into  components.  And depending on which peptides are there — you can sort of think of it like  when you have certain  there: the presence of a gene means something — in ZooMS the presence of a particular protein, or the combination of a couple different proteins, means it belongs to a certain animal.  So, if you just have one protein present, you know, it might be kind of difficult to say what animal it came from; but the more you have, then you can be more confident in what animal, or type of animal it's coming from.\n\n What were the advantages of using bones from bovine animals over reindeer's? So, I think it mostly has to do with the size.  These large bovids are definitely larger than reindeer.  Reindeer actually have pretty thin and flimsy ribs.  And large bovids like cattle, or bison, they have really really robust ribs.  And so, they're thicker, they're stronger, and they're gonna be more resistant to breaking during .  And probably the action of using this tool would cause it to bend under pressure.  And so when you have this thicker rib, then there's less chance that it's gonna break during use.\n\n Apart from the strength, how do the rib bones of bovines differ from those of reindeers? I guess they'd be a little longer as well.  I mean it's a bigger animal so they're gonna be longer.  The morphology is probably gonna be slightly different.  I would say, in general, ungulates — I mentioned that term before: hoofed animals — they have pretty similar rib morphologies: flatter ribs.  If you just had a piece of the rib on the side of the animal, then you might not be able to tell what it came from.  But if you have a piece preserved, like the head of the rib, or near the  of the rib, there will be some slight morphological differences, where you'd be able to tell what animal it came from.\n\n Did the Neanderthals use reindeer bones for some other purposes? As far as we know, they weren't used for specific purposes.  I mentioned the retouchers before: bones just used to sharpen a lithic edge.  I'm sure there were lots and lots reindeer rib — not ribs — but reindeer leg bones used to resharpen stone tools.  But those probably weren't selected for a specific purpose.  That was just 'cause it was there to use.\n\n Does this imply Neanderthals were inclined [towards] using bones from one species or the other? So, I think there would need to be more research to say something like that.  But in my opinion, I don't think so.  I think it has more to do with the size of the animal, in their environment, at that time, these large bovids were the larger animals on the landscape.  So I think that's why they used those ribs, as opposed to the reindeer, or something else that was more abundant.  Yeah.\n\n How did you make sure this available data is not ? Yeah.  Okay.  So I suppose it could be, an issue of preservation: the only ones that happen to be preserved were the larger bovid bones.\n\nI suppose that could be an issue.  But we did look at all of the fauna from the site and specifically looked at all the ribs from the site as well.  And there are plenty of rib fragments from reindeer, or from smaller species and those do not seem to be preserved any less frequently than the large bovid ribs.  So I don't think that is an issue at the site.\n\n ZooMS usually involve drilling the artefacts.  How did your team come to the idea that you would rather use the collagen stuck to the walls of the containers? The inspiration for the analysis was really from another team that did it first.  I was at a conference in 2017, and I saw that another team had done this.  And I talked to my colleagues, and we decided that we would try this on our bone tools too.\n\n For how long were these bone tools exposed to the plastic containers? It was various amounts of time depending, well, depending on a number of things, how long the artefacts had been found; what they had been curated in before — because not all of them were curated in something plastic beforehand, but most of the Abri Peyrony ones were sitting in a plastic box for about five years.  One of them had been found more recently, and it was only in its plastic box for about two months.  And then, we tested the Pech[-de-l’Azé] one after it had been in a plastic bag for about five months.\n\n Has this type of non-destructive ZooMS been used for studying bones and artefacts dating back millennia? Not back millennia.  I mentioned this other team, who did it first, and they did it non-destructively on  bone tools: so that would be a couple hundred years old.  But so far this particular type of non-destructive ZooMS hadn't been done on anything older.\n\n How did the team make sure the samples gathered from the walls of these containers were not contaminated? So.  As I mentioned before, validating our results and ruling out contamination: it was a big issue for us.  And so we took lots and lots of different measures to do this.  And in the paper, we mentioned seven different ways, how we did this.  When you run the ZooMS samples, you always leave a sample blank.  So, one where you don't have any collagen in it.  If you get results at the end, and there is some sort of collagen, then you know your samples are all contaminated.  But that one was blank, so that was good.  We also tested the empty boxes — similar boxes that never held any archæoological specimens before — those came back empty of any collagen as well.  Next, we tested the washing water that artefacts — when we excavate, they're covered in dirt, most of the time.  So we always wash them to get this dirt off.  And, especially for the teeny tiny bone fragments, those get washed together, because they're all in a bag together; they're really teeny tiny, less than two centimetres; small pieces.  So those get washed together in the little water bath.  And then we tested that water to see if any collagen was contaminating the water, or if there could be any chance of cross-contamination during this washing process.  So then, the third way was — well, when we were doing the identifications, all the IDs came back as one animal.  If it was contaminated you would have IDs that didn't make sense, you know?  Like proteins popping up from, you know, not just these large bovids, but also reindeer, something else in there.  Then, the next way was to look to see if there were any peptides from , or from .  And there wasn't anything like that, so we ruled out any contamination from the skins that may have been worked by these tools.  And then, two more ways that we did.  Since we didn't want to destroy these objects, we couldn't confirm our results destructively.  So we got a sample from the other fauna at the site.  Most of those we had good morphological identifications on, identifications based on morphology; we can say, \"yes this piece is a reindeer; we know that.  100% certainty.\"  And we also did destructive ZooMS as well as non-destructive ZooMS, and — that didn't always work; sometimes we didn't get results at all; but when we did get positive results, for the most part it was all confirming each other.  And then, the last way that we ruled out contamination was, we looked at the  calculations of the collagen, and it showed that the collagen was degraded and therefore ancient.  So, then we were able to rule out modern contaminants in there as well.\n\n Do we know which animals that Neanderthals used for making leather? No.  Not at all.  We don't know that at all.\n\n Is it possible the bones [which] were from different locations gave different results because of the contamination?  As you mentioned one of the sites didn't give any positive results.  Could it be possible because it was contaminated? No, if it was contaminated, then we would have some other results.  We just, we didn't have any results.  That wouldn't be related to contamination.\n\n How did you make sure that everything was pointing back to the same result, provided the number of specimens were not that much? Mm.  Yeah, so sample size is always gonna be an issue in archæology.  It is.  So anybody who's reading the paper is gonna have to take the results, I guess, with a grain of salt.  Because when you start adding more and more samples, maybe the results will start to change.  But just based on the samples that we have, they were all one thing and I mean, I think that's fairly good results for a small sample size.\n\n In your blog post about this research, you had mentioned Neanderthals \"did not necessarily manufacture bones into specific objects\".  What could be the reason?  And can you please explain that? Yeah, so I think when I said that in the blog post, I was thinking about those retouchers that I mentioned earlier.  So they are just the bones that you'd pick up and use to sharpen a stone tool.  So those bones don't need to be shaped into any particular object.  Those bones are just used the way they are to do a very particular task.  And for the most part, Neandertals — they didn't really make many other bone tools.  And that's what we find in the archæoological record: for most of the time Neandertals were alive, hardly any bone tools [are] found from their archæoological sites.  And the reason for that — lots of people have different reasons for this.  Some people say \"oh it's because Neandertals couldn't make bone tools\".   But now we know with these lissoirs that they [could] — they did shape them into somehting to use them.  Also, at very very few sites some of the latest Neandertals that ever lived did make some other bone tools.  So they definitely were able to make bone tools.  But why they didn't make them all the time: that's something harder to get at.  Maybe they just didn't need them for their specific purposes.\n\n What does this tell us about their behaviour? Wait; what specifically?\n\n The process that Neanderthals follow for making tools from bones — what does that tell us about the behaviour? So do you specifically mean these ones?  The lissoirs from this study?\n\n [Nods]. Okay.  Well, it tells me that they knew what they were doing.  They had a clear idea about what type of bone in a certain type of animal would work for a certain purpose.  So they obviously had a lot of forethought.  And they really understood the raw material properties of the particular tools that they were using.\n\n In your career, you had previously worked on a study which stated Neanderthals used sophisticated tools made of bone before humans ever did.  Could you tell us more about it? Yeah, so I believe you're referring to the 2013 study from PNAS.  These are the same bone tools.  It's just, that paper described the discovery of these tools, and this current paper is describing one particular aspect: the raw material selection of these tools.  I guess I just want to comment on that question a little bit.  It's not [just] that they made these tools — they made them before humans were making them in Europe; because Neandertals were in Europe before humans migrated into Europe.  So that was the main thing about that.\n\n So you used the same artefacts for that research as well? Yes.  The same artefacts.  And then, I found an additional one during my dissertation studies.\n\n So what are the inferences of this study? Well, I think I probably said it a couple times now: Neandertals were definitely selective in their raw material for making these bone tools; and this selection really shows that they had knowledge of the raw material properties of these ribs and knew what they wanted for their particular tasks.\n\n Are we aware of some other bone tools used for some other purposes by Neanderthals? Well I mentioned the retouchers before.  Those are very very common at Neandertal sites.  So they're not shaped pieces of bone, they're just bone fragments and then you can see by little impact marks on these bones that they were used to sharpen lithic tools.  And then, in just a few sites in southwest France — the technology I guess we can say, is .  So it would be the very latest latest Neandertals that lived in Europe.  They were making other bone tools then, right before they went extinct.  So they made awls, elongated pointed objects likely for piercing, possibly, animal skins.  They also made some pendants made out of animal teeth, possibly worn as jewellery or something like that.  But that was very very rare, only found at a very small number of sites, and even that is controversial.  Not everyone actually believes that Neandertals made those.  Yeah; there's been debate about that.\n\n Are there any downsides of using a non-destructive ZooMS procedure? So, I would say the main downside would be that your results might be ambiguous, or maybe you don't even get results at all.  Your results are definitely going to be better using the destructive methods.\n\n What does the success of this study mean for the future of archæology, especially for using non-destructive ZooMS procedure? Oh, I think a lot of researchers are probably gonna be pretty excited about this.  Because now, there's the possibility to test all sorts of precious artefacts that nobody ever wanted to sample before.  And so now we can at least try to sample these artefacts and see if we can get some results for that.\n\n Are there any future plans to explore more about the preferences of Neanderthals from other sites, or maybe some other peculiar habits they had? So, if you're speaking of bone tools specifically, I would say: I don't have any specific plans at this moment, but I would love to keep doing that, if there are more bone tools to study in this way.  I would love to do a study on the retouchers that I mentioned several times now, to see if there was some sort of preference with those.  There are plenty of other researchers out there,  working on raw material selection in Neandertals, but on stone.  So for the most part, what we find in the archæoological record, especially in Neandertal times, is a bunch of stone tools.  And so there's actually been lots and lots of research on what Neandertals were using for their stone tools.\n\n What lies ahead in this field of study? I think there needs to be a lot more experimental work done.  If you look at all of our results, including the fauna from the two sites, a lot of the pieces didn't have any positive results at all.  We had a lot of empty spectra.  So, trying to figure out how this actually works, I guess [laughs], that's a big thing.  In what circumstances, and using which plastics — because there are different types of plastics, and maybe certain plastics pull the collagen out of the bone better and stick to the plastic better.  So there's all sorts of different experimental things that can be done.  Working on the plastic; various lengths of time; touching the plastic; if it's rubbing on plastic in a particular way.  Yeah, there's various things that can be done with that.\n\n What are the other researches you are already working on? I guess the main thing that I'm working on right now, I actually just started as a  at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in , Germany; although I'm in California right now.  But I will get over to Leipzig as soon as the world starts opening up again.  But my main reason for being hired by them to work in Leipzig is to study the bone artefacts from a site called  in Bulgaria.  And I was actually in Bulgaria for five months, starting in October, studying the bone artefacts there as well as animal teeth pendants.  And then I went back to California because I was in Bulgaria on a  that ended; but then, I'm gonna try to get back to Europe to continue that study.  So that's the main thing I've been working on, I would say.\n\n What was your role at the UC Davis? So, for the past: well, starting in 2012 — I guess it was — 2012 to 2019, I was a graduate student.  I obtained my PhD last year, and I'm still an associate researcher for UC Davis.  So I still have all my connections there; and I will retain the status of associate researcher for the next couple years.\n\n [Those] were all the questions I had for you.  Is there anything you would like to add? Oh!  Is there anything else?  You know, as I was talking, I was thinking, \"oh I should have said this, and that, and the other thing\", but now when you ask me that I can't remember.  [laughs]  I think the main thing I wanted to get across, and maybe I said it a couple times during this talk:  Just thinking about Neandertals:  When Neandertals were living — mostly in Europe, also in the Near East — for a couple hundred thousand years, during this whole time period, they hardly used bone tools.  Or if they did, it was very opportunistically.  They only made a handful of shaped bone tools for specific purposes.  And when they did do that, they were able to do it in a very professional way.  They knew what they were doing; it wasn't just like \"oh let's just try this thing and see what happens\", right?  So, I guess the main thing I would like to impart, to the general public, is: often, in popular media, whatever, Neandertals kind of get a  as these, I don't know, subhuman type of ancient people, but they were very very sophisticated in many many ways.  And with these bone tools, that's just one of the ways.\n\n Thank you for agreeing for this discussion.  It was a great pleasure  discussing this with you. Yeah!  Thank you.  I enjoyed it as well.\n\n Okay.  Goodbye.  Have a good night.'\n\n Okay you too.

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, June 2020", "content": "The following is the second edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Prohibition Party, Reform Party, and the Life and Liberty Party.\n\nAs the campaign entered June, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who mathematically secured the nomination of his party with victories in the June 2 primaries, led President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, 49.0 percent to 42.2 percent in the  average.\n\n related to the death of  continued across the nation.  During a riot in Washington, D.C. near the White House, rioters reportedly partly set fire to  at , which suffered damage. The next day, with protests ongoing, President Trump delivered a speech declaring himself the \"president of .\" Afterwards he walked to the church.  Before doing so, law enforcement cleared reportedly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square using .  Trump walked and upon reaching the Church held up a Bible for a .  He received criticism for the move.   Protests escalated later in June with the police  in Atlanta.  Charges were promptly filed against the officers involved. Atlanta's Democratic mayor 's handling of the incident raised her vice presidential prospects.  With the issue of race at the forefront of the campaign, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota withdrew her name from consideration to be Biden's running mate.  She endorsed the selection of a \"woman of color.\"  At the time, Bottoms, former  , Congresswoman ,  New Mexico  , and Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were said to be finalists for the .\n\nAlso as a result of the protests, the slogan \"\" became popular among supporters of Black Lives Matter.  The Minneapolis  voted to disband its police force. And in some cities, most notably in Seattle, protesters set up police-free autonomous zones.  CHAZ () or CHOP (Capitol Hill Occupied Protests) as it was later known, formed in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The Trump campaign connected the \"defund\" slogan and lawlessness to Biden.  In addition, rioters started to tear down and vandalize public statues.  They vandalized, toppled, and/or destroyed statues of figures associated with the , and statues of , US presidents  and , and abolitionist . Law enforcement halted attempts to take down an equestrial statue of US President  in Lafayette Square.  Ahead of a planned attempt to take down the  featuring US President  in , Trump vowed to issue an executive order regarding those caught desecrating federal statues.  Trump railed against the rioters during his first campaign rally since the coronavirus pandemic fully engaged the United States, on June 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rally did not require , which led to criticism over concerns about spreading coronavirus.  Attendance was underwhelming with empty seats visible.  Trump created controversy during the rally with a statement about coronavirus testing resulting in an uptick in the number of infections counted.  Although the rate of deaths from coronavirus decreased, infections increased in certain states, resulting in a slowdown in reopening.  Due to the pandemic, the planned  moved from  to Jacksonville.  The Democratic Party planned to hold its  largely online.\n\nOn June 23, Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton released a book, , critical of Trump.  The administration sued to stop publication, claiming the book had not yet been fully checked for classified information.  A judge agreed the book may have contained classified materials but ruled that \"the damage is done\" with advanced copies made available to the media. Notably, in the book, Bolton claims Trump asked Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping for help in the 2020 election, which Trump denied. Trump said Bolton broke the law and \"likes dropping bombs on people, and killing them.\"  Democrats expressed dissatisfaction with Bolton over his unwillingness to testify at the Trump impeachment proceedings.  In interviews promoting the book, Bolton said he would not vote for Trump or Biden but planned to write-in an alternate candidate instead.  In alternate party news, businessman Rocky De La Fuente, already the presidential nominee of the , was named the presidential nominee of both the Reform Party and the  of Michigan. The parties nominated his running mate, historian Darcy Richardson, for vice president. The newly created Life and Liberty Party, a -leaning  party, held its first national convention and nominated a ticket of activist J. R. Myers for president and professor Tiara Lusk for vice president.In the Green Party, union leader and party co-founder  attained the number of delegates required to secure the Green Party presidential nomination ahead of the party's  in July.\n\nAt the end of the month, Biden held his first press conference since the pandemic was just starting in the United States.  At the event, he broached the New York Times report that Russians were paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.Trump described the story as possibly a hoax and the White House claimed it did not brief Trump on the matter. Biden, during his conference, also countered claims about his mental acuity, declaring that he \"can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.\"  Nevertheless, with more  in June including the misstatement that 120 million people had died from coronavirus, opposition questions about Biden's alleged mental decline continued.  A  poll showed 55 percent of respondents believed Biden to be in the early stages of .  Still, he remained well ahead of Trump in opinion polls as the month came to a close. In the RealClearPolitics average at the end of June, Biden led Trump 50.0 percent to 40.4 percent. \n\nIn June, Prohibition Party presidential nominee  and vice presidential nominee Billy Joe Parker unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the Reform Party, thereby denying ballot access for the ticket in Florida.  However, the Prohibition Party has access in Mississippi and Arkansas and is attempting to appear on the ballot in Vermont, Colorado, and Tennessee.  In addition, Collins won the American Independent Party's California Primary in March. Their victory does not guarantee Collins/Parker the party's nomination and a place on the California ballot. The Prohibition Party has not attained ballot access in five or more states since .  In 2016, the party's ticket of James Hedges for President and Bill Bayes for Vice President appeared on the ballot in three states and received 5,617 votes. \n\nCollins/Parker was not the Prohibition Party's original 2020 presidential ticket.  In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. The next month, the party nominated a new ticket of Gammon for President and Collins for Vice President. Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around the beginning of August 2019.  The party finally settled on the Collins/Parker ticket later that month. Parker is a former  who worked in manufacturing and warehousing jobs until retiring in 2002.  Since then he has been active in the . \n\nParker spoke with Wikinews about the campaign.  He discussed why he ultimately decided to join the Prohibition Party, what he sees as his duties and responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee, and why voters should consider voting for the Collins/Parker ticket.\n\n When did you join the Prohibition Party and what attracted you to it?\n\nParker: I first discovered the Prohibition Party about  2000. I donated to it until about AD 2005 when I was asked to join and represent Georgia in the party. The Prohibition Party appealed to me because of the high caliber men in leadership and I was impressed by their willingness to set the highest standards possible for the American people and their children. The Prohibition Party has a higher dimension than either the Republican and Democrat parties. The party pursues the edification of the American people financially, economically, spiritually, and morally. Its higher dimension is that it includes the lives and welfare of American children that the Democrat and Republican parties exclude from their protection and they will surrender the children to be destroyed in order to appease interstate groups for power to gain rule over the nation. The Prohibition Party obeys the  and the US Constitution and the duty they set to give life to each American.\n\n What duties and responsibilities come with your role as the vice presidential nominee of the Prohibition Party?\n\nParker: I feel my duty and responsibility as the Prohibition Party vice-presidential nominee is to aid and support the election of our candidate for president — Phil Collins — whom I feel is far superior to the Democrat candidates for president and of a much higher virtue. I would recommend to the members of the  and Republican Party to leave their parties and join the Prohibition Party in order to make their children safer.\n\n Why should voters consider voting for the Collins/Parker ticket over others on the ballot?\n\nParker: Americans, if you want the very best for your children — prosperity, education, health, good leadership, and a better security that they shall live in happiness to a ripe old age, then you should vote for the Collins/Parker ticket. Under the Republican and Democrat parties, millions of children and adults have died from the wrongs of men, women, and society that have been imposed on them because of a lack of love for them. The Prohibition Party will obey the promise of life to each person made by the nation through the Declaration of Independence. Happily we will meet you at the polls in November. We wish you the very best in whatever choice you make. If you choose against us, it will not diminish or end our love for you. Be sure we will defend you and your children in or out of power as we would defend ourselves.\n\nMay God bless you forever.  I remain your obedient servant.\n\nAt the virtual 2020 Reform National Convention on June 20, the Reform Party nominated the De La Fuente/Richardson presidential ticket, granting it ballot access in Florida. Three days later, the ballot- qualified Natural Law Party of Michigan gave its nomination to the duo. De La Fuente/Richardson has already secured the nomination of the Alliance Party, giving it ballot access in Delaware, South Carolina, and possibly Connecticut.  Wikinews reached out to Richardson to discuss the campaign.\n\nRichardson is a political activist and historian who has authored many books on past political campaigns. He owns the political website Uncovered Politics.  In the , Richardson served as campaign manager for the late US Senator . Richardson himself entered presidential politics when he challenged President Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's 2012 presidential nomination. He sought the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nomination but lost to his 2020 running mate De La Fuente. In 2018, Richardson  for  as the Reform Party nominee and finished in third place. \n\nWith Wikinews, Richardson discussed his role as the running mate of De La Fuente, the complexity of being the vice presidential nominee for so many parties simultaneously, and for what the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stands.\n\n What are your duties and responsibilities as the running mate of Rocky De La Fuente?\n\nRichardson: Well, I can certainly understand why , in turning down the vice presidency in , quipped that he didn't intend to be buried until he was dead and while I think there was plenty of wisdom in the late Eugene McCarthy's seemingly offhanded suggestion that the office should probably be abolished, I thought it was important to run for vice president not only to help promote Rocky's candidacy — he's a genuine humanitarian and has a lot to offer the country, especially in a dire moment like this — but also to help introduce a new approach to politics in an era of extreme hyper-partisanship and polarization under the auspices of the nascent Alliance Party, a profoundly and refreshingly principled party. \n\nThe level of partisanship in this country is almost sickening.  The American people are hurting, and they're hurting badly, and most of them — if they were really honest with themselves — know the two major parties have failed them, and have failed them badly.\n\nAs Rocky's running mate, I will do anything I'm asked.  Unless the pandemic makes travel impossible this autumn, I'm planning to personally stump in the old \"\" — places like Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin where we'll likely be on the ballot and where the presidency is probably going to be decided.  I'm willing to spend as much time in those battleground states as necessary.  In addition to campaigning in Tennessee and South Carolina, I plan to press our case pretty hard here in Florida, too.  Of course, due to the badly-botched response to COVID-19 by Gov. DeSantis, who spent too much time listening to the megalomaniac in the White House and too little time listening to health experts, the Sunshine State will probably be the epicenter of the pandemic long before then.  Campaigning, of course, could be hazardous.\n\n De La Fuente/Richardson is the ticket of the Alliance, Reform, Natural Law, and American Delta parties. What can the De La Fuente campaign do to grow these parties? Is the campaign focused more on growing one party over the others?\n\nRichardson: This isn't about parties or any particular party.  We're doing this to give the American people a pragmatic, centrist-oriented alternative to the two sorry choices being offered by the Republicans and Democrats, one that is hellbent on renominating an incumbent who probably knew less than any President since  upon assuming the nation's highest office, and the other which intends to nominate a guy who once possessed quite a bit of knowledge but is now, sadly, beyond his prime.  I think it's pretty safe to say at this stage of his life that Joe Biden has forgotten more than Trump ever knew.  \n\nWe don't intend to favor any party over any of the other parties which are supporting us, but we hope that all of them will share in pulling off the greatest upset in U.S. political history when we defeat the failed and corrupt duopoly on Nov. 3rd.  With twin crises plaguing the country and the world — a deadly global pandemic and a looming economic depression on the immediate horizon — these are unprecedented times and anything is possible.\n\n What does the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stand for? What unique issues or ideas should a voter associate with the campaign?\n\nRichardson: We've embraced the Alliance Party's Manifesto and, as such, want to return the United States to its rightful place as the world's \"Gold Medal Nation,\" the global leader in creating an economy that works for everyone, not just the \"investor class,\" and leading the way in terms of environmental stewardship by investing in 100 percent clean and renewable energy.  It's later than we think.  Much later.  \n\nWe also want to be the envy of the world when it comes to providing affordable health care for all of our citizens,  How tragic it is that the United States has only four percent of the world's population yet has suffered more than 25 percent of the Coronavirus deaths. \n\nFinally, a De La Fuente−Richardson administration will also strive to make the U.S. second-to-none when it comes to educational opportunities and outcomes.\n\nOn June 27, via , the Life and Liberty Party (L&L) held its first national convention.  It nominated conservative activist J. R. Myers of Alaska for president.  For vice president, three candidates sought the party's nomination. With 71 percent of the vote, Tiara Lusk of Idaho was victorious. Wikinews contacted Lusk about her designation as the first vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party.\n\nLusk teaches business management as an adjunct professor at . She served as a delegate at the 's 2018 convention and as a delegate at the Constitution Party's .  In addition, she chaired region six of the Constitution Party of Idaho. \n\nThe Life and Liberty Party formed from former members of the Constitution Party.  It has attained ballot access in Arkansas and is currently petitioning in several other states.  As of late June, several state Constitution parties were considering severing their ties with the national Constitution Party, which nominated Don Blankenship for president in May.    According to Politics1.com, some of these states may attempt to give their nomination and ballot access to the Myers/Lusk ticket. \n\nWith Wikinews, Lusk discussed why she joined the Life and Liberty Party, what her role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters should choose the Myers/Lusk ticket over other conservative tickets.\n\n What is the Life and Liberty Party? How is it different from the Constitution Party?  And why did you decide to seek its vice presidential nomination?\nLusk: One major difference is that L&L is a Party that is open to diverse religious groups and belief systems. The Constitution Party tends to be more narrowly focused on a certain branch of Christianity. I believe that most cultures throughout the world are founded primarily on conservative values and our party wants to welcome diverse groups that support our party platform. I'd say I'm a spiritual person but I take a scientific approach to learning about eternal truths. Additionally, L&L is the only party that advocates for a debt jubilee. These two platform stances were the main reasons I was attracted to the L&L party. I was also really impressed with JR in his debates and I wanted to be part of his team.\t\n\n What are your duties and responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party?\n\nLusk: My duties consist of speaking to the public about the issues that are important to JR. I'm also responsible for some marketing aspects of the campaign and getting signatures for ballot access.\n\n Why should right wing or conservative voters choose Myers/Lusk over President Trump or the Constitution Party's Blankenship/Mohr ticket?\n\nLusk: The public should vote for us because we are focused on bringing healing, unity, and order to our country by centering our platform on the foundations that have made our country great. We focus on real solutions that address the core root of the problems in our society, instead of bandaid solutions to address symptoms. The other parties tend to be focused on surface level solutions. Additionally, Trump and Blankenship seem very much driven by a personal grudge. Their statements are often inflammatory, which causes even further hatred and division in our society. The most effective leaders are able to inspire hope in their followers. Rather than incite further tension, JR and I are focused on bringing healing and unity to our country.", "question": "What was the outcome of Joe Biden's campaign during the June primaries?\n\nA) He lost to President Trump.  \nB) He secured the Democratic nomination with victories.  \nC) He withdrew from the race entirely.  \nD) He was declared the winner of the Reform Party nomination."}

Wikinews also reached out to Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer and contributor of the youtube-dl project to discuss this takedown.\n\n When did you get to know about the takedown notice and what were your initial reactions?\n\n I saw the takedown notice along with anyone else, on reddit.  Since I am no longer involved with the youtube-dl project (except for occasional contributions, my maintainership ended in 2016), I don't know any details.\n\n Does YouTube implement DRM for videos not under Creative Commons license, and if so, how does youtube-dl bypass it?  Could you please elaborate the procedure?\n\n YouTube implements DRM for YouTube Movies.  youtube-dl does not support those.\n\nYouTube has multiple non-DRM video delivery protocols.  I'm not up to date about specifics; my last dabbling in this was in 2015.\n\nOne of these protocols is described here.  YouTube uses  to compute parts of the URLs.  youtube-dl executes this JavaScript, just like a web browser.\n\n Could you also explain in brief how youtube-dl functions, and how the maintainers had intended it to be used?\n\n youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, just like any other web browser, from over 1000 different services. Its uses are varied: It enables video playback on many devices (e.g. ) where the video services don't work properly, it makes high-quality video playable for people with a bad or no Internet connection, it enables disabled users to use tools to play videos, and it is used for archival and research.\n\n What do you think of the DMCA notice?\n\n I think it is not warranted because youtube-dl is entirely legal.  As the DMCA notice has no effect for me personally, I'm not really the right person to address it.\n\n Why were the copyrighted tests in the source code?  Could they be replaced?\n\n I'm not sure why, but my guess is that users requested support for these videos and thus they were added as test cases.  They can be removed trivially, without losing any function of youtube-dl.\n\n Are you aware Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was a \"disappointing and counterproductive move\"?  What do you think should be the next steps?\n\n Yes, and I concur.  I'm no longer involved in the project. If I were, I would probably just remove the test cases, block these music videos (RIAA is not worth the trouble for me, that can be done by other projects), and get the project back online.\nI understand people who think differently.", "question": "What was the primary reason GitHub blocked public access to the youtube-dl repository?  \n\nA) It was due to a violation of privacy policies.  \nB) GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the RIAA.  \nC) The maintainers decided to discontinue the software.  \nD) Users reported malicious activity related to the software."}
{"title": "Open source game developer Perttu Ahola talks about Minetest with Wikinews", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Open source game developer Perttu Ahola talks about Minetest with Wikinews}}\n\nRecently, Finnish open-source  Perttu Ahola discussed Minetest, his \"longest ever project\", with Wikinews.\n\nStarted in October 2010, Minetest was an attempt by Ahola to create a  similar to .  Minecraft is a multi-platform commercial game, which was in  version when Ahola challenged himself to create something similar to it from scratch, he told Wikinews.\n\nMinetest is an open-source game, which is free for anyone to download and play. It is written in the , and the  is available on code-hosting site GitHub.  According to Ahola, Minetest attempts to run on older hardware, with limited graphics, but to be accessible to more people: those who have outdated technology, and making it available for no cost.  Minecraft, on the other hand, is a paid game, currently costing USD 26.95 for its computer version.  Minecraft is currently owned by Microsoft, and performs poorly on older hardware.\n\nA correspondent from French Wikinews contacted Perttu Ahola via  a few weeks ago, discussing Minecraft.  This interview is built on top of the previous interview, as we take a deeper dive into knowing more about this free game which is about to turn ten years old in a few months.\n\n Can you introduce yourself?\n\n  Hi.  Although I'm usually called \"celeron55\" on the Internet, my real name is Perttu Ahola.  I'm a  and  geek from Finland.\n\n How did you find out about programming?\n\n I've had programming as a hobby my entire life.  When I was a kid I programmed using  on my dad's computers and at school and university I attended programming courses and learned more .\n\n What made you want to create Minetest?\n\n Initially I took it as a challenge, but after a year of working on it, it turned into this weird quest of trying to figure out what can be done with it that  (now Microsoft) won't do.  But initially it was the challenge, and the mystery of how a game world like this works under the hood.\n\n When did you start working on Minetest initially?\n\n At the beginning of October 2010.\n\n How many core-developers were working on the development at that time?\n\n Myself only.  Back then it was exactly what the name implies.  The first contributor appeared six months after.\n\n When was Minetest first available to public?\n\n It was first published to a private IRC channel for testing, and after about a week I published it on a public programming channel on  called #ohjelmointiputka.  I created the website sometime during January 2011.\n\n How were the initial few months for the game?  How did the userbase respond?  How was it received?\n\n The initial userbase was mostly a bunch of hobbyist programmers from that  IRC channel.  Everyone liked messing around in the quirky little multiplayer  that it was.\n\n How many core-developers are working on Minetest right now?\n\n I need to look this up as much as you do...  Looks like we have 13 at the moment.  It doesn't really correlate with how many people are working on Minetest though, as core developer is primarily a position of trust — they decide what is merged into the upstream repositories.  Some contributors do a lot but aren't core developers.  This goes both ways: Some core developers are quite inactive a lot of the time.\n\n Do these trusted core-developers have specific roles?\n\n They used to have, but [it] didn't work very well.  Nowadays everyone is simply responsible of only touching things they know about.\n\n What are you learning from them and what are they learning from you?\n\n During the first years I learned a lot about programming.  Some of it came from others but mostly it was just because I did it so much myself.  Later I've learned some things about management as I had to move from programming more into a leadership role.  Many young people have come and gone from the project as their life has moved on — I'm sure they've learned something from it.\n\n Tell us more about your workflow.\n\n Historically when making most of my development contribution in Minetest, or currently?\n\n Tell me about both the times, please.\n\n Well there's not much to talk about my current workflow, as I'm mainly doing  and administration, being an encyclopædia about the code and design of the project, assigning core developer, moderator and other roles to people, and just managing the odd weird things that sometimes happen that contributors and core developers can't handle.\n\nWhen I was programming Minetest in the first many years, and these days in other development projects, my workflow is just to allocate as much continuous time that I possibly can for a task that I want to do, then just begin designing and writing a prototype and iteratively forming it into a final implementation.  The only distinct step in between starting and finishing is the first time it runs and does the bare minimum.\n\nI don't want to boast about it, but people have commented about my ability to solo develop things really fast from nothing into usable state.  There's no method to it.  I just make sure I have the time, I know what the bare minimum is and then I just get to it.\n\n Have there been any significant changes in the game or source code in the history of Minetest?\n\n It was developed in a very .  We've never had to throw away any big parts.  Maybe iterative isn't the best word, I mean it was always developed by building on what was previously created.  Actually we've had one big change, although it too was an addition: When we went from version 0.3 to 0.4, Minetest gained its -based  .  It was a really big change in how people thought about and used Minetest.\n\n What are the different ways to participate?\n\n Many of our users like to write , big and small, and publish them on our forum and content database.  If you're more of a  person, our GitHub and  channels are good places to check out.  If you feel like a server administrator, you could set up a Minetest server with an interesting world for people to join in.\n\nIf you find something interesting in the game world while playing or experimenting, we have a popular screenshot thread on our forums that you can post to.  It shows almost the entire history of the project and I still like browsing it.  But I think the best part of Minetest is that it sets people free to do their own thing.  You don't need to ask us or anyone to use Minetest for anything you would like.  Use it to learn programming, use it as a teacher, use it to model an environment, geographical formations, a mathematical formula or an electronic principle, use it to prototype a multiplayer game.  Use it as a way to host a party when in ? I think of it more of as a tool than a game project.\n\nBut you're welcome to contribute something that makes it better.  It is a project at multiple levels, so pick a level that you're comfortable in.\n\n Can you give us some figures on Minetest?\n\n We don't really keep track of our userbase in any centralized manner, so I don't have any numbers to give unless I go about digging for them.  It's difficult to figure out how many installs of Minetest there are when it's packaged in so many Linux distributions that I can't even count those reliably.  There are also endless  to be found, especially on mobile platforms, even though we do publish an official  version.\n\n What are the tools you use for the development of Minetest?\n\n ,  and some common  like , , .   of course.  Sometimes .  Minetest uses the  build system which is simple to use from the command-line.  All in all just the bread and butter Linux command-line environment, with my personal customization of course.\n\nI don't really like complex slow IDEs [], they get in the way and create new problems that you shouldn't have to deal with.\n\n How do you track the progress of the development?\n\n Currently, or when I started the project?  In any case the answer pretty much is I don't.  Things develop as they do and nobody likes being pushed when they're doing it as a hobby for free.  We use a release process where when enough new features have been added, there is a  where only  are allowed, and then a release.  It's the bare minimum to keep things rolling smoothly in a large project like this.  We have long wishlists and roadmaps, but in the end what features get developed gets chosen by whoever's putting in the work, as long as whatever they want to do fits the project.\n\nWell, we of course have an issue list and PR [] list on GitHub.  I tend to take that for granted these days.\n\nThere are multiple levels you can track development in — issues and pull requests are at the bottom just above commits.  You could be tracking roadmaps or minimum viable products or such, but we use a relatively chaotic model if you compare it to a company developing a product for a market.\n\n How rigorously is the software tested?\n\n There are  for some easily testable portions, and there's a CI [] server that checks whether the project builds on a couple of platforms and whether the tests pass.  In addition to developers many of our users are using the development version which helps us catch bugs before they end up in a release, making releases reasonably .  How rigorously?  Well, you could do more or less, but this seems to balance the effort and the end result.\n\n Have there ever been critical bugs in the releases, or severe security breaches?\n\n That depends on your criteria.  Nothing that would've made the news.  And nothing that I would really remember.  Something allowing in-game cheating on a multiplayer server, sure.  Something that would have irreversibly corrupted a player's game world, not in a stable release.  Something that would have prevented the game from starting on some platform, sure of course.  Something worthy of a remote code execution CVE []?  Well not really, but that can be just because not enough resources are put into finding out if there are any.  Not that we have any resources for that.  Contributions welcome!\n\n What are the key selling points of Minetest?  As I understand, Minetest is not just a game, and you can do more with it.  What are some of the fascinating use cases you have seen people use Minetest for?\n\n It's so many things to so many people.  The basic premise is, it implements a cubic  world which is played in the  or  perspective, either locally or on a multiplayer server.  In the default game there's a sandbox or a survival-ish scenario where you can build stuff from familiar materials, and a world generator that creates a natural landscape.\n\nBut hooks have been added to it where you can add or remove content to your liking (these pluggable modifications are called \"mods\" by the engine), and the community has used these over the years to create different kinds of above- and underground landscapes that can either be just explored or used as the backdrop for whatever you're doing, logical systems resembling electronics or mechanics, programmable blocks, sets of animals with different design goals, some vehicles (although the engine isn't quite up to snuff for those), trains, multiplayer economics, some RPG [] elements, weapons, things designed for education, and whatnot.  Those are combined in multiplayer worlds on servers to something much more than the sums of their parts.\n\nAnd often the enjoyment is as much in the making of a mod as it is in using the end result.  It's an outdated idea that you implement a feature to use it.  Minetest can be enjoyed as much inside a text editor as it can be enjoyed by controlling the player character in the game.  It's actually interesting also that the fact that it is a multiplayer sandbox environment makes it fun in itself due to human nature.  I proved it with the initial versions that had like 3 block types and zero game elements or limits other than basic gravity.  You get these layers of creativity: There's creativity in the making of Minetest, there's creativity in making a mod, there's creativity in making a world, there's creativity in the playing itself.\n\nIf you like messing around in open-ended development and gameplay, Minetest is for you.  If you need an end goal and a set path, some specific mods or servers could give you those.  I mean, one could write a book about this.  It's the question Minetest asked that Minetest has been answering.\n\n What are the main features that differentiate Minetest from ?\n\n Minetest has a simple base game that might seem like the exact same thing.  However, under the hood Minetest is open source, has a modding API, runs on older hardware, supports more platforms and is free to download.  The community has released many kinds of games that run on Minetest and in fact the project is very much based on the community.\n\n Tell us more about Minetest's modding API.\n\n Technically the modding API is a Lua interpreter integrated into the Minetest engine, which runs Lua in an environment to which most of the game content and engine features are provided by the engine.  There is a simple format for bundling code, textures, sounds and other data to form a thing called \"mod\".  Users can install them and enable them for the game worlds they create.\n\nMods also create their own APIs that other mods can interface to, and the engine implements a dependency model to facilitate this.  Some game content is grouped into groups so that handling similar items by mods that don't know about the specifics can handle them in reasonable ways.  Say, if you add a new kind of tree formed from its special blocks, they can be marked as being wood or so, and then you can use them as fuel in most cooking or such devices no matter who created them.\n\nThere is a mechanism for bundling mods into modpacks to easily bundle related mods together, and there is a concept called \"game\" which is kind of a stand-alone modpack.  The game Minetest comes with is just one of those, and if you install more, you can choose between them in the menu.\n\n Why was Lua chosen for the API?  What are some of the advantages of using Lua?\n\n Lua is simple but effective, and designed for .  It's also easy to sandbox.  Not many languages actually are designed for embedding, and some of those aren't simple.  For example, ['s]  is complex and its API is changing all the time, and Python isn't really designed for embedding, it's more of a host language and messes with your locale settings and whatnot, and is quite slow.\n\nThere's also , which is a JIT [] compiled version of Lua.  Minetest is able to use it and as such usually Minetest is built with it, as it's faster.  Lua also has a track record in games, although that doesn't matter much in practice.\n\n What are some of the Minetest features that are extremely popular among the users?\n\n How do I know?  Well, I mean, placing blocks probably, I'm pretty sure everyone does that.  More seriously what Minetest does that Minecraft don't is that for the vast majority of servers you don't have to modify your client at all, regardless of mods used on the server.  The client downloads what it needs from the server and custom code runs on the server.  The user of course doesn't need to do anything to make this happen so everyone is automatically using it and it is quite a defining feature.\n\nModding, of course, is an extremely popular feature — Minetest wouldn't be what it is without mods.  I'd say extremely popular is also the fact that Minetest's mobile versions use the same protocol and code as the desktop version.  I don't think most users appreciate it, but some do.  It brings you all the power regardless of the device.\n\nWell, one Minetest feature is definitely also the license, being LGPL [] 2.1.  It has allowed many more and less appreciated developers to publish their own versions of it.  This has happened on all the mobile app stores, those are full of Minetest forks with awful advertising and  schemes.  To me it's funny and definitely something that those shady developers appreciate, to users who have fallen for them it's probably quite painful.\n\n When was the last time you played Minecraft?\n\n I don't remember, certainly not once after 2014 as I don't have it on this computer.  It quickly grew too slow on the previous computer on which I started developing Minetest.  In the  days [of Minecraft] it was capable of running on it, these days not a chance.\n\n What are some of the features in Minecraft that you hear about, which aren't currently in Minetest?\n\n I rarely hear about Minecraft and even then it's about some server and not about features.  At one point every place was full of all kinds of Minecraft mods, but nowadays you have to go look for them to find them.\n\n Actually, what position do you hold in the Minetest development?\n\n For the past years I've been doing the positions that are the most difficult to fill for contributors: Being the \"CEO\" [Chief Executive Officer] of the project, and doing part of the web hosting, mostly the message board and overseeing the use of *.minetest.net subdomains.  Basically just overseeing things and making sure things that people don't like to do don't turn into disasters.  Sometimes I help with technical details of the engine that people don't always fully understand.\n\n What are some of the things you really like about your work?\n\n I like how robust Minetest is.  It's based on proven technology that are kind of outdated, but that makes it easily compile and run almost anywhere, and as it's also free, it spreads and sticks like some goo.  It's also small and low maintenance, which I like in anything I do.\n\nI also like that it explores what can be done in the game or application category it's in, in an unusual way (like outside the box of gameplay itself).\n\n Do you do this full-time?  Or do you have any other job?\n\n Even though the first year or two things were quite hectic I've never done this full time.  It doesn't really make any money.\n\n Ah, so you do have other job, too, right?\n\n Yeah, I've had a number of jobs during this time.\n\n How does the game development receive financial support?\n\n I get some donations or \"tips\" as I like to call them, which generally cover the hosting costs of the website and not much more.  Other than that, there has never been any money involved.  In addition to myself some modders and developers also collect some miniscule amounts of donations.\n\nI guess development is mostly supported by being able to slap it onto your CV [] and get a better job that way.  I guess it's a bit sad.  Or  for , of course.\n\n\"Hi, my hobby is taking over the world from Microsoft.  What's yours?\"  Well it's a bit of a joke of me introducing myself and Minetest.  And the absolute craziness of doing it for no monetary gain at all.\n\n  Yeah; but some sort of donation is needed for running the servers, hosting the wiki, and the , right?\n\n It's not required, but I'm fortunate enough to get enough donations to not [have] to pay them out of my own pocket.\n\n How does a typical day as the core-developer look like?\n\n The core-developer?\n\n Since you are one of the core-developers of the game, how does your typical day as the core-developer of this open-source game look like?\n\n Currently, as I'm focusing on some other programming projects outside of Minetest, when I have some free time I still check the Minetest IRC channels and GitHub to see what's going on, and if I have something to say I'll make a comment about it.  Of course I check my emails to see if any automated system has sent me a warning about something and needs fixing, or maybe there's a private message on the forum about some administrative task that needs doing.  I might check some system statistics on the VPS [] running the forum to make sure it's running smoothly and make sure backups look ok.\n\nThe average core developer of course doesn't have much of these administrative things to do and can focus on some programming task or just check through pull requests to see if a new contribution needs attention.  For most core developers the typical day is probably a day off, though, as we work on Minetest when we have free time and feel like it.\n\n Tell me, what are some of the design decisions that you are not happy about?\n\n There are none, all of them were required to get where we are now.  I think you should never blame a design decision that got you somewhere.\n\n Okay.  How does the developer team decide on the design-decisions and feature requests for the game?\n\n I have written some blog posts and roadmaps about my vision, and the team is free to either pick from there or simply do anything they think is important.  The core team mostly deals with engine things, and feature requests often come from modders.  Dealing with game design feature requests is really difficult so we've tried to move them out of the engine and into the independent game content.  Most features are accepted as long as they're simply and nicely done and it's obvious players or modders will find use for them.\n\nThe team will ask from me if they're unsure about something.  It doesn't often happen, but they're free to do it and I take the responsibility in that case.\n\nThis also applies if there's a conflict between team members.\n\n Conflict between the team members?  How often is there a conflict between team members?  And how do you resolve it?\n\n I'm not sure it has ever really happened.  It's not as exciting as it sounds.  But in that case I get to be the dictator.  :-)\n\n What accomplishment are you most proud of?\n\n I think it's the initial decision to start the project.  Everything is based on that, after all.  Maybe also the fact that probably like 50% of Minecraft clones on Google Play are Minetest forks, many of which are at least slightly illegal.\n\n Looking back at the 9–10 years of this project, what are some of the excellent moments/milestones that stand out?\n\n The initial 0.4 development in late 2011 and early 2012 was an exciting time.  One of the contributors at the time helped me a lot in getting it done, he was quite capable and enjoyable to work with.  It felt a bit like a \"dream team\".  Some persons in the Minetest team are quite anonymous, including this one — I never learned their real life identity.\n\nThere was a take over attempt of the project in 2017 by an individual who until then seemed like a contributor with good intentions.  It was quite the time too.  I don't want to give any publicity to him though, as he's still trying to do it.  I don't know if I'd call it excellent, but it definitely comes to mind as something that happened.\n\nDuring the past few years Minetest has had some physical presence in Europe.  A couple of core developers and community members organized a stall at the  #live event in 2017 and 2018.\n\nI guess I have to say I'm not that good at remembering milestones though.  I'm sure many people have their own memories about Minetest's history.  Many remember their first server that they played on, for example — my perspective on the other hand is in development.  In development, it's a good thing I don't remember much because that means everything has gone rather smoothly.\n\n Have you been to Freenode #live events?\n\n I haven't been to Freenode #live.  I don't tend to travel that far, I feel international travel is too much hassle and I'm not a very social person at all.\n\n Do you or any of the Minetest developers attend ,  or other conferences too?\n\n I haven't been following too closely, but as they're open source developers and many live in , you might stumble upon them in events around there.  They might be in a disguise, though, as they are involved in other projects in addition to Minetest.\n\nRubenwardy (one of the core developers) has said he wants a Minetest convention and I have to go.  We'll see if that happens, and where if so.\n\n Ah, that would be interesting.  Does Rubenwardy have any places in mind?  What do you think of organising it in Helsinki?\n\n As most core developers and contributors come from Germany, France, UK and such, I think Helsinki wouldn't make that much sense.\n\nDuring Minetest's history, there haven't been almost any Finnish developers other than me.  And, given that I live half a thousand kilometers away from Helsinki, it's not exactly my home town either.\n\nIt's a very international project.\n\n How do you and Minetest benefit from the presence at freenode? Apart from the platform features, do you also benefit from links with members of other channels at Freenode?\n\n Freenode doesn't really link projects together, it mostly works as a private platform for discussions for each project.  Of course it's easy to join if you're already on some other Freenode channels, as many open source developers are.\n\n Apart from freenode, how do the developers meet with other developers? Do they use online text or video chat, or do they also have meet-ups in-person?\n\n I hear people using mostly IRC, Github and the forum.  There's some development talk on the unofficial  server too.  I rarely hear about IRL meet-ups.  I've only ever met one Minetest contributor who was visiting  with a group to see the  which happens this time of the year here in the north.\n\n What is planned for the next versions?\n\n I and many of our core developers have big plans but we're a bit lazy and have many projects going on so it's really up to who has a spare week here and there and what kind of new contributions are coming in.  We have a history of not ending up even close to what the roadmap was telling us to do.  On a weekly basis we do have a continuous flow of fixes and new modding API features going into the engine, so there's always something around the corner.  In addition to that, an interesting place to be on the lookout is the modding sections of our forum.  Those guys get to use much more imagination than the core engine developers.  It's been long in the plans to get more imaginative content into the main Minetest release, but currently it's still kind of boring, so make sure [to] check out the forum and content database.\n\n What are some of the upcoming milestones for Minetest?\n\n We're moving release by release and including stuff on a when-it's-ready basis.  [Version] 5.3 will be coming out very soon as there are just some bugs left.  It's ended up with 50 commits.  That's mostly bugfixes, but to pick a feature, the \"minimal development test\" game that comes with engine for mod and engine developing purposes has been rethought and overhauled.  What'll end up in 5.4 is still completely open.\n\nIn my experience setting any milestones you're not doing yourself is never a good idea in a hobby project — it'll just intimidate people and nothing gets done.  Some developers have big plans, including myself, but they may or may not happen. :-)\n\n How is the  [internationalisation] support for Minetest?  Do you plan on supporting more languages?\n\n There are some challenges due to the fact that Minetest supports multiplayer servers with each client using their own language settings, but if you choose your mods carefully, you can get a single player experience in many, many languages.  You can check out the translation status for different languages at .  You can also contribute translations right there on that website.  We occasionally update the English versions and occasionally copy the translated texts over to the project to be included in releases.\n\nMany open source projects do it like this, we're no different.  Currently it looks like 11 languages have 90% of texts translated.  More than 90%, I mean.\n\nOf course with game content, especially that which you find separately, your mileage will vary — but the engine translations are enough to configure Minetest and get you into a game world.  It's an ongoing process to try to make everything we can translatable by the community.\n\n Okay.  Do you also plan on providing more biomes, or making the current ones more interesting?\n\n We've long been in the process of moving the game content out of the engine and away from the core team more to individual game-focused developers, so the default game content has been a bit boring.  However, you don't need to live with it, as it's easily solved: just download some biomes you like into your game.  At this point it's not really even intended to be used as-is.\n\nIt's the core idea of Minetest 0.4, and from there on all subsequent versions.  Content is so easy to add and modify that it doesn't really even matter what content you start from.\n\nIf you want a fleshed out product with everything in there out of the box, Minetest doesn't really do that.  But you can search on our forums or content database if there's something that would do it for you — some game packages are quite complete.\n\n What are some of the reasons people choose Minecraft over Minetest?  What are some of the common complaints you hear about the game?\n\n I think most of the time people don't like Minetest because they want a full game that they can just play.  On the other hand other people choose Minetest because they don't want that, they want something they can easily customize.\n\nSome don't like how Minetest looks, to the experienced eye the graphics aren't as polished.  However it does run on older hardware.  People using older hardware often choose Minetest because it works much better.  On the other hand, Minetest can't utilize high end gaming PCs as well, it's not optimized for those.\n\nOf course also the price differentiates the two.  Minecraft costs a lot, especially if you're a kid in a poor country, or you want to install it on every computer in the classroom, or even an entire school.  But for the money you're getting a fleshed out product.  For some use cases you can't beat that.\n\n Will the improvement in the graphics of the game compromise with the advantage of the game running on older hardware?  Is it possible to achieve both without any compromises?\n\n Improvement in graphics will compromise the advantage of being able to run on old hardware, or it will result in basically two separate rendering engines.  To take advantage of new hardware you have to switch to newer versions of , heavily use shaders and such, and as a result old hardware simply grinds to a halt or simply doesn't support those.\n\nOf course some improvement can be done without compromise, but it's relatively minor if you look at what gamers are expecting these days.  On the other hand for use by kids or education or such, looks don't really matter.  What matters is that it's able to run on the hardware they happen to have.\n\n Would you want to create two different engines for those players who have new hardware and want to enjoy the open-source game?\n\n Maybe, but I'm not the one to do it.  High-end graphics is quite a specialized field and it's especially specialized when you want to render a voxel world like this, with voxel-based lighting and whatnot.  For more common types of game environments you could use more easy-to-use solutions.\n\n What contributors are the most wanted at the moment? What activities are in dire need of more eyeballs and helping hands?\n\n Any kind of contribution is always welcome.  I don't think I'm in a position to pick and choose what people spend their time on.  If you contribute something because it's important to you, it's going to be important to some others too.  I also can't pick and choose what skills people have.  If you are a capable programmer and for some crazy reason have lots of free time that you don't know what to do with, you can absolutely trust me and other core developers to give you things to do for the rest of your life.  But that's not how it works, nobody is like that.  You do what you like and what you feel is important.  You will be thanked by the users.\n\nOn the off chance that I can get a programmer inspired to do something for us: We've been long thinking of Voxel Area Entities — basically objects that are built from the same blocks that the world is, but that can move within the world based on some kind of moddable logic, like physics.  Every year I'm asked by a different person when I'm going to do it, and every year I've had some other project I'm focusing on.  Most core developers don't feel they have what it takes to even try doing that.\n\nOther massive ideas floating in the air in the Minetest developer community, core developers and contributors alike, is abstracting away and switching the rendering engine to something more modern, probably something made by us to fit the needs of Minetest instead of some generic game graphics engine.\n\n For how long do you see yourself continuing to work as the CEO of the project?\n\n Until I'm dead, probably.  Not because I really want to, but because it's not something anyone else wants to do.\n\nWhat would you choose, going on the beach, pub or golf field to take it easy, or staying in your basement looking through issues and pull requests, thinking when you're going to upgrade the forum software, trying to figure out why something was implemented in some way in the code, writing about some idea you have that hasn't still been implemented in seven years?\n\nSee, I'm absolutely crazy.  Most people aren't.\n\nIt's actually an interesting question: Is there any way I could be replaced?\n\n Is there a way to?\n\n I do think some parts of Minetest have been made as student projects.  Such extra motivation helps getting things done.  Maybe a tech leadership school could take Minetest CEO as a student project position?  Like, do it for a year and get lots of points.  Just an idea I guess.\n\nAlso, I kind of hate the subject.  In that way I'm more of a CTO [Chief Technical Officer] than a CEO.\n\n Do you think Minetest can benefit from programmes such as Google Summer of Code?\n\n Maybe, but it's difficult to compete with other projects there and the person doing it has to already be a contributor with a task in mind.  Otherwise it takes way too much prepping work to get somebody going in anything larger.  Self motivation is key in getting something done in a project like this.\n\nNobody will make you do anything or guide you.  You have to want to do it, and ask for help.  We also don't have any centralized official organization in any country, so we can't really collect funds and pay people to do things.\n\nMoney, official forms, agreements — No thanks.  Throw it in the trash.  Our agreement is the LGPL license of the code and  of other assets — it's the bare minimum and works.\n\nEnrolling Minetest into  could be the contribution of someone.  I don't think there's anything stopping that.  It could be quite beneficial to the project.\n\n How can the community ensure that the Minetest project succeeds for the foreseeable future?\n\n Use it, teach other people how to use it, share your in-game and mod creations with other people.  Of course reporting and fixing bugs and contributing engine features helps, but the main reason it exists is because it has users that enjoy playing it.\n\nWhether something is a \"thing\" really only depends on whether it's popular.\n\n When did you actually think Minetest was getting significant attention and it was getting popular?'\n\n When I started posting about it on the Irrlicht forums and other places on the 'net, it immediately became obvious there was interest for such a thing.  I mean, compared to Minecraft, it has always been tiny.  But it was something completely different to anything else I had published until then in terms of public interest.  It wasn't just one person saying they checked it out.  It easily created a thread with people arguing whether it was even legal to make one like it.\n\n The legal aspect is something even I wondered about.  But you haven't received any legal notices, right?\n\n Well, it might have not been obvious then that it is legal, but nowadays there are so many Minecraft-like games everywhere people don't even think about it any more.  Nothing at all, ever.\n\nAnd why would I [get a legal notice?] — it's completely made from scratch and I've never seen any Minecraft source code.  That wouldn't be the reason I'd change the name.  But changing the name isn't really doable.  You could of course publish it in addition under a second name and leave the engine called Minetest.  But what's the point?\n\nMinetest is such a bad name it works as a trademark in itself.  Nobody wants to copy it.  It doesn't sell, but we don't need to sell.  If it was a serious commercial endeavour I would never had named it that in the first place.  [A trademark lawsuit would] only make Minetest grossly more popular, and we could simply change the name.  Really nothing is stopping us, if we need to, but there's not really any need.\n\n What are some of your other hobbies?\n\n In addition to programming I also do electronics as a hobby.  I'm very interested in electric vehicle [EV] conversions and have done some reverse engineering for re-using parts from crashed EVs.  Some of that has been released as open source.  Well, in addition to having them as hobbies, I also work in programming and electronics.  But anyway — whether money is involved or not, that's what I do.\n\nI've also tried to do some other game development.  That was more of a learning experience than something that would have resulted in an end product.\n\n What sport activities do you normally undertake to stay strong and healthy? How has the pandemic affected them?\n\n I'm not a very sporty person.  If I feel so, I'll go for a walk or ride to town and back with my bicycle.  I do try to eat quite healthy though.  The pandemic hasn't had much effect on my life overall.  I've just shifted from less remote work to more remote work.\n\n What are some of the important things your have learned as an open-source game developer?\n\n Well, most game ideas suck, and the programming doesn't really matter.  Game development isn't something I'd recommend for anyone, it's such a saturated field.\n\n Saturated field?\n\n I mean, too many people are making games already.  It's such a popular hobby.\n\n Well those were all the questions I had for you.\n\n (That was quite a lot of questions, I think that'd make a small book so far. :-))\n\n Anything you would like to add?\n\n I don't think so.\n\n Thank you so much, being so generous with your time, celeron55.  It was wonderful discussing about Minetest with you!\n\n No problem, it's not too often I answer so much things about my longest ever project.", "question": "What programming language is used for the modding API in Minetest?  \n\nA) Python  \nB) C++  \nC) Lua  \nD) Java"}
{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, August 2020", "content": "The following is the fourth edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: a bat attacks the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee, the American Independent Party picks a ticket amid controversy, and  resurface to question the eligibility of the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.\n\nAs the campaign shifted to August, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the  head-to-head polling average, 49.4 percent to 42.0 percent.\n\nAfter President Trump suggested in a late July tweet that  could result in fraud, early August debate centered around the postal service.  , a Republican fundraiser Trump appointed to the post two months prior, instituted new policies at  that resulted in a slowed service.  Critics accused Trump of an intentional delay.  DeJoy maintained the USPS could handle the increased demand for mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Democrats in Congress pushed for extra funding to avoid potential voter disenfranchisement.  Trump endorsed blocking emergency relief as a means to prevent a proliferation of mail-in ballots.  Biden criticized Trump for this stance, arguing the President did not want the election to take place.  Trump repeated his claim mail-in voting would be fraudulent.  In addition, he initiated several lawsuits challenging certain states' mail-in voting procedures, particularly a Nevada law mandating ballots be mailed to all registered voters.\n\nBiden named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate.  Harris previously sought the Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew before the primaries.  This fulfilled Biden's earlier pledge to pick a woman as his running mate.  Trump questioned the selection.  He said the \"phony\" and \"nasty\" Harris attacked Biden during Democratic debates and blasted her behavior during the  Supreme Court . He also said Harris' poll numbers dropped precipitously before her withdrawal. Other critics outside the Democratic party raised questions about Harris' eligibility, which Trump also briefly entertained.  Commentators compared this response to the debunked  that questioned the citizenship of President Barack Obama.  One entity whose members challenged Obama's citizenship  and now do likewise with Harris, the American Independent Party, nominated a ticket of  presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper  for vice president.  The party, which has ballot access in California, reportedly did not contact West about the nomination. West, a presidential candidate himself, with the Birthday Party, spent much of August seeking ballot access in various states. According to , West claimed to be in communication with Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser  \"almost daily.\" In mid-August, Kushner, on behalf of the White House, helped broker a deal establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nJust ahead of the , Donald Trump's younger brother  died of an unspecified illness. Biden and Harris each sent their condolences to Trump.  Observers questioned whether coronavirus was the cause of death. The hashtag #WrongTrump went viral on Twitter shortly after, suggesting users wished for the President's death. The Democratic convention took place in a largely virtual format due to the coronavirus pandemic.  It featured speeches that were, for the most part, previously recorded.  Party business took place in , Wisconsin.  Speakers hammered Trump for his response to coronavirus.   Biden was officially nominated with some delegates pledged to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, unlike the other withdrawn Democratic candidates, did not release his delegates to Biden in order to help shape the party platform.  At 77, Biden became the oldest person ever nominated for president by either major party. Speakers throughout the four day convention included three former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama; former Ohio  John Kasich, among other Republicans; and two brothers of , whose death in police custody in May led to widespread protests.  Former  Michelle Obama gave the keynote address on the opening night, urging viewers, \"we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.\" After her speech, the  slur \"Big Mike\" trended on Twitter.  Harris, in her address, accepted the vice presidential nomination, becoming the first  and first  to fill the role.  On the last day, Biden delivered his acceptance speech at  in , Delaware.  Broadcast of the speech appeared on a screen at a drive-in viewing nearby at .   Trump described the convention as a \"-produced .\"  He defended his record on the pandemic, and criticized Democrats for failing to mention Biden's opposition to Trump's  from China and Europe to slow the spread of coronavirus. In a later speech, Trump assailed the event as the \"darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history.\"\nOpinion polls did not show any meaningful convention bump for Biden.\n\nBefore the start of the , the police shooting of  in , Wisconsin led to protests and unrest.  Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed.  Wisconsin   declared a state of emergency and deployed the . Unrest continued in Portland, Oregon as well, where a Trump supporter was shot and killed. \"\" was a common theme at the convention.  Most speeches were given from Washington D.C., though the party handled its internal business, such as the unanimous renomination of Trump, in , North Carolina.  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both gave speeches in Charlotte on the first day of the convention. Other speakers during the four day event included four of Trump's children; First Lady Melania Trump; , who drew weapons on allegedly trespassing protesters at their St. Louis residence; and , a former high school student who received a settlement from CNN over the depiction of him during a 2019 anti-abortion march. From Israel,  Mike Pompeo spoke, defending Trump's  foreign policy.  It was unusual for a sitting Secretary of State to speak to a political convention.  Democrats in Congress vowed to investigate whether Pompeo used State Department resources to engage in partisan activities. Vice President Pence gave a speech before a crowd of about 100 people in Baltimore, Maryland.  On the last night, Trump delivered a long acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House with 1,500 spectators and a large fireworks show afterwards.  During the speech Trump claimed, \"Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it is a surrender to the virus.\"  Political commentators such as  and  described the speech as \"flat\" and lacking energy.  Trump's decision to allow part of the convention to take place at the White House raised ethics questions as well. A Black Lives Matter group protested outside the White House on the last day of the convention.  A group of protesters surrounded and allegedly threatened Senator  and his wife  as they exited the event.  In reaction to the convention,  Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of ignoring \"truth, evidence, data and facts\" and said she would prefer Biden not participate in the presidential debates with Trump.  Biden rejected Pelosi's suggestion, saying he would act as a \"fact checker on the floor\" during the debate.\n\nUnlike Biden, Trump seemingly received a slight bump from his convention. At the end of August, he erased some of Biden's lead in the nationwide RealClearPolitics head to head average, trailing 49.6 percent to 43.3 percent.\n\nFor  Libertarian Party presidential nominee , the August campaign began on a hairy note.  According to the campaign, on the morning of August 1 around 4:30 or 5:30 a.m. EST, a flying creature collided with Jorgensen on the front porch of her South Carolina home.  That creature, a , apparently approached Jorgensen's neck and struck her on the chin. Wikinews contacted campaign manager  and deputy campaign manager Jess Mears about the incident.  \n\n\"Jess Mears and I witnessed [the bat attack],\" said Dasbach to Wikinews. \"I was driving them to the airport to catch a flight to Pittsburg[h].\"\n\nMears would not confirm Dasbach's account.  Instead, she pointed to a video of Jorgensen on Facebook, which corroborated most of Dasbach's telling.  Neither Dasbach nor Mears would provide Wikinews with an image of the wound.\n\nOn the campaign trail in Pittsburgh, Jorgensen stopped at a local medical facility. Jorgensen received five precautionary shots for  since the bat broke her skin.  Bats can carry the rabies virus, which is transmittable to humans and could result in death.  According to the , treatment for any potential exposure requires a series of shots over a 14 day period. In her Facebook video, Jorgensen confirmed this course of treatment. \n\n\"I'm taking the instructions very seriously\", said Jorgensen.  \"The instructions basically say if you miss any shots, if you don't take them on time, you die.  They didn't say it quite like that.  They said if you don't take the remaining shots on time then the shots you've taken will do you no good.  So that's kind of scary. [...] It is a bit disconcerting to have an encounter with a bat.\"\n\nNews of the incident was not reported until after August 7 when Jorgensen tweeted about missing campaign events in Mississippi to get shots as part of her treatment.  Following the tweet, , , , Time Magazine,  , ,  and , among others, published stories on the incident.  A day after the news broke, the hashtag #LetHerSpeak, referring to Jorgensen's bid to be included in the Presidential Debates, trended on Twitter. \n\nAt the time of the news reports, Jorgensen polled at three percent nationwide in the / poll.  She polled at two percent in the .  This falls short of the 15 percent threshold for participation in the official debates put on by the .\n\nThe American Independent Party (AIP), the same party that nominated the late Alabama   for president in  and future president Donald Trump in 2016, nominated a candidate with center left views for its 2020 presidential ticket.  At its August 15 convention with around 20 virtual attendees, the party nominated Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper  for vice president. The AIP, which has ballot access in California, the most populous US state, made the nomination amid three points of controversy:  De La Fuente's usual running mate, Darcy Richardson, was left off the ticket in favor of West; questions surround whether the AIP nominated the ticket to assist President Trump's re-election; and before the nomination, De La Fuente made several monetary transfers to the AIP vice chairman.\n\nDe La Fuente, a businessman who first ran for president in the 2016 Democratic primaries and was the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nominee, ran for president again this year; first as a challenger to President Trump in the Republican primaries, and then as the presidential nominee of the Alliance, Reform, and  parties.  For each of these parties, Richardson is De La Fuente's running mate.  The De La Fuente/Richardson ticket has ballot access in a total of 15 states.  But for California, with the AIP, West stands in Richardson's usual place.  Richardson had his own opinion on the matter.  He provided Wikinews with the text of a message he sent to AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg:\n\"Please let Rocky [De La  Fuente] know that if he runs with the unstable, bi-polar Trump-loving Kanye West in California that I will withdraw as his vice-presidential running mate nationally.\nI've spent my entire adult life battling the duopoly and certainly DO NOT want my name associated with a candidacy that peripherally includes a Trump/GOP plant like the unhinged rapper .... [AIP co-founder]  must be rolling over in his grave.\"\n\nRichardson has since reconciled with De La Fuente and remains \"fully committed\" to the campaign despite its new association with West.  \n\nWest, who is running for president in multiple states, may not even be aware of the AIP nomination.   He has, previusly, not denied allegations his candidacy is meant to assist President Trump but also not admitted it outright.  The AIP is less discreet about its intentions. In comments at Ballot Access News, AIP chairman Markham Robinson, whose Twitter bio includes the hashtags #MAGA and #TRUMP2020, writes:\n\"It’s a long shot I’ll grant you, but our ticket may draw enough votes that would otherwise go to Biden-Harris to give Trump-Pence a plurality. \nThink about it for a second, who would votes for our ticket? Well, there will be those [who] vote for it based on their love and/or admiration for Rocky or Ye (Kanye West). There may well be  from the ranks of Republicans who will not vote for Trump, but are galled by [the] thought of voting for loathsome Progressives/Socialists like Biden-Harris. And there will be those who will vote for Rocky because of his  name and roots. In fact our ticket may turn out to be the most popular protest vote receptacle ever.\" \n\nAccording to FEC records, De La Fuente's Rocky 101 LLC  gave Seidenberg a total of US$10,000 over a series of five payments between December 2019 and April 2020.  The reports use the description \"research services\" or leave the label blank. Seidenberg defended the payments in comments on  and denied any allegation of quid pro quo:\n\"[T]he advance[s] received from Rocky [were] to cover hotels and travel expenses around California to run for House and/or Senate races. None [of the money] went to work on [the] race for President. [I] spent three days alone in March 2020 at  Library looking up Texas Election Law.  Most of the time was [spent] at the offices of the  and Registrar of Voters in Kings, Kern, Fresno, and Tulare Count[ies] on Rocky['s] run for House of Representatives.\" \n\nWhen asked to clarify his association with Seidenberg and whether the payments influenced the AIP decision, De La Fuente gave a terse \"no.\"  Robinson and Seidenberg were each contacted for this story as well but have not responded to inquiries as of this publication.\n\nProminent members of the aforementioned AIP, among others, question the citizenship and eligibility of Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Her selection as Joe Biden's running mate and ultimate nomination at the Democratic National Convention further highlighted these questions.  Political commentators see similarities to the  and eligibility of President Barack Obama from those termed Birthers. Nearly all legal experts consider the perspective of Birthers as incorrect, arguing there is no question about Harris' eligibility.  Still, the vocal minority persists. \"Birther King\" Andy Martin, a lesser-known 2012 and 2016 presidential candidate, Wikinews interviewee, and former adjunct law professor, provided his own input on the Harris question.\n\nAt Ballot Access News, AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg commented:\n\"[Kamala Harris is] Constitutionally ineligible to serve as VPOTUS (Vice President of the United States). At [her] birth her parents were from foreign\ncountries and not US citizens, viz., she is not a natural born citizen. Then she [grew] up in her formative years in Canada and graduated from a high school in Canada.\" \n\nHarris was born October 20, 1964 in , California to an Indian-born mother, the late , and a Jamaican-born father, .  The two parents were married before Harris' birth but divorced in 1971. Neither were U.S. citizens at the time of Harris' birth. Harris moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada with her mother and sister, , at the age of 12.  She graduated from Quebec's  in 1981 before returning to the United States to attend college.\n\nThe  makes the qualifications of vice president the same as the qualifications of president.  , Section 1 sets the citizenship qualification for president:\n\"No Person except a , or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President\".\n\nMartin argues that since the term \"natural born Citizen\" is not defined in the document, the meaning of the term at the time of its writing should prevail.\n\n\"Under commonly understood legal theory in 1789,\" writes Martin, \"a natural born citizen had both parents born in the United States. Being born yourself in the US made you a 'citizen.' But you were 'natural born,' and therefore eligible to serve as president, only if both of your parents had also been born in the US.\"\n\nMartin says the founders constructed this \"significant barrier\" to \"prevent foreigners from coming to the US and procreating a baby who would then be eligible for the presidency.\"  He claims the founders were concerned \"a German Prince would come to America and father a child to establish Germanic hegemony of the new nation.\"\n\nThe  states: \"all persons born [...] in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.\"  Martin does not consider such  to have any effect on what constitutes natural born citizenship, seeing the two as distinct concepts.\n\nDiffering slightly in a Newsweek essay, Professor  of  writes that the term \"subject to\" in the 14th Amendment requires parents to be citizens subject to \"complete jurisdiction\" rather than mere \"partial jurisdiction\" as noncitizens.\n\nAIP chairman Markham Robinson reflects this view in Ballot Access News comments:\n\"It is the AIP position that while foreign tourists (or illegal immigrants) are IN US jurisdiction, they are not UNDER it, so the children born in the US of such parents do not in fact enjoy 'birthright citizenship.'\" \n\nEastman does not make a judgment on Harris, arguing that she needs to answer questions on the status of her parents at the time of her birth.  He holds that if they were \"lawful permanent residents\" at Harris' birth then she meets the requirement.  If they were only \"temporary visitors\" on student visas, she does not meet the requirement. \n\nFor Martin, it does not make much of a difference.  While he believes Harris does not qualify as a natural born citizen under the 1789 view, he says court decisions made to challenge Obama's status have left the natural born citizen clause unenforceable.\n\n\"Harris can probably rest easy that despite the renewed debate\", Martin opines, \"she will not be blocked from taking the oath of office if she and Biden win.\"\n\nThe majority of legal experts reject the views Seidenberg, Martin, Robinson and Eastman espouse. \n\nProfessor  of  writes in a Newsweek essay that the term \"natural born citizen\" derived from the British \"natural born subjects\" which included all people born within the borders of the British empire.   Moreover, he says the 14th Amendment phrase \"subject to\" referred primarily to children born to  tribes.  He concludes Harris meets the natural born citizen requirement. \n\nOthers dismissed the claims outright. , Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law called it \"a truly silly argument.\" Professor  of  asked whether Oakland was part of the US and then declared \"that's the full legal analysis.\"", "question": "What was the primary reason Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election?\n\nA) Harris's prior performance in presidential debates  \nB) Biden's pledge to select a woman as his running mate  \nC) Harris's views on mail-in voting  \nD) The support of the American Independent Party"}

{"title": "On the campaign trail in the USA, September 2020", "content": "The following is the fifth edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee secures ballot access in all 50 U.S. states, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee proposes a novel solution to the issue of \"packing\" the U.S. Supreme Court, and three candidates give their thoughts on the latest military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nAs the campaign entered September, Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the  head-to-head polling average, 49.0 percent to 43.0 percent.\n\nPresident Trump started the month visiting , Wisconsin, where riots had broken out due to the police  in August.  Trump referred to the riots as acts of \"domestic terror\" and placed further emphasis on maintaining \".\" His opponent, Biden, in a message to fundraisers, accused Trump of \"trying to scare the hell out of America.\"  Biden himself visited Kenosha two days after Trump in what was his first campaign trip to the swing state of Wisconsin.  During the appearance, Biden delivered a speech on racial inequality while wearing a mask, discussing the \"original sin\" of .  He also visited the family of Jacob Blake and spoke to Blake on the phone.  The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing  and for making the trip despite claiming previously that it was not safe to do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin  , a Democrat, said he would have preferred that neither Trump nor Biden had made the stop. At least three unfavorable claims about Trump surfaced in early September.  First, after CNN reporter and former Bill Clinton   questioned whether the President's impromptu visit to  last November was the result of a stroke, Trump alleged the media was falsely claiming he had suffered from \"mini-strokes.\"  Thereafter,  posted a report from  about Trump's \"mini-strokes\" tweet as the top story on the . Trump attacked Drudge as a  and his campaign called for CNN to fire Lockhart.  Next,  claimed that during a 2018 trip to France, Trump refused to visit a cemetery of U.S. soldiers killed during the World War I  and referred to the soldiers buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"  Furthermore, Trump allegedly questioned whether the U.S. allied with the correct side during the war.  Aides publicly denied the story as did Trump-critic and former  John Bolton.  Nevertheless, others, including Fox News reporter , confirmed key parts of the story.  Trump called on Fox News to fire Griffin. Lastly, excerpts from 's book , for which Trump gave insider access, revealed Trump downplayed the coronavirus in February in order to avoid public panic.  Trump confirmed the claim, arguing it was not in the national interest to stir up panic about the virus.   Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, called Trump's action \"a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\"  He described it as \"beyond despicable\" and \"almost criminal.\" \nTrump stirred controversy for himself both during an interview with a local , North Carolina outlet and again at a rally in Pennsylvania.  He suggested supporters fill out absentee ballots, and then visit their polling places and vote in-person if records indicated they had not voted. After Trump tweeted the same advice, Twitter placed a warning over the tweet. People in the Trump administration and campaign said his comments were misconstrued and that he did not support voting twice. According to the , voting twice is a felony.\n\nIn mid-September, Trump held his first indoor rally in three months, in Nevada, flouting local coronavirus mandates.  Afterwards Trump visited California to discuss the  havoc in the state.  In a public briefing that included California  Gavin Newsom, Trump denied the effect of climate change on the intensity of the fires, arguing they were largely the product of forest mismanagement.  The climate change issue reappeared on the campaign trail.  Biden delivered a speech in Delaware in which he called Trump a \"climate arsonist,\" citing the recent California wildfires, flooding and .  He argued that if Trump wins re-election, \"these hellish events will continue to become more common.\" In Florida, where hurricanes have a disproportionate impact, polls revealed Trump strengthening with ; perhaps due,  president Domingo Garcia indicated, to Trump's social conservative positions and stances against socialism and protests.  As Kamala Harris visited the state and focused more on the  constituency, Biden campaign officials expressed concern about Latino support.  Biden improved his standing among another large voting bloc in Florida, , who voted heavily for Trump in 2016.  Furthermore, a major boost for Biden in Florida came with the announcement that former New York City  Michael Bloomberg planned to invest US$100 million into the state and offered to pay fines for former inmates to regain their ability to vote. Trump claimed the move was criminal. \n\n \nBuilding on the  brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the previous month, the Trump administration announced additional deals  Israel and Bahrain and between Serbia, Kosovo, and Israel.  Like the UAE, the Muslim majority nations of Bahrain and Kosovo recognized Israel and opened diplomatic relations with the nation. The formerly antagonistic nations of Serbia and Kosovo opened economic ties as well and Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Representatives from the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel held a special signing at the White House with President Trump.  Trump hailed the agreements as the \"dawn of a new Middle East.\"  Meanwhile, the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed  escalated to violence. Back home, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, leaving an opening on the Court.  Democrats claimed the election should decide who picks the next justice, citing the Republicans' refusal to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of  after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016.  Republicans argued this was a different situation than in 2016 because now the party controlling the Senate matches the President's party.  President Trump nominated Federal Judge  for the seat.  Citing concerns Barrett's placement would upset the balance of the Court for conservatives, some Democrats advocated  the Court with liberal justices until it reached a liberal majority.  That would only be possible if Democrats won the presidency and the Senate.  When confronted with the possibility of Democrats winning the election, Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming the possibility of fraud occurring as a result of increased mail-in voting. Trump received criticism for the statement.  Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a sometime Trump critic, said the peaceful transfer of power is what separates the U.S. from nations like Belarus, and described Trump's potential unwillingness as \"unthinkable and unacceptable.\" The Biden campaign recycled a statement it first put out in July:  \"The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\" Trump received further criticism just ahead of the first presidential debate,  when The New York Times published allegations about his tax returns.  The reports indicated Trump paid US$750 in taxes in 2016 and the same amount in 2017, and that he owed on loans in excess of US$300 million due in four years.  Trump labeled the report as \"\" and said he would release his tax returns once he was no longer under audit.  Biden left the campaign trail a few days before the debate to prepare both virtually and in-person at his Delaware house. According to CNN, a source told them Trump prepared for a total of two hours, enlisting help from former New Jersey  Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  He continued to hold campaign rallies and White House events.\n\nThe first presidential debate between Trump and Biden took place on the penultimate day of September in Ohio. During the debate, the candidates often interrupted each other.  Although Biden was the first to do so, Trump interrupted far more often.  Moderator  was criticized for his inability to maintain control. During the debate, Biden would not say whether or not he supported Court packing.  Once, when Trump interjected, Biden said \"Will you Shut up, man?\"  During the course of the debate, Biden called Trump a clown, a racist, and the worst president.  Trump insulted Biden as unintelligent. After Biden attacked Trump for the alleged \"losers\" and \"suckers\" comment reported in The Atlantic, Trump brought up Biden's son  and his dealings in Ukraine and China.  Biden defended his son's struggle with drugs. Biden attacked Trump for the over 200,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus. Trump countered that Biden would have lost even more if he were president due to his opposition to the  from China. Trump claimed Democrats pushed Biden to the far left on , the  and defunding the Police. Biden referred to himself as the Democratic Party and said he did not support the policies Trump mentioned. Trump argued Biden had just lost the far left by saying he didn't support those things.  He challenged Biden to name any law enforcement individuals or groups who endorsed Biden's campaign, which Biden did not do. Trump made a confusing statement about the far right organization , when asked to condemn them, stating \"stand back and stand by\" but argued the far left Antifa organization needed to be addressed.  Biden called Antifa an \"idea.\"  Trump continued his claims about postal voting causing fraud and again would not commit to accepting the results of the election. After the debate, CNN anchor  described the event as a \"shitshow.\" Republican Senator  had the same response. Fox News commentator  called it \"a mess.\"  Biden called Trump a \"national embarrassment\" for his performance, while the communications director for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, declared victory for Trump.  According to the , moderators would have \"additional tools\" to maintain order in future debates.\n\nAs September came to a close, Biden maintained his lead over President Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 43.1 percent.\n\nLibertarian Party presidential candidate  passed a milestone in September, becoming the only third party candidate in this election to secure ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia.  The party had the same access in 2016, but in that cycle there was no coronavirus pandemic hampering petitioning efforts.  Before 2016, the last time the Libertarian Party had ballot access in all jurisdictions was  when Jorgensen was on the ballot as the running mate of the late .  The Browne-Jorgensen ticket, as well as the Reform Party ticket of the late  that same year, was the last time before 2016 that any third party or independent candidate achieved full ballot access.\n\nIn a celebratory email to supporters, Jorgensen exclaimed: \"It's official — my campaign is on ballot in ALL 50 states!  I want to thank all the volunteers and staff who made this possible. It was a lot of work! We're talking about hours upon hours of collecting petitions.\"\n\nWith the access secured, Jorgensen aimed to gain entry to the presidential debates sponsored by the .  The Commission's  criterion for inclusion remains a showing of 15 percent support in opinion polls.  In late September polls, when included, Jorgensen was in third place.  She drew two percent in the September 25–27  poll, two percent in the September 26–27 Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey, and five percent in the September 25–27  Analytics poll.\n\n\"We are the real choice for American voters in November,\" Jorgensen argued, \"yet the corrupt Commission on Presidential Debates refuses to have me. Our campaign is the only viable option to both Trump or Biden.\"\n\nIn 2016, despite full ballot access and a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, then-Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson was denied access to the debates.  Nevertheless, he received 3.27 percent of the vote on Election Day, the most a Libertarian Party presidential nominee has ever received.\n\nIn mid-September, staunch  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died after a long battle with cancer.  President Trump nominated   as her replacement.  With a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, Barrett's confirmation was likely, resulting a 6–3 majority for conservatives in the Court.  In response, some Democrats, such as former 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of , Indiana, proposed major changes to the Court, similar to what President  proposed in the 1930s.  While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did not say in the debate whether he supports significant changes, one third party presidential nominee proposed to Wikinews a novel approach, aiming both to prevent future Court packing and promote ideological balance.\n\nAfter his  programs suffered a series of defeats in the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt looked to add justices that would interpret the Constitution to uphold his agenda.  Capitalizing on the public perception of the Court as being too old, Roosevelt sought to tie the number of justices to age. In 1937, he proposed a  to amend the , which sets the number of Supreme Court justices at nine.\nRoosevelt's bill would allow the President to nominate one additional justice for every justice over the age of 70 years and six months with at least ten years of experience on the bench.  The proposal capped the number of justices to be nominated this way at six.  The plan did not receive much support, even from his own Democratic Party.  The Senate voted 70 to 20 to send the bill back to committee, where it died.\n\nNow, 83 years later, some Democrats have revisited a plan to expand the number of justices that Buttigieg proposed during his campaign.  He suggested expanding the Court to 15 justices: five Republicans, five Democrats, and five to be chosen by the other justices. Other Democratic plans include a straight-up expansion of the number of justices and a plan to institute term limits for justices.  According to a 2019  poll, 57 percent of the U.S. public opposes expanding the number of justices. However, 72 percent support term limits.\n\nBill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, whose running mate Eric Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews in August, provided Wikinews with his own plan for the Court.  While it would expand the number of justices, it aims to prevent future Court packing:\n\n\"The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a  to prevent future Court Packing,\" says Hammons, \"and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.\"\n\nThe U.S. Constitution provides two ways to propose a Constitutional Amendment as Hammons proposes: (1) a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and House of Representatives, or (2) an affirmative vote in the state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a constitutional convention.  The latter route has not yet been used. If an amendment is successfully proposed, three-quarters of states must then ratify it in order for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.  The last successful amendment occurred in 1992.\n\nWhile both the Hammons plan and the Buttigieg plan aim for balance, Hammons's approach differs from Buttigieg's in that future Court packing, like that proposed from President Roosevelt, would not be possible absent further amendment to the Constitution.  Furthermore, there is no partisan classification of justices provided and party identification does not serve as the basis for judicial ideology. Curiously, the number of justices Hammons favors matches the current number of ; the courts from which the Supreme Court hears appeals.\n\nA longstanding conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted into violence late in September.  The  between the two  centers on the  region.  It lies within the internationally-recognized borders of Azerbaijan but the Armenian-backed separatist  currently occupies it. After inquiry from Wikinews, U.S. presidential candidates  of the Prohibition Party, Don Blankenship of the Constitution Party, and Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, weighed in on the issue.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan fought a  over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994.   Russia brokered a cease-fire agreement but skirmishes continued to break out.  The latest violence began with conflicting claims from both sides. The Armenians claim they were retaliating against missile attacks from Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis state they were responding to Armenian aggression.  The president of Turkey vowed support for Azerbaijan, while Russia called for a cessation of fighting.  As of September 30, Armenia claimed 790 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed, with 103 Artsakh deaths. Azerbaijan claimed to have killed about 2,300 Artsakh soldiers.\n\nPresident Trump commented on the matter during a White House Press Briefing, \"[W]e're looking at it very strongly. [...] We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.\"  Although Trump's State Department asked for any \"external party\" not to involve themselves in the conflict, his main presidential rival Joe Biden called on the President to demand directly that Turkey stop interfering on Azerbaijan's behalf.\n\nCollins saw compromise as the best way for the two nations to resolve their differences: \"I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half.\" Nevertheless, Collins did not want the U.S. to involve itself militarily and calls on Washington to remain neutral. His opponents, Jorgensen and Blankenship, shared this view.\n\n\"The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours\", said Jorgensen. \"We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.\"\n\nBlankenship concurred: \"We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs\", he argued. \"We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues. \" \n\nThere is precedent for the U.S. President mediating international disputes. In 1905, President  mediated a peace agreement between Japan and Russia, fostering the  that ended the .  Roosevelt's efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.  President Jimmy Carter mediated an end to the conflict between Israel and Egypt at the  in 1978 that brought about the 1979  and the normalization of relations between the two nations.

{"title": "Wikinews interviews Jo Jorgensen, U.S. Libertarian Party presidential nominee", "content": "Professor  of South Carolina, the U.S. Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nominee, answered some questions about her campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.\n\nJorgensen is a psychology professor at .   In 1992, with the Libertarian Party's backing, she ran for public office, seeking  in the United States House of Representatives.  She finished the race in third place with almost 2.16 percent of the total vote. Four years later, the Libertarian Party tapped Jorgensen to be its vice presidential nominee.  She joined a ticket with the late .  Browne-Jorgensen appeared on every state ballot and received a total of 485,798 votes, which was roughly 0.5 percent. This marked the best performance for the party since  and would not be topped percentage-wise until 2012 when former New Mexico  Gary Johnson attained 0.99 percent of the vote.  Johnson bested that performance in 2016 as the party's presidential nominee for a second time, earning 3.27 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for the party  since its 1971 inception.\n\nFor the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen navigated through a primary campaign that featured the short-lived campaigns of former Rhode Island   and Congressman  of Michigan, the first sitting Congressman to be a member of the Libertarian Party.  At the virtual , Jorgensen won the nomination on the fourth ballot, edging attorney , performance artist Vermin Supreme and activist , among others.  Podcaster , originally the running mate of Supreme, was picked to be the party's vice presidential nominee.  Cohen spoke to Wikinews back in June.  The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket has since secured ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nAs a libertarian, an ideology that advocates for lesser government, both in the social and economic realms, Jorgensen's issue positions include a mix of traditionally liberal and conservative stances.  She supports both LGBT rights and gun rights.  She opposes the police state and the taxing authority equally.  And, she supports an open immigration policy while arguing against the welfare state. \n\nWith Wikinews, Jorgensen discusses her background, COVID-19, her potential cabinet, gridlock, and an assortment of issues including climate change, foreign affairs, free speech, and race relations. \n\n: Which past  do you most admire and why? \n\n Jo Jorgensen: . Hey, he wrote the . I would, however, change the phrase, \"that ,\" to \"that all people are created equal\"!\n\n: How have your past experiences prepared you for the job of President?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: The most important preparation for the job of president is to learn that businesses and families and people everywhere are better off when they are free to run their own lives without government interference. My grandmother, who immigrated from Denmark, instilled in me a love of freedom when I was a child. Ever since, life has taught me, over and over, that government must be strictly bound to protecting our life, liberty and property - and nothing more.\n\n: How would you describe your style of leadership?  How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?   \n\n Jo Jorgensen: My leadership style is rooted in the principle, \".\" I will assemble a cabinet and staff that, with me, will scrutinize any proposal for use of government force for any purpose.  That's the polar opposite of both President Trump, former President Obama, and his former Vice President [Joe] Biden.\n\n: If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: I would have made sure the bureaucrats at the CDC [(Centers for Disease Control)] and the FDA [(Food and Drug Administration)] did not block access to tests and treatments developed by the free market. Once it became clear that the primary danger is to people with , I would have used my  to strongly advise that those people use masks, socially distance, and self-quarantine as needed to avoid contagion. I would have ended any emergency economic lockdowns and trusted people to take care of themselves and go back to work and school in a safe manner.\n\n: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: It has limited our in-person events to being mostly outside and socially distanced. That has obviously decreased the number of people able to participate in rallies and the ability of volunteers to execute a traditional ground game. On the positive side, it has tied people closer to their cell phones and computers and, we hope, increased our ability to reach people through social media.\n\n: In 2016, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson, the former Governor of New Mexico, received about 3.28 percent of the popular vote, a record for the party.  Based on your polling and general feeling on the ground, what percentage of the popular vote do you expect to receive in the 2020 election?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: As a  popular former governor with another former governor as a running mate, who was also very popular with the media, our 2016 Libertarian ticket received unprecedented media coverage. As a result, they were polling double digits shortly after they were nominated. Those polling numbers declined as election day drew near. I started out with virtually no name recognition outside the Libertarian Party. Coming out of our (virtual, thanks to COVID) nominating convention, I was polling at one percent according to . That number has gone up and ranges from two to five percent in national polls. In addition, we are polling high enough in battleground states like Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and now Alaska to cover the spread between Biden and Trump. \n\nWe have already won in the sense that Republicans and Democrats now pay lip service to libertarian ideas (lower taxes, bringing our troops home, ending the , etc.) to win votes. This shows that our ideas are becoming more and more popular. Unfortunately, the Ds and Rs betray those libertarian ideals - and those voters.  We'll keep fighting until we make government much smaller than it is today - whether or not I, and other Libertarians, are elected. That is the ultimate victory.\n\n: During the 2016 campaign, Gary Johnson responded to a reporter's question about the Syrian city of Aleppo with \"What is Aleppo?\"  This seems to be one thing people most remember about Johnson.  If there's one thing the public will remember about you and your campaign, what do you want it to be?  What do you expect it to be?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: I expect that it will be one of two things: That I am the only 2020 candidate who has credibly campaigned to bring the troops home and make America like one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral. \n\nOr that, when I hear politicians call for , I hear \".\" If there's one thing I want people to remember, it's this: We haven't had a free market in health care in over 100 years. As president, I will work tirelessly to remove government barriers to free market healthcare, so that it's a fraction of today's cost, much higher quality, and easily accessible to everyone.\n\n: What would a Jorgensen administration look like?  Which specific individuals would you ask to be in your cabinet?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: A Jorgensen administration would call on talented, seasoned public policy analysts from institutions like the , , and others who are committed to the goal of a much smaller government to staff the cabinet and administrative agencies. We would also draw on the libertarians now holding office as Democrats and Republicans and those who show strength in particular areas of government.\n\n: There is currently only one Libertarian in Congress, .  He is not seeking re-election.  If you win the election, the government will remain divided.  How will you work with Congress to avoid gridlock and pass your agenda? \n\n Jo Jorgensen: My biggest tool will be my  pen. I will refuse to sign any budget that is not in balance. I will require all Department heads to propose budgets that are smaller than the previous year. Some issues like cannabis decriminalization and criminal law reform already have enough bipartisan support that they will get passed with a presidential nudge. I will immediately pardon all non-violent federal drug war prisoners as well as whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. As Commander in Chief, I will immediately begin bringing the troops home. \n\n: What should be done, from the government's perspective, to combat global climate change? \n\n Jo Jorgensen: All federal subsidies to the energy industry, especially fossil fuels, should be eliminated. , anti-competitive policies  that prevent the full development of nuclear energy should be ended. Zero-emission nuclear power will fare very well on a level playing field, cutting  and protecting our irreplaceable planet. \n\n: What are your views on the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan?  What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours. We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.\n\n: Are you concerned about the  and  censorship of notable conservatives and libertarians?  How would you address this issue as president?\n\n Jo Jorgensen: The kind of censorship I worry about is government censorship. That's what repeal of  would ultimately lead to. One of the reasons prominent social media platforms have been censoring users  is fear of government regulation if they don't censor on their own. I would foster an environment where censoring platforms' biggest fear would be users departing to competing platforms that do not censor.\n\n: What can you do, as president, to improve  in the United States? \n\n Jo Jorgensen: The two most effective ways to improve race relations are criminal justice reform and ending restrictive, protectionist licensing laws. \n\n laws like drug and vice laws put minorities in prison at a higher rate than non-minorities even though the actual crime rate in both populations is similar. Ending qualified immunity, no-knock raids, federal \"gifts\" of tanks and other weapons of war to local police departments, civil asset forfeiture and other oppressive police tactics will go a long way in restoring respect between people of color and government. Americans should not feel like enemy combatants in their own neighborhoods\n\nIn the long run, the best way to improve race relations is to provide equal economic opportunity to all. Ending overly restrictive licensing (which prevents people from learning trades, opening businesses, or growing their wealth) would extend American prosperity and opportunity to all, not just those whom the state favors.", "question": "What percentage of the popular vote did Jo Jorgensen's running mate in the 2016 election, Gary Johnson, receive as the Libertarian presidential nominee?  \nA) 0.5%  \nB) 2.16%  \nC) 3.27%  \nD) 0.99%"}

He spent nine years in Colombia teaching children whose  parents were stationed there. Carroll joined the Solidarity Party and ran for Congress in 2018 for .  He finished the  in fifth with 1.3 percent of the vote. Carroll received the Solidarity Party's 2020 presidential nomination in September 2019 over two other contenders: candidate Joshua Perkins and past Wikinews interviewee .  Carroll selected fellow teacher Amar Patel as his running mate.  Patel spoke to Wikinews in August.\n\nThe Solidarity Party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party. It is based on Roman Catholic , advocating for , environmentalism, and \"a \" including opposition to , , and .  The party changed to its current name ahead of the 2016 presidential election, when its first ticket of  for president and Juan Muñoz for vice president appeared on the ballot only in Colorado, receiving reportedly a total of 6,777 votes, largely from  elsewhere.

I patterned my own educational goals in that direction.  As I got older, I could see the underside of Jefferson, and every human being has two sides.  I taught history for 40 years to  and  students, and spent extra time on [George] , Jefferson, [Andrew]  and [James K.]  (as negatives), [Abraham] ,  as positive in domestic affairs and negative in foreign affairs, [Woodrow]  as negative.

How does it compare to the leadership styles of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama?  \n\nBrian Carroll: I'm the unTrump.  I'm secure enough in myself that I don’t feel threatened by experts.  Like Jefferson, I have multiple interests and a softer personality, though I'm more comfortable speaking in public than was Jefferson.  I will hire a very organized staff to help keep me focused.\n\n: If you were president, how would you have handled the coronavirus pandemic differently than President Trump?  \n\nBrian Carroll: I would not have entered office by throwing away the playbook for pandemics that Obama left him.  I would have acted earlier  American industry to produce the equipment we needed.\n\n: How has the pandemic affected your campaign and your ability to reach out to voters?  \n\nBrian Carroll: It has kept me from traveling, and it made it more difficult to collect signatures in states that required that to get on the ballot.

We need to use , , and  where practical, and explore , as well.\n\n: What are your views on the  between Armenia and Azerbaijan? What would you do as president to help resolve the conflict and how does that comport with your overarching philosophy on foreign affairs?\n\nBrian Carroll: Diplomacy but not military intervention.\n\n: Are you concerned about  and the censorship of certain views on ?  How would you address this issue as president? Brian Carroll: Social media is still too young to graduate from high school.  We're learning, and social media is learning, but the teen years are stressful for any person or organization.  They need to be dealt with according to patient persistence.  We'll get there.\n\n: What can you do, as president, to improve ?  Brian Carroll: First, let it be known that we consider it a priority. A document like the recent Contract with Black America has well over a hundred ideas, most of them good.  The idea is that it could be accomplished in the first 100 days, which I think is unrealistic, but there needs to be a visible start from day one.\n\n: Election Day is quickly approaching and early voting has already started in some states.  What is your final plea to voters?   Brian Carroll''': When many voters—or citizens who have given up on voting—are asked what they want, they describe a party that fits our description.  This is their chance.  The major parties are campaigning on panic.  They want to scare voters with visions of life under the other party.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the  holds two presidential debates, three candidates who did not participate in those debates give their final pleas to voters, and three political pundits give their predictions on the outcome of the election.\n\nPolls at the start of the final full month on the campaign trail showed Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the  average, 50.1 to 42.9 percent.\n\n  \nOctober started with a  for the electorate. After it was revealed his aide  tested positive for coronavirus, President Trump himself, his wife Melania, and son Barron all tested positive for the virus. Trump was said to be suffering \"minor symptoms\", and was admitted to  as a precaution.  Video captured Trump wearing a mask while walking to  en route to the hospital. Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from  as well as the anti-viral  and the steroid .  His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine.  After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House.  He tweeted, \"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.\" A couple days after Trump’s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief .  Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected.  In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions.  Politico regarded the debate as \"markedly more civil\" than the prior Trump-Biden debate.  The next day, the  announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate.  In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC.  Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC.\n\nWith the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for  looming, the issue of  returned.  Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing.  Biden said voters \"don't deserve\" to know his position.  A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a  poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony.  Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus.  Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in , Florida.  At the rally, Trump declared himself \"immune\" and offered to kiss members of the crowd.  White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days.\n\nIn another potential \"October surprise,\" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the  published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop.  According to the Post, former Trump adviser  told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former , recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner.  E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged .  Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company , on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired.  The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act.  Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA  John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and , signed a letter saying the Post'‍s report \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"  Current Director of National Intelligence  said the information was \"not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.\" According to The Washington Post, intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the Post story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials.  Twitter CEO  later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform.  Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively.  While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by , on the main network as well as MSNBC and , ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with  for two hours.  The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper  described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the  and defended his pandemic policies.  At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.  On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question.  Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate.  Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead.  At this time, he made critical remarks about  director Dr.  and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released 60 Minutes interview with , that Trump claimed was unfair.  Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the .  In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer  may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop.  Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director  held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election.  Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election.  Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020.  Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a New York Times story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States.  \n\nJust before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them.  He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the , Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by  of NBC News.  Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation.  Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious \"big guy\" who received a cut of money, Trump said, \"You're the big man, I think.\"  Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum.  Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19.  Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as .  He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are \"learning to live\" with the virus.  Biden countered that people are instead \"learning to die\" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan.  He proposed a  and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare.  Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip  and .  He vowed to protect people with  from being denied health coverage. When asked about climate change, Trump claimed carbon emissions have been lower during his administration and argued against re-entering the . Biden argued that green energy can provide good paying jobs. Trump accused Biden of previously saying he wanted to ban . Biden denied, though Trump said it is on tape.  Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website.  Welker brought up the  at the border.  Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid \"millions of dollars\" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on  when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence.  Welker received near-universal praise for her performance.  Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first.\n\nIn the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day  throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others.  Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause.  At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby.  Biden referred to the people as \"chumps.\"  At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as \"ugly folks.\"  Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer.  The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court.  Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on.  The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel.  This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months.  The fatal police , a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: \"[w]e cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.\"  President Trump called it a \"terrible event\" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence.  Category Two  slammed into the Louisiana coast.  Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina.  The anonymous insider who wrote New York Times op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former  chief of staff .  The Trump campaign described Taylor as \"just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him\". The  released a report showing growth in  of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020.  This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950.  Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases.  Biden described the growth as not \"nearly enough.\"\n\nAt the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent.\n\nThe  held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates.  The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states.  The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the .   Libertarian Party presidential nominee , Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper  were each invited but did not attend.  Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate , Green Party presidential nominee , Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship,  presidential nominee , and  presidential nominee .  All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director  moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate.  The debates used the format the  developed when  they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nAt the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the ,  and , national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the , vaccinations, gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of , Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor , SpaceX co-founder , indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner  .  The debate closed with final statements from each candidate.\n\nIn opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as \"pro-life\" and said climate change must be addressed.  Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed  as the root of all the nation's ills.  Blankenship offered US$1 million to  to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the  and the .  \n\nThe candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that  could arise from a hasty withdrawal.  While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world.  Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and \"diluting\" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting.  La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years.  Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of \"rigged polls\" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a \"felon\" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic.  Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to  while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers.  Pierce and Carroll endorsed , though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams.  La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals.  Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts.  Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users.  Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm.  Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's  and turns them into \"genetically modified humans.\"  Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses.  La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights.  On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war.\n\nIn closing, Pierce urged voters to \"vote their conscience.\" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation.  Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy.  Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit.\n\nAt the final debate held October 24 in , Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad  Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist , Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist , Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of ,  of , and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates.\n\nWith Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage.  In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages.  Pierce professed himself \"deeply concerned\" about the future of the US and endorsed using \"life\", \"liberty\", and \"happiness\" as the measure of success.  Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.  He noted that the  is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces.  He found it curious he was called a \"Democratic socialist\" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for .\n\nLike the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates.  La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the  decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of Citizens United.  Hawkins attacked the \"macho culture\" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the  and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a \"horrible\" use of the working class.  She called the  a \"genocidal war.\"  Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea.  He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea.  Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used.  Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction.  Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech.  La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts.  Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the .  Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve.  Carroll argued that trade deals like  have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the  to remove corporations from its protection.  Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the  system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two.  Pierce claimed  was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals.  Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs \"visionary leadership.\"  La Riva argued against  (UBI), proposing  be increased to US$20 an hour.  Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI.  He named his economic view as , which he said was an extreme form of capitalism.  Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs. Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card.  Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local  communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under.  Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination.  Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a \"failed state.\"  He urged voters to vote for what they want.\n\nWikinews provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters.  Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee , Prohibition Party presidential nominee , and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons.\n\nI'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal. \n\nTo dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, \"There is a real party of peace and justice.\" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\n\nTo small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, \"There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility.\" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\n\nMy final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol.  I tell them that we care about other issues.  We support a balanced budget.  We're pro-life and pro-gun rights.\n\n \n\nIt is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era.  The  outlines that the top three finishers in the  receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic.  I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience.\n\nWikinews asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the  tally of the 2020 presidential election.  The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented  as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the |Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com. \n\nIn addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination.  During his run he spoke to Wikinews in an exclusive interview.  Afterwards, Tancredo ran for  in  as the nominee of the Constitution Party, finishing the race in second place.  He later returned to the Republican Party.\n\nTancredo predicts President Trump wins re-election over former Vice President Biden with an electoral count of 362 to 176.\n\nIn 2008, Knapp stood as the first vice presidential nominee of the Boston Tea Party, which disbanded in 2012.  Historian Darcy Richardson picked Knapp as his running mate for his 2016 campaign for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.  Knapp runs the politics blog KN@PPSTER and is the director and senior news analyst of The  Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism.\n\nKnapp predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 319 to 219.\n\nGunzburger, a trial lawyer since 1988, founded the nonpartisan Politics1.com in 1997.  He currently serves as senior advisor to Maryland's Republican  .

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the , the Bread and Roses Party, and the Unity Party of America.\n\nAs the campaign reached July, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the  head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 40.3 percent.\n\nOn July 1, the city of Seattle cleared the autonomous  (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capitol Hill Organized Protest).  Nevertheless, civil unrest including the toppling of statues, still stemming from the police killing of  in May, continued elsewhere in the US. President Trump sent  officers to protect federal buildings in Portland.  Biden criticized the move, arguing Trump was \"sow[ing] chaos and division\" and \"mak[ing] matters worse.\"  The Trump campaign accused Biden of \"siding with criminals.\" Trump maintained the campaign theme of .  While the nation continued to suffer through the coronavirus pandemic, the President traveled to South Dakota, which, unlike most states, had not enacted a , to take part in a celebration at  on the eve of .  He delivered a speech in which he condemned rioters who desecrate statues and memorials throughout the nation.  In addition, he announced the creation of a special park with statues to honor historic US figures.  Most attendees at the event did not practice  or wear .   The next day, Trump held a Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" in Washington, D.C. in which he delivered another speech. Joe Biden forewent traditional holiday activities as an added precaution against COVID-19.  That same day, rapper  made a surprise announcement on Twitter that he, himself, was running for president.  In an interview with , West outlined his campaign.  He named Wyoming preacher  as his running mate and introduced the Birthday Party as the vehicle for his run. His platform included . West backed away from his previous support for President Trump, expressing disappointment at reports Trump hid in the White House basement during riots.  He leveled greater criticism at Biden, saying he was not \"special\" like himself, Trump, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The interviewer questioned whether West was running to help President Trump defeat Biden. West did not deny the suggestion.  After the interview, a spokesman for West claimed West decided to drop out of the race.  However, subsequently, West officially filed with the FEC and secured a place on the ballot in Oklahoma with a US$35,000 payment.   Two other Independent presidential candidates also paid the fee to qualify for the Oklahoma ballot: child actor and entrepreneur ; plus pianist and pageant participant .  West, in an interview with a  radio station, floated Simmons as a potential running mate, arguing  Tidball could be used in a different capacity.  He identified fellow rapper  as his ideal running mate.  West held his first campaign rally in Charleston, where he tearfully discussed potentially aborting his first child with wife , screaming \"I almost killed my daughter!\"  He proposed a US$1 million payment for those who give birth to children rather than aborting.  At this time, West's family reportedly expressed concerns about West's mental state.  The next day on Twitter West accused his wife of attempting to \"lock me up\" due to his comments at the rally.\n\nIn a July 9 speech in Pennsylvania, Biden introduced an economic plan called \"Build Back Better\" designed to reinvigorate the US economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.  \"Build Back Better\" is, like Trump's \"\" plan, a form of .  \"Build Back Better\" calls for an increase in corporate taxes among economic incentives to \"Buy American.\"  Biden claimed the plan would create five million US jobs. Trump encouraged public schools to reopen classes in-person at summer's end.  He threatened to withhold federal funds from districts that did not comply.  Trump later softened his stance, acknowledging that circumstances may require delaying some school reopenings.  In addition, for the first time, Trump was pictured wearing a face mask.  As cases of coronavirus increased in Florida, Trump cancelled the in-person  planned for Jacksonville.  Instead, like the   Republicans opted to hold their convention in a largely virtual format.  The Libertarian Party held the second half of its  partially in-person in Orlando.  Although the party had already nominated the ticket of professor  for president and podcaster  for vice president at the virtual convention in May, party business still needed to be completed.  At the same time, the Green Party held its national convention virtually and nominated the ticket of party co-founder and union leader  for president and truck driver  for vice president.   \n\n \nIn mid-July, Trump commuted the prison sentence of confidante Roger Stone.  Stone had been found guilty of several crimes including false statements to investigators as part of 's  of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.  Trump called Stone's 40 month sentence \"unjust.\"  The Biden campaign criticized the commutation as an abuse of power, pointing to the \"ballot box\" as the only way to stop Trump.  Several days later, Trump's niece  released the tell-all book .  The book alleges, among other things, that Trump paid his friend Joe Shapiro to take the  for him before his admission to the .  Shapiro's widow, former tennis player , said her husband had told her Trump had not met Shapiro until being admitted to Wharton. The July 17 death of Democratic Congressman , a prominent civil rights leader, had a major impact on the second half of the month.  The death brought the issue of civil rights back to the forefront of the campaign.  Lewis's colleague and leader of the , Congresswoman  emerged as a significant contender to be Biden's running mate, joining Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and  as potential candidates.  Trump did not attend Lewis's viewing or funeral.  Three former presidents including Barack Obama attended the funeral.  During his eulogy, Obama took a veiled shot at Trump for his attacks on , which critics, like Obama, have said amounted to voter suppression.  As the funeral progressed, Trump tweeted about possibly delaying the 2020 election due to his concerns about potential fraud from widespread mail-in balloting instituted due to the pandemic.  Biden attacked Trump for the tweet, claiming he used it to distract from Lewis's funeral.  In honor of Lewis, Biden said once in office he would immediately sign the renewal of the , renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. On the day of the funeral, the co-chair of Black Voices for Trump and 2012 presidential candidate, Herman Cain, who, like Trump, ran for president on his business credentials, died from COVID-19.  He had attended Trump's Tulsa rally in June without a mask and first received hospital treatment for COVID-19 on July 1.  Trump lauded Cain as a \"powerful voice of freedom.\" \n\nAs July came to a close, Biden’s lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average slightly decreased, with Biden registering 49.9 percent to 42.1 percent for Trump. \n\nIn July, the 's ticket of retired teacher  for president and high school teacher Amar Patel for vice president, qualified, through petition, for ballot access in Illinois.  The party has expanded upon its ballot access from 2016 when its first ticket of  for president and Juan Muñoz for vice president appeared on the ballot only in Colorado, receiving a total of 6,776 votes, largely from  in other states.\n\nThe party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party. It changed to its current name ahead of the 2016 presidential election.  The party is based on Roman Catholic , advocating for , environmentalism, and \"a consistent life ethic\"\nincluding opposition to abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment.  It has grown ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\nLast September the party nominated Carroll for president over past Wikinews interviewee  and Joshua Perkins who also sought the party's nomination. Carroll selected Patel as his running mate. Patel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a high school teacher in the Chicago suburbs. He converted to Catholicism in 1993 and engaged with the . He became involved in the pro-life movement and, in association with that, the Republican Party, but grew disillusioned with the party over the war policies of the George W. Bush .  Eventually, Patel joined the Solidarity Party and rose to the position of chairman\n\nPatel spoke with Wikinews about the campaign. He discussed how he became the vice presidential nominee of the Solidarity Party, what he sees as his duties and responsibilities as Carroll's running mate, and why voters should consider voting for the Carroll/Patel ticket.\n\n Why did you agree to be the running mate of Brian Carroll?  How do you complement him on the ticket? \nPatel: I was already serving the second and final year of my term on the National Committee and was the party chair when Brian asked me to run with him. I would have essentially done the same thing I did until the end of June whether I was running for office or not. This basically continued my service as a party leader through November and I welcomed the opportunity to have a heightened awareness to our message for a few more months. I complement Brian by being the quick take provider on Twitter while he is long form prose producer on Facebook. \n\n What duties and responsibilities come with being the vice presidential nominee of the Solidarity Party?\nPatel: Technically there are no official duties or responsibilities besides filling in and signing the required paperwork to get on various ballots or become write-in candidates. I have taken on the responsibility of creating  and videos for us to promote the party message but also the short term campaign message.\n\n  In what states is the Carroll/Patel ticket expected to be on the ballot? Why should voters in those states choose Carroll/Patel over other tickets?\nPatel: We will be on the ballot in my home state of Illinois, Vermont, Wisconsin, Colorado, Louisiana, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Washington, Mississippi, and perhaps a few others. \nThere is no other campaign that clearly states that government will necessarily continue to grow as long as #FamilyFriendsFaith erode. Those institutions teach us self control and responsibility for others. If you primarily concern yourself with selfishness, the state has to provide the constraints that you do not. If you believe rights and responsibilities must be balanced vote Carroll/Patel 2020.\n\nThe Bread and Roses Party ticket of  research scholar  for president and filmmaker John de Graaf for vice president secured a spot on the ballot in Vermont in July. The party had already achieved qualified status in Maryland.  It is seeking access only in non-s where a particular major party is heavily expected to win.  In swing states, to avoid the , the party supports the Democratic Party's presidential ticket. \n\nSegal founded the Bread and Roses Party since the last presidential election.  Its name derives from the  of immigrant textile workers in Massachusetts during a .  The party holds leftist positions including the right to employment, paid vacation, a shortened work week, and recognition of the State of Palestine.  In August 2019 the party nominated Segal for president. He announced de Graaf as his running mate this past April.  As a filmmaker, de Graaf has produced 40 documentaries.  In addition, he has co-written four books, and has written numerous articles for such publications as  and The New York Times.\n\nWith Wikinews, de Graaf discusses why he joined the Bread and Roses Party, what his role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters in non-swing states should choose the Segal/de Graaf ticket over other options on the ballot.\n\nWhy did you decide to run as the vice presidential nominee of the Bread and Roses Party?  How do you complement Jerome Segal on the ticket? \n\nde Graaf: I was asked by Jerome to be his Bread and Roses Party running mate and considered it an honor as I have been advocating for its principles for half a century.  We believe that quality of life is more important than quantity of money or goods, and that our national priorities of economic growth, worship of the stock market and constant tax cutting to fuel mindless consumption both threaten the life systems of the planet and ignore the importance of \"the roses\" in our lives — such things as nature, natural beauty and smart human design, the arts, social connection, good health, and especially enough leisure time to actually enjoy the fruits of our prodigious labors. \n\nWe come out of the \"voluntary simplicity\" movement of resistance to consumerism but understand that living simply and ecologically is not solely a personal choice.  We need policies that make it easier for people to earn a modest but secure income without working themselves to death or producing for the sake of production rather than the satisfactions that meaningful work, human connections and a beautiful environment can bring us. \n\nJerome has also been a longtime advocate of Middle East peace and justice for Palestinians with a  in Israel.  We support that, and a massive reduction in nuclear weapons and arms buildups in the interest of world peace.  Our priorities as a country are simply out of whack and we want to make that point and offer a different vision of the good life. \n\nI complement Jerome in that while he is an academic and a scholar I am a filmmaker and communicator who has spent forty years making documentaries for  about quality of life issues.  \n\nWhat duties and responsibilities do you have as the vice presidential nominee of the Bread and Roses Party?\n\nde Graaf: At this point, only to help get the word out as we are under no illusions of winning.  Our goal is educational and we hope that our key concepts — guaranteed jobs or income that allow for a modest but secure life and a Beauty New Deal (to complement the  which we also support), will be picked up by candidates and leaders in the major parties.  Of course, we hardly expect the GOP to take us seriously but we know many Democrats share our values and will be inspired by our proposals. \n\nWe'd love to see a Bread and Roses caucus in the Democratic Party — we agree with its calls for greater equality, climate action, racial justice, compassion and kindness.  We also believe it should pay attention to the \"roses\" and should work hard to reduce international tensions.  We will continue to campaign for these ideas both as a third party and within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn what states should voters expect to see the Segal/de Graaf ticket on the ballot?  Why should voters choose the Segal/de Graaf ticket over other tickets on the ballot?\n\nde Graaf: COVID-19 has made it very difficult to collect the signatures to get on the ballot in many states and you will only see us on the ballot this year in Maryland, where Jerome lives, and Vermont.  We are not seeking to be spoilers and had no intention of running in any state where we might in any way cause the defeat of Joe Biden as we believe the most important thing right now is to end the monstrosity of the Trump presidency. \n\nWe see Vermont and Maryland as among the bluest states in the union, where it is also possible that some on the Left will sit the election out, knowing that a Biden victory is assured in their state. Instead, we hope they will come out and vote for us and then for other progressives further down the ticket.  If we get enough votes to be noticed we hope we can create a new dialogue about the importance of the roses in political thinking. \n\nIn other safe , voters can write us in to send a message about quality of life.  As we emerge from Covid-19, we do not want to return to the old normal of a grossly unequal, overworked America, obsessed with materialistic values at the expense of our environment, health and happiness.

The party had already attained ballot access in Colorado as a qualified minor party with at least 1,000 members. This is the first election cycle the party has fielded a presidential ticket.  \n\nHammons founded the Unity Party in 2004  and grew it through his 2008 and 2010 runs for US Congress, his 2014 and 2016 runs for US Senate, and his 2018 run for .  The party, which describes itself as centrist, advocates in its constitution for, among other things, a , elimination of the , tax deduction for health care costs, a global minimum wage for fair trade,  for Congress and judges, lowering the voting age, , and expanded . \n\nBodenstab has previously run for city council and was the Unity Party's nominee for  in 2018.  With Wikinews, Bodenstab discusses how he joined the Unity Party's presidential ticket, what constitutes his role as the party's vice presidential nominee, and why voters in the states the party has attained ballot access should consider casting their vote for the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket.\n\n: Why did you join Bill Hammons on the Unity Party's 2020 presidential ticket?  How do you complement him on the ticket?\n\nBodenstab: I joined Mr. Hammons on the ballot because it was time to expand the party nationally.  We had just appeared on the ballot together in 2018, and by December it was clear that we were going to field a presidential candidate.  That person was myself.  Bill, for all his effort since 2004, probably needed to have someone else drive.  In addition, there was plenty to do at the state level here in Colorado.  When COVID[-19] hit, I lost my job and it made sense to pass the baton back.\n\n: What duties and responsibilities come with being the vice presidential nominee of the Unity Party?\n\nBodenstab: Our duties are very widespread.  From fundraising to finding candidates to talking with voters — we are candidates and field coordinators at the same time.  I was just in Louisiana last weekend personally seeking 8 electors for our presidential ballot.  Despite having in-laws in that state, we didn't have much of a network there, so Bill and I both were building it at the grassroots level.\n\nAfter we engaged and enrolled 8 individuals, spread across the 6 districts, Bill headed back to Tennessee to finish our ballot access there.  Our time in Louisiana took us to Eunice, a small town of no more than 10,000.  After finding our elector there (in CD 4), we met a young woman who was helping us find our last elector in Baton Rouge.  In passing, I let it be known that I was in the engineering field.  She was clearly more excited by that, than us being presidential candidates.  Such is the nature of our campaign, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  People should be excited by us being ordinary citizens rather than rich and powerful lawmakers.\n\n: In what states should voters expect to see the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket on the ballot?  Why should these voters consider casting their vote for the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket over the other tickets on the ballot?\n\nBodenstab: As I have mentioned, we traveled to Louisiana and Tennessee this last month.  We anticipate being on the ballot there, as well as in New Jersey (which is confirmed and reported, how you heard about us).  \n\nWe have demonstrated that just a couple guys, with the peripheral help of several others, can take a big step personally on behalf of the party we founded some years ago.  I don't think any of the other candidates can boast that.  Jo Jorgensen, from what I understand, has also worked tirelessly on ballot access for the Liberty party.  But she cannot claim she founded a party.

{"title": "Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Red Hat to move focus away from CentOS in favour of Stream; CentOS team discuss implications with Wikinews}}\nOn Tuesday, US-based software company Red Hat announced their plans to shift their focus away from  in favour of .\n\nIn the blog post , the Chief Technological Officer of Red Hat said Red Hat had informed the CentOS governing board that Red Hat was \"shifting our investment fully from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream\".  At least five of the nine CentOS Governing Board listed on the project are Red Hat employees.  \n\nStarted in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided  with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — Red Hat's  paid operating system.  CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".\n\nRed Hat also sponsors the  operating system.  Red Hat even gives the software engineering interns laptops with Fedora on it.  Till now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription.  CentOS would then follow RHEL to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.\n\nStream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM.  CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL.  Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle.\n\nWith CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat emplyees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a , before those features are absorbed into RHEL.  CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution.  Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.  Stream, on the other hand, has features added to it before those features become a part of RHEL.  That implies Stream would be ahead of RHEL's development, containing new features which are not yet tried and tested by RHEL developers, and not be binary code-compatible with RHEL.\n\nWriting \"The future of CentOS Linux is CentOS Stream\", Wright further wrote in the announcement, CentOS Stream \"provides a platform for rapid innovation at the community level but with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics.\"  Wright also said, \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\"\n\nSince the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on  (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list.  CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.\n\nGregory Kurtzer, who had started the CentOS project, announced a new operating system, Rocky Linux.  Rocky Linux describes itself as \"a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux\".  The project said \"Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to the upstream vendor, not before.\"  The project maintainers have not decided a date for when the operating system will be released.\n\nKurtzer explained the reason to call the OS as Rocky Linux: \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh.  He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\".\n\nWikinews reached out to the members of the CentOS project, Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen, to discuss this move, its implications as well as the future of CentOS.  Greco is a maintainer of  (32-bit processors) and is a part of the CentOS'  team.  Bowen — who unlike Greco, works for Red Hat — is the community manager of the CentOS project.\n\n Can you tell me about your current role in the CentOS development, and how did you get involved with the project?\n\n I'm the armhfp maintainer, basically helping out fixing things that are not part of the Red Hat supported architectures.  I do help out with other things like secondary , and creating images for armhfp and .  I got involved not too long ago when a project that I was working on needed to use ARMv7 hardware, and although CentOS had a version, it wasn't complete.\n\n I'm Rich Bowen and I'm the Community Manager for the CentOS project.  That means that it's my job to help people get involved in the project, manage the social media and newsletters (the \"voice\" of the project), and generally work with the community.  I've been at Red Hat for almost 8 years, and during that time have worked in this capacity with a couple of other projects, too.  I've been dedicated to the CentOS Project for going on 3 years now.  And I've been doing  stuff for about 25 years now.\n\nI should also note that I'm not alone — either on this team, or in responding to these questions.  I have a team of colleagues who help me out with CentOS through the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at Red Hat, and across the many other departments that are part of the / (RHEL)/ projects at Red Hat.\n\nThere's also a number of colleagues looking over my shoulder as I write this response, to ensure that I get the story straight.  As a community manager, I'm not the technical expert on all the things, and so I need that support to get the details right in some of your questions.\n\n What is the relationship between CentOS and RHEL?\n\n CentOS started as an external project, that was acquired by Red Hat 7 or 8 years ago.  But I don't think that it counts as an answer.  I think you'll get a better answer from people from Red Hat.\n\n In many ways, it's the same as it's always been, but with a different end result and project structure.  This is a community-focused open source project that delivers a strong Linux distribution foundation where non-operating-system focused (\"layered\") open source projects can develop, test, and innovate.  For example,  and .\n\nThe main shift with this evolution of a focus on  is how it is developed in the open, in the community space, allowing contributors to get involved in the creation and shaping of the future.  This also means RHEL users, customers, partners, independent hardware/software vendors, and anyone else can participate in the future of RHEL in true open source fashion.\n\nIn the past, the relationship between Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS was effectively, \"Fedora gets snapshot every so many years, then RHEL engineers develop RHEL behind closed doors until release day, then the RHEL source code is released, then CentOS would take the RHEL source and rebuild.\"  While that is an oversimplification, it is essentially accurate.  Now the new structure is, \"Fedora gets snapshot every so often and becomes the basis for the next CentOS Stream release, then development happens in the open with community contribution involvement and influence, and then RHEL rebases frequently on CentOS Stream.\"\n\nThis moment of integration is called \"the development phase\" in the RHEL engineering process.  This is being misinterpreted as a \"beta\".  Rather, this is an aspect of a distribution that is continuously delivered.\n\nThis is not software that is untested and not considered ready for inclusion in RHEL.  It is already planned for the next RHEL release, has passed QA [quality assurance] and  [Continuous Integration] checks, and is considered stable.  In the past, this software went right into RHEL without external visibility.  We don't schedule software for inclusion into RHEL unless it has been used/tested/integrated at other levels (such as Fedora), and is considered stable enough for inclusion.  This same philosophy will still be at play with CentOS Stream.\n\nOne thing I would like to highlight here is this is the first time in the history of RHEL that development happens in the open and allows for collaboration and contribution from the broader open source community.  That is a large goal of CentOS Stream and we're making the move to focus on that entirely.\n\nFor an example of where this evolution has been discussed in the past, this presentation from Fedora's Flock 2018 \"The Penrose Triangle\" shows how this problem has been discussed and worked through for a number of years now.\n\n How has CentOS evolved after Red Hat acquired it?  How has it evolved since IBM acquired Red Hat last year?\n\n The biggest change when CentOS came to Red Hat was that individuals who were working on CentOS in their weekends and evenings now had the ability to devote more time to it.\n\nIn addition, the project for the first time was able to put significant resources on helping make the platform useful for open source software development of other projects in Red Hat's ecosystem.  This included the expansion of the SIG program [Special Interest Groups] to include layered projects like , and .\n\nIBM is not involved in the CentOS community or Red Hat's work in it.  An unfortunate misconception about this announcement has been conspiracy theories about IBM's involvement in this decision.  Red Hat operates independently from IBM, and IBM had no influence or involvement in the decision.\n\n What are the similarities between CentOS, Fedora and RHEL?\n\n I'm gonna explain in a really loose way, ok?  Fedora is where everything starts, all the fast moving packages.  Some maintained by Red Hat employees, some by contributors.  Every few years, Red Hat gets sort of a snapshot of Fedora, and starts stabilizing and improving it, and that becomes RHEL.  CentOS originally was a rebuild of that.\n\nAbout 1 year ago, Stream was introduced, as a way to make the work around RHEL more public, allowing the users to contribute.  Making it sort of a continuous preview of what's to come for RHEL.  That doesn't imply anything about it being of lower quality by definition, or some  like some people call it.  Many of the packages that are built for stream, reach the next version of RHEL unmodified.  So even if there is a higher level of testing in Stream, it is far from a traditional .\n\n They are each Linux distribution projects, which work on a common code base at different points in its life.  It's born in an  open source project, and travels through each of the projects as it matures.\n\nFrom a community perspective, the projects are each run as open, collaborative communities, but with different audiences.  By the time we get to RHEL, it's done inside Red Hat, but that team also operates with the principles of open source.\n\nThe exciting thing about CentOS Stream is that it makes RHEL development more open, both in terms of decision making, and in who can participate.  We're believers in the Four Opens, as the OpenStack community talks about them here — https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/opens.html\n\nOur roots are in open source, but that's not enough without the other three.\n\n What are the similarities and differences between CentOS and CentOS Stream?  Or do they just share the name and are completely different?\n\n For me, Stream is not CentOS, Stream is the next RHEL, the rest is just branding.\n\n The name \"CentOS\" is frequently misused, and has been for a long time, so here are the basics: CentOS is the project.  CentOS Linux is a rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).  CentOS Stream is an upstream distribution from RHEL, which reflects what the RHEL team intend to put into the next minor release of RHEL.  The CentOS Project also contains other things, such as the SIGs (Special Interest Groups), the Promo/Events team, the CI/CD and build system (CBS) project, and so on.\n\n Do you have any stats for the userbase of CentOS vs Stream?\n\n I don't, but Stream is rather new so I don't expect the number to be that big.  I've been using Stream for most of my things ever since it came out, and I love the idea for it.  The only problem is that Stream is being used as an excuse to kill CentOS, and that's the part I hate.\n\n We don't.  For reasons of privacy, we have never kept server logs around CentOS Linux, and other CentOS Project \"downloads.\"  And these files are served by a large  network distributed around the world, much of which we don't have any actual access to.\n\nI put the word downloads in quotes, because installing a Linux distribution isn't exactly just downloading something.  It's composed of thousands of packages which are (can be) installed independently, and figuring out which of those packages are going to CentOS Stream machines, vs CentOS Linux machines (vs  machines, and so on) and which ones are being mirrored for further use by additional users behind a firewall, is a lot of guesswork.\n\nWe have some general ideas, but have always been reluctant to try to put actual numbers on it, because of these reasons and others.  Linux user surveys [...] perhaps have a better handle on this than we do, since we have simply never gathered these stats.\n\n Could you briefly explain what Red Hat announced and what it means for the future of CentOS?\n\n They announced that the CentOS as we all know it, doesn't exist anymore, there's only Stream from now on.  This applies to all releases starting with [CentOS] 8, [CentOS] 7 seems to be unaffected by this.  In my view, CentOS is dead, there is no CentOS anymore, because as I said, I view Stream as a RHEL thing and not a CentOS thing.\n\n Could you briefly explain Chris Wright's announcement, and what it means for the future of CentOS?\n\n The future of CentOS is stronger than ever, as it is now literally in the critical path of RHEL development.  The CentOS Project as a community continues, and in fact the community grows more facets as CentOS Stream provides more ways where the community can engage with Red Hat and each other.  There will be some growing pains as users of CentOS Linux find out and help shape whether CentOS Stream meets their needs.  Communities are built in overcoming challenges together, and there are many challenges ahead in making CentOS Stream right for members of the CentOS community.\n\nA major aspect of this is that in the past, CentOS Linux users could not shape the future of the distro within the project.  From now on, not only developers but end users of all types will be able to shape the future of the distro.  If CentOS Stream does not meet a user's need today, now they can advocate and contribute toward it meeting their needs as it evolves.\n\n Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan?\n\n I don't have a contractual relation with Red Hat, just as many of the people that helped in the CentOS-QA team.  I assume that those who are knew about this, but the rest of us didn't.  But this is all my assumption, don't have any evidence one way or the other.\n\n Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan?  Were there any oppositions within Red Hat about this decision?  Was it put to vote?\n\n Red Hat discussed this with the CentOS Governing Board, which is responsible for the oversight of the CentOS Project.  There was a lot of back-and-forth on that proposal.  The CentOS Governing Board voted and reached consensus.\n\nRed Hat's engineering resource focus has never been decided by voting.  Some of the core developers are on the Governing Board but not everyone in our community was involved in the decision.  As I'll touch on later in this interview, that's one of the reasons that some of the community have taken this change so hard.\n\nIs every Red Hatter happy with the announcement?  Of course not.  A big part of Red Hat's culture is the ability to voice an opinion and ask hard questions.  And Red Hatters have definitely expressed their thoughts about this.\n\n Do you know why this sudden move from Red Hat?\n\n No idea, I can assume it was a business decision, but no information whatsoever.\n\n CentOS Stream was introduced in September 2019, so while the news may have come as a surprise to many, Red Hat has also had that time to get feedback on CentOS Stream and see momentum that reinforced the role it believed CentOS Stream could fit in the RHEL ecosystem.  I've seen Red Hat's VP of Linux Engineering explain the timing internally — once Red Hat took the decision to the CentOS Governing Board and the Board had voted, they all thought it was important and most transparent for the community leadership to communicate that decision as soon as possible. \n\n Why has the End of Life [EOL] been shortened?\n\n Good question, I don't have an answer for it.  I guess someone from Red Hat should give you that.  I'm not happy about it to say the least.\n\n Why has the EOL been shortened?  Is this unusual?\n\n First, it's important to understand that the dates that the CentOS project lists as EOL (End Of Life) dates are, and always have been, dependent on Red Hat.  That is, we can say that CentOS Linux 7 will be EOL on a particular date, but if the dates around RHEL 7 shift, hypothetically speaking, then so will those around CentOS Linux 7.  That's what happened with CentOS Linux 8.  This decision was made by Red Hat and the CentOS Board. \n\n What are some of the reasons people consider CentOS for their daily driver or for their servers?\n\n It used to be rock solid distribution, with almost everything that RHEL has, but without all the hassle or the costs of a RHEL license, and obviously without the main benefit of RHEL which is the support.  CentOS 7 still fits that description.\n\n Besides the obvious cost benefits of running CentOS Linux, many users find that the friction of running CentOS Linux is much lower than other options.  There's no web form, registration, or subscription management.  And while these frictions are things that the RHEL subscription team is actively working on, this remains part of our users' mindset.\n\n How different are CentOS 7 and CentOS 8?\n\n Upgrades between major release versions provide a chance to provide the latest versions of packages to our users.  A major release will stay on these base package versions for the releases' lifecycle.  The \"rebasing\" of packages allows us to incorporate all of the fixes and enhancements that have occurred between major releases and ensure we maintain the balance of upstream momentum, with the stability that backporting patches and fixes provides.\n\n In some ways, very different, Modularity may be the biggest, many new versions of things (there was a 5 year gap between 7 and 8).  But for the most part, usage is the same as it has been forever, like in things like repos [repositories], installing and removing packages, building packages, etc.\n\n Anyone who would be running CentOS 7 could upgrade to CentOS 8 without any breaking changes?\n\n There are several attempts to do that, none successful as far as I know, I'm really hoping to be wrong.\n\n Would it be feasible for the developers to fork CentOS 8 after EOL, to continue developing the OS?\n\n We've actually covered this in the FAQ that we published on Tuesday.  The short answer is yes, and we fully expect that to happen.  Indeed, the Rocky Linux project has already indicated their intention to do just that. \n\nThere's also ongoing discussion on the CentOS Project mailing lists of how this could be done within the community itself.\n\n Very, to me the most difficult part of coming up with a new fork is the human factor.  The technical side may have its complications (many to mention), but at the end of the day, they are solvable.\n\n The human factor?\n\n People interaction, who does what, responsibilities, jealousy, etc.  Dealing with people is a lot harder than dealing with computers.\n\n Are there any discussions taking place in the community to fork CentOS?\n\n As far as I know, Rockylinux is the main one, it has gotten some traction, hopefully something good will come out of it.  Then there is , which announced that during Q1 2021 they'd be releasing their rebuild for free.\n\n Is CentOS Stream not as rock solid distribution as CentOS?\n\n No, and that's not a bad thing. just for different use.\n\n What are some of the use cases for which CentOS is ideal?\n\n Personally, I use CentOS for everything, [CentOS] 7 for some servers, [CentOS] 8 for others, Stream for development and desktops.  But that's just me, many people could use it in different ways.\n\n CentOS Stream is ideal in many (even most) of the same situations that CentOS Linux is good for.\n\nLook, with my Red Hat on, I want everyone to use RHEL, because it puts food on my table.  But I am also passionate about the CentOS platform as a solution to everyday computing needs, from a desktop machine to your server farm.  And Red Hat wants people to adopt CentOS Stream widely, so that it can actually realize its benefit to the RHEL development program.\n\nTo that end, we'll be trying to make CentOS Stream as widely useful as possible, and as stable as possible, so that people actually use it.  Because if they don't use it, this was all for nothing. \n\n Will Red Hat employees be barred from contributing to any community-driven development of forks of CentOS?\n\n A large part of Red Hat's culture is ingrained in the idea of open source and community.  Red Hat will never prevent its employees from pursuing upstream development and open source projects. \n\nI think section 6 [of Red Hat's Open source participation guidelines] \"Contributing to upstream projects not maintained by Red Hat\" applies here. \n\n What are the implications of this move for the userbase?\n\n Where to start?  There are too many cases in the userbase to mention, but taking some examples.  If you have a fast deploying platform (like the Facebook example given in the press release), and you take advantage of the benefit of Stream even with the shortened EOL, this may not even affect you.  But in my opinion, this is not the majority.  Most users wanted CentOS for its premise of being bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL, and since that option doesn't exist anymore, until a suitable replacement appears, things are going to be complicated.  I guess I could extend this by a lot, but that's the gist.\n\nDepending on your use case, you may be unaffected, or have a really complicated year ahead of you. I think very few people will be unaffected.\n\n \"being bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL\" -- Is it fair to call CentOS as RHEL, but without the support?\n\n Fair, but not entirely accurate.  RHEL customers have access to tools that may not be public, and therefore, not available for CentOS.  I mean, there are other benefits of being a RHEL customer, aside from support.  Not all the tools are code, there's access to different containers, knowledge base, etc.\n\n If I understand correctly, Stream is going to be a RHEL beta, and a rolling release, similar to  or 's .  Right?\n\n Not exactly.  Let's say it is a minor-release-rolling, that's how I'd describe it.  It is not a continuous rolling like Arch.  And with respect to beta, there's never code that is known to break, everything that lands in Stream is expected to be shipped as-is in the next RHEL minor release.  That expectation may not always be met, but still.\n\n Is the success of Stream somehow responsible for this move?\n\n In my opinion, no.  The need for Stream to succeed maybe, but I just don't see Stream succeeding under the new conditions.\n\n Oh, why do you say so?\n\n Because I've lost all my incentives to collaborate in Stream.  The idea was that it would be a preview of what's to come, and that's great.  But they just removed the end-result of Stream, which is the next minor release.  Stream helps make a better product, but we don't have that product anymore (CentOS Linux), so.\n\n Is the success of CentOS Stream somehow responsible for this? In the announcement, Wright said Stream was not the replacement for CentOS. What is the possible solution for those who relied on CentOS? \n\n CentOS Stream is not a drop-in replacement for all existing use cases.  It requires sysadmins out there to evaluate the new information and adjust their workflows.  We would do our user base a disservice to claim otherwise.  For many use cases it can be used as a replacement.  Indeed, for people who wanted the stability of the CentOS Linux base operating system, but were frustrated by the slowness of application updates, CentOS Stream will be a better replacement for CentOS Linux — now those updates will be available sooner, should users choose to update.\n\nWe also want people to understand the difference, so they can see the additional options it brings to them.  We want people to go into this decision with eyes open, and not expect it to be something that it's not.\n\n What can be done for those users for whom CentOS Stream does not meet their requirements?\n\n Pay for RHEL, move to another distribution, or wait for someone to fill in the gap.  If someone has another solution, I'm all ears.\n\n We hope any users who are in that situation will tell us, so we can figure out how to fix that failing.  One of the exciting things about the move to CentOS Stream is it's designed to be an actual contributor community, rather than the legacy CentOS Linux that is almost entirely a consumer community.\n\nCentOS Stream is more than just something you download and install.  It's a process and a community — a venue for contributing changes, making suggestions, and reporting bugs.  All of that feeds back into making CentOS Stream better, and, in turn, making RHEL better.\n\nThat said, Red Hat is working on some \"low- or no-cost programs\" for users who cannot, for whatever reason, deploy CentOS Stream in their environment. This is discussed in the Red Hat announcement and we anticipate hearing more details around that in the coming weeks. \n\n What are some of the best arguments in favour of, and against this move that you are aware of?\n\n I have nothing positive to say about the announcement, let's just leave it at that.  [About against the move,] I can't put it into words you can publish.\n\n While I empathize with users' response to the decision, I believe that shifting focus to CentOS Stream is the right solution for our community, in the longer term.\n\nCentOS Stream creates a place where the community can actually participate in the development of the OS on which they rely.  They can now actually file bugs against it and have those considered by the engineering team.  They can submit their own changes to the project and expect that they will actually be considered and accepted into the code.\n\nThe arguments against it have been made eloquently elsewhere, and if I can summarize them, they would be timing (dropping the announcement right on the heels of the CentOS 6 Linux EOL) and timing (cutting the maintenance lifetime of CentOS Linux 8 from 10 years to 2).\n\n How will this move affect the development of RHEL, and other GNU/Linux?\n\n RHEL maintainers try to do as much work as possible \"upstream first\". This means starting in upstream open source projects like the kernel, then participating in Fedora, then bringing those changes in for RHEL.  CentOS Stream gives RHEL maintainers a place to collaborate with the community in public on what's coming for the next minor release. \n\n I don't think this will affect other distros in a negative way, quite the contrary.  With respect to RHEL development, depends on how much people contribute to Stream.  If people contribute to it, it will make RHEL a better product, because it will have a broader testing in the earlier stages.  But that's just the benefit of stream.  I mean, this was still true before the announcement.\n\n Hm, how can it benefit other distros?  I mean, how does the development of any distribution benefit other distros?\n\n For me, it is going to benefit other distros because many people, angry at this announcement, will move away from the RHEL ecosystem.  And that could mean more resources, but it is all just guesses.\n\n Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development?  Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?\n\n As far as I understand, no.  CentOS is a  of Red Hat, so anything would have to be done on the outside.  But I'm not a lawyer, and I think you should get a formal answer to that from someone who represents Red Hat.\n\n What does the strong reaction from the CentOS community indicate?\n\n For me it indicates that Red Hat didn't expect this, or that they did expect it and were prepared to handle it.  I don't like any of the options.\n\n What is the reason for such a strong reaction from the CentOS community?  Had Red Hat considered this while making this move?  How are they planning to handle it?\n\n Open source communities are often very passionate about their projects.  The very nature of open source means that each person has equal ownership of the project.  So the strong reaction here is understandable.  A decision was made outside of their view, which they would not have made themselves.  That makes people feel betrayed.  We get that.\n\nAnd, yes, we discussed, in the leadup to this, how it would affect people, and that they would be angry.  We tried to minimize that, but we understand community skepticism about that statement.  It's a big change, being made quickly, and driven by business needs that the majority of our user community doesn't know or particularly care about.\n\nI've talked in other places about the stages of grief.  The community has lost something, and they are grieving that.  Part of that process is anger.  This is neither unexpected nor strange in any way.\n\nWe also understand that this explanation rings hollow to some, and sounds like, \"We considered that and then decided to ignore it.\"  That's not the case, but we understand why some people feel that it is.\n\nHow are we planning to handle it?  By ensuring that CentOS Stream lives up to our promises by doing rather than talking.  I'm here, as the community manager, to help people find the solutions that they need, and to help them navigate this period of transition. \n\n How many core developers are there, who are not working for Red Hat?\n\n The CentOS QA team which handles most of the day-to-day things, are about 20 people, most of which are not Red Hat employees, like myself.\n\n What lies ahead for you (and the non-Red Hat developers)?\n\n I can't speak for the others aside from the general anger.  I'm considering my options, don't want to hurry and say something that I'd have to retract.  Right now, the working theory is that I'm going to help with CentOS 7, because it is still alive, and in fact, it will outlive CentOS 8.  But I don't plan on reaching a conclusion this year.\n\n Did the non-Red Hat developers collectively send a letter/email to Red Hat about this?\n\n Not that I know of.  And not that it would change anything in my opinion, this was planned for a long time.  The way I see it, Red Hat doesn't view the non-Red Hat employees as a part of CentOS, so we're just like anybody else.\n\n How do you think Fedora now fits in the grand scheme of Red Hat development?\n\n Fedora is still the upstream for whatever comes to RHEL, and is where most of the big changes happen.  So in my opinion, Red Hat needs a stable and vibrant Fedora.\n\n Isn't Stream achieving the same goal?\n\n Different stages.  Take 8 for example.  8-stream is the next minor version of 8.  When RHEL takes a snapshot of Fedora in a few months, that will become 9 stream.  And Fedora will continue moving.  Part of the preparation for the snapshot is being done in fedora as ELN (Enterprise Linux Next).\n\n Many users are calling it \"The death of CentOS\".  Do you agree with that?  Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development?  Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?\n\n No, obviously I do not agree that this is the death of CentOS.  As I said earlier, CentOS is a project with multiple outputs, and the remaining outputs are still important both to CentOS users and to Red Hat.  The project continues, it just looks different now, with a different primary focus.\n\nThat said, we totally understand community members who feel that we have killed the part of the project that they care about, and that, to them, this means the death of the project.  That's not confusing or surprising at all.\n\nIn the coming year, we hope to demonstrate that CentOS Stream is every bit as useful, to most of our users, as CentOS Linux was.  And for the users for whom it is not as useful, we will strive to understand why, and whether we can address that gap.\n\nThe very first sentence of my blog post on Tuesday was \"The future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream.\"  Clearly that implies that I don't believe that this is the end of the line, or the death of the project.  Our job going forward is to demonstrate the value of CentOS Stream, and build the contributor community around it.\n\n How can an open source project ensure situations like these do not repeat?\n\n Wish I knew, maybe not letting for-profit companies dictate the future of non-profit organizations/distributions.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'm equipped to solve that :(\n\n All projects in the open source ecosystem are unique and face unique challenges.  We would not presume to try to predict how to anticipate another project's issues.", "question": "What is the primary reason for Red Hat's shift in focus from CentOS to CentOS Stream?\n\nA) To discontinue all support for CentOS entirely  \nB) To allow community participation in development for future releases of RHEL  \nC) To enhance the commercial offerings of Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nD) To eliminate the CentOS Governing Board"}

{"title": "Gregory Kurtzer discusses plans for Rocky Linux with Wikinews as Red Hat announces moving focus away from CentOS", "content": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Gregory Kurtzer discusses plans for Rocky Linux with Wikinews as Red Hat announces moving focus away from CentOS}}\n\nLast week, on December 8, US-based software company Red Hat announced plans to shift their focus away from  in favour of .\n\nStarted in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided  with  (RHEL) — Red Hat's  paid .  Gregory Kurtzer told Wikinews he started CAOS Linux around the time when Red Hat announced  for their  in favour of subscription-based Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  CAOS was succeeded by CentOS when Rocky McGaugh, a developer of CAOS rebuilt the source code of RHEL to provide a monetarily free alternative.  CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".\n\nRed Hat also sponsors the development of the  operating system.  Until now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription. CentOS would then follow RHEL's release cycle to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.\n\nStream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM.  CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL.  Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle. \n\nWith CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat employees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a , before those features are absorbed into RHEL.  CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution.  Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.\n\nRed Hat's Chief Technical Officer Chris Wright wrote in the announcement \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\"  Since the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on  (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list. CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.\n\nSoon after Red Hat's announcement, Kurtzer announced his intentions to develop , to fill the role CentOS had been playing for so long.  Kurtzer said Rocky Linux was named after Rocky McGaugh.  \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\", Kurtzer wrote.  Wikinews discussed with Kurtzer the beginning of CentOS, and future of Rocky Linux.\n\nWhile no formal date of release has been announced for Rocky Linux, Kurtzer said they are planning to release the CentOS replacement before the end of life of CentOS 8.  Kurtzer also said Rocky Linux will run on both x86-64 and ARM-based processors, and CentOS users would be able to convert their OS to Rocky Linux just by running a single command.\n\nSaying Rocky Linux is for the community, Kurtzer said he \"take[s] the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control\" including his own company.  Talking about the attention from the userbase Rocky Linux has received, Kurtzer said, \"I have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.\"\n\n Why was CentOS originally created?  What were the reasons why it was then absorbed by Red Hat?\n\n CentOS was originally created because Red Hat decided to EOL (End of Life)  (RHL) shortly after releasing RHL 8.  Overnight, RHL ceased to exist and Red Hat instead released Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) which was a commercial only product.  This means that the majority of RHL users were left without a \"free\" solution or upgrade path.\n\nAt the time a Linux distribution that I founded called CAOS Linux was just beginning to get underway, and we too were relying on RHL as a bootstrap build environment.  One of our developers, Rocky McGaugh, quickly rebuilt the sources in RHEL to give us a stable foundation.  That was the beginning of CentOS which was released as an open source project.\n\nAfter CentOS became widely known, CentOS was separated from Caos Linux Foundation and another person took the lead.  Later, the project underwent some drama — lost developers, contributors, and a lot of support, to the point where only a couple of developers were running everything and Red Hat hired most of them.  I had no visibility of the acquisition of CentOS.\n\n How has CentOS evolved since it became a part of Red Hat?\n\n Red Hat has invested a good deal of resources into the CentOS project itself and the community has benefited from additional developers, closer ties to Red Hat's internal development team and infrastructure (including Fedora), marketing, branding, conference presence, etc.\n\nRed Hat has always been a tremendous supporter of Linux and open source, but that doesn't make Red Hat/IBM a good home for CentOS.\n\n How will this move by Red Hat, to move focus towards Stream, affect those who relied on CentOS?\n\n The focus towards Stream, while not exactly meeting the needs of enterprise use cases, wasn't the biggest problem, it was the unexpected change in the CentOS End Of Life (EOL) which moved from 2029 to 2021.  But either one, much less both together, demonstrates that the Community Enterprise Operating System is not technically \"community\" or \"enterprise\".  We have heard from many people now that this move has undermined not only trust in CentOS, but also other open source distributions of Linux which are commercially controlled.  Who is to stop them from doing something very similar?\n\n Tell us about Rocky Linux.\n\n Rocky Linux is a Community Enterprise Linux distribution by the community and for the community.  Our goal is to be  with RHEL and provide a long life for enterprise needs.\n\n How will Rocky Linux aim to fill the void that CentOS will leave?\n\n The last time I checked, CentOS was the most utilized Linux server operating system on the Internet.  All of these users, including development teams, need stability.  Linux is free.  Myself, among many thousands of developers and companies around the world, have contributed to what makes up a Linux distribution.  While nobody has a problem with companies offering value by building a usable, supportable platform out of open source software, there needs to be a freely available version out of respect to all of the people who have made the distribution possible as well as the organizations that have contributed time and resources into Linux.  It is not owned by the Linux distribution vendor, it is packaged by them.\n\nRocky [Linux] will provide a freely available, stable, enterprise-grade operating system that can be used everywhere by anyone.\n\n Will Rocky Linux provide a way to migrate CentOS 7 and 8 to Rocky Linux?  How will you ensure it is a smooth transition?\n\n We are not currently forking CentOS 7 because that has not changed its EOL.  If that changes, we will rebuild that as well.\n\nTo convert a CentOS 8 system to Rocky Linux 8, you only need to run a single command:\n\ndnf install http://your.favorite.rocky.mirror/path/to/rocky-release*.rpm\n\nBecause Rocky is completely compatible with both CentOS and RHEL, this single command is all you will have to do to keep your system running, patched, and supported.\n\n Which hardwares will Rocky Linux run on?  Is the aim to provide support for all hardwares CentOS supported, or just those which Red Hat supported?\n\n So far we have very active support and interest in  as well as .  Nobody from  has reached out to us (yet).\n\n Will Rocky Linux be supported for both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM processors?\n\n That isn't known yet, it depends on what ARM and contributors commit too, which will surely be driven by community necessity and requests.\n\n Will Rocky Linux be the same as CentOS in functionality, or will it do some things differently?\n\n Bug-for-bug compatibility.\n\nWe've already been approached by multiple people asking about  (SIGs) for value adds over and above the base enterprise platform.  One of my interests, for example, can be supported here with an HPC () SIG.  , /, and enhanced security have been among the other SIG proposals we've received.\n\n What are some of the challenges that Rocky Linux currently faces?  How do you plan to tackle those?\n\n Velocity of growth is the biggest challenge so far.  We are six days old and we keep hitting the invite link limits for our , which now has thousands of people in it.  I've requested a sponsorship from Slack, but so far, we haven't had a very positive outcome.  We're looking into alternatives to Slack for real-time communications as well.  For durable discussion, we've had more than 100,000 views of our forums in three days, and already we're hitting limits with our hosting there, so that needs to be scaled soon as well.\n\nAlso, we are working on  certifications and  standards which have been a consistent request.  That means that the security and compliance team is guiding how every aspect of the infrastructure is set up to guarantee security, compliance, and trust.\n\n How many developers are working on Rocky Linux?  What are the important things that require significant developer time and attention?\n\n We are about 65 contributors actively driving Rocky right now, all in small task groups to do specific things.  We also have about another 250 who have volunteered and are awaiting roles, and even more asking to help drive and build the community.  We also have small to massive corporations stepping up to support us in the form of sponsorships, donations, mirrors, hardware, cloud resources, etc.\n\nVery careful attention will be paid to the security, trust, and compliance of what we are creating.\n\nI have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.\n\n Can we expect Rocky Linux to be released before CentOS 8 reaches end of life?\n\n Yes.  While we haven't given any ETA on release, we already have a large percentage of the work underway and if I were to make a SWAG [], it will be near the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2 2021.\n\n How will the governing body of Rocky Linux function?  How can Rocky Linux ensure similar situation like this does not repeat?\n\n At the moment, we have a structure similar to most organizations.  People have been empowered to make decisions and report upwards.  This may change in the future, but right now, we need leadership and I take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control (even from my own company).\n\nMy commitment to the project is that Rocky will always remain in the best interest of the community and everyone who wishes to be part of the organization, with good intentions, will be welcomed.  Since day one, Rocky's coordination efforts have been completely transparent.  I invite anyone reading this to join the #rocky-coordination channel on our Slack instance. There you'll find many high-level discussions taking place with direct community involvement.\n\n What are the short-term and long-term goals of Rocky Linux and how will the project ensure it stays on its path?\n\n Short term: organization of technology and people.\n\nMid term: general availability of Rocky Linux.\n\nLong term: growing the community like sponsoring SIGs.", "question": "What was the main reason for Gregory Kurtzer to start Rocky Linux?  \n\nA) To replace Red Hat Enterprise Linux  \nB) To honor his late co-founder Rocky McGaugh  \nC) To provide a paid support option for CentOS users  \nD) To compete with Fedora"}

{"title": "'Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres': MIT professor Dr Seager tells Wikinews about her research on organisms thriving in oxygen-less environment", "content": "In May, a study was published in journal , conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Dr  and other researchers, showing - organisms like  (E. coli) and  can thrive in both 100%  and  atmospheres.  Wikinews discussed the findings with Dr Seager to know more about her research.\n\nLife has not been observed in any habitat other than Earth, which has an -rich environment.  While Earth's atmosphere is dominated by  gas, oxygen is essential for advanced living organisms.  Some species of microorganisms do not require oxygen for metabolism, called , such as  which rely on carbon-dioxide while releasing .\n\nResearchers used Escherichia coli strain K-12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiæ strain S288C for this experiment.  The two microorganisms were kept in four different environments: one being 100% air, and the other three being anærobic environments: 100% H2, 100% He, and 80%-20% N2-CO2.  The environments were kept in at 28° Celsius.  The researchers made sure the anaerobic experiment environments were anoxic, and had installed oxygen sensors to report fluctuation in the oxygen level.  They monitored growth of E. coli using optical density measurement, and they used a  for yeast.\n\nThe study reported the organisms were reproducing normally in both 100% H2 and 100% He environment.  However, the -shaped growth curve was not on par with 100% air.  E. coli and yeast switch from ærobic respiration, which uses oxygen, to anærobic respiration and fermentation.  Both processes are less efficient and do not produce as much energy as ærobic respiration.\n\nE. coli in an 80%-20% N2-CO2 environment had slower growth rate as CO2 dissolves and makes the liquid medium acidic.  Such reduction in growth rate was not observed for yeast cultures, which can thrive in acidic environments.  However, yeast's growth rate in 100% air was far greater than in the other three media.  The likely reason for this significant difference was lack of oxygen for non-respiratory purposes, the research reported.  Oxygen is essential for synthesis of biochemicals such as heme and sterols, which are important for yeast.  In atmospheres lacking oxygen to produce these chemicals, yeast fungi have stunted growth rate.\n\nWith this discovery, Dr Seager said scientists can now observe even more planets to study for habitable life.\n\n\"There's a diversity of habitable worlds out there, and we have confirmed that Earth-based life can survive in hydrogen-rich atmospheres.  We should definitely add those kinds of planets to the menu of options when thinking of life on other worlds, and actually trying to find it\", Professor Seager said.\n\nA  with expanded hydrogen-rich atmosphere should be easy to detect using the emerging technologies.  Hydrogen and helium gas have very low density.  Dr Seager said, \"It's kind of hard to get your head around, but that light gas just makes the atmosphere more expansive [...] And for telescopes, the bigger the atmosphere is compared to the backdrop of a planet's star, the easier it is to detect.\"\n\nThe research paper noted rocky planets which have radius below 1.7 times Earth's radius (Earth's radius is roughly 6360 ) can support a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, if water were to react with .\n\nThe research paper reported E. coli releases a number of gases when it lives in hydrogen-based atmosphere including , , , ,  and .  These gases can serve as  gases which can help astronomers detect and study potential life on exoplanets.\n\nConfirming life can thrive in atmospheres that do not have oxygen, Seager said \"Astronomers should keep an open mind as to which planets are worth searching for life\".\n\nWith NASA's  scheduled to be deployed next year, the paper suggests researchers could observe smaller exoplanets that orbit small red-dwarf stars.\n\n What prompted your interest in studying the survival of single-celled organisms in hydrogen gas environments?\n\n We wanted to show to astronomers that life can [survive] in hydrogen gas environments because planet atmospheres dominated by hydrogen are the easiest to study with current techniques (as opposed to N2 or CO2-dominated atmospheres).\n\n What led you to conduct this research?\n\n It's one of my life's goals to find signs of life on exoplanets.  We'd hate to have missed something just because we were too narrow minded.\n\nWhen I and others write proposals to use the upcoming telescopes (including the James Webb Space Telescope and the extremely large telescopes now under construction: , , ) we want to be able to point to evidence that hydrogen atmospheres shouldn't kill or destroy life.\n\n When did the team start working on this study?\n\n About three years ago.  However we started working in earnest about 2 years ago.\n\n Could you explain — in very simple terms — what you've done and what you saw?\n\n We grew microorganisms E. coli (a 'Prokaryote') and yeast (a more complex 'Eukaryote') in atmospheres other than air, including molecular hydrogen (and also helium and a carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixture).  We saw that life could grow and thrive in these other atmosphere types.  Although, the microbes grew more slowly than they would in air, i.e.  with oxygen.\n\n What activities did this study involve?\n\n Custom-made sealed bottles with E. coli and yeast growing in them.\n\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n\n The custom equipment was the most time consuming.\n\n Were there any challenges the team faced while conducting this experiment?\n\n Hydrogen gas is considered unsafe in large quantities.  Although we only used small amounts there were safety regulations that made our work challenging.\n\n What is the most fascinating aspect of this discovery?  How is it going to affect future space exploration?\n\n That E. coli, a simple single-celled organism, can produce so many different gases.  Proving to the astronomy community that life can survive and thrive in a hydrogen-dominated environment will enable astronomers to jump-start the search for life because hydrogen-dominated planet atmospheres are easiest to study.\n\n Were you surprised by the results?\n\n No, and the biologists on my team and elsewhere are not surprised either.  Hydrogen is not known to be toxic to life.  And, the life was not gaining energy from the atmosphere but rather from the \"broth\", the liquid culture the microbes were living in.\n\nOne thing I was personally surprised about is the diversity of gases produced by E. coli; this lowly life form can give us scientific hope that a range of interesting gases might also be produced by simple microbial-type life on exoplanets. \n\n How would you define what a 'biosignature gas' is and what is its advantage in looking for life in exoplanets compared to other forms[?]\n\n A \"biosignature gas\" is one that is produced by life, can accumulate in a planetary atmosphere, and be detected with remote space telescopes.  It is a \"sign\" of life, not foolproof evidence of life.\n\nExoplanets are so so so far away.  We can barely study their atmospheres at all.  Looking for gases that don't belong in a given atmosphere is the main way we can hope to search for signs of life beyond our solar system.\n\nAn example is oxygen on Earth.  Oxygen (O2) fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.  Without plants and photosynthetic bacteria, there would be no oxygen.  If there is an alien civilization with the kind of telescopes we are hoping to build, and they can see oxygen in our atmosphere, they will know oxygen is a highly reactive gas and shouldn't be present.  The aliens might infer there is life producing the oxygen.\n\nThe alternative is SETI — search for extra terrestrial signatures by way of mostly radio signals.  That requires intelligent life intentionally sending us a signal.  In the search for biosignature gases we can rely on simple single-celled life.\n\n Did your team also investigate the growth pattern of the bacteria in other biosignature gases?\n\n No.\n\n There are a few microbes on Earth known to thrive in hydrogen-rich environments.  Why did you decide to investigate yeast and E. coli for this experiment?\n\n Hydrogen-rich environments on Earth are incredibly rare and not well known.  We decided to do a simple experiment to communicate clearly to astronomers that live can survive and thrive in hydrogen environments.\n\n If there are planets with hydrogen-dominant atmosphere which can host life — will they have ultra-violet protection layer like the ozone gas?  If not, how will it affect the evolution of the life of these single-celled bacteria?\n\n  No.  The organisms may have to develop UV resistance like some life on Earth has.\n\n In the experiment, the study reported yeast had \"a substantially lower maximal cell concentration in the pure hydrogen-gas environment\".  What could be the reason for that?\n\n Even though life can survive without oxygen, life reproduces more with oxygen.\n\n The research paper talks about systems with hydrogen gas in abundance in the atmosphere.  Do you suspect microorganisms might be living in some of those systems?\n\n On Earth, yes, in niches.\n\n Are there habitats on Earth that might hint at what life on a hydrogen-rich atmosphere planet might look like?\n\n Not really.\n\n Should this change our search for life on other planets?  If so, how?\n\n This should open up — continue to push — astronomers on what kinds of planets might be habitable.  We will have so few planets to search for life around, even with our upcoming sophisticated telescopes, that we want to keep options open.\n\n What are some of the ways to detect microscopic alien life on an exoplanet?  Or is it beyond the limitations of physical instruments?\n\n Currently beyond limitation.  Future telescopes will be able to search for gases that might be linked to microbes.\n\n Are there any candidate exoplanets or satellites which meet the above description to be potential hosts for life?\n\n There is a list, but we do not know enough about the exoplanets, we need more information.\n\n Are some categories of exoplanets more likely to support hydrogen-based lifeforms?\n\n .  We know  and giant exoplanets have hydrogen/helium atmospheres but they are too hot beneath the atmospheres for life to survive.\n\n Can you describe the kind of planet that would likely have such an atmosphere?\n\n Planets are born with hydrogen in their atmospheres; even Earth had a tiny amount in its atmosphere.  Past calculations (that is theory, not observation) show the scenarios under which a planet can have a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere.  It can outgas if it is made of building blocks that have H-containing minerals.  Or some planets can capture an H/He from the planetary nebula while the planet is forming, then even if they lose some H and He it might be maintained from outgassing from the interior.\n\n How massive do the exoplanets have to be, so there is enough atmosphere available to support hydrogen-based life?  I suspect below a threshold, the planet's gravitational pull might be too weak, the planet may lose its atmosphere.\n\n Correct.  We know very little about exoplanet atmospheres; forthcoming observations are needed to learn more.\n\n Will the yeast and E. coli survive in a very thin atmosphere or in vacuum?\n\n Probably not.\n\n Does E. coli or yeast consume hydrogen gas for their survival?\n\n No.\n\n How many hydrogen gas-dominant exoplanets or satellites have been discovered?  How common are they?\n\n Rocky planets with hydrogen-gas dominated atmospheres haven't been discovered yet because we can't yet observe and study rocky planet atmospheres.\n\n Can we predict the category of the host stars where the planets may support life?\n\n We cannot.\n\n What are some of the adverse effects of living in a high concentration of hydrogen gas for E. coli and yeast?\n\n To my knowledge, none.\n\n How did you ensure the gas concentration remained stable throughout the experiment?\n\n Sealed bottles.\n\n Were [the microbes] taken out of the bottles for [counting]?\n\n Yes, with a needle so that air would not enter the bottles.\n\n The growth curve of 100% helium and 100% hydrogen gas environments were nearly the same.  What does that suggest?\n\n That the life we studied can probably survive in any type of non-poisonous atmosphere if it has energy, nutrients, and liquid. \n\n What's the significance of learning that microorganisms can survive and grow in a 100% hydrogen atmosphere?\n\n We used a pure 100% hydrogen atmosphere as a proxy for a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (as atmosphere[s] are unlikely to be pure anything). \n\nThe significance is for astronomers.  In our further search for life on exoplanets (once the next-generation telescopes are available to us) we will look for signs of life by way of gases in exoplanet atmospheres that might be produced by life. \n\nRocky planets with hydrogen atmospheres will be easier to study than atmospheres with nitrogen (N2) or carbon-dioxide atmospheres because hydrogen is a light gas and creates an expansive atmosphere.\n\nI should note that we don't have any rocky planets yet known with hydrogen atmospheres, but they are theorized.  Nor do we have a large number of rocky planets with accessible atmospheres at all.  So this whole sentiment is somewhat in the future.\n\n What can we infer from the growth curve of the bacteria in 80% nitrogen gas, 20% carbon dioxide environment?\n\n This atmosphere was used as a control and was not intended to have meaning on its own.\n\n How do you think next year's James Webb Telescope will set the course of astrobiology for years to come?\n\n Webb is poised to answer some of your above questions relating to rocky exoplanet atmospheres.  Webb has a small chance to find biosignature gases, but there are really only a small pool of planets available for study.\n\n Are there any future plans to follow up on this study?  Perhaps in different physical environments and with different microorganisms?\n\n My team is not planning on follow-up work.\n\n  What lies ahead in this field of research?\n\n Observations with Webb, and with other telescopes now under construction.\n\nzh:富氫大氣中的生命：專訪麻省理工教授塞格博士", "question": "What conclusion did the study conducted by Dr. Seager and her team draw regarding the survival of microorganisms in hydrogen-rich atmospheres?\n\nA) E. coli and yeast cannot survive without oxygen.  \nB) Microorganisms can thrive in hydrogen-rich environments without oxygen.  \nC) Only yeast can survive in anaerobic environments.  \nD) The growth of microorganisms is doubled in hydrogen atmospheres compared to air."}

At the last , the Liberal National Party, Queensland's dominant conservative party, won this seat by over 70% of the , and since the seat's creation in 1984, it has been held by conservative political parties. \n\nSome political analysts considered this a foregone conclusion, with analyst Kevin Bonham having declared it on his blog as \"Australia's most boring by-election\", however Bonham noted the size of the swing may have been indicative of the dominant centre left 's general performance in Queensland. There was a 4.2% swing against the Labor Party in the state of Queensland at the previous federal election.\n\nWikinews spoke to one of the four candidates running in the by-election, Craig Farquharson, who is running for the .  Liberal Democrats describes itself as standing for \"individual liberty, free markets and small government\". The party has two elected officials, who sit in the . Farquharson is a former military contractor and owns the King Vapealot vape store in Toowoomba.\n\n: Why are you running to be Groom's local MP?  \n\nCraig Farquharson: What prompted me to run as a candidate in Groom is, because as a small business owner, I could not get my elected MP to talk to me or even to call me back.\n\nI became \"\" with elected representatives who are inaccessible to their electorate, and resolved to do something about it. I have pledged that if elected I will be as accessible as possible to voters in my electorate. \n\nAfter 36 years of being a safe  seat, the electorate is ready for change, and wants the additional attention that a more marginal electorate gets, or alternately another party to represent them.\n\nAs a Liberal Democrat, I guarantee I can get more attention for the voters of the Groom electorate, and a better deal from government.\n\nBeing accessible and listening to voters would be step 1 in promoting a better deal for Groom.\n\n: The Liberal Democrats are a party of small government and cutting \"\" – what's one particular law you think needs revising?  \n\nCraig Farquharson: Liberal Democrats would like to see subsidies dropped and for all technologies to compete on an equal basis to keep electricity prices and the costs of living as low as competition between companies and technologies can get them.\n\nBut one of the big issues for Groom is actually \"\" rather than \"red tape\". It is essential for jobs in the region for  to receive environmental approvals to extend the mine. This is both a Federal and a State issue.\n\nWhile Australia can switch to alternative technologies to generate power and for energy, many undeveloped nations depend on cheap electricity to lift their billions out of poverty. And responding to this demand, providing a better quality of coal would not only be an environmental improvement, for humanity and for alleviation of global poverty, it is the right thing to do. And jobs would be created in the Groom electorate. I see this as a triple bottom line win for all stakeholders, enabled by a cutting \"green tape\" decision.\n\n: You own a vape store in Toowoomba. Do you think that there's reforms that need to be made in regards to e-cigarette laws and drug laws as a whole?\nCraig Farquharson: We in Liberal Democrats would like to see some of the restrictions relaxed to enable people to take personal responsibility for their own health. We do not believe recreational drug use should be criminalised — this is harmful to society and funnels money to dangerous gangs via the . We believe that drug abuse is a separate matter to use, and should be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal matter. We would like to see relaxation of the rules according to the evidence and a scientific/medical approach, rather than using heavy handed legislation and rules enforced by unfeeling bureaucrats. These are personal health problems to be addressed by individuals and their health advisers; not by the justice system or the bureaucrats.\n\n: Why did you decide to join the Liberal Democrats?\n\nCraig Farquharson: Liberal Democrats have principles similar to my own values, and similar to the values of most small business owners and with many in the electorate, who see themselves as responsible adults able to run their own lives and make most of their own decisions.\n\n: The Liberal Democrats have not ever been successful in winning a seat in the House of Representatives and have never run in the seat of Groom. What is your goal as a candidate this election?  \n\nCraig Farquharson: We shall be delighted if we make some impact on the arrogance of the major parties with our campaign. We shall be even more delighted if we are able to deliver a better deal from the Federal Government for the voters of Groom.\n\nOur aim is to restrict the two major parties to no more than the proportion of votes they each received last general election. We are happy to receive the remaining votes.\n\n: How have COVID-19 restrictions impacted your ability to campaign?  \n\nCraig Farquharson: There are very few COVID[-19] restrictions in Queensland which have had any impact on campaigning. Every business premises has a COVID plan — but that generally has not restricted either voters to participate, nor Liberal Democrats to get our message across. The border closures which are keeping family members apart, and preventing people from accssing health care, hospitals and services closest to their homes is a far greater impact on them than on us with our campaign. We empathise with those who are still impacted or restricted or who have suffered with this disease.\n\n: What's one key issue in Groom that you think needs acting on?  \n\nCraig Farquharson: Groom has not previously been a marginal electorate, so has not attracted its share of funding for infrastructure over the past 36 years with an LNP [Liberal National Party] representative. Nor have voters of Groom received the amount of attention from government they deserve. Consequently there are water, road and infrastructure problems to resolve. We aim to make Groom a marginal electorate, if we cannot win the seat outright ourselves to hold the government accountable personally. My approach is to listen to the community and to those enterprises in the electorate which employ the people of Groom; and to represent them. The principles of Liberal Democrats are the prism through which my perceptions and solutions will be based. Most of all, and the key issue in Groom, is to listen to the electorate and to represent voters to get for this community, what this community needs.\n\n__NOTOC__\n\nzh:維基新聞專訪澳洲2020年地方選舉補選候選人克雷格·法誇森", "question": "What is one of Craig Farquharson's key goals as a candidate in the Groom by-election?  \n\nA) To win the seat outright for the Liberal Democrats  \nB) To ensure the major parties receive only their share of votes from the last election  \nC) To increase the number of Liberal Democrats representatives in Queensland  \nD) To gain support for stricter drug laws"}

At the last , the Liberal National Party, Queensland's dominant conservative party, won this seat by over 70% of the , and since the seat's creation in 1984, it has been held by conservative political parties. \n\nSome political analysts considered this a foregone conclusion, with analyst Kevin Bonham having declared it on his blog as \"Australia's most boring by-election\", however Bonham noted the size of the swing may have been indicative of the dominant centre left 's general performance in Queensland. There was a 4.2% swing against the Labor Party in the state of Queensland at the previous federal election.\n\nWikinews spoke to one of the four candidates running in the by-election, Sandra Jephcott, who is running for the  party. Sustainable Australia describes itself as a \"independent community movement from the political centre\". According to the party's website, Jephcott is a  and farmer, who has completed a veterinary degree from the University of Queensland, as well as a  at  and a Master of Science at . With Wikinews, Jephcott discussed climate change, COVID-19, water security, and foreign ownership.\n\n: Why are you running to be Groom's local MP?  \n\nSandra Jephcott: I am a veterinarian and farmer and live on a 4000- property west of . I have a broad range of experiences that I can bring to the role of federal MP []. When approached by the Sustainable Australia Party to run and help to raise awareness for our party, I was very happy to contribute.\n\nI believe that the Groom by-election offers voters an opportunity to send a message to the two major parties that we're not happy with business as usual politics — including rampant  and systemic political corruption that negatively impacts on the environment.\n\n: You've said that you want to act on climate change — what would your plan be?  \n\nSandra Jephcott: There is no silver bullet to addressing climate change. Sustainable Australia Party has a  plan to act on climate change, including: \n Funding and subsidising research and development into renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives;\n Net zero or net negative Australian  by 2050 (or ideally sooner);\n Imposing a moratorium on all new coal mines in Australia such as  (and all major coal mine expansions such as )\n Imposing a  on all new , including for ;\n Phasing out  subsidies;\n Adopting a globally-consistent carbon pricing mechanism that does not unfairly penalise Australian industries;\n Promoting the environmental benefits of plant-based food;\n and Lowering population growth pressures.\n \n: What do you think needs to be done in Toowoomba to properly protect the environment and water?\n\nSandra Jephcott: Despite holding a Carnival of Flowers each year, Toowoomba came in last nationally for its resident's access to . It is therefore important that areas in and around Toowoomba — including  — are protected and where possible expanded. Housing sprawl and density is a key contributor to destroying tree canopy and green space, so stopping overdevelopment is a key priority.\n\nIn terms of water, we need to better manage Toowoomba's water security, including through lower wastage, an expansion of water tank usage and the revisiting of recycled water options. Strong action on climate change will also be vital to the long-term viability of Toowoomba's water supply.\n\n: What are your thoughts on the COVID-19 response plan federally from the ?\n\nSandra Jephcott: Overall, the Morrison Government's response has been reasonable, after initially being very reluctant to prioritise health and well-being over economic growth. Also, there were major gaps in coverage for affected workers and industries. For example, casual workers and the arts were not adequately supported throughout the pandemic.\n\n: Why did you decide to join Sustainable Australia?\n\nSandra Jephcott: I come from a science background. It was very important to me that Sustainable Australia Party is from the  with an , science-based approach to policy. For example, Sustainable Australia Party is the only party in my view with a holistic plan to address our various . It was important for me that this plan not only includes strong action on climate change but also stabilising population in Australia and globally.\n\n: Why do you think that foreign ownership of farms, housing and land is an important issue to combat?\n\nSandra Jephcott: Australia is a sovereign nation. We need to be able to both manage our natural resources sustainably and ensure that we maintain profits, jobs and taxes in Australia for the well-being of Australians. Selling off our resources undermines our capacity to achieve these very important economic, environmental and social objectives.\n\n: How have COVID-19 restrictions impacted your ability to campaign?\n\nSandra Jephcott: I've been able to comfortably work at early voting centres and do media interviews, so there has not been much restriction at all.\n\n: What's one key issue in Groom that you think needs acting on?\n\nSandra Jephcott: Sustainable Australia Party has three big priorities in this by-election: Protect our environment; Stop overdevelopment; Stop corruption. But number one is protecting our environment, including strong action on climate change. Of the four parties running — the others being ,  and  — only Sustainable Australia Party advocates for a moratorium on all new coal mines and major coal mine expansions.
