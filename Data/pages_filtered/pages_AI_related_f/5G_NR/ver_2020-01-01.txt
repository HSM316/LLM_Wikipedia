5G NR (New Radio) is a new radio access technology (RAT) developed by 3GPP for the 5G (fifth generation) mobile network. It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.

The 3GPP specification 38 series provides the technical details behind NR, the RAT beyond LTE.

Study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015, and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017. While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing, industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard, with the expectation that the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR would occur in 2019.

 Frequency bands 

5G NR uses two frequency ranges:5G/NR - FR/Operating Bandwidth
 Frequency Range 1 (FR1), including sub-6 GHz frequency bands
 Frequency Range 2 (FR2), including frequency bands in the mmWave range (24–100GHz)

 Network deployments 

Ooredoo was the first carrier to launch a commercial 5G NR network, in May 2018 in Qatar.  Other carriers around the world have been following suit.

 Development 
In 2018, 3GPP published Release 15, which includes what is described as "Phase 1" standardization for 5G NR. 3GPP is expected to publish Release 16, which includes "Phase 2" of 5G NR, by the end of 2019.Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 855 mobile chip as it readies for 5G

Deployment modes
Initial 5G NR launches will depend on existing LTE 4G infrastructure in non-standalone (NSA) mode, before maturation of the standalone (SA) mode with the 5G core network.

Non-standalone mode
The non-standalone (NSA) mode of 5G NR refers to an option of 5G NR deployment that depends on the control plane of an existing LTE network for control functions, while 5G NR is exclusively focused on the user plane. This is reported to speed up 5G adoption, however some operators and vendors have criticized prioritizing the introduction of 5G NR NSA on the grounds that it could hinder the implementation of the standalone mode of the network.

Standalone mode
Standalone (SA) mode of 5G NR refers to using 5G cells for both signalling and information transfer. It includes the new 5G Packet Core architecture instead of relying on the 4G Evolved Packet Core, to allow the deployment of 5G without the LTE network. It is expected to have lower cost, better efficiency, and to assist development of new use cases.

 Numerology (sub-carrier spacing) for New Radio 
NR supports five sub-carrier spacings:

 Sub-Carrier Spacing Slot Duration Comment Frequency Bands 15 kHz 1 millisecond same as LTE Available in FR1 30 kHz 0.5 millisecond  Available in FR1 60 kHz 0.25 millisecond Both normal Cyclic Prefix (CP) and extended CP may be used with 60 kHz sub-carrier spacing Available in both FR1 and FR2 120 kHz 0.125 millisecond This is the highest sub-carrier spacing for the path of data Available in FR2 240 kHz 0.0625 millisecond This is only possible for search and measurement purposes, using the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) Available in FR2

The length of CP is inversely proportional to the sub-carrier spacing. It is 4.7 micro-second with 15 kHz, and 4.7 / 16 = 0.29 micro-second for 240 kHz sub-carrier spacing.
