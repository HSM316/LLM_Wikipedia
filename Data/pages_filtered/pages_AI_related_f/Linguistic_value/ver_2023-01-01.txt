In artificial intelligence, operations research, and related fields, a linguistic value (for some authors linguistic variable) is a natural language term which is derived using quantitative or qualitative reasoning such as with probability and statistics or fuzzy sets and systems.Fuzzy Logic for Business and Industry Earl Cox, Charles River Media, pp188,214,302,306,352  1995 The Fuzzy Systems Handbook, Second Edition Earl Cox, Academic Press, 1999  Ch 6 Fuzzy Reasoning, ยง 1 The Role of Linguistic Variables

Example of linguistic value

For example, if a shuttle heat shield is deemed of having a linguistic value of a "very low" percentage of damage in re-entry, based upon knowledge from experts in the field, that probability would be given a value of say, 5%.  From there on out, if it were to be used in an equation, the variable of percentage of damage will be at 5% if it deemed very low percentage.
