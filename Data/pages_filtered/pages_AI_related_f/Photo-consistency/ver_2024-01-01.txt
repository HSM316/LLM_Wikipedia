In computer vision, photo-consistency determines whether a given voxel is occupied. A voxel is considered to be photo consistent when its color appears to be similar to all the cameras that can see it.Jianfeng Yin and Jeremy R. Cooperstock, A New Photo Consistency Test for Voxel Coloring, Proceedings of the Second Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRVâ€™05), IEEE Most voxel coloring or space carving techniques require using photo consistency as a check condition in Image-based modeling and rendering applications.
