Evolutionary developmental robotics (evo-devo-robo for short) refers to methodologies that systematically integrate evolutionary robotics, epigenetic robotics and morphogenetic robotics to study the evolution, physical and mental development and learning of natural intelligent systems in robotic systems. The field was formally suggested and fully discussed in a published paperY. Jin and Y. Meng, "Morphogenetic robotics: A new emerging field in developmental robotics. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Reviews and Applications, 41(2):145-160, 2011 and further discussed in a published dialogue.Y. Jin and Y. Meng. "Evolutionary Developmental Robotics: The Next Step to Go?" IEEE CIS AMD Newsletter, 8(1):13-14, 2011

The theoretical foundation of evo-devo-robo includes evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), evolutionary developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience etc. Further discussions on evolution, development and learning in robotics and design can be found in a number of papers,H.
