Microsoft HoloLens 2 is a pair of mixed reality smartglasses developed and manufactured by Microsoft. It is the successor to the pioneering Microsoft HoloLens. On February 24, 2019 the Hololens 2 enterprise edition debuted as the first variant of the device, followed by a developer edition that was announced on May 2, 2019. It was subsequently released in limited numbers on November 7, 2019. 

 History 
HoloLens 2 was announced by Alex Kipman on February 24, 2019 at MWC in Barcelona, Spain. You can see the HoloLens 2 on-stage demo from MWC 2019 here. On May 7, 2019 the HoloLens 2 was shown off again at Microsoft Build. There, it showcased an application created with Unreal Engine, which you can see here.

On August 20, 2019, at Hot Chips 31 Microsoft presented their Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) 2.0 custom design for the Hololens 2.

 7x SIMD Fixed Point (SFP) for 2D processing
 6x Floating Vector Processor (FVP) for 3D processing
 >1 TOP of programmable compute
 125Mb SRAM
 79mm2 die size and 2 Billion transistors
 TSMC 16FF+ process
 PCIe 2.0 x1 at 100 MB/s bandwidth to Snapdragon 850

On August 29, 2019, at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Microsoft's Executive Vice President, Harry Shum, revealed that HoloLens 2 will go on sale sometime in September 2019. The product started shipping on November 7, 2019.

 Improvements over the previous model 
Microsoft highlighted three main improvements made to the device: immersiveness, ergonomics and business friendliness.

HoloLens 2 has a diagonal field of view of 52 degrees, improving over the 34 degree field of view of the first edition of HoloLens, while keeping a resolution of 47 pixels per degree. 

Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) 2.0 improvements compared to the HPU 1.0:

 1.7x compute
 2x effective DRAM bandwidth
 Improved Hologram stability
 New hardware accelerated workloads such as eye tracking, fully articulated hand tracking, semantic labeling, spatial audio and JBL filter

 HoloLens 2 Emulation 
The HoloLens 2 Emulator was made available to developers on April 17, 2019.  This emulator allows developers to create applications for the HoloLens 2 before the device ships. For more technical information on the HoloLens 2 Emulator, see the Microsoft Documentation.
