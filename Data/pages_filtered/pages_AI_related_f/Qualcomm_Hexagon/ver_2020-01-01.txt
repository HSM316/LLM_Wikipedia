Hexagon (QDSP6) is the brand for a family of 32-bit multi-threaded microarchitectures implementing the same instruction set for a digital signal processor (DSP) developed by Qualcomm. According to 2012 estimation, Qualcomm shipped 1.2 billion DSP cores inside its system on a chip (SoCs) (average 2.3 DSP core per SoC) in 2011 year, and 1.5 billion cores were planned for 2012, making the QDSP6 the most shipped architecture of DSPWill Strauss, Forward Concepts. Wireless/DSP Market Bulletin: Qualcomm Leads in Global DSP Silicon Shipments  // Forward Concepts: "In calendar year 2011, Qualcomm shipped a reported 521 million MSM chip shipments and we estimate that an average of 2.3 of its DSP cores in each unit resulted in 1.2 billion DSPs shipped in silicon.  This (calendar) year, we estimate that the company will ship an average of 2.4 DSP cores with each (more complex) MSM chip." (CEVA had around 1 billion of DSP cores shipped in 2011 with 90% of IP-licenseable DSP market; ; Ceva grabs 90% of DSP IP market, 2012).

The Hexagon architecture is designed to deliver performance with low power over a variety of applications.  It has features such as hardware assisted  multithreading, privilege levels, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW), Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD),Hexagon v2 Programmers Reference and instructions geared toward efficient signal processing. The CPU is capable of in-order dispatching up to 4 instructions (the packet) to 4 Execution Units every clock.Porting LLVM to a Next Generation DSP, L.

At Hot Chips 2013 Qualcomm announced details of their Hexagon 680 DSP. Qualcomm announced Hexagon Vector Extensions (HVX). HVX is designed to allow significant compute workloads for advanced imaging and computer vision to be processed on the DSP instead of the CPU. In March 2015 Qualcomm announced their Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK which allow AI acceleration using the CPU, GPU and Hexagon DSP.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 contains their 4th generation on-device AI engine, which includes the Hexagon 690 DSP and Hexagon Tensor Accelerator (HTA) for AI acceleration.

 Software support 
 Operating systems 
The port of Linux for Hexagon runs under a hypervisor layer ("Hexagon Virtual Machine"https://developer.qualcomm.com/download/80-nb419-3ahexagonvirtualmachinespec.pdf (restricted access)) and was merged with the 3.2 release of the kernel.Linux Kernel 3.2 Release Notes "1.4. New architecture: Hexagon" The original hypervisor is closed-source, and in April 2013 a minimal open-source hypervisor implementation for QDSP6 V2 and V3, the "Hexagon MiniVM" was released by Qualcomm under a BSD-style license.Richard Kuo, Hexagon MiniVM // linux.ports.hexagon, 25 Apr 2013Hexagon MiniVM // CodeAurora (Qualcomm)

 Compilers 
Support for Hexagon was added in 3.1 release of LLVM by Tony Linthicum. Hexagon/HVX V66 ISA support was added in 8.0.0 release of LLVM. There is also a non-FSF maintained branch of GCC and binutils.

 Adoption of the SIP block 
Qualcomm Hexagon DSPs have been available in Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC since 2006.Qualcomm Announces Its 2012 Superchip: 28nm Snapdragon S4, 10/12/2011 by John Oram. Quote: "Hexagon DSPs have been in Snapdragon chips since 2006."QDSP6 V4: Qualcomm Gives Customers and Developers Programming Access to its DSP Core // InsideDSP, June 22, 2012 In Snapdragon S4 (MSM8960 and newer) there are three QDSP cores, two in  the Modem subsystem and one Hexagon core in the Multimedia subsystem. Modem cores are programmed by Qualcomm only, and only Multimedia core is allowed to be programmed by user.

They are also used in some femtocell processors of Qualcomm, including FSM98xx, FSM99xx and FSM90xx.Qualcomm Aims Hexagon at Femtocells,  October 31, 2011. Linley Gwennap// Linley WIRE

Third party integration
In March 2016, it was announced that semiconductor company Conexant's AudioSmart audio processing software was being integrated into Qualcomm's Hexagon.

 Versions 
There are six versions of QDSP6 architecture released: V1 (2006), V2 (2007–2008), V3 (2009), V4 (2010–2011), QDSP6 V5 (2013, in Snapdragon 800Qualcomm Announces Next Generation Snapdragon Premium Mobile Processors // Qualcomm, January 07, 2013); and QDSP6 V6 (2016, in Snapdragon 820). V4 has 20 DMIPS per milliwatt, operating at 500 MHz.
Clock speed of Hexagon varies in 400–2000 MHz for QDSP6 and in 256–350 MHz for previous generation of the architecture, the QDSP5.

Code sample
This is a single instruction packet from the inner loop of a FFT:
{ R17:16 = MEMD(R0++M1)
  MEMD(R6++M1) = R25:24
  R20 = CMPY(R20, R8):<<1:rnd:sat
  R11:10 = VADDH(R11:10, R13:12)
}:endloop0

This packet is claimed by Qualcomm to be equal to 29 classic RISC operations; it includes vector add (4x 16-bit), complex multiply operation and hardware loop support. All instructions of the packet are done in the same cycle.
