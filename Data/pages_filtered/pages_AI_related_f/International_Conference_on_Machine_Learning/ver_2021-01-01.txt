The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the leading international academic conference in machine learning. Along with NeurIPS and ICLR, it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research. It is supported by the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS). Precise dates vary from year to year, but paper submissions are generally due at the end of January, and the conference is generally held during the following July. The first ICML was held 1980 in Pittsburgh.http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~icml2009/past.html
