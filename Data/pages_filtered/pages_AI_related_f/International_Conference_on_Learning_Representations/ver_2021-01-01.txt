The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)  is a machine learning conference held every spring. The conference includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers. Since its inception in 2013, ICLR has employed an open peer review process to referee paper submissions (based on models proposed by Yann LeCun). In 2019, there were 1591 paper submissions, of which 500 accepted with poster presentations (31%) and 24 with oral presentations (1.5%). Along with ICML and NeurIPS it's one of the three major machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences, and has the highest impact of the three.
