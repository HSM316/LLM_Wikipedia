Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a free open-source software project specific for data stream mining with concept drift. It is written in Java and developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

Description

MOA is an open-source framework software that allows to build and run experiments
of machine learning or data mining on evolving data streams. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that can be used from the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the command-line, and the Java API.
MOA contains several collections of machine learning algorithms:

 Classification
 Bayesian classifiers
 Naive Bayes
 Naive Bayes Multinomial
 Decision trees classifiers
 Decision Stump
 Hoeffding Tree
 Hoeffding Option Tree
 Hoeffding Adaptive Tree
 Meta classifiers
 Bagging
 Boosting
 Bagging using ADWIN
 Bagging using Adaptive-Size Hoeffding Trees.
 Perceptron Stacking of Restricted Hoeffding Trees
 Leveraging Bagging
 Online Accuracy Updated Ensemble
 Function classifiers

These algorithms are designed for large scale machine learning, dealing with concept drift, and big data streams in real time.

MOA supports bi-directional interaction with Weka (machine learning). MOA is free software released under the GNU GPL.
