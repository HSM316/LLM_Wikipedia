Fake nude photography refers to nude photographs created to appear as actual nudes of an individual. Several reasons for the creation of these doctored photographs include sexual gratification, stigmatization or embarrassment of the subject, or for commercial gain, such as by selling the photographs on pornography websites. Fakes can be created using image editing software or through machine learning (fake pornographic images created this way are referred to as deepfakes).

Many websites host fake nude and pornographic photos of celebrities, which are sometimes referred to as celebrity fakes. Magazines such as Celebrity Skin, which published paparazzi shots and illicitly obtained nude photos, have been cited as precursors to this phenomenon. In the 1990s and 2000s, fake nude images of celebrities proliferated on Usenet and other websites, leading to campaigns to take legal action against the creators of the images and websites dedicated to determining the veracity of nude photos. "Deepfakes", which use artificial neural networks to superimpose a person's face into a pornographic image or video, were popularized in the late 2010s, leading to concerns about the technology's use in fake news and revenge porn.

Purposes

The reasons for the creation of nude photos may range from a need to discredit the target publicly, personal hatred for the target, or the promise of pecuniary gains for such work on the part of the creator of such photos.

Fake nude photos often target prominent figures such as businesspeople or politicians. This is the case for candidate for Rwanda's presidential election in 2017, Diane Rwigara.

Methods
Fake nude images can be created using image editing software or neural network applications.
There are two basic alternative methods::
 Combine and superimpose existing images onto source images, adding the face of the subject onto a nude model.
 Remove clothes from the source image to make it look like a nude photo.

Impact

Images of this type may have a negative psychological impact on the victims and may be used for extortion purposes.
