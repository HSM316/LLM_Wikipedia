 History 
The co-founders met at Facebook, where Moskovitz, Facebook's co-founder and vice president of engineering, and his colleague Rosenstein created a productivity tool called Tasks.

In April 2012, Asana released its API to third-party developers. Asana's open API provided a means to read and input information and create programmed automation within the app. 

In 2014, Asana launched its native iOS app and in January 2015, Asana released its native Android app. In 2016, Asana raised $50 million in Series C financing led by Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator. In 2017, Asana integrated with Gmail, and launched its app in French and German.

By January 2018, more than 35,000 paying customers were using Asana, including CityFibre, AB-InBev, Viessmann, eBay, Uber, Overstock.com, Navy Federal Credit Union, Icelandair, and IBM.
