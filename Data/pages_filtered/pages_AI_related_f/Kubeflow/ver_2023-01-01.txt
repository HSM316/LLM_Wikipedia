Kubeflow is a free and open-source platform for machine learning on Kubernetes. The Kubeflow project has multiple distinct software components which each address specific stages of the machine learning lifecycle, including model development (Kubeflow Notebooks), model training (Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubeflow Training Operator), model serving (KServe), and automated machine learning (Katib).

Each component of Kubeflow can be deployed separately, and it is not a requirement to deploy every component.

 History 

The Kubeflow project was first announced at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017 by Google engineers David Aronchick, Jeremy Lewi, and Vishnu Kannan to address a perceived lack of flexible options for building production-ready machine learning systems. The project has also stated it began as a way for Google to open-source how they ran TensorFlow internally.

The first release of Kubeflow (Kubeflow 0.1) was announced at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018 with claims of having already become among the top 2% of GitHub projects ever. Kubeflow 1.0 was released in March 2020 via a public blog post announcing that many Kubeflow components were graduating to a "stable status", indicating they were now ready for production usage.

 Components 

 Kubeflow Notebooks 

The Kubeflow Notebooks component provides a way to run web-based development environments inside a Kubernetes cluster, with native support for Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and RStudio.

 Kubeflow Pipelines 

The Kubeflow Pipelines component provides a platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning workflows based on Docker containers. Google Cloud Platform has adopted the Kubeflow Pipelines DSL within its Vertex AI Pipelines product.

 Kubeflow Training Operator 

The Kubeflow Training Operator component provides Kubernetes custom resources that make it easy to run distributed or non-distributed TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, XGBoost, and MPI training jobs on Kubernetes.

 KServe 

The KServe component (previously named KFServing) provides Kubernetes custom resources for serving machine learning models on arbitrary frameworks including TensorFlow, XGBoost, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and ONNX. KServe was developed collaboratively by Google, IBM, Bloomberg, NVIDIA, and Seldon. Publicly disclosed adopters of KServe include Bloomberg, Gojek, and others

 Katib 

The Katib component is described as a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning with support for hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, and neural architecture search.
