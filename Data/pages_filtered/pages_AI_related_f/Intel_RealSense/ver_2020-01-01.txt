Intel RealSense Technology is a suite of depth and tracking technologies designed to give machines and devices depth perceptions capabilities that will enable them to “see” and understand the world.  There are many uses for these computer vision capabilities including autonomous drones, robots, AR/VR, smart home devices amongst many others broad market products.  RealSense technology is made of Vision Processors, Depth and Tracking Modules, and Depth Cameras, supported by an open source, cross-platform SDK called librealsense that simplifies supporting cameras for third party software developers, system integrators, ODMs and OEMs.

As of January 2018, new Intel RealSense D400 Product Family was launched with the Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4, Intel RealSense Depth Module D400 Series, and 2 ready to use depth cameras:  Intel RealSense Depth Cameras D435 and D415.

Previous generations of Intel RealSense depth cameras (F200, R200 and SR300) were implemented in multiple laptop and tablet computers by  Asus, HP, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. Additionally, Razer and Creative offered consumer ready standalone webcams with the Intel RealSense camera built into the design.: Razer Stargazer and the Creative BlasterX Senz3D.http://www.pcgamesn.com/creative/creative-senz3d-razer-stargazer

 Intel RealSense Depth Camera D400 Series 
Intel launched 2 new depth cameras in January 2018: D415 and D435.   Both cameras feature the RealSense Vision processor D4 and camera sensors.  They are supported by the cross-platform and open source Intel RealSense SDK 2.0 or librealsense on GitHub.

 Intel RealSense Depth Camera D415 
The Intel RealSense Depth Camera D415 includes the Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4 featuring high depth resolution - up to 1280x720 at 30 frames per second (fps), long-range capabilities, rolling shutter technology and a narrow field of view ideal for precise measurements.  It is designed for easy setup with USB 3.0 and is in a sleek form factor for portability.  With the rolling image shutter and narrow field of view, the Intel RealSense Depth Camera D415 offers high-depth resolution when the object size is small and more precise measurements are required.  The D415 Camera is for sale now at several distributors.

 Previous Generations 

Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front F200)
This is a stand-alone camera that can be attached to a desktop or laptop computer. It is intended to be used for natural gesture-based interaction, face recognition, immersive, video conferencing and collaboration, gaming and learning and 3D scanning.

There is a version of this camera to be embedded into laptop computers.

Specifications

 Full VGA depth resolution
 1080p RGB camera
 0.2–1.2 meter range (Specific algorithms may have different range and accuracy)
 USB 3.0 interface

Intel RealSense Snapshot
Snapshot is a camera intended to be built into tablet computers and possibly smartphones. Its intended uses include taking photographs and performing after the fact refocusing, distance measurements, and applying motion photo filters.

The refocus feature differs from a plenoptic camera in that RealSense Snapshot takes pictures with large depth of field so that initially the whole picture is in focus and then in software it selectively blurs parts of the image depending on their distance.

Dell Venue 8 7000 Series Android tablet is equipped with this camera.

Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Rear R200)
Rear-mounted camera for Microsoft Surface or a similar tablet, like the HP Spectre X2. This camera is intended for augmented reality applications, content creation, and object scanning. Its depth accuracy is on the order of millimeters and its range is up to 6.0 meters. This makes it the more accurate and longer range of the Intel RealSense 3D cameras. Also unlike the F200 and SR300, the R200 is a stereo camera and is able to obtain accurate depth outdoors as well as indoors.

Intel RealSense Camera LR200

Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front SR300)
The SR300 camera is the next generation of the Front F200 camera. It improves in various respects over its predecessor, notably with

 60% improved range
 >5X reduction in standby power
 2X improvement in gesture speed (up to 2 m/s)
 >8X improvement in depth/RGB latency

App Challenge
To address the lack of applications built on the RealSense platform and to promote the platform among software developers, in 2014 Intel organized the Intel RealSense App Challenge. The winners were awarded large sums of money.

 Software Developer Kit:  Librealsense 
Intel launched their open source cross platform software developer kit with the Intel RealSense depth cameras D435 and D415.  It is available on GitHub.

The SDK (librealsense) allows depth and color streaming, and provides intrinsic and extrinsic calibration information. The library also offers synthetic streams (pointcloud, depth aligned to color and vice versa), and a built-in support for record and playback of streaming sessions.

Key Features of the SDK (librealsense): 
WhatDescriptionIntel® RealSense™ ViewerWith this application, you can quickly access your Intel® RealSense™  Depth Camera to view the depth stream, visualize point clouds, record and  playback streams, configure your camera settings, modify advanced controls,  enable depth visualization and post processing and much more.Depth Quality ToolThis application allows you to test the camera’s depth quality,  including: standard deviation from plane fit, normalized RMS – the subpixel  accuracy, distance accuracy and fill rate. You should be able to easily get  and interpret several of the depth quality metrics and record and save the  data for offline analysis.Other Debug ToolsDevice enumeration, FW logger, etc. as can be seen at the tools  directoryCode Samples to Start  Prototyping QuicklyThese simple examples demonstrate how to easily use the SDK to include  code snippets that access the camera into your applications. Check some of  the C++ examples including capture, pointcloud and more and basic C examplesWrappersPython, .NET, Node.js API, as well as integration with the following 3rd-party  technologies: ROS, LabVIEW, OpenCV, PCL, Unity, and more to come, including Matlab and OpenNI.

Reception
In an early preview article in 2015, PC Worlds Mark Hachman concluded that RealSense is an enabling technology that will be largely defined by the software that will take advantage of its features. He noted that as of the time the article was written, the technology was new and there was no such software.
