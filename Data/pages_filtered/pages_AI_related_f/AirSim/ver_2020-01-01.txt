AirSim (Aerial Informatics and Robotics Simulation) is an open-source, cross platform simulator for drones, ground vehicles such as cars and various other objects, built on Epic Games’ Unreal Engine 4 as a platform for AI research.Microsoft AI simulator includes autonomous car research It is developed by Microsoft and can be used to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles.https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/README.mdMicrosoft AirSim, a Simulator for Drones and Robots This allows testing of autonomous solutions without worrying about real-world damage.

AirSim provides some 12 kilometers of roads with 20 city blocks and APIs to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way. The APIs are accessible via a variety of programming languages, including C++, C#, Python and Java. AirSim supports hardware-in-the-loop with driving wheels and flight controllers such as PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. The platform also supports common robotic platforms, such as Robot Operating System (ROS). It is developed as an Unreal plug-in that can be dropped into any Unreal environment. An experimental release for a Unity plug-in is also available.AirSim on Unity: Experiment with autonomous vehicle simulation – Unity BlogMicrosoft's open source AirSim platform comes to Unity | VentureBeat
