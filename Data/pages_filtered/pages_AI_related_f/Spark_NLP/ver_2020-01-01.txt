Spark NLP is an open-source text processing library for advanced natural language processing for the Python, Java and Scala programming languages. The library is built on top of Apache Spark and its Spark ML library for speed and scalability  and on top of TensorFlow for deep learning training & inference functionality. Its goal is to provide an API for natural language processing annotations allowing a scalable approach within a distributed large scale environment. The library offers pre-trained neural network models, pipelines, and embeddings , as well as support for training custom models.

Spark NLP is geared towards production use in software systems that outgrow older libraries such as spaCy, nltk, and CoreNLP . As of February 2019, the library is in use by 16% of enterprise companies and the most widely used NLP library by such companies . On March 28th, 2019, Spark NLP was named a winner of the Strata Data Award in the open source category “for providing state-of-the-art natural language processing in Python, Java & Scala” .

 Main features 

The library’s design uses the concept of a pipeline: an ordered set of text annotators . Out of the box annotators include:

 Tokenizer: Word tokens
 Normalizer: Text cleaning
Stemmer: Hard stems
 Lemmatizer: Lemmas
 RegexMatcher: Rule matching
 TextMatcher: Phrase matching
 Chunker: Meaningful phrase matching
 DateMatcher: Date-time parsing
 SentenceDetector: Sentence Boundary Detector
 DeepSentenceDetector: Sentence Boundary Detector with Machine Learning
 POSTagger: Part of speech tagger
 ViveknSentimentDetector: Sentiment analysis
 SentimentDetector: Sentiment analysis
 Named Entity Recognition CRF annotator
 Named Entity Recognition Deep Learning annotator
 SpellChecker: Norvig algorithm
 SpellChecker: Symmetric delete
 Dependency Parser: Unlabeled grammatical relation
 Typed Dependency Parser: Labeled grammatical relation

 Spark NLP for Healthcare 
Spark NLP for Healthcare is a commercial extension of Spark NLP for biomedical text mining . It provides healthcare-specific annotators, pipelines, models, and embeddings for:

 Biomedical named entity recognition
 Entity normalization
 Assertion Status Detection
 De-identification
 Part-of-Speech tagging
 Spell checking & correction
 Object character recognition (OCR)
