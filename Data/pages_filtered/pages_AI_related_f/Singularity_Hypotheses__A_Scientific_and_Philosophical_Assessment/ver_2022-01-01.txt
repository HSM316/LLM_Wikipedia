Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment is a 2013 book written by Amnon H. Eden, James H. Moor, Johnny H. Soraker, and Eric Steinhart. It focuses on conjectures about the intelligence explosion, transhumanism, and whole brain emulation.

The book develops the theory that humans will one day make an intelligent agent that will enter a runaway reaction of self-improvement cycles, with each new version appearing more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in an intelligence that will far surpass us.
