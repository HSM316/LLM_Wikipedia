MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton) was an early prototype of Speech Synthesis machine started in 1975.

 Description 
It consisted of a stand-alone computer hardware and a specialized software that implemented a diphone-synthesis technology. It was one of the first real-time TTS systems. It was able to read Italian in intellegibile robotic voice and also to sing managing up to 8 synthesis channels in parallel thanks to Linear predictive coding technology.Luciano Nebbia, Paolo Lucchini, Eight-channel digital speech synthesizer based on LPC techniques.
