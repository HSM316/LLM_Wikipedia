Piranha is a text mining system. It was developed for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The software processes free-text documents and shows relationships amongst them, a technique valuable across numerous data domains, from health care fraud to national security. The results are presented in clusters of prioritized relevance. Piranha uses the term frequency/inverse corpus frequency term weighting method which provides strong parallel processing of textual information, thus the ability to analyze large document sets.

Piranha has six main elements: 

 Collecting and Extracting: Millions of documents from sources such as databases and social media can be collected and text extracted from hundreds of file formats; This information can be translated to other languages.
 Storing and indexing: Documents in search servers, relational databases, etc. can be stored and indexed.
 Recommending: The system can highlight the most valuable information for specific users.
 Categorizing: Grouping items via supervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods and targeted search lists.
 Clustering: Similarity is used to group documents hierarchically.
 Visualizing: Showing relationships among documents so that users can quickly recognize connections.
