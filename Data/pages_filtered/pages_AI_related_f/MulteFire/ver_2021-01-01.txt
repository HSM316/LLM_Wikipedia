MulteFire is an LTE-based technology that operates standalone in unlicensed and shared spectrum, including the global 5 GHz band. Based on 3GPP Release 13 and 14, MulteFire technology supports Listen-Before-Talk for fair co-existence with Wi-Fi and other technologies operating in the same spectrum. It supports private LTE and neutral host deployment models. Target vertical markets include industrial IoT, enterprise, cable, and various other vertical markets.

The MulteFire Release 1.0 specification was developed by the MulteFire Alliance, an independent, diverse and international member-driven consortium. Release 1.0 was published to MulteFire Alliance members in January 2017 and was made publicly available in April 2017. The MulteFire Alliance is currently working on Release 1.1 which will add further optimizations for IoT and new spectrum bands.

According to Harbor Research in its published white paper, the market opportunity for private LTE networks for industrial and commercial IoT will reach $118.5 billion in 2023. It also reported that the total addressable revenue for Enterprise markets deploying private and neutral host LTE with MulteFire will reach $5.7 billion by 2025.

The MulteFire Alliance has grown to more than 40 members. Its board members include Boingo Wireless, CableLabs, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm and SoftBank. The organization is open to any company with an interest in advancing LTE and cellular technology in unlicensed and shared spectrum.
