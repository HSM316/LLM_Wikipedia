Collective motion is defined as the spontaneous emergence of ordered movement in a system consisting of many self-propelled agents. It can be observed in everyday life, for example in flocks of birds, schools of fish, herds of animals and also in crowds and car traffic. It also appears at the microscopic level: in colonies of bacteria, motility assays and artificial self-propelled particles.Palacci, Jeremie; Sacanna, Stefano; Steinberg, Asher Preska; Pine, David J.; Chaikin, Paul M.

One of the most famous models that describes such behavior is the Vicsek model introduced by Tamás Vicsek et al. in 1995.Vicsek, T.; Czirok, A.; Ben-Jacob, E.; Cohen, I.; Shochet, O. (1995).

Collective behavior of Self-propelled particles

Just like biological systems in nature, self-propelled particles also respond to external gradients and show collective behavior. Micromotors or nanomotors can interact with self-generated gradients and exhibit schooling and exclusion behavior.Wang, W., Duan, W., Ahmed, S., Mallouk, T., & Sen, A. (2013). Small power: Autonomous nano- and micromotors propelled by self-generated gradients. NanoToday, 8(5), 531. For example, Ibele, et al. demonstrated that silver chloride micromotors, in the presence of UV light, interact with each other at high concentrations and form schools.Ibele, M., Mallouk, T., & Sen, A. (2009). Schooling behavior of light-powered autonomous micromotors in water. Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 48(18), 3308. Similar behavior can also be observed with titanium dioxide microparticles.Hong, Y., Diaz, M., Córdova‐Figueroa, U., & Sen, A. (2010). Light‐Driven Titanium‐Dioxide‐Based Reversible Microfireworks and Micromotor/Micropump Systems. Advanced Functional Materials, 20(10), 1568. Silver orthophosphate microparticles exhibit transitions between schooling and exclusion behaviors in response to ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and UV light.Duan, W., Liu, R., & Sen, A. (2013). Transition between collective behaviors of micromotors in response to different stimuli. Journal of American Chemical Society, 135, 1280.Altemose, A., Sánchez-Farrán, M. A., Duan, W., Schulz, S., Borhan, A., Crespi, V. H., & Sen, A. (2017). Chemically-controlled spatiotemporal oscillations of colloidal assemblies. Angewandte Chemie International Edition. . This behavior can be used to design a NOR gate since different combinations of the two different stimuli (ammonia and UV light) generate different outputs. Oscillations between schooling and exclusion behaviors are also tunable via changes in hydrogen peroxide concentration.

Micromotors and nanomotors can also move preferentially in the direction of externally applied chemical gradients, a phenomenon defined as chemotaxis. Chemotaxis has been observed in self-propelled Au-Pt nanorods, which diffuse towards the source of hydrogen peroxide, when placed in a gradient of the chemical.Hong, Y., Blackmann, NMK., Kopp, ND., Sen, A., & Velegol, D. (2007). Chemotaxis of nonbiological colloidal rods. Physical Review Letters, 99, 178103. Silica microparticles with Grubbs catalyst tethered to them, also move towards higher monomer concentrations.Ravlick, RA., Sengupta, S., McFadden, T., Zhang, H., & Sen, A. (2011). A Polymerization-Powered Motor. Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 50(40), 9374. Enzymes also behave as nanomotors and migrate towards regions of higher substrate concentration, which is known as enzyme chemotaxis.Sengupta, S., Dey, KK., Muddana, HS., Tabouillot, T., Ibele, M., Butler, PJ., & Sen, A. (2013). Enzyme Molecules as Nanomotors. Journal of American Chemical Society, 135(4), 1406. One interesting use of enzyme nanomotor chemotaxis is the separation of active and inactive enzymes in microfluidic channels. Another is the exploration of metabolon formation by studying the coordinated movement of the first four enzymes of the glycolysis cascade: hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase. More recently, enzyme-coated particles have shown similar behavior in gradients of reactants in microfluidic channels. In general, chemotaxis of biological and synthesized self-propelled particles provides a way of directing motion at the microscale and can be used for drug delivery, sensing, lab-on-a-chip devices and other applications.
