A semantic similarity network (SSN) is a special form of semantic network.R. H. Richens: "General program for mechanical translation between any two languages via an algebraic interlingua". Cambridge Language Research Unit. Mechanical Translation, November 1956; p. 37 designed to represent concepts and their semantic similarity. Its main contribution is reducing the complexity of calculating semantic distances. Bendeck (2004, 2008) introduced the concept of semantic similarity networks (SSN) as the specialization of a semantic network to measure semantic similarity from ontological representations.Fawsy Bendeck, Three Fold "Ontology + Model + Instance (OMI) - Semantic Unification Process, In International Conference on Advances in Internet, Processing, System and Interdisciplinary Research (IPSI-2004), Stockholm, Sep 2004, . Implementations include genetic information handling.

The concept is formally defined (Bendeck 2008) as a directed graph, with concepts represented as nodes and semantic similarity relations as edges. The relationships are grouped into relation types. The concepts and relations contain attribute values to evaluate the semantic similarityP. Resnik. Using Information Content to Evaluate Semantic Similarity in a Taxonomy. Proc. the 14th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 448â€“453, 1995. between concepts. The semantic similarity relationships of the SSN represent several of the general relationship types of the standard Semantic network, reducing the complexity of the (normally, very large) network for calculations of semantics. SSNs define relation types as templates (and taxonomy of relations) for semantic similarity attributes that are common to relations of the same type. SSN representation allows propagation algorithms to faster calculate semantic similarities, including stop conditions within a specified threshold. This reduces the computation time and power required for calculation.
