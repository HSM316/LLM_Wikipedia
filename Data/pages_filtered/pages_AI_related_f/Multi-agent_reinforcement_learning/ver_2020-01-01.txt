Multi-agent learning is the use of machine learning in a multi-agent system. Typically, agents improve their decisions via experience. In particular, an agent has to learn how to coordinate with the other agents.

 Overview 
According to Shoham et al., it is difficult to pinpoint all relevant articles in the domain. There are some inherent difficulties about multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The environment is not stationnary anymore, thus the Markov property is violated: transitions and rewards does not only depend on the current state of an agent.
