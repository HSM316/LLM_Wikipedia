Artificial intuition is a theoretical capacity of an artificial software to function similarly to human consciousness, specifically in the capacity of human consciousness known as intuition.

Intuition is the function of the mind, the experience of which, is described as knowledge based on "a hunch", resulting (as the word itself does) from "contemplation" or "insight".Eugene Sadler-Smith - Inside Intuition - p.3 Routledge, 6 Aug 2012  Accessed 17 September 2018etymonline Accessed 17 September 2018

Psychologist Jean Piaget showed that intuitive functioning within the normally developing human child at the Intuitive Thought Substage  of the preoperational stage occurred at from four to seven years of age.Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour, Richard Gross    see: Jean PiagetSantrock, John W. (2004). Life-Span Development (9th Ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College - Chapter 8  from Piaget's theory of cognitive development In Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity, the concept of "intuitive intelligence" is described as something like a capacity that transcends ordinary-level functioning to a point where information is understood with a greater depth than is available in more simple rationally-thinking entities.worldcat retrieved 11:03(GMT) 26.10.201 Farlex retrieved 11:08(GMT) 26.10.2011Jung, C.G.

Artificial intuition is theoretically (or otherwise) a sophisticated function of an artifice that is able to interpret data with depth and locate hidden factors functioning in  Gestalt psychology,Herbert Simon.

To create artificial intuition supposes the possibility of the re-creation of a higher functioning of the human mind, with capabilities such as what might be found in semantic memory and learning.Fuzzy Information and Engineering Volume 1 Chapter titled Crime pattern study and fuzzy Information Analysis (Springer, 2008) By Bing-Yuan Cao 19:17(GMT) 25.10.2011  see also:Fuzzy logicMonica Anderson (research company website)  retrieved 12:23(GMT) 26.10.2011website by Gunther Sonnenfeld  retrieved 19:36(GMT) 25.10.2011 The transferral of the functioning of a biological system to synthetic functioning is based upon modeling of functioning from knowledge of cognition and  the brain,sulcus.berkeley.edu  retrieved 20:57(GMT) 25.10.2011ITP  retrieved 20:52(GMT) 25.10.2011 for instance as applications of models of artificial neural networks from the research done within the discipline of computational neuroscience.Schwartz, Eric (1990).

Application software contributing to its development
The notion of a process of a data-interpretative synthesis has already been found in a computational-linguistic software application that has been created for use in an internal security context.Video lecturer: Shmuel Bar, CEO and Founder (secondary source) retrieved 19:26(GMT) 25.10.2011"Artificial Intuition" Technology for Security and Defense Applications, Israel Uploaded by TAUVOD on 25 Sep 2011  (secondary source) retrieved  19:30(GMT)  25.10.2011  The software integrates computed data based specifically on objectives  incorporating a paradigm described as "religious intuitive" Roland Faber :  Professor of Systematic Theology at the University of Vienna,  from Process Studies, pp.195-211, Vol. 28, Number 3-4, Fall-Winter, 1999 (secondary source) (in situ) 12:21(UTC)27.10.2011 (hermeneutic,  27.10.2011  see also: Martin Heidegger and Richard Polt  Ramberg, Bjørn and Gjesdal, Kristin, "Hermeneutics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N.

In fiction
Artificial intelligence in fiction often crosses the line to apparent artificial intuition, although it can't be shown if the intent of the fiction creator was to show a simulation of intuition or that real artificial intuition is part of the story's AI, because this depends on the internal structure of the programming of the AI, which is not usually shown in stories.

 The Terminator, (James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, William Wisher, Jr.) – in The Terminator, it's unclear whether the machines had a form of intuition or that all their processes were programmed.  
 Star trek, (written by Gene Roddenberry)– Data is a humanoid who shows artificial intelligence, but it can't be shown he is showing artificial intuition, since his programming is not disclosed. Abstract of a paper written by Mark Zilbermann retrieved 19:45(GMT) 25.10.2011 see also:  algorithms
