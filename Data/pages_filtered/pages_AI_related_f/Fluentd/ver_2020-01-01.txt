Fluentd is a cross platform open-source data collection software project originally developed at Treasure Data. It is written primarily in the Ruby programming language.

 Overview 
Fluentd is a Big Data tool for semi- or un-structured data sets. Like Apache Kafka, it analyzes event logs, application logs, and clickstreams.Pasupuleti, Pradeep and Purra, Beulah Salome (2015). Data Lake Development with Big Data. pp. 44–45; 48. Packt.  According to Suonsyrjä and Mikkonen, the "core idea of Fluentd is to be the unifying layer between different types of log inputs and outputs.",Suonsyrjä, Sampo and Mikkonen, Tommi "Designing an Unobtrusive Analytics Framework for Monitoring Java Applications", pp. 170–173 in Software Measurement.

 Users 

Fluentd was one of the data collection tools recommended by Amazon Web Services in 2013, when it was said to be similar to Apache Flume or Scribe. Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery recommends Fluentd as default real-time data-ingestion tool, and uses Google's customized version of Fluentd, called google-fluentd, as a default logging agent.Google Cloud Platform (2016).
