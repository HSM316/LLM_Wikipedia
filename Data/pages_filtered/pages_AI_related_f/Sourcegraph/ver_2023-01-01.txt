 

Sourcegraph, Inc. is a software company headquartered in San Francisco. Sourcegraph’s eponymous code search and code intelligence tool semantically indexes and analyzes large codebases so that developers can find, navigate, and understand code across commercial, open-source, local, and cloud-based repositories. Sourcegraph supports all major programming languages.

 History 
Stanford graduates Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu founded Sourcegraph in San Francisco, California, in 2013.

Partly inspired by Liu’s experience using Google Code Search while he was a Google intern, Sourcegraph was developed to “tackle the big code problem” by enabling developers to manage large codebases that span multiple repositories, programming languages, file formats, and projects. The platform can be used to search and analyze all of an organization’s code.

To begin with, Sourcegraph customers self-hosted the platform on their own infrastructure. Early customers included Uber, Dropbox, and Lyft.

Prior to 2016, Sourcegraph began indexing “hundreds of thousands” open-source repositories, reporting in 2021 that they had indexed over 1,000,000.

In 2016, Sourcegraph collaborated with technology licensing lawyer Heather Meeker to develop the Fair Source License, announcing in May 2016 that “all of Sourcegraph’s source code is publicly available and hackable, under the Fair Source License.” The license aimed to “help open sourcers strike a balance between getting paid and preserving their values,” but came under fire for undermining open-source licensing. 

In 2018, Sourcegraph became an open-source project under the Apache License 2.0. Sourcegraph has since released Sourcegraph OSS under the Apache License 2.0 and Sourcegraph Enterprise under its own license. 

In 2019, Sourcegraph integrated into the GitLab codebase, which gave GitLab users access to a browser-based developer platform.

As of July 2021, some of Sourcegraph’s customers include Adidas, Cloudflare, Lyft, Uber, Yelp, Plaid, GE, Atlassian, Amazon, PayPal, Qualtrics, and Cloudflare.

Sourcegraph integrated its code search platform with cloud-based technology in August 2021, launching a browser-based portal that anyone can use to search open-source projects and personal private code for free. Sourcegraph Cloud, a single-tenant cloud solution for organizations with over 100 developers, was launched in 2022, marking a shift in the company’s business model toward a SaaS model.

In October 2022, Steve Yegge joined Sourcegraph as Head of Engineering.

 Applications 
In research, Sourcegraph has been applied to develop data mining methods for downstream dependencies and to aid in the refactoring and translation of a program into its equivalent in a different programming language.

Sourcegraph is used in the CERN Accelerator Control software community to index code, quickly search through it, and create statistics.

In cybersecurity, Sourcegraph has been used for better insights into source code during penetration tests.

 Services 
The core Sourcegraph product has two versions: 
 Sourcegraph Open Source (Sourcegraph OSS), which is free to use and only includes Sourcegraph’s universal code search functionality.
 Sourcegraph Enterprise (previously Sourcegraph Data Center), which includes the Sourcegraph code intelligence platform and has a free tier for a limited number of users.

Code can be searched and navigated from the Sourcegraph web UI or using browser and IDE extensions and text editor plugins. Sourcegraph supports over 30 programming languages and integrates with GitHub and GitLab for code hosting, Codecov for code coverage, and Jira Software for project management.

 Code Search 
Sourcegraph's "universal code search" tool is used to search, explore, and understand code. Search can be implemented across multiple repositories and code hosting platforms. Search can be literal, regular expression, or structural. Structural search syntax is language-aware and handles nested expressions and multi-line statements better than regular expressions. Sourcegraph's Code Search uses a variation of Google's PageRank algorithm to rank results by relevance.

 Code Navigation 
Sourcegraph's Code Navigation feature can be used to jump to the definition of a variable or function, or find all references to it in a codebase.

 Batch Changes 
Sourcegraph's Batch Changes feature allows developers and companies to automate and track large-scale code changes across repositories and code hosts.

 Code Insights 
Sourcegraph's Code Insights feature extracts data from a codebase to provide detailed analytics and visualizations to track the state and progress of a code project.

 Growth 
Sourcegraph has raised a total of almost $225 million in financing to date. Its most recent $125 million Series D investment in 2021 valued the company at $2.625 billion, a 300% growth from its previous valuation in 2020.
