Vectra AI, Inc. is a cybersecurity company with headquarters in San Jose, California. 

 History 

Vectra was founded in 2010 as TraceVector LLC in New York City and was incorporated in 2012 under the name Vectra Networks.

 Products 

The Cognito platform from Vectra provides continuous, automated threat surveillance to expose hidden and unknown cyberattackers that actively spread inside networks.

Threat behaviors and cyberattack techniques detected by Cognito include botnet command-and-control communications, botnet monetization, internal reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data theft, or exfiltration.

Vectra offers three applications on the Cognito platform to address use cases:
 Cognito Stream delivers enterprise-scale network metadata enriched with security insights in Zeek format to data lakes and security information and event management (SIEM) applications without the complexity, constant tuning and scale limitation of open-source Zeek. 

 Cognito Recall gives security analysts a logical starting point to perform AI-assisted threat hunting and conclusive incident investigations. 

 Cognito Detect automates the real-time detection of hidden attackers in cloud and data center workloads and user and internet-of-things devices.

Using AI for incident detection and triage in its security operations center has helped one Vectra customer – Texas A&M University System – resolve an incident in 10 to 20 minutes, rather than hours or days.

 Technology 

Vectra AI combines data science, machine learning and network behavioral analysis technologies to identify patterns that characterize malicious behavior within a network.

Cognito uses artificial intelligence, including supervised learning, unsupervised machine learning, and deep learning techniques, to detect and respond to advanced cyberattacks. Remediation actions are taken with security information and event management (SIEMs), firewalls, endpoint security enforcement, network access control, and orchestration, which are integrated with Cognito via an application programming interface.

 Attacker Behavior Industry Reports  

Vectra publishes Attacker Behavior Industry Reports, which provide an analysis of active and persistent attacker behaviors inside the enterprise networks of Vectra customers. The reports examine a wide range of cyberattack detections and trends from 300+ Vectra customers from nine different industries. The reports span all strategic phases of the attack lifecycle.

 "90% of organisations deploying Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exhibited RDP attacker behaviour."

 "The most significant ransomware threat — in which hackers steal your data and hold it for ransom — is malicious encryption of shared network files in cloud service providers."

 "Attackers are actively infiltrating energy organizations and utilities for reconnaissance purposes.”

 "Sixty percent of cryptomining detections in a Vectra study occurred on higher-education networks."

 "Sophisticated cyber-attackers are using hidden tunnels to spy on financial firms and pilfer sensitive data and personally-identifiable information (PII) - and they're doing it at a higher rate than in other industries."
