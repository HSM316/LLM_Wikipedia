 Software 
Notion is a collaboration platform with modified markdown support that integrates kanban boards, tasks, wikis, and databases. The company claims it is an all-in-one workspace for note-taking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management. It is described as a file management tool offering a unified workspace, allowing users to comment on ongoing projects, participate in discussions, and receive feedback. In addition to cross-platform apps, it can be accessed via most web browsers.

The software includes a tool for "clipping" content from webpages. Notion helps users schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, set reminders, keep agendas, organize their work. Notion allows writing & pasting equations in the form of blocks or inline, as it supports LaTeX.  Users can also embed online content in their Notion pages using Embed.ly. In this way notes can also be efficiently typed down alongside an embedded video playing in PiP mode.

 Pricing 
Notion has a four-tiered subscription model: free, personal, team, and enterprise. It offers an account credit system where users can earn credit via referrals. Users are not charged if they have a remaining balance in their accounts. An academic email address allows a free personal plan. As of May 2020, the company upgraded the Personal Plan to allow unlimited blocks, a change from the previous cap in the Personal Plan. This allows all new users the benefit of having unlimited storage.
