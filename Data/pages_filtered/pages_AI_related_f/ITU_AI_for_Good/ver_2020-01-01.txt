AI for Good is a United Nations platform, centered around annual Global Summits, that fosters the dialogue on the beneficial use of Artificial Intelligence, by developing concrete projects. The impetus for organizing global summits that are action oriented, came from existing discourse in artificial intelligence (AI) research being dominated by research streams such as the Netflix Prize (improve the movie recommendation algorithm).
 The AI for Good series aims to bring forward Artificial Intelligence research topics that contribute towards more global problems, in particular through the Sustainable Development Goals, while at the same time avoiding typical UN style conferences where results are generally more abstract. The fourth AI for Good Global Summit will be held from 4–8 May 2020 in Geneva, Switzerland.
