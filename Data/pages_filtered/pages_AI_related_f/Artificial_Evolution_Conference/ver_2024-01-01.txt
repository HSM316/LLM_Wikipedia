The biennial Artificial Evolution (AE) conference is held in France every two years (odd years), in early fall. The Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN) conference is held at the same period (early fall), but even years. EA is dedicated to techniques that simulate natural evolution. Proceedings of AE are published by Springer-Verlag in their LNCS serie.

Artificial Evolution was originally initiated as a forum for the French-speaking evolutionary computation community, and the first conference, organized by Jean-Marc Alliot, Evelyne Lutton, Edmund Ronald and Marc Schoenauer, was held in Toulouse in 1994 under the name Evolution Artificielle. It is the only conference held an even year, and the only one with proceedingsProceedings of Evolution Artificielle 1994 not edited by Springer (they were edited by CepaduesCepadues Edition). 

It became an international conference the following year (1995) in Brest, under the name Artificial Evolution. It is still referred sometimes as Evolution Artificielle (French for Artificial Evolution) however.
