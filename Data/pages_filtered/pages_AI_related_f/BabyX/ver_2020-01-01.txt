BabyX is a project of Auckland's Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies, and is a virtual animated baby that learns and reacts like a human baby. It uses the computer's cameras for "seeing" and microphones to "listen" as the inputs. The computer uses Artificial intelligence algorithms for BabyX's "learning" and interpretation of the inputs (voice and image) to understand the situation. The result is a virtual toddler that can learn to read, recognize objects and "understand." The output is the baby's face that can "speak" and express its mood by facial expressions (such as smiling).
