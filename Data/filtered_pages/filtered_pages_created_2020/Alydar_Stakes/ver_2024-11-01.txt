The Alydar Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually in early August at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York. Made a Listed race in 2019, it is contested on dirt at a distance of a mile and one-eighth. It is open to four-year-old non-winners in the current year of a Sweepstake other than a State-bred event.
