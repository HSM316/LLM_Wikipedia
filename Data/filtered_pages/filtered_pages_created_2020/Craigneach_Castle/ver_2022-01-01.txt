History
The property may be the “Place of Elchies” plundered in 1645 by the Covenanters, although little about it is certain.

Structure
Craigneath Castle was an L-plan castle, on a spur, in a commanding position.  The building was of about  internal width.  There was a dry-stone enclosure wall.

There are now no remains.
