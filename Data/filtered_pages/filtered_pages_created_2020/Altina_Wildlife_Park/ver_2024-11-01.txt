In October 2023, two black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) were paired for potential breeding. However, in early December, the female gave birth to three babies (2x M, 1x F), which was a complete surprise to staff. As the gestation is longer than their pairing, the female had been pregnant before being transported from Darling Downs Zoo in Queensland, and DNA testing will reveal the identity of the father.Altina Wildlife Park to use DNA tests to find mystery father of black-and-white ruffed lemur triplets, Monty Jacka, ABC News Online, 2023-12-14
