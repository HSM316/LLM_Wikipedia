The England cricket team is scheduled to tour India during February and March 2021 to play four Test matches, three One Day International (ODI) and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Tests will form part of the inaugural 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship, and the ODI series will form part of the inaugural 2020–23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. In December 2020, the full itenary was released with three venues hosting the entire tour.

Background
Originally, England were scheduled to tour India in September and October 2020 to play the ODI and T20I matches. However, after the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Indian Premier League was rescheduled to be played in its place. In February 2020, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that they would like to play a day/night Test match at the refurbished Motera Stadium. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed the changes to England's tour in August 2020.

On 20 August 2020, Sourav Ganguly, president of the BCCI, said that India would host England to fulfil their Future Tours Programme (FTP) commitments. In September 2020, the BCCI were also in discussions with the Emirates Cricket Board with regards to using the United Arab Emirates to host the series, due to the COVID-19 situation. Later the same month, Sourav Ganguly reiterated that it was a "priority" to host the matches in India, and that the BCCI were continuing to monitor the COVID-19 situation.

The tour's itinerary originally was scheduled to have five Tests, three ODIs and three T20I matches. However, in November 2020, Sourav Ganguly confirmed that one of the Test matches had been dropped with two more T20I matches added to the tour, in preparation for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.
