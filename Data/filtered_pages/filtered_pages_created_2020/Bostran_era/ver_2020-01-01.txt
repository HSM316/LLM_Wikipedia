The Bostran era (also called the era of Bostra, Arabian era, provincial era or era of Provincia Arabia) was a calendar era (year numbering) with an epoch (start date) corresponding to 22 March 106  AD. It was the official era of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, introduced to replace dating by regnal years after the Roman annexatino of the Nabataean Kingdom. It is named after the city of Bostra, which became the headquarters of the Sixth Legion stationed in the province.

The start date of the Bostran era was once a matter of dispute, in part because the Chronicon Paschale explicitly puts it the year of the consuls of 105. Manuscript discoveries from the Cave of Letters put the issue to rest: the era of Bostra began in 106. A leap year came once every four years in the Bostran calendar starting from the second year. Thus years 2, 6, 10 etc. were leap years.

The Bostran era was used extensively in "commemorative and honorific inscriptions", but less frequently in "administrative and legal documents". It was used in Nabataean Aramaic and Greek. Its usage was not enforced by the Romans and many cities continued to use local calendars on locally minted coinage. These included the "era of Pompeii" (63 BC) in some cities of the Decapolis and the "era of Capitolias" (97/98 AD). Inscriptions from Arabia Petraea which do not specify the era but simply provide a year number are, however, in the era of Bostra.
