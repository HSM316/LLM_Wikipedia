Critical reception

Rob Caldwell of AllMusic gives the album 3 out of 5 stars and writes, "Following the pattern of her debut, it featured a fine selection of songs and a fine array of guest performers."

Charles Donovan of Pop Matters had this to say of the album, "Wild Child marked the end of Carter's time with Columbia. Busy with backing vocals and some songwriting here and there in the 1980s, she wouldn't re-emerge as a solo artist until 1996, when she cut The Way It Is for the Japanese Pony Canyon label. It was a tremendous return."
