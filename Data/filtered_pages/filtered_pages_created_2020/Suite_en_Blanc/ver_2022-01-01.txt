Suite en Blanc, later retitled Noir et Blanc, is a ballet choreographed by Serge Lifar to music from Ã‰douard Lalo's ballet Namouna. The first performance, by the Paris Opera Ballet, took place on 19 June 1943 in Zurich. The original costumes were all white, whence the title ("Suite in White"), but in subsequent productions the male dancers wore black and the title was changed to reflect this ("Black and White").Oxford Dictionary of Dance, p.431Australian Ballet: Suite en Blanc
