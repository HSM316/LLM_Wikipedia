Critical reception
Mary Helen Becker, writing in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers, says that the Septimus Finch novels often feature large eccentric families, old houses, secret rooms, psychic phenomena, and "familiar puzzles". She rates the novels as "not really in the first rank" but "nevertheless better than many... Horrible things happen, but they are packaged for polite society."
