The Zhao Jianmin Spy Case (), or Zhao Jianmin Wrong Case (), was a major fabricated spy case in Yunnan province during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, with more than 1.387 million people implicated and persecuted, which accounted for 6% of the total population in Yunnan at the time. From 1968â€“1969, more than 17,000 people died in massacre while 61,000 people were crippled for life; in Kunming (the capital of Yunnan) alone, 1,473 people were killed and 9,661 people were disabled.

In March, 1967, Zhao Jianmin, then the provincial communist party secretary of Yunnan, suggested to Kang Sheng in person that the Communist Party of China (CPC) should resolve the issues in Cultural Revolution in a democratic manner, receiving no immediate response from the latter. However, Kang Sheng snitched on Zhao to Mao Zedong afterwards, claiming that Zhao was against the Central Committee of CPC, against Chairman Mao, and against the Cultural Revolution. In August 1967, Mao Zedong as well as the Central Committee of CPC approved that the national and local media may publicly criticize the "capitalist roaders" among the provincial leaders in China. A total of 55 leaders were named, including Zhao Jianmin.

In 1968, Zhao Jianmin was slandered as "the spy of Kuomintang (KMT)" as well as "traitor" by Kang Sheng and others, and was also regarded as one of the "local proxies" of Liu Shaoqi. Zhao was then jailed for 8 years. At the same time, a massive search for members of the fabricated "Zhao Jianmin KMT Spy Agency in Yunnan" was carried out, resulting in the arrest and persecution of more than 1.38 million civilians and officials. Tan Furen, a lieutenant general in the People's Liberation Army, was in charge of the massive persecution after Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of CPC sent him to Yunnan to direct local affairs.

After the Cultural Revolution, Zhao Jianmin was officially rehabilitated and became a vice director of the Third Ministry of Machine Building.
