The Orange Line is a light rail in Santa Clara County, California, and part of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail system. It serves 26 stations in the cities of Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose, and Milpitas, traveling between Mountain View and Alum Rock stations. The line connects to Great America, Levi's Stadium, and in the future will connect to the Milpitas BART station. It runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays, with headways of 15 minutes for most of the day. On weekends, train run at 20 minute headways for most of the day. After around 8pm on weekdays and weekends trains run at 30 minute headways.

Route description
The Orange Line starts from the Downtown Mountain View station in Mountain View, California, travels toward the east, passing under U.S. Route 101 at Ellis Avenue, following Mathilda Avenue to Java Drive, crossing State Route 237 and turning east on Tasman Drive, which eventually becomes Capitol Avenue. For the rest of the trip the line follows Capitol Avenue until it reaches its eastern terminus, the Alum Rock Transit Center.

Construction history
The route that the Orange Line now runs on is constructed in three different expansion projects: the original Guadalupe line, the Tasman West extension, and the Vasona extension.

Guadalupe line
The trackway between Old Ironsides station and First Street is part of the Guadalupe line, the first light rail line constructed in Santa Clara county.  The Guadalupe line opened for revenue service on December 10, 1987 originally running from Old Ironsides station to Civic Center station in San Jose. Champion station was not part of the original line; it was added as intermediate stop as part of the Tasman West project.

Tasman West extension
The Tasman West extension project was constructed with funds from 1996 Measure B sales tax measure. Champion station was the first to open as an infill stop along the existing Guadalupe line trackway, opening March 24, 1997. On December 17, 1999,  of trackway and 12 new light rail stations added between the existing Old Ironsides station and the new Downtown Mountain View station. On the same day, Baypointe station opened just east of the intersection of 1st and Tasman.

Tasman East/Capitol extension
The first phase of the Tasman East extension opened in May 2001 between Baypointe and I-880/Milpitas stations.

On June 24, 2004, the 8.3-mile (13.4-km) Tasman East/Capitol extension was opened, incorporating 8 new stations. This extension runs from the I-880/Milpitas station east along the Great Mall Parkway in Milpitas, then into East San Jose on Capitol Avenue to Alum Rock Transit Center on Alum Rock Avenue. This extension brings service to the Great Mall of the Bay Area in Milpitas. The total cost of this extension was $432.9 million.

 Light Rail Efficiency Project 
In 2014, a new storage track and crossover was constructed between Old Ironsides and Reamwood as part of improvements to support events at Levi's Stadium and the future Silicon Valley BART extension.

To provide better headways and service reliability, a second track was constructed between Whisman and Downtown Mountain View. Work began in summer 2014 and was completed in late 2015. Evelyn Station was permanently closed in mid-March 2015 as part of track construction.

2019 reconfiguration
Ahead of the opening of the Silicon Valley BART extension to Berryessa / North San Jose, the Orange Line was created. Starting in early 2019, station signage was changed reflect the new configuration, displaying line colors rather than terminus icons.

Proposed Capitol Expressway extension

VTA have proposed a future extension to this line running along the median of Capitol Expressway. Under the 2005 Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR), an initial operating segment would extend from Alum Rock, terminating at Eastridge. Phase 1 of the Capitol Expressway extension would include new light rail stations at Story Road and VTA's Eastridge Transit Center, extending the line  south from Alum Rock. Actual construction remains contingent on funding availability. An earlier version of the project also included a station at Ocala as part of Phase 1, but the Ocala station was eliminated in 2014.

Phase 2 of the extension would complete a loop to the existing Capitol station. As originally proposed in the 2005 FEIR, the original proposed extension included several new stations along the extension to State Route 87. Phase 2 would also include an intermediate connection to Caltrain at Monterey Road. Stations studied for the extension included:
 Alum Rock (existing)
 Story Rd – Phase 1
 Ocala/Cunningham Ave (Park and Ride) – Phase 1
 Eastridge Mall (Park and Ride) – Phase 1
 Nieman Blvd – Phase 2
 Silver Creek Rd – optional infill station to follow Phase 2
 McLaughlin Ave – Phase 2
 Senter Rd – Phase 2
 Monterey Rd – Phase 2
 Vista Park Dr (Park and Ride) – Phase 2
 Capitol – rebuild existing station to include SR 87, Park and Ride features for Phase 2
