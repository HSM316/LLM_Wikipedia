Herbert Willi (born 7 January 1956) is a freelance Austrian composer of classical music, whose orchestral works, concertos and chamber music have been performed internationally and also recorded. Willi composed an opera, Schlafes Bruder, for the Opernhaus Zürich.

 Life 
Willi was born in Bludenz, Vorarlberg. He studied music pedagogy and theology at the University of Innsbruck, and simultaneously bassoon and piano at the Innsbruck conservatory. From 1983, he studied composition with Helmut Eder at the Salzburg Mozarteum, then with Boguslaw Schaeffer. He lives in Sankt Anton im Montafon.

 Work 

Willi's work comprises an opera, orchestral works, and chamber music, including compositions for one player. Willi received a commission from the Salzburg Festival and the Cleveland Orchestra in 1991 for Konzert für Orchester. The premiere was conducted by Christoph von Dohnányi. In 1994/95, the Opernhaus Zürich commissioned the opera Schlafes Bruder on the occasion of Austria's millennial, with a libretto by Robert Schneider, who had written the novel on which it is based, Schlafes Bruder. It was premiered in 1996. In 1997/98, Willi composed Begegnung für Orchester on a commission by the Wiener Philharmoniker for the orchestra's 150th anniversary.

He composed Zyklus Montafon, containing the works Eirene, a trumpet concerto; ...geraume Zeit..., a concerto for flute, oboe and orchestra; ego eimi, a clarinet concerto; and Äon, a horn concerto. A revised version of Schlafes Bruder was produced at the Stadttheater Klagenfurt in March 2008.

Willi's works were performed in Carnegie Hall in New York City, Tokyo, the Royal Albert Hall in London, and at the Philharmonie Berlin, among others. They were played by the Berlin Philharmonic, Wiener Philharmoniker, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and New Japan Philharmonic, conducted by Claudio Abbado, Gustavo Dudamel, Manfred Honeck, Riccardo Muti and Seiji Ozawa.
