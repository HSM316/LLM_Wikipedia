This article is about the American Billboard Hot 100 chart held during the 2020s.

The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, airplay, and, since 2012, streaming.

A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public every Tuesday in Billboard magazine and on its website. Each chart is dated with the "week-ending" date of the Saturday four days later.

Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" began the 2020s in the number-one position on the Hot 100, and made her the first artist to rank at number one on charts from four different decades. The song was in its third week at number one on January 4, 2020, reaching the top for the first time on December 21, 2019. The following week, on January 11, 2020, Post Malone's "Circles" returned to the number-one spot, another carry-over from the 2010s; it originally reached number one on November 30, 2019.
