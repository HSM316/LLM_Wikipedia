Alliance Bible Seminary (Abbreviation: ABS; Chinese: 建道神學院), previously called as Alliance Bible School, was established in Wuzhou, Guangxi in 1899 by C&MA missionaries Dr Robert Glover and Robert A. Jaffray. It is the first C&MA seminary established overseas and is one of the first seminaries in South China. In 1949, the seminary was moved to Cheung Chau, Hong Kong by Rev Dr William C. Newbern due to the change of religious policy in China. ABS was founded even before any church plant and was determined to train its students for missionary work. After they graduated, most were sent to establish new churches. Hence, most churches of the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Hong Kong were planted by their graduates. And due to its relatively early establishment as a seminary in Hong Kong, it is well-known in the Chinese Christian circle as a higher institution.

History
In 1899, Robert Glover, the first principal of ABS, together with Robert A. Jaffray, Alvin Field, and Walter H. Oldfield, established Alliance Bible School in Wuzhou, Guangxi. In 1902, Alliance Women College was founded. In 1938, these two were merged and renamed as Alliance Bible Institute. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Alliance Bible College was closed for a year and moved to Cheung Chau, Hong Kong. In 1955, the College was renamed as Alliance Bible Seminary, since "college" in Hong Kong usually meant secondary school. In 1975, Christian and Missionary Alliance Church Union Hong Kong took over the management of the seminary from the C&MA west missionary agency. In 2005, ABS opened its second campus in Wanchai to promote pastoral and professional continuing education, as well as a lay leadership training programme.
