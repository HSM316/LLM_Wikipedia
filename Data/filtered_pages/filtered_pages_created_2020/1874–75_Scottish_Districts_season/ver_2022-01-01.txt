The 1874–75 Scottish Districts season is a record of all the  rugby union matches for Scotland's district teams.

It includes the Inter-City fixtures between Glasgow District and Edinburgh District.

History

The matches here remain 20 – a – side. These matches, with more players on the park, made it harder to score.

In addition, scoring a try did not count for points. The try gave you an attempt to get a score by means of the conversion; if the conversion was missed then it did not benefit the try scoring team. It was only goals that mattered.

Both inter-city matches this season show just how difficult it was to score when the teams were 20-a-side.

The February 1875 match was the fourth draw in succession, although the North British Mail noted that Glasgow District had the best of the Inter-City match. It was noted that the 1875 match was played in two halves lasting 50 minutes each.
