Stephenson Avenue refers to two separate sections of road in the western suburbs of Perth, Western Australia.

The first section is a  section of dual carriageway linking Scarborough Beach Road to Pearson Street/Jon Sanders Drive in Osborne Park. The second, longer section is a  two-lane road in Mount Claremont used to link central Perth to the West Coast Highway via Hay Street, Underwood Avenue and Rochdale Road.

The two sections of road are to date the only evidence of the originally proposed Stephenson Highway, a controversial highway that was proposed to connect Swanbourne to Innaloo.

The two roads are named after Gordon Stephenson, an influential person in the development and expansion of Perth through the Metropolitan Region Scheme during the 20th Century.
