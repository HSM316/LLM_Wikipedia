The World Athletics Continental Tour is an annual series of independent track and field athletic competitions, recognised by World Athletics (formerly known as the IAAF). The Tour forms the second tier of international one-day meetings after the Diamond League. First held in 2020, it replaced the IAAF World Challenge series."World Athletics Continental Tour to launch in 2020 " . World Athletics. 23 November 2019. Retrieved 21 April 2021."Triple jump and 200m cut from 2020 Diamond League" . Athletics Weekly. Retrieved 21 April 2021.

Initially divided into three levels – Gold, Silver and Bronze – the Continental Tour was expanded in 2022 with the fourth tier: Challenger. The Gold meetings are organised globally, with investment from World Athletics, and represent the second tier of meetings in the sport. Area associations are responsible for managing the Silver and Bronze level competitions.
