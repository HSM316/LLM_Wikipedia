Reception
Kirkus Reviews stated in 1987 that Pohl's Heechee series "...has been growing steadily less involving", and calls The Annals of the Heechee the "...dullest of the lot".  Kirkus Reviews' states that the novel has "[n]o plot, a subplot that fizzles, chunks of cosmological explication, uninteresting aliens, and thoroughly boring characters" and calls it "...one of the least engaging Poh[l] [books] in many a year, and thus strictly for Heechee addicts."
