 After Long Autumn Night by Qian Qi 钱起《效古秋夜长》唐诗  from Tang Poems 

Mahler's choral symphony "Das Lied von der Erde" 2nd movement text was based on this 8th century Tang poem.

"Autumn brings the white jade frost, North wind sweeps the lotus scent.

Pining with love she weaves by a flickering lamp, Tearful at the long cold loom,

Her cloud of finished gossamer green silk like a pool of quiet water, Until the moon and perched crow bring the dawn.

Who is this young girl faithfully weaving at her loom?

Hidden deep behind rich silken drapes, amidst the splendor listening to falling leaves.

I sympathize with her; cold in solitary desolation."

钱起《效古秋夜长》唐中期  - -

秋汉飞玉霜，北风扫荷香。含情纺织孤灯尽，

拭泪相思寒漏长。檐前碧云静如水，月吊栖乌啼鸟起。

谁家少妇事鸳机，锦幕云屏深掩扉。

白玉窗中闻落叶，应怜寒女独无依 。
