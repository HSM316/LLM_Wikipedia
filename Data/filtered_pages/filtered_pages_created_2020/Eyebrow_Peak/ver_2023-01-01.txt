Eyebrow Peak is a prominent  glaciated mountain summit located in the Purcell Mountains in southeast British Columbia, Canada. It is the ninth-highest peak in the Purcells. It is situated  south of The Bugaboos,  west of Invermere,  north of Mount Monica, and  east of Duncan Lake. Its nearest higher peak is Commander Mountain,  to the southeast. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1914 by Edward Warren Harnden, D. Brown, L. Nettleton, and E. Parson via the west slopes. The name Eyebrow Peak came about by Arthur Oliver Wheeler in 1910 when viewing two broad rock scars near the summit, and their arrangement in connection with the surrounding snow created the appearance of enormous eyebrows. However, using the same sightings as Wheeler, Professor Peter Robinson showed that Wheeler actually saw Mount Farnham. Poor weather conditions led to Wheeler's error, and the Eyebrow moniker was then moved to its present location. The mountain's name was officially adopted June 9, 1960, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.
