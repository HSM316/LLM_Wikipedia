Mansfield Zoo is a  zoo located around ten kilometres outside Mansfield, Victoria. Established in 2000, it is privately owned by Bronwen Wilson and Dave Murphy. 

Mansfield Zoo is home to over 220 animals, including both Australian and exotic species. Some of the animals, such as the kangaroos and deer, are free-roaming and can be hand fed by visitors who purchase animal feed at the zoo. The zoo also has four African lions, (including two rare white lions); visitors can watch the daily lion feedings. From September to May, visitors are also able to camp in the zoo for up to two days.

History
Mansfield Zoo was established by Steve Junghenn in early 2000. The wildlife park initially contained only deer and other Australian animals, but it had two lions, brothers Kitwe and Monbu, by 2005. Junghenn eventually put the property up for sale. 

Not content with her life in suburban Melbourne, Bronwen Wilson and her husband Rodney sold their house and business. In December 2005, they bought Mansfield Zoo for $800,000, moving to Mansfield with their two school-aged children Alisha and Jordan. Wilson's only prior experience with lions was two weeks of work experience at Melbourne Zoo. Though Wilson was adamant on holding on to the zoo, her husband disagreed with her decision to move to rural Victoria. He moved away after their divorce in 2007; Alisha went with him several months later. Wilson struggled as a single mother and zoo manager. In 2008, she met neighbouring farmer Dave Murphy, who became her new partner and co-manager of Mansfield Zoo. They are aided by Wilson's now-adult children.

The lion Monbu died in 2011, followed by his brother 18 months later. The male white lions Djuma and Matimba were transferred from the National Zoo & Aquarium in 2012. They were joined by the African lion Robbie (Rubani) and lioness Delilah in May 2014.

Mansfield Zoo was closed from AprilMay 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
