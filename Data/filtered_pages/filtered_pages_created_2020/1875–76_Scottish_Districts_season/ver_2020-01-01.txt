The 1875-76 Scottish Districts season is a record of all the  rugby union matches for Scotland's district teams.

It includes the Inter-City fixtures between Glasgow District and Edinburgh District.

History

The first Inter-City match of the season was played under the 20-a-side rules. Like many Inter-City matches before this produced a nil - nil draw. It was noticed that this format drew less spectators to witness the match. During the match it was noted that Glasgow District's Malcolm Cross was seriously injured and had to be stretched from the fround.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aUREAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rLEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483%2C6173325

In 1876, it was realised that less players on the park might increase the chances of teams scoring. The second match of the Inter-City fixtures was thus played with the now standard 15-a-side rules. The reduction of players provided - as The Glasgow Herald reported - the best Inter-City match ever played and the attendance, having dropped with the nil-nils previously with the 20-a-side format, was also boosted to 5,000 spectators. Despite the much better match, scoring remained at a premium and the match once again ended nil-nil.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d0xEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rrEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140%2C1660789
