History
left|Shirley Isolation Hospital
The facility has its origins in two houses on West Quay in Southampton which were acquired to create an isolation hospital in 1874. These premises were replaced by a purpose-built facility on Mousehole Lane (now Oakley Road) in Shirley in 1900. This facility developed to become the Southampton Chest Hospital and joined the National Health Service as the Southampton Western Hospital in 1948. After the Southampton Western Hospital closed in the mid-1980s, a new facility for elderly people was created on the site in January 1996. This facility evolved to become the Western Community Hospital.
