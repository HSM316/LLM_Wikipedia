Don't Take Your Laser to Town is a 1988 role-playing game adventure for Paranoia published by West End Games.

Plot summary
Don't Take Your Laser to Town is a scenario for Yellow Clearance troubleshooters set in WST Sector, where outlaw Black Bot is terrorizing the townsfolk.

Publication history
Don't Take Your Laser to Town was written by Malcolm Mouris and Vern C. Hargett, and was published by West End Games in 1988 as a 32-page book.

According to Shannon Appelcline, "Though some post-Rolston releases like the pre-crash Don't Take Your Laser to Town (1988) and the time travel Alice through the Mirrorshades did well commercially, the uneven humor of the early '90s and the metaplot issues would eventually doom the line."

Reception
Lawrence Schick notes that the adventure includes "Lots of Hollywood Western clich√©s."
