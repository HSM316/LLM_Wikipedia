Voetbalvereniging Alkmaar is a club that competes in the Dutch women's Eredivisie and the only one not affiliated with a (men's) professional club.

From 2007 until 2011 AZ Alkmaar had a successful women's section, but when they decided to pull the plug on the women's team for financial reasons, most of the players moved to nearby Telstar, who were starting up a women's section. The team continued to train in Alkmaar and because the offices were there as well. It was decided after the 2016/17 season to separate from Telstar, move to Alkmaar and form a new club.(Dutch) Vrouwen van Telstar zoeken hun heil onder de vlag van Alkmaar, NOS, 1 maart 2017
