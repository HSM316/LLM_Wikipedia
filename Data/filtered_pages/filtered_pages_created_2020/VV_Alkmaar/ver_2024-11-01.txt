Vrouwenvoetbal Alkmaar, commonly known as VV Alkmaar, was a Dutch football club that competed in the Eredivisie, the top women's league in the Netherlands, until 2023. During its time in the Eredivisie, it was the only team in the league not affiliated with a men's professional club.

History
From 2007 until 2011, AZ Alkmaar had a successful women's club, but when it decided to dissolve the women's team for financial reasons, most of the players moved to nearby SC Telstar in Velsen, which started a women's club in 2011. Telstar continued to train in Alkmaar because its offices were there. After the 2016â€“17 season, the women's club decided to separate from Telstar, move to Alkmaar, and form a new club.(Dutch) Vrouwen van Telstar zoeken hun heil onder de vlag van Alkmaar, NOS, 1 maart 2017 

In late 2022, the club announced that AZ Alkmaar would compete in the Eredivisie beginning in the 2023-2024 season.
