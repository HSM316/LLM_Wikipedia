The 2022 FIA World Rally Championship will be the fiftieth season of the World Rally Championship, an auto racing competition recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as the highest class of international rallying. Teams and crews are due to compete for the World Rally Championships for Drivers, Co-drivers and Manufacturers. Crews are free to compete in cars complying with World Rally Car and Group R regulations; however, only manufacturers competing with World Rally Cars homologated under regulations introduced in 2017 are eligible to score points in the Manufacturers' championship.

A significant change to the regulations is planned to be introduced in 2022 as the sport adopts the use of hybrid drivetrains for the first time.

Changes
Technical regulations
The sport will introduce hybrid drivetrains for the first time. All cars competing under World Rally Car regulations will be required to be fitted with a hybrid system. This will take the form of an e-motor that produces  and must be used to power the car when travelling around service parks and through built-up areas when driving between stages. Drivers will be free to use the e-motor to offer additional power when competing in a stage, with the FIA dictating how much power can be used and how long a driver can deploy it for.

The championship will also introduce a standardised safety structure in a bid to improve safety standards. This will coincide with the homologation requirements being re-written to allow teams to build prototype chassis based on production cars rather than having to adapt a chassis to fit a roadgoing model.
