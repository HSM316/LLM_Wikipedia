Calendar changes

The rally base of Monte Carlo Rally is set to move from Gap, Hautes-Alpes to Monaco solely.

Rally Sweden is due to return to the championship after a one-year absence, moving its rally headquarters for the first time in history. It will relocate from Torsby, Värmland northwards to Umeå in Västerbotten County.

Rally Mexico has contracts to hold the WRC event in 2022 and 2023, but the rally was not included in the calendar.

Rally Chile finds itself in a similar situation like Mexico when its contract with WRC Promoter GmbH is set to end in 2022. Chile had previously hosted the event in .

Rally New Zealand is set to return to the championship for the first time since . The country had also secured a spot in the calendar in , but their bid to return to championship was taken down due to the cancellation of the event in response to the COVID-19 situation.

Regulation changes
Technical regulations

The championship is due to introduce a new set of technical regulations known as "Rally1" to replace the World Rally Car. The Rally1 regulations will place a greater emphasis on standardised parts than in previous years to make the sport more accessible.

Rally1 will also introduce hybrid drivetrains to the sport for the first time. This will take the form of an e-motor that produces  fitted to current 1.6 L turbocharged inline-4 engine and must be used to power the car when travelling around service parks and through built-up areas when driving between stages. Drivers will be free to use the e-motor to offer additional power when competing in a stage, with the FIA dictating how much power can be used and how long a driver can deploy it for. The hybrid system and the software governing its use will be standardised for three years as a way of keeping the costs of competing down. The system will be provided by Compact Dynamics, a subsidiary of Formula E team Audi Sport ABT supplier Schaeffler.

The championship will also introduce a standardised safety structure in a bid to improve safety standards. This will coincide with the homologation requirements being re-written to allow teams to enter a scaled chassis based on production cars rather than having to adapt a chassis to fit a roadgoing model.

Sporting regulations
The eligibility requirements for crews entering events will be simplified and streamlined into a system called the "FIA Rally Pyramid". The top tier of the sport is known as "Rally1". The second tier, "Rally2", will be for manufacturer teams and professional independent teams in the World Rally Championship-2. This will be followed by "Rally3" for privately entered and "gentlemen driver" crews competing in the World Rally Championship-3. "Rally4" and "Rally5" entries will not contest their own dedicated championship, but will be permitted to enter WRC rallies.

Specific liaison sections in which Rally1 competitors must drive in full electric mode will be introduced into the championship.
