Personal life
Mao was a table tennis prodigy before her disability. She represented her home province Jiangsu in national competitions in 2005, when she was 10 years old. However, later that year, an injury and a misdiagnosis caused a dislocated hip, which forced her retirement. She began playing seriously again after meeting para table tennis coach Yuan Feng in 2009.
