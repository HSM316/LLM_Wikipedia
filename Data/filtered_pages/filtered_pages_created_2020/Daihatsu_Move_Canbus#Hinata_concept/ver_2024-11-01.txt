The  is a retro-styled semi-tall kei car with rear sliding doors manufactured by the Japanese carmaker Daihatsu since 2016. Despite adopting the "Move" nameplate, the car shared its underpinnings with the Tanto instead.

 Etymology 
The name "Canbus" is a combination of the verb "Can", describing the car's ability, and the noun "Bus", describing the car's bus-like shape and inspiration from the Volkswagen Type 2, which was also known as the "Bus".

 Overview 
The Move Canbus borrowed its overall design from the Hinata concept car. The Hinata was first showcased at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show alongside the Tempo food truck and Noriori wheelchair accessible van concepts.

The Canbus is targeted towards the female sales demographic.
