Colin Imber is a lecturer in Turkish studies at Manchester University, UK. 

He completed his Oriental studies at Cambridge University, where he defended his doctorate on "The Ottoman Fleet in the Age of Sultan Suleiman I (1520-1566)". His research interest is focused on the history of the Ottoman Empire until the 17th century and on Islamic law, in particular on the system of Ottoman law, until the 17th century.

He is considered as "perhaps the leading, and...certainly the most productive, of the painfully few Ottoman historians currently working in British universities."

He is noted for his opposition to Paul Wittek's "Ghaza thesis".
