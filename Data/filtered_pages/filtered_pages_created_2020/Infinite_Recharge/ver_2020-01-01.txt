Infinite Recharge, stylized as INFINITE RECHARGE, is the FIRST Robotics Competition game for the 2020 season. As the rules are yet to be revealed, it is unknown what the game will involve. The game is teased to center around a theme of energy and citybuilding and is in partnership with Star Wars: Force for Change. Additionally, this will be the first season without an enforced six-week build period, with teams able to work on their robots until the date of their first event.

 Kickoff 
The season's kickoff event will take place on January 4, 2020. The event will be livestreamed starting at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

 Events 
The competition season for Infinite Recharge is divided into seven weeks, with many events occurring simultaneously during each week. After Week 7, teams that have qualified compete in the FIRST Championship, held over two weeks in Houston and Detroit. Only regional, district championship, and world championship events are shown.
