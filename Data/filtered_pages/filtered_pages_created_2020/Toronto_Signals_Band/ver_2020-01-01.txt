The band is nicknamed "Canada’s Marching Ambassadors".

The band was formed in 1926, as part of the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment. In 1959, the band left the Canadian Army to form the famed Drum Corps, "Canada’s Marching Ambassadors". Following the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in the late 1960s and early 1970's, the band fell out of place in reformed Canadian Forces and was finally restructured as an independent unpaid organization in 1973.https://books.google.com/books?id=031WegRPmM8C&pg=PA345&dq=toronto+signals+band&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEpcSxq-HmAhVICc0KHRJfCmcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=toronto%20signals%20band&f=false bands continued as a voluntary organization, maintaining the traditions of the military band.
