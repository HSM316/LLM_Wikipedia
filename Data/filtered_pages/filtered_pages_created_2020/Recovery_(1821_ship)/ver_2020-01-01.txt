Recovery was launched at Howrah, Calcutta, in 1821. At some point she was renamed Valetta (or Valletta). In 1823 Valetta was one of five or six British opium ships at Macao or outside the Pearl River, the Chinese government having forbidden them to enter with their cargoes of opium. The East-India register and directory for 1824 showed her registered at Calcutta and gave her master's name as J.W.Phillips.

Valetta struck a reef off Cape Hillsborough on 10 July 1825. She was refloated the next day, but sprang a leak on 23 July in the Whitsunday Passage and was beached the next day at Cape Gloucester, New Britain, where she was declared a total loss. All 57 people on board survived. Lloyd's List (LL) reported on 14 April 1826, based on a letter from Sydney dated 21 September, that the country ship Valetta, Phillips, master, had wrecked on 10 July 1825 on the coast of New South Wales, but that her crew and most of the materials had been saved.LL 14 April 1826, â„–6107.
