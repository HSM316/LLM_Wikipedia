Political career
Morkel was a member of the Labour Party before was elected a councillor for the NNP in 1996. He was formerly chairperson of the now-defunct Cape Metropolitan Council's executive committee. In 2000, he declined to run for the position of unicity mayor in the upcoming municipal elections. He announced this following the expulsion of Mayor William Bantom. The ANC alleged that dismissal of Bantom meant that Morkel stood to benefit due to his father serving as premier. Morkel denied this claim and instead was a councillor candidate for the newly-created DA.

Within the DA, he served as provincial chairperson and was head of the party's caucus in the City of Cape Town municipality. He was soon advanced to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. 

In June 2005, Morkel was accused of accepting bribes from Gilt Edged Management Services (Gems). 

Morkel defected to the ANC during the September 2007 floor-crossing window period. Fellow DA MPP Kobus Brynard also joined the ANC. The defections were announced at a press conference headed by ANC national chairperson Mosiuoa Lekota.

In February 2008, it became known that during Morkel's tenure as DA provincial chairperson, he allegedly offered a bribe to an Independent Democrats councillor Sheval Arendse to defect to the DA. The agreement between Arendse and Morkel was discussed before the Erasmus Commission of Inquiry into allegations of spying in the Cape Town City Council. In April, he denied that he accepted a bribe from Badih Chaaban.
