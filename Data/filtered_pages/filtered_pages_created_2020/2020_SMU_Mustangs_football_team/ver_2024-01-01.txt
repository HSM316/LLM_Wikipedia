The 2020 SMU Mustangs football team represented Southern Methodist University during the 2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Mustangs were led by third-year coach Sonny Dykes and played their home games at Gerald J. Ford Stadium in University Park, Texas, a separate city within the city limits of Dallas, competed as members of the American Athletic Conference.

After finishing their regular season with a record of 7–3 (4–3 in conference play), the Mustangs accepted an invitation to the Frisco Bowl, where they were slated to play the UTSA Roadrunners. However, the bowl was subsequently canceled, due to COVID-19 concerns within the SMU football program.
