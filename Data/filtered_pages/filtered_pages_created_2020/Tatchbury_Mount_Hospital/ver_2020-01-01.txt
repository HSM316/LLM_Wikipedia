Tatchbury Mount Hospital is a health facility at Totton, Hampshire, England.

History
The facility was built as a private house known as Tatchbury Mount which was completed in the early 19th century. Tenants included Sir Daniel Fulthorpe Gooch, 3rd Baronet. It was acquired by Hampshire County Council and re-opened as a colony for mental defectives in 1931. The original house was demolished in 2006 but the hospital remains in use as a psychiatric hospital.
