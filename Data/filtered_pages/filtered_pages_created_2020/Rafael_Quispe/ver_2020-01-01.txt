He is also well known for his humorous and polemic style of politics, pulling many stunts, including giving "a "basic level" Aymara language translation dictionary to President Evo Morales when the debate about the authorities speaking his native language was in vogue" Although Morales is ethnically Aymara, he does not speak the language. In the run-up to the 2019 election, he delivered a tray of eggs to Vice President Linera to boost Linera's brainpower if he were to take up the challenge of facing Quispe in a debate.
