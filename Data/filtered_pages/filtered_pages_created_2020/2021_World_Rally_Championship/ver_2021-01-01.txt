The 2021 FIA World Rally Championship is the forty-ninth season of the World Rally Championship, an auto racing competition recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) as the highest class of international rallying. Teams and crews are competing in twelve rallies for the World Rally Championships for Drivers, Co-drivers, Teams and Manufacturers. Crews are free to compete in cars complying with Rally1 and Rally2 regulations; however, only manufacturers competing with Rally1 cars homologated under regulations introduced in 2017 are eligible to score points in the Manufacturers' championship. The championship is due to begin in January 2021 with the Rallye Monte-Carlo and conclude in November 2021 with Rally Japan. The series will be supported by the World Rally Championship-2 and World Rally Championship-3 categories at every round of the championship and by the Junior World Rally Championship at selected events.

Sébastien Ogier and Julien Ingrassia will be the reigning drivers' and co-drivers' champions, having secured their seventh championship titles at the 2020 Rally Monza. Hyundai are the reigning manufacturers' champions and will defend their manufacturers' title for the second consecutive year.

Calendar changes
With the addition of Rally Chile to the calendar in 2019, the FIA opened the tender process for new events to join the championship in 2020. Three events were successful, but the championship was affected by a series of cancellations in 2019 and 2020 that necessitated changes to the 2021 calendar:
 Rallye Catalunya is due to return to the championship. The rally was removed from the 2020 schedule as part of an event-sharing agreement that would see it removed from the calendar for one year, but be guaranteed a spot on the calendar for the next two.
 Rally Chile is due to return after a one-year absence. The rally had been included on the original draft of the 2020 calendar, but was later cancelled in the face of ongoing civil unrest in the country. Organisers of the event negotiated a return to the calendar for the 2021 championship.
 Rally Croatia will make its championship début, replacing Rally Mexico. Croatia will become the 34th country to host a World Rally Championship round. It will be based in Zagreb, and use tarmac roads that had been part of the INA Delta Rally.
 Rally Deutschland was removed from the calendar. The event had planned to run in 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not included on the 2021 calendar.
 The Rallies of Finland, Great Britain, and Portugal are due to return to the championship after a one-year absence. The 2020 events were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Rally Japan is scheduled to return to the calendar for the first time since 2010. It was originally included on the 2020 calendar, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Safari Rally is scheduled to be run as a World Championship event for the first time since 2002. The event is to be based in the Kenyan capital Nairobi and feature stages around Lake Naivasha. The event had been planned to make its return to the championship in 2020, but was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Rally Sweden was included on the first draft of the calendar with its traditional February date, but was cancelled before the start of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In light of the disruption caused by the pandemic in 2020 and in anticipation of further delays, the calendar included an additional six reserve rounds that could be included in the event of rallies being cancelled. These events include rallies in Greece, Belgium, Turkey, Argentina, Monza and Latvia.

In detail
Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT had planned to introduce a new car based on the Toyota GR Yaris, an "homologation special", or road-going version of a car specifically designed for competition and with production limited to the minimum number required to meet homologation requirements. However, the team later announced that it had abandoned development the GR Yaris, citing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the automotive industry and the costs of developing the car when new regulations were due to be introduced in 2022. Tommi Mäkinen stepped down from Toyota's team principal to become the company's motorsport advisor. Former driver Jari-Matti Latvala was named to succeed Mäkinen's role.

Reigning World Drivers' Champion Sébastien Ogier announced that he would retire from full-time competition at the end of the 2020 championship, but his retirement would be delayed as he renewed a one-year deal with Toyota. Ogier explained that his decision to stay in the sport was because the shortened 2020 championship was not how he wanted his career to end. The team retained the pairings of Elfyn Evans and Scott Martin and of Kalle Rovanperä and Jonne Halttunen. Takamoto Katsuta and Daniel Barritt remained with the team to contest a full-time campaign.

Hyundai retained the line-ups of Thierry Neuville and Nicolas Gilsoul, and of Ott Tänak and Martin Järveoja. The team's third entry will be shared between crews led by Dani Sordo and Craig Breen. Sordo will be partnered with new co-driver Borja Rozada as Carlos del Barrio is due to partner Fabrizio Zaldívar in the WRC-3 category. Nine-time World Champion Sébastien Loeb left Hyundai to join Bahrain Raid Xtreme team in the 2021 Dakar Rally and Team X44 in the Extreme E electric rally raid series. In the Hyundai 2C Competition team, Pierre-Louis Loubet will contest the full season in 2021, having contested three events with the team in 2020.

Changes
Technical regulations
Pirelli will replace Michelin as the sport's sole tyre supplier. Under the terms of the agreement, Pirelli will supply tyres to all teams entering Rally1 and Rally2 cars.

Sporting regulations
2021 will see the creation of the World Rally Championship for Teams, a new championship title that will exist alongside the World Rally Championships for Drivers, Co-drivers and Manufacturers.

As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that only seven of the thirteen events planned for the 2020 championship took place, the World Motorsport Council passed a resolution declaring that for the drivers', co-drivers' and manufacturers' championship titles to be awarded a minimum of six rallies must be held.

Manufacturers will be awarded Power Stage bonus points for the first time. The scoring system will be the same as that used by drivers and co-drivers, with five points awarded for the fastest manufacturer car down to one point for the fifth quickest. Only the two fastest drivers from a single manufacturer will eligible to score.
