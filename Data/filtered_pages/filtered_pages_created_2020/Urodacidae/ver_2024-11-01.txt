 
Urodacidae is a family containing two genera of scorpions, both of which are endemic to Australia. It was first described by British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1893. Formerly a subfamily (Urodacinae) of the Scorpionidae, it was later raised to family rank. Its sister taxon is the monotypic family Heteroscorpionidae, the species of which are confined to Madagascar.
