The Lancaster oilfield is an offshore oil field in Scottish territorial waters  west of Shetland and  north of mainland Scotland in water depths of around .  It comprises licence blocks 205/21a, 205/22a, 205/26b and 205/22b, all of which are fully owned by Hurricane Energy. https://www.hurricaneenergy.com/download_file/view/148/255 It is the first fractured basement oilfield in the United Kingdom continental shelf to reach production.

History
Exploration well 205-21-1A was drilled in 1974 by Shell. It discovered light oil in fractured basement but was plugged and abandoned. 

In 2009, Hurricane Energy drilled well 205/21a-4 into the fractured basement reservoir and discovered a substantial column of light oil with 38Â° Api and a flow rate of 1,367 barrels of oil per day ("bopd"). Subsequently, a sidetrack well, 205/21a-4Z, was drilled in 2010 which flowed light oil at 2,885 bopd. The 205/21a-4 well was plugged and abandoned. The 205/21a-4Z well was suspended.

Well 205/21a-6 well was completed in 2014. This included a one kilometre horizontal section. It produced a natural flow rate of 5,300 bopd, 9,800 bopd with an electrical submersible pump ("ESP") and a very high productivity index of 160 stb/psi/d. It was suspended as a future producer. 

Well 205/21a-7 was drilled in 2016 and produced 11,000 bopd with an ESP. It was subsequently sidetracked as 205/21a-7Z to include a one kilometre horizontal section. This produced a natural flow rate of 6,520 bopd, 15,375 bopd with an ESP and a very high productivity index of 147 stb/psi/d. It too was suspended as a future producer.  https://ukdigest.canadiandiscovery.com/released-well/released-well-20521a-4-4z-5-5-re

Early production system
In 2016, Hurricane committed to an Early Production System ("EPS") using the Aoka Mizu FPSO, chartered from Bluewater, for an initial five year period with an option to extend to ten years. This will be used to generate revenue and evaluate the reservoir properties over an initial testing period of about 12 months. It will inform decisions regarding potential full field development. The Early Production System utilises wells 205/21a-7Z and 205/21a-6. Revenue generated from oil sales will help to fund further activities in the Lancaster Field and the adjacent Halifax, Warwick and Lincoln fields.  

First oil
The Aoka Mizu FPSO arrived at the Lancaster field on 17 March 2019. Two days later, it was successfully hooked-up to the turret mooring system buoy. http://ir1.q4europe.com/IR/Files/RNSNews/18985376/Hurricane2018tf_14252704.pdf  On 11 May 2019 hydrocarbons began flowing into the processing system marking the commencement of the start-up phase. On 4 June 2019, following a 72-hour production test during which the planned production rate of 20,000 bopd was achieved and maintained, a press release announcing of "First Oil" was issued. http://ir1.q4europe.com/IR/Files/RNSNews/18985376/Hurricane2018tf_14335407.pdf

Testing phase
This phase involves testing the two production wells individually and together. Early test results have exceeded expectations. Substantially higher flow rates and productivity indexes have been demonstrated. 

Each of the two production wells has flowed at more than 16,500 bopd without the need for ESP assistance.https://www.hurricaneenergy.com/download_file/475/222 The natural flow rates are 211% higher than previous tests for the 205/21a-6 well and 153% higher than previous tests for 205/21a-7Z. 

Well 205/21a-6 has demonstrated a productivity index ("PI") of 205 stb/psi/d  (29.3% above previous tests) and well 205/21a-7Z has demonstrated a PI of 190 stb/psi/d  (28.1% above previous tests). 

Hurricane Energy is continuing to test and analyse the reservoir properties and expects to update its assessment of the Lancaster Field during 2020.
