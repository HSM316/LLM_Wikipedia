The WWE Year-End Awards is a concept used by WWE, where awards, similar to the Academy, Grammy, are given to professional wrestlers at the end of the year who have competed in Raw and SmackDown.

Created in 2018, they are based on the NXT Year-End Awards, which reward wrestlers from the NXT and NXT UK brand since 2015. Wrestlers from Raw and Smackdown had previously been rewarded by Slammy Awards between 1986 and 2015. In the first edition, the winners were voted by fans, while for the second, WWE picked the winner themselves.
