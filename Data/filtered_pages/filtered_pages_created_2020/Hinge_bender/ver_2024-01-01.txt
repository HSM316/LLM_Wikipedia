Hinge bender.
A hinge bender, also called a hinge tweaker or hinge adjuster, is a hand tool for adjusting hinges, for instance on doors and windows on buildings or on cars. A hinge bender can be used to straighten a door that is tilted sideways relative to the door frame, which tends to happen gradually with most doors over a long time period. According to the Norwegian Standard NS 3424, it is expected that a house door needs adjustment every 2 to 8 years.About the NS 3424 Standard (Norwegian) | standard.no Tilted doors can be especially noticeable during the winter time, as doors tend to expand due to changes in humidity of the air.

 Use

The tool is placed onto the hinge from the top while the door is closed. By rotating the hinge bender towards the door, the opening between the hinge stile and casing is decreased. If the tool instead is rotated away from the door, the opening between the hinge stile and casing will be increased.

Pulling with too much force can break the hinge or strip the screw heads of the hinge. Hinge benders can have either adjustable or fixed openings in order to fit different types of hinges.
