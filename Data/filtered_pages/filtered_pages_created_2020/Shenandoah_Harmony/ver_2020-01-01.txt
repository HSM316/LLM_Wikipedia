The Shenandoah Harmony is a four-shape tune book of 459 songs in for social singing, published in 2013 as a "curatorial" compilation of fasola repertoire from the mid-Atlantic region,. Another tunebook based on the "curatorial themes of regionality and place" mentioned by Davis is the The American Vocalist of Maine.  paying special attention to the works of Ananias Davisson (1780 – 1857)."The original inspiration for The Shenandoah Harmony  was to create a tunebook that included the best of the shape-note songs collected, printed, and published by Ananias Davisson from 1816 to 1826 in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia."  The importance of the Shenandoah Valley for the emergence of a distinctive Southern shape-note singing tradition has been noted by many musicologists.Harry Eskew, Shape-note hymnody in the Shenandoah Valley, 1816-1860.

Diffusion
All-day singing events based on the Shenandoah Harmony have emerged not only in the mid-Atlantic region,Recordings of all-day singings in Northern Shenandoah Valley (near the grave of Ananias Davisson) and in Lehigh Valley (PA) are posted to the  but also in the UK, Ireland, and Germany.List of singings at the Shenandoah Harmony page.  The popularity of the regional tunebook outside of the core area can be attributed to a design that has been optimized for sight-singing: "visually attractive, the songs are easy to read ... and the book feels good in your hand," Another reason is that shape note singers love minor-key songs;Buell E. Cobb, Jr., in The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music (University of Georgia Press, 2004), p. 34, states that "the high percentage of "minor music" in the Sacred Harp (roughly two songs out of five) is an anachronism"; in fact, only 23% of Sacred Harp songs are minor, but they are indeed sung about 40% of the time.  and the Shenandoah Harmony satisfies this peculiarity more than any other publication in current use: 52% of the tunes being minor."The editions of The Kentucky Harmony and The Tennessee Harmony are roughly 60% minor; even the early editions of The Easy Instructor are over 50% minor. As our book has evolved, we’ve added songs from other sources; the finished book will have about 52% minor songs."  A third reason is that, although many shape note singers know of Ananias Davisson as the composer of the iconic tune Idumea, the Sacred Harp does not contain any other songs by him; thus, having an entire book inspired by Davisson appealed to many traditional shape note singers."Admired for its scholarship, curation, and design, its use has quickly surpassed any other recently published tunebook of its kind."

Content
The curatorial focus is on the Kentucky Harmony (1816) and subsequent publications by Ananias Davisson, who lived in the Shenandoah Valley but cultivated a network of singing-school teachers and composers in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.David W. Music, "Ananias Davisson, Robert Boyd, Reubin Monday, John Martin, and Archibald Rhea in East Tennessee, 1816-26", American Music Vol. 1, No. 3 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 72-84.  The Shenandoah Harmony contains 24 compositions by Ananias Davison, 52 songs from his Kentucky Harmony, and 46 songs from Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony. Works by other composers from his era have also been revived: five tunes by  Elkanah Kelsey Dare, originally published in  Wyeth's Repository, Part Second (1813); 13 by William Hauser (and another 13 from  The Hesperian Harp compiled and published by him in 1848); and 9 by Lucius or Amzi Chapin.Song counts are from the "Index" at the back of the Shenandoah Harmony (no pagination for end matter).  Reflecting the vitality of the tradition as practiced today are dozens of new compositions by singers living at time of publication (2013)."Given that the original project had as its crux the tunes from Ananias Davisson's publications in the second and third decades of the 19th century, the decision to include more than sixty 20th- and 21st-century compositions in The Shenandoah Harmony was a bold one, but a wise one."  Tunes that already appear in the 1991 Denson edition of The Sacred Harp were avoided.However, alternative versions of some tunes are provided, such as alternate words for Stafford (page 78 in both books), replacing the anti-Semitic lyrics  of Isaac Watts with uplifting poetry by Joseph Hart.
