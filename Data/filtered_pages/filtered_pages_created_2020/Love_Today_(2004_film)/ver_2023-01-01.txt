 Release 
The film released to mixed reviews. A critic from Idlebrain.com gave the film two point five out of five stars and wrote how the film feels lengthy. Additionally, the reviewer praised the techinal aspects of the film, the performances of Uday Kiran and the supporting cast especially Devadarshini stating how she "would be suitable for akka [sister] & vadina [sister-in-law] roles in Telugu films". A critic from Sify wrote that "Director Aprudhan has a very thin storyline as the film moves at a snail pace. Unfortunately Love Today has nothing new to offer and ultimately lacks any style or soul". A critic from Full Hyderabad wrote that "When the crux of the movie is about dealing with misunderstandings, they should've at least tried to show some remotely sensible reason for all the squabbles. With such an effort from the makers' side, the outcome is only ordinary".
