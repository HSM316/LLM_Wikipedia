Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Schencke (January 9, 1869 â€“ June 29, 1946) was a Norwegian specialist in Semitic languages and the history of religion.

Schencke received a theology degree in 1894, but he chose to not become a priest. Theological dogmatism did not appeal to him, but he had a strong interest in Old Testament studies. After graduating, he studied religious history, Egyptology, and Semitic languages in Germany.
