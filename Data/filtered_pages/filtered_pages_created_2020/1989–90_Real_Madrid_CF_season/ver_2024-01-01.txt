The 1989–90 season was Real Madrid Club de Fútbol's 88th season in existence and the club's 59th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football.

Season
Real Madrid finished the campaign as league champions for the fifth season running, claiming their 25th league title overall. Furthermore, under the helm of new coach John Benjamin Toshack, the team broke the record for most league goals in a season, with 107. Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez scored 38 of them, equaling Telmo Zarra's record, and won the European Golden Boot. Real Madrid were also aiming to clinch the second consecutive domestic double, going all the way to the Copa del Rey final where they were beaten by Barcelona 0–2.
