 Early life 
Torbjørn Cederlöf Pedersen was born in Kerteminde, Denmark, to Torben Pedersen (Danish) and Ylva Cederlöf (Finnish). The family moved to Vancouver, Canada, then to Toronto, Canada, and  after that to New Jersey, USA over a period of six years, before returning to Denmark in 1984 where he spent his childhood growing up in Kerteminde and Bryrup before entering business school at Silkeborg Handelsskole, Silkeborg. Pedersen graduated as a merchant student in 1998 and was drafted to the military later the same year, serving as a royal life guard at the royal palaces throughout Denmark. He was later a UN soldier for half a year in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Following an education in shipping and logistic the Dane worked several years abroad in Libya, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United States and other countries.

 Once Upon a Saga 
In 2013, Pedersen began planning a project which aimed at visiting every country in the world in a single unbroken journey explicitly without the use of air transport. Graham Hughes holds the world record of fastest visiting all countries by public surface transport, according to Guinness World Records. Hughes was however permitted to fly home to Britain twice during his journey, as long as he returned to the same airport in order to continue his journey. To visit every country in the world, in one single journey, without catching a single flight is something that has never been done before.Leve, Andy "Torbjorn Pedersen: the man on a mission to visit every country in the world, without taking a single flight", The National, Abu Dhabi, 7 September 2019. 

Through the project Pedersen intends to reach every country without flying, while promoting every country and the world in a positive way.
