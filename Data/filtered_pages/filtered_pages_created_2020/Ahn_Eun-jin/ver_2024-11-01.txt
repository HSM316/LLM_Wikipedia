Ahn Eun-jin (; born May 6, 1991) is a South Korean actress. She is best known for her roles in Hospital Playlist (2020–2021) and The Good Bad Mother (2023), which gained her international recognition, as well as My Dearest (2023). She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 59th Baeksang Arts Awards for her role in the film The Night Owl (2022).

Ahn Eun-jin is a member of the class of 2010 at Korea National University of Arts, a group that include fellow actors and actresses such as Kim Go-eun, Lee Yoo-young, Lim Ji-yeon, Park So-dam, Lee Sang-yi, and Kim Sung-cheol, who are actively engaged in both the film and television industries.

Career
In 2010, Ahn enrolled at the Korea National University of Arts. She debuted in 2012 in the musical The Sorrows of Young Werther. In 2015, while she was still in college, Ahn performed in a play directed by her professor Lee Sang-woo, titled The Story of Tail Cotton, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Chaimu Troupe. Ahn believed her performance was lacking at the time, but fellow actor Lee Joong-ok reassured her years later, saying that she had done well. Following their discussion, Ahn said she realized that the performance had marked a turning point in her career as she was able to overcome the difficulties despite being disappointed with her work.

In 2015, Ahn also appeared in director Park Hee-soon's musical production Infinite Energy, focused on a group of young people gathered in the boarding house of an eccentric inventor to create an infinite energy device. Ahn made her debut in the role of Kim Sol on September 4, 2015,  and her performance received positive reviews, praising her versatile acting, comedic scenes, and her clear vocals. The musical ran until January 3, 2016, at Daehangno TOM 1 Theater.

In April 2018, Imagine Asia announced that Ahn had signed an exclusive contract with the agency. In August 2019, Ahn signed an exclusive contract with Big Boss Entertainment. Ahn auditioned for an unspecified role in a new medical drama by writer Lee Woo-jung and director Shin Won-ho. Months later, Ahn was asked to audition again and subsequently cast in the role of Chu Min-ha. Ahn said she felt lucky to be considered for the role at the last minute, having lost hope to get it after waiting such a long time. In August 2021, Ahn Eun-jin signed an exclusive contract with United Artist Agency (UAA).
