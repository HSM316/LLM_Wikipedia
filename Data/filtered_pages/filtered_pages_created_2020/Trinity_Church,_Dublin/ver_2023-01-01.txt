Trinity Church was designed by Frederick Darley who designed many buildings in Trinity College Dublin, and the church would have accommodated up to 1,800 people.

John Gregg from 1839 until his elevation in 1862 to Bishop.Gardiner Street Employment Exchange: The Historical Background and Development by Ciaran Clancy, Dublin Historical Record, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Spring, 1990), pp. 47-51, Published by: Old Dublin Society Mr. Vance, a wealthy Dublin businessman, funded it, on condition that Rev. Gregg could raise the other half of the money required to build it, which he did. It was a Proprietary Church, independently funded by wealthy laypeople, and the term "Episcopal" was used to distinguish it from other movements in the reformed faith at the time - the church was evangelical, verging on Calvinist.
The Rev. Dr. John Duncan Craig served as the incumbent in Gardiner street from 1884 until 1901, he was a poet, chaplain in the Franco-Prussian war, and a deputy chaplain in the Orange Order.
