Tamsyn Muir (born 14 March 1985) is a New Zealand author of fantasy, science fiction and horror. She has been nominated for several awards, and her first novel, Gideon the Ninth, was published in 2019.

Biography
Muir was born March 14, 1985, in New South Wales, Australia. She moved to New Zealand when she was nine months old, and grew up in Howick, New Zealand. In 2010, she earned a degree in education. She is also a 2010 graduate of the Clarion Workshop. She currently lives and works in Oxford, United Kingdom with her husband, Matt Hosty, whom she married in 2014. As of 2020, Muir identified as a lesbian. In an interview with Vox's Constance Grady, Muir described her Catholic background.

Work
Muir's short story "The Deepwater Bride", published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 2015, was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novelette, the World Fantasy Award—Short Fiction, the Eugie Award and the Shirley Jackson Award for best novelette.

Gideon the Ninth, Muir's first novel and the first book of the Locked Tomb series, was published in 2019. It was awarded the 2020 Locus Award for Best First Novel and the 2020 Crawford Award, presented annually by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Hugo Award for Best Novel. It finished third in the Goodreads Choice Awards for best science fiction in 2019. The front cover blurb by Charles Stross describes the story as "Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!". Constance Grady notes: "Throughout, Muir’s prose is sleek and compulsively readable. She has a genius for sliding her voice seamlessly from Lovecraftian gothic mode into a slangy contemporary mode without ever undercutting one or the other for cheap comedy. Instead, the contemporary mode makes the cast of characters feel familiar and recognizable, the Lovecraftian horror makes the world feel expansive and terrifying, and the slippage between both powers the book forward." Jason Sheehan said: "Gideon the Ninth is too funny to be horror, too gooey to be science fiction, has too many spaceships and autodoors to be fantasy, and has far more bloody dismemberings than your average parlor romance. It is altogether its own thing — brilliantly original, messy and weird straight through."

The second book in the series, Harrow the Ninth, was published in August 2020, and is a finalist for the 2021 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It will be followed by Nona the Ninth in 2022 and Alecto the Ninth in 2023.

After the Locked Tomb books, Tor will be publishing Muir's cyberpunk western novella trilogy beginning with Go Marching In, as well as two other books.
