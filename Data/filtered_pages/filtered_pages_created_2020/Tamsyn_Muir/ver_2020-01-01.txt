Gideon the Ninth is the first book of the Locked Tomb Trilogy and Muir's first novel. It was published in 2019. The front cover blurb by Charles Stross describes the story as "Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!". Constance Grady notes: "Throughout, Muir’s prose is sleek and compulsively readable. She has a genius for sliding her voice seamlessly from Lovecraftian gothic mode into a slangy contemporary mode without ever undercutting one or the other for cheap comedy. Instead, the contemporary mode makes the cast of characters feel familiar and recognizable, the Lovecraftian horror makes the world feel expansive and terrifying, and the slippage between both powers the book forward." Jason Sheehan said: "Gideon the Ninth is too funny to be horror, too gooey to be science fiction, has too many spaceships and autodoors to be fantasy, and has far more bloody dismemberings than your average parlor romance. It is altogether its own thing — brilliantly original, messy and weird straight through."

Other books in the trilogy will be Harrow the Ninth, coming 2020 and Alecto the Ninth in 2021.
