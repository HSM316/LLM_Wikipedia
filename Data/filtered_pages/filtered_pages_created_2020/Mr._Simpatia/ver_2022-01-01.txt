 In popular culture 
The Mr. Simpatia album is considered to be one of the albums that made history of Italian hip hop, that's why also the rapper Madman in his first album Escape from Heart cited it, in the verse contained in the track Trash Music: 

E non so niente a memoria, nemmeno l'Ave Maria – And I don't know anything by heart, not even the Ave Maria

Ma so qualcosa di storia tipo Mr. Simpatia – But I know something about history, like Mr. Simpatia

In this verse, Madman says that like a Christian knows by heart the Ave Maria and other prayers, MadMan knows by heart some records that have made the history of Italian rap, which for him is religion.
