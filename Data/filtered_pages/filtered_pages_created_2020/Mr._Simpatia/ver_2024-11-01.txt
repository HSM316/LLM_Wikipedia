Track listing

In popular culture
This album is considered to be one of the most important italian hip hop albums. The rapper Madman quoted it in his first album Escape from Heart, in the track Trash Music: 

E non so niente a memoria, nemmeno l'Ave Maria – And I don't know anything by heart, not even the Ave Maria

Ma so qualcosa di storia tipo Mr. Simpatia – But I know something about history, like Mr. Simpatia

In this verse, Madman says that like a Christian knows by heart the Ave Maria and other prayers, MadMan knows by heart some records that have made the history of Italian hip hop, which for him is religion.
