 Season Two 
In 2018, most of the earlier shows continued to run. In addition, a new format of show launched in the summer- a cooking competition called Food Fight. The show featured female kosher cooks and had four rounds, each one eliminating a contestant until the winner was chosen.https://forward.com/food/406628/food-fight-is-the-orthodox-community-s-answer-to-chopped/

 Season Three 

Once again, in 2019, Kosher.com released a cooking competition in the summer. Following the format of Food Fight, the show was a four-round elimination series, but took place in Oxnard, California in a kosher restaurant, and the competitors were men.https://www.vcstar.com/story/life/2019/07/11/ventura-county-michelin-star/1634751001/ This decision got some criticism from journalists on Twitter, for featuring only men to the exclusion of women in contrast to the previous year.https://twitter.com/Laura_E_Adkins/status/1146102029108031489
https://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/301379/l-a-kosher-chefs-compete-in-skillit-cook-off/ Jewish comedian Elon Gold served as the host of the show.

In December 2019, a new show geared for kids launched, called Nosh and Nibble. The first episodes featured Rylee Gluck, an 11 year old making dishes such as personal dessert pizzas. The show is geared for kids and will feature other children in future episodes.
