Taractes rubsecens is a species of pomfret of the family Bramidae. T. rubescens is closely related, and quite similar, to Taractes asper, but adults can most easily be distinguished by the bony keel present on the caudal peduncle. In fact, this bony keel is unique to Taractes rubescens and will distinguish it from all other bramids.

Distribution

Tokiharu Abe suggested in personal communications with Giles Mead that T. rubsecens adults are likely distributed throughout the tropical oceanic Pacific.  Specimens at various stages of development have been collected throughout the Pacific Ocean, from the Sea of Japan to the coast of Hawaii. Limited collections have been made in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Trinidad. T. rubscens had never been scientifically documented in the Indian Ocean until recently in 2010, where it was reportedly collected in the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea. Despite their widespread distribution, they remain quite uncommon.
