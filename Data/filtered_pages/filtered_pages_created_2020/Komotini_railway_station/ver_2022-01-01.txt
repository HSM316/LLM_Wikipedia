Komotini railway station () is a railway station that servers the city of Komotini, in Rhodope in East Macedonia and Thrace, Greece.

The station (as of 2019) is staffed, but only at peak times, but has waiting rooms and a bus stop in the forecourt.

History
The station opened in 1900. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables where cutback and routs closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis were cut back from six to just two trains a day, reducing the reliability of services, and passenger numbers. However, the station building remained open and staffed (at a reduced level). There is old abandoned boxcar shunted onto one of the sidetracks, very close to the station buildings.

Facilities
The station has waiting rooms, within the original brick-built station building. There Are two cafes/restaurants one in the station building, with a second within the station complex. The station is staffed, however only during peak times.

Services

In January 2019 services between Komotini and Alexandroupolis were suspended after a local river burst its banks in the area near the village of Venna, a rail replacement bus service was commenced.

Between July 2005 and February 2011 the Friendship Express, (an international InterCity train jointly operated by the Turkish State Railways (TCDD) and TrainOSE linking Istanbul's Sirkeci Terminal, Turkey and Thessaloniki, Greece) made scheduled stops at Komotini.
