Elvaston Place is a street in South Kensington, London.

Elvaston Place runs west to east from Gloucester Road to Queen's Gate.

Much of the street, 1-20 and 32-46, was built by the porperty developer Charles Aldin in the early 1860s. 26-31 were built in 1866-68.

From 1 January 1968 until at least May 1969, the musician Al Stewart lived in a basement flat at number 10, and his song Elvaston Place is about his time there.
