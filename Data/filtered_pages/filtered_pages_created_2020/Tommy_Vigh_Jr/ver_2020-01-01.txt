Thomas "Tommy" Vigh Jr. (born November 27, 1964) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He most recently competed full-time in the ARCA Menards Series, driving the No. 10 Ford for Fast Track Racing.

Racing career
Vigh began his racing career on local dirt tracks and in . Prior to racing in ARCA, 

He made his first three ARCA starts for Andy Hillenburg's Fast Track Racing team, driving their No. 10 car at Madison as well as the two dirt races at Springfield and DuQuoin with sponsorship from Extreme Kleaner. He got top-15 finishes in each race, with a 15th place finish at Madison and 13ths on both dirt tracks.

He and his sponsor returned to Fast Track and the No. 10 to run the 2019 season-opener at Daytona, which later turned into a full-season run for rookie of the year by April.

Because rookie Christian Eckes won the championship, he became ineligible to also win the rookie of the year award in addition to his title according to ARCA rules, so Vigh, who was second place behind Eckes in rookie points, was given the award at season's-end. He became the oldest rookie of the year winner in ARCA Series history, earning it at age 54.

Personal life
He is from Otisville, New York, although he currently lives in Parsippany, New Jersey.

In addition to racing, Vigh works as a shop fabricator for Statewide Line Striping and has been a longtime ambassador for his sponsor, Extreme Energy Solutions, based in Sparta, New Jersey.
