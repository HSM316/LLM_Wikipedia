He is well known in Bulgarian historiography for removing the lower boundary of the Bulgarian Renaissance from 1762 or from the writing of Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya - until the beginning of the 18th century with the end of the Köprülü era. This thesis is generally accepted in Bulgarian historiography and is known as the Bulgarian National Awakening. In this way Gandev, who was also historian of the Ottoman Empire, introduced a new conceptualism in Bulgarian history, namely continuity and communion with the history of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, including earlier ones during the Komnenos era.Проф. д-р Христо Гандев - житейски път и научно наследство
