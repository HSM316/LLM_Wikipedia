Poe Returning to Boston is a statue of Edgar Allan Poe in Boston, Massachusetts. The statue is located at the corner of Boylston and Charles streets at Edgar Allan Poe Square.

In March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of the bronze sculpture. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by an oversized flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a "paper trail" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him. The public unveiling on October 5, 2014 was attended by former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky.
