Poe Returning to Boston is a statue of Edgar Allan Poe in Boston, Massachusetts. It was created by the american sculptor Stefanie Rocknak. The statue is located at the corner of Boylston and Charles streets at Edgar Allan Poe Square.

It is accompanied by an oversized flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a "paper trail" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him. The public unveiling on October 5, 2014 was attended by former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky.
