Reception
Andy Butcher reviewed The Shapeshifters Manual for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that "The Shapeshifter's Manual is both attractively designed and packed with information. It has to be said that using this book will add a fair amount of complexity to the game, both in terms of new rules, and new jargon for players and referees to learn. Despite this, it's something of a must for any Immortal group, new or old."
