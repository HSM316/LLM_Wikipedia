 History 
The December 2013 timetable change applied the S6 designation to an existing hourly service between Rapperswil and Linthal. That service, and the new service, were operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Supplementing the S6 was the Glarner Sprinter, a long-distance train that originated at Zürich Hauptbahnhof and operated every two hours, terminating in Schwanden. The S6 designation had been used for a service between  and , operated by THURBO.

In July 2014, the Glarner Sprinter was designated the S25 of the Zürich S-Bahn, made hourly, and extended to Linthal. The S6, in turn, was cut back to Schwanden. SBB transferred the operation of the S6 to Südostbahn with the December 2020 timetable change.
