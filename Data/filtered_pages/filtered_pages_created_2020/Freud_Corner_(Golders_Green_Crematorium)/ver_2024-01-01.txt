History
When writing his will in 1919, Sigmund Freud stated that he wanted to be cremated as it was a cheaper and easier process than conventional burial.This will was last amended on 28 July 1938, soon after his arrival in London. See Paul Roazen: "Freud's last will", in: Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, 18(3), 1990, 383–385. Freud died at 3 am on 23 September 1939. Three days later, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His son Ernst Freud had organised the funeral arrangements, and Harrods of Knightsbridge acted as funeral directors.Michael Turner:  After the funeral, Freud's ashes were  deposited in an ancient Greek bell krater from the 4th century BC which came from his large collection of over 2000 antiquities (see below). The ancient bell krater, now serving as a funerary urn, was later placed atop a black marble plinth, designed by Ernst FreudList of the works of architect Ernst Freud and erected in the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium. This building, built 1922–1928, was designed after Ernest George's death by Alfred Yeates in Romanesque Revival stylewww.architecture.com - Golders Green Crematorium, London: the East Columbarium (RIBA102395) as a three-sided building, grouped around a central lawn and a lily pond.

On New Year's Day 2014, Golders Green Crematorium staff discovered that burglars had apparently broken into the Ernest George Columbarium overnight and smashed the ancient bell krater containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes in the attempt to steal the vessel. The severely damaged urn was afterwards temporarily moved to a secure location.Maev Kennedy: Urn containing Sigmund Freud's ashes smashed during theft attempt, The Guardian (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.Sigmund Freud's ashes targeted in Golders Green Crematorium raid, BBC Online (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.

Description
Freud Corner occupies a window niche, built in red brick, inside the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium. In the centre of this niche stands a black marble plinth with the funerary urn of Sigmund and Martha Freud on its top. Their names, dates of birth and death are inscribed on the plinth in gold lettering. The vessel containing their ashes is a sealed ancient Greek  bell krater, likely made in Apulia, painted with Dionysian scenes. One of these images depicts Dionysus with a maenad. It is not known why, when, and by whom the decision was made to place Freud's ashes in this vessel; there is no mention of such an intention in any of Freud's correspondence, in his last will, or in any subsequent family correspondence. Freud had received this 2,300-year-old item from Princess Marie Bonaparte for his 75th birthday on 6 May 1931. Freud loved the piece, writing to Marie Bonaparte about it: "...it is a pity one cannot take it into one's grave."Bryony Davies: How did Freud celebrate his birthday?, Freud Museum London (6 May 2019), access date 2019-12-29. He used to  keep the bell krater on display in his study at Berggasse 19, Vienna, until his forced move to the United Kingdom in June 1938.

The white stone shelf to the left of the black marble plinth with the ancient Greek bell krater holds nine urns, . While most of these are brick-sized brownish metal containers inscribed with the name, date of birth and date of death of the deceased, both the ashes of Colin Peter Freud and of Margaret Freud are kept in wooden caskets. The ashes of Dr. Lajos Lévy and his wife Katá are in the same vessel. The cremated remains of the following rest here:
+ Jean-Martin Freud (1889–1967)  Anna Freud (1895–1982)Ernst Freud (1892–1970)  Oliver Freud (1891–1969)Dorothy Burlingham (1891–1979) Colin Peter Freud (1956–1987) Jula Weiss (1905–1994)  Margaret Freud  Dr. Lajos Lévy (1875–1961) and Katá Lévy (1883–1969)

The white stone shelf to the right of the black marble plinth currently holds four urns. The ashes of Tini Maresch are in a brick-sized brownish metal container like those already mentioned. So are those of Mathilde Hollitscher (née Freud) and her husband Robert, which are in the same vessel. The ashes of Anton Walter Freud and his wife Annette share a large wooden casket, while the ashes of Henny Freud are kept in a stone urn made of granite.
