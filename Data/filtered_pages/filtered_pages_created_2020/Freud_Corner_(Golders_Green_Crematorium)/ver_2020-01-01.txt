Freud Corner at Golders Green Crematorium, London 
Greek krater containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes
"Freud Corner" is the name used for the place within Golders Green Crematorium in North London, where the funerary urns of Sigmund Freud and many other members of the Freud family are deposited.

History
When writing his last will in 1919, Sigmund Freud stated that he wanted to be cremated as it was a cheaper and easier process than conventional burial. Three days after Freud's death on 23 September 1939, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.  His son Ernst Freud had organised the funeral arrangements, and Harrods of Knightsbridge acted as funeral directors. After the funeral, Freud's ashes were  deposited in an ancient Greek krater from around 300 BC which came from his collection of antiquities (see below). This urn was later placed atop a black marble plinth, designed by Ernst Freud,List of the works of architect Ernst Freud and erected in the crematorium's East Columbarium. 

After Martha Freud's death in 1951, her ashes were also placed in the krater.Burke, Janine The Sphinx at the Table: Sigmund Freud's Art Collection and the Development of Psychoanalysis, New York: Walker and Co. 2006, p. 340. In the decades since, many more members of the Freud family have been  cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, with their ashes stored next to the black marble plinth with Sigmund and Martha's urn. These later urns are today placed on three-tiered white stone shelves erected on both sides of that plinth. 

On New Year's Day 2014, Golders Green Crematorium staff discovered that burglars had apparently broken into the columbarium overnight and smashed the ancient Greek krater containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes in the attempt to steal the vessel. The severely damaged urn was afterwards temporarily moved to a secure location.Maev Kennedy: Urn containing Sigmund Freud's ashes smashed during theft attempt, The Guardian (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.Sigmund Freud's ashes targeted in Golders Green Crematorium raid, BBC Online (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.
