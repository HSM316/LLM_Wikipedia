History
When writing his will in 1919, Sigmund Freud stated that he wanted to be cremated as it was a cheaper and easier process than conventional burial.This will was last amended on 28 July 1938, soon after his arrival in London. See Paul Roazen: "Freud's last will", in: Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, 18(3), 1990, 383¨C385. Freud died at 3 am on 23 September 1939. Three days later, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His son Ernst Freud had organised the funeral arrangements, and Harrods of Knightsbridge acted as funeral directors.Michael Turner:  After the funeral, Freud's ashes were  deposited in an ancient Greek bell krater from the 4th century BC which came from his large collection of over 2000 antiquities (see below). The ancient bell krater, now serving as a funerary urn, was later placed atop a black marble plinth, designed by Ernst FreudList of the works of architect Ernst Freud and erected in the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium. This building, built 1922¨C1928, was designed after Ernest George's death by Alfred Yeates in Romanesque Revival style www.architecture.com - Golders Green Crematorium, London: the East Columbarium (RIBA102395)  as a three-sided building, grouped around a central lawn and a lily pond.

After Martha Freud's death in 1951, her ashes were also placed into the ancient bell krater.Janine Burke: The Sphinx at the Table: Sigmund Freud's Art Collection and the Development of Psychoanalysis, New York: Walker and Co. 2006, p. 340. In the decades that followed, many more members of the Freud family were cremated at Golders Green:  Robert Hollitscher (Sigmund Freud's son-in-law), who died in 1959; Jean-Martin Freud (Sigmund Freud's son), who died in 1967; Oliver Freud (Sigmund Freud's son), who died in 1969; Ernst Freud (Sigmund Freud's son), who died in 1970; Henny Freud (n¨¦e Fuchs, second wife of Oliver Freud), who died in 1971; Mathilde Hollitscher (Sigmund Freud's daughter, widow of Robert Hollitscher), who died in 1978; Anna Freud (Sigmund Freud's daughter), who died in 1982; Colin Peter Freud (Sigmund Freud's great-grandson), who died in 1987; Annette Freud (n¨¦e Krarup, wife of Anton Walter Freud), who died in 2000 and  Anton Walter Freud, who died in 2004.

The vessels containing  their ashes are today kept on three-tiered white stone shelves erected on either side of the plinth with Sigmund and Martha Freud's funerary urn.

On New Year's Day 2014, Golders Green Crematorium staff discovered that burglars had apparently broken into the Ernest George Columbarium overnight and smashed the ancient bell krater containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes in the attempt to steal the vessel. The severely damaged urn was afterwards temporarily moved to a secure location.Maev Kennedy: Urn containing Sigmund Freud's ashes smashed during theft attempt, The Guardian (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.Sigmund Freud's ashes targeted in Golders Green Crematorium raid, BBC Online (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29. Today the restored urn is protected by a case of special glass and guarded.

Description
Freud Corner occupies a window niche, built in red brick, inside the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium. In the centre of this niche stands a black marble plinth, with the funerary urn of Sigmund and Martha Freud on top. Their names, dates of birth and death are inscribed on the plinth in gold lettering. The vessel containing their ashes is a sealed ancient Greek  bell krater, likely made in Apulia, painted with Dionysian scenes. One of these images depicts Dionysus with a maenad. It is not known why, when, and by whom the decision was made to place Freud's ashes in this vessel; there is no mention of such an intention in any of Freud's correspondence, in his last will, or in any subsequent family correspondence. Freud had received this 2,300-year-old item from Princess Marie Bonaparte for his 75th birthday on 6 May 1931. Freud loved the piece, writing to Marie Bonaparte about it: "...it is a pity one cannot take it into one's grave."Bryony Davies: How did Freud celebrate his birthday?, Freud Museum London (6 May 2019), access date 2019-12-29. He used to  keep the bell krater on display in his study at Berggasse 19, Vienna, until his forced move to the United Kingdom in June 1938. 

The white stone shelf to the left of the black marble plinth with the ancient Greek bell krater currently (2021) holds nine urns. While most of these are brick-sized brownish metal containers inscribed with the name, date of birth and date of death of the deceased, both the cremated remains of Colin Peter Freud and of Margaret Freud are kept in wooden caskets. The ashes of Dr. Lajos L¨¦vy and his wife Kat¨¢ are in the same vessel. The following rest here:
+ Jean-Martin Freud (1889¨C1967)   Anna Freud (1895¨C1982)Ernst Freud (1892¨C1970)  Oliver Freud (1891¨C1969)Dorothy Burlingham (1891¨C1979)   Colin Peter Freud (1956¨C1987) Jula Weiss (1905¨C1994)   Margaret Freud  Dr. Lajos L¨¦vy (1875¨C1961) and Kat¨¢ L¨¦vy (1883¨C1969)

So are those of Mathilde Hollitscher (n¨¦e Freud) and her husband Robert, which are in the same vessel.
