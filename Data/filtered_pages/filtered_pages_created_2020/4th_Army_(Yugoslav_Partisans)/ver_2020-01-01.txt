The 4th Army of the Yugoslav Partisans was a Partisan army that operated in Yugoslavia during the last months of the Second World War. 

The Army was created on 1 March 1945, when Chief Commander Marshal Josip Broz Tito converted the underground National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia in the more regular Yugoslav Army.
