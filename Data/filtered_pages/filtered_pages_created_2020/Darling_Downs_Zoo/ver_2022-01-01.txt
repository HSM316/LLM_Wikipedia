Darling Downs Zoo is a zoo situated in Pilton, Queensland, Australia. The zoo is divided into four separate geographical areas featuring animals from Africa, South America, South-East Asia and Australia.

 History 
The zoo was closed from 27 March to 9 June 2020 due to government restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. As the zoo had large carnivores it had problems feeding them. It relied on bank loans and generous people to cover costs, and also set up a crowdfunding page to raise money. The zoo has since re-opened to the public.
