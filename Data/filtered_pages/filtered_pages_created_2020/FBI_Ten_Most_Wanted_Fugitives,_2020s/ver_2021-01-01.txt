 FBI 10 Most Wanted Fugitives to begin the 2020s 
300px|right|The modern header with blue border used by the FBI on top Ten Fugitive wanted posters since at least 2002, on both the FBI internet web site and in public presentations of the wanted posters.

The FBI in the past has identified individuals by the sequence number in which each individual has appeared on the list. Some individuals have even appeared twice, and often a sequence number was permanently assigned to an individual suspect who was soon caught, captured, or simply removed, before his or her appearance could be published on the publicly released list. In those cases, the public would see only gaps in the number sequence reported by the FBI. For convenient reference, the wanted suspect's sequence number and date of entry on the FBI list appear below, whenever possible.

The following fugitives made up the top Ten list to begin the 2020s:
