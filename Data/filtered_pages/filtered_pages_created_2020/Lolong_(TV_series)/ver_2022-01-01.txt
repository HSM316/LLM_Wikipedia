Broadcaster Jessica Soho came up for the series' concept of conflict between humans and crocodile, which was featured in her show Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho. Lolong is named after a crocodile of the same name, which was known as the world's largest crocodile in captivity. A  long animatronic, enhanced by computer-generated imagery was used to depict the crocodile "Dakila".

In October 2020, Filipino actress Sanya Lopez left the series due to joining the drama series First Yaya. Kim Domingo was also initially attached to appear in the series. Principal photography commenced in July 2021 in Quezon. It was halted in August 2021 due to the enhanced community quarantine in National Capital Region caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
