Fareham Community Hospital is a healthcare facility at Brook Lane in Sarisbury, Hampshire, England. It is managed by the Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust.

History
The facility was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2007. It was built by Morgan Sindall at a cost of Â£10 million and opened in 2010. In 2018 it was estimated that its rooms were only being used 40% of each day and, as such, the hospital was not being used to its full potential.
