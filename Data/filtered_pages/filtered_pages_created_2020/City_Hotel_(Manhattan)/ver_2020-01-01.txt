The City Hotel (1794–1849) stood at 113–119 Broadway, occupying the whole block bounded by Cedar, Temple, and Thames Streets, in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It has been called probably "the first newly built structure in America that qualifies as a hotel". Designed by John McComb Jr., it offered not only luxurious accommodations, but also such amenities as shops, a barroom, and a coffeehouse, as well as public dining and dancing. It replaced the former home of Stephen Delancey (French: Étienne de Lancy), built in 1700, which had become an inn.
