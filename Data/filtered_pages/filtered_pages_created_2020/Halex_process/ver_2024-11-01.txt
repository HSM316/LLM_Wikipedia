In chemistry, the Halex process is used to convert aromatic chlorides to the corresponding aromatic fluorides.  The process entails Halide exchange, hence the name. The reaction conditions call for hot (150-250 °C) solution of the aryl chloride and anhydrous potassium fluoride. Typical solvents are dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and sulfolane.  Potassium chloride is generated in the process. The reaction is mainly applied to nitro-substituted aryl chlorides.  Sometimes more soluble fluorides, such as caesium fluoride and TBAF are used.ACS Green Chemistry Halex Reaction

The following reactions are practiced commercially in this manner:.
2-nitrochlorobenzene  →  2-fluoronitrobenzene
4-nitrochlorobenzene  →  1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene
1,2-dichloronitrobenzene  →  1-chloro-2-fluoro-5-nitrobenzene
1,4-dichloronitrobenzene  →  1-chloro-4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzene
1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene  →  1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
5-chloro-2-nitrobenzotrifluoride  →  5-fluoro-2-nitrobenzotrifluoride
1,3-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene  →  1,3-difluoro-4-nitrobenzene
2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile  →  2,6-difluorobenzonitrile

The nitro groups in the above compounds can be reduced to give the corresponding aniline.  For example, selective hydrogenation of 4-fluoronitrobenzene gives 4-fluoroaniline.  Thus, the Halex method provides access to a host of fluoroanilines.

For producing aryl fluorides, the Halex process is complementary to the Balz-Schiemann reaction and its variants.
