In 1996 MacDonald founded the journal Paediatrics & Child Health, which was the first Canadian journal on paediatric medicine. Her research considered the microbiology of cystic fibrosis, sexually transmitted infections in adolescents and the development of vaccinations for infectious diseases.

In 1999 MacDonald left Ottawa and moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. At Dalhousie University she became the first woman in Canada to be elected Dean of a Faculty of Medicine, and held this position until 2004. That year she was a founding member of the World Health Organisation Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, and has held various positions on technical committees and in training development since then. She remains on their Strategic Advisory Committee on Immunisation, which considers the demand for vaccines, as well as serving as a consultant for vaccine safety.

 Affiliations 
In 2004, with support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation she founded the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCfV). The CCfV was established to implement and evaluate vaccine technologies as well as training experts in infectious diseases and global health. She has spoken about the dangers of vaccine hesitancy and how the internet permits the dangerous messaging of anti-vaxxers.

MacDonald serves on the advisory board of the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases and on the Board of Directors of Academics Without Borders. MacDonald is interested in building the healthcare capacity of the developing world. She co-founded East Africa's MicroResearch, a program that looks to support local health providers. MicroResearch is modelled on principles from microfinance, developing solutions that are appropriate for the context and culture of African communities. From 2008 to 2019 MicroResearch had led more than forty two-week workshops across seven African countries, training in excess of 1000 healthcare professionals and community members. In particular MicroResearch looked to train women, improving their opportunities for leadership and tackling the gender gap in African research. The success of the programme resulted in a similar version being launched in Canada in 2016.
