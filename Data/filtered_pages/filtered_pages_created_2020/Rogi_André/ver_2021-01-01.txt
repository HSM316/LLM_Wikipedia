Attracted to the bohemian milieu of Paris like other Hungarians including Brassai and André Kertesz, André settled there in 1925. Indeed, on 2 October 1928, she married Kertész who was her neighbour, although this marriage was short-lived and, from his first name, she created a new identity 'Rogi André'. 

She produced a series of portraits of personalities in the arts during starting in the 1930s. Several are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. They include Fernand Léger, Florent Fels, Alberto Giacometti, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Joan Miró, Jacques Lipchitz, and also André Derain, with a 1939 print of his portrait being held by London's National Portrait Gallery. In 1937, she photographed Dora Maar.
