The Pakistan cricket team are scheduled to tour South Africa in April 2021 to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series will form part of the inaugural 2020â€“23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.

Originally, the matches were scheduled to be played in October 2020. However, in August 2020, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following month, it was confirmed that both cricket boards were looking for a window in the international calendar to play the matches. In October 2020, Cricket South Africa announced that the tour had been rescheduled for April 2021.
