The Pakistan cricket team toured South Africa in April 2021 to play three One Day International (ODI) and four Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League.

Originally, the matches were scheduled to be played in October 2020. However, in August 2020, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following month, it was confirmed that both cricket boards were looking for a window in the international calendar to play the matches. In October 2020, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced that the tour had been rescheduled for April 2021. In January 2021, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that the tour was still on their schedule for the 2021 calendar year. In February 2021, the tour dates were confirmed, including the addition of a fourth T20I fixture. On 4 March 2021, CSA announced that Temba Bavuma had been appointed as South Africa's limited overs captain, taking over the role from Quinton de Kock.

Pakistan won the first ODI by three wickets, with South Africa winning the second match by seventeen runs to level the series. Pakistan won the third ODI by 28 runs to win the series 2–1. In the T20I series, Pakistan won the first match by four wickets, with South Africa winning the second match by six wickets. The third match saw Pakistan win by nine wickets, with their captain Babar Azam scoring his first century in the format. Pakistan won the fourth T20I by three wickets to win the series 3–1.
