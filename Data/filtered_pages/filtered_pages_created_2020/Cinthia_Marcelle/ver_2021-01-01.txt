 Art 
Cinthia Marcelle's art is mainly characterized by the synthesis and concision of language in her work. She takes inspiration from things she sees in her everyday life such as typical objects, places, and their interactions. 

She has had solo exhibitions at MoMA PS1, and the Secession. She has also been included in the 2018 Berlin Biennale, the 2013 Istanbul Biennial, the 2012 New Museum Triennial, the 2015 Sharjah Biennial, and the 2017 Venice Biennale. 

One of her first well seen art pieces were photographs that she had made together with the South African artist, Jean Meeran (Capa Morada, 2003). In these photos, Marcelle disappeared into the landscape, dressed in a cape with matching colors so that herself and the city elided (Capa Morada, 2003). In one of her installation pieces, Education by Stone, she pushed numerous rods of chalk, a traditional teaching material, into the school-turned-gallery. This was seen at the MOMA in 2016.

She is the recipient of the 2010 Future Generation Prize. Marcelle applied for the prize when she was 35 and submitted three films which were featured at the Pinchuk Art Center in Kiev, Ukraine.
