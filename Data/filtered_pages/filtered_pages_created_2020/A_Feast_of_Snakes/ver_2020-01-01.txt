A Feast of Snakes is a novel by Harry Crews.  It was published by Atheneum Books in 1976. Many critics consider it to be Crews's best novel. It would be his last for more than a decade. 

The novel is about an annual snake roundup in Mystic, Georgia.

Kirkus gave the novel a glowing review, writing that "Crews is a true regional writer out of the heart of the redneck rural south and besides the brutality  . . . there's the humor, the dynamite dialogue, and the real despair--all tetched with talent." Guy Owen, in The Georgia Review, called it a "surrealistic study of violence and competitiveness in the South." Time thought that is was "full of brilliant descriptions and characters attempting to kick and gouge their way through some back door to salvation." The Virginia Quarterly Review described the paperback edition as "a fierce and funny account of life in Mystic."

A Feast of Snakes was for a time banned in South Africa.
