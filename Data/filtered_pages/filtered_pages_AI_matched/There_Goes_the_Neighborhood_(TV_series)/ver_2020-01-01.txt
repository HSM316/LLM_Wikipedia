There Goes the Neighborhood (originally to be titled Block Party) is an American prime-time reality television program on CBS. The show premiered on August 9, 2009, and features eight suburban families shut out from the outside world with no television, internet, phones, or contact with anybody outside of their neighborhood. The families will compete in challenges against each other. Each week, one family will be banished from the neighborhood, thereby eliminating the family from contention for the show's $250,000 prize fund. The show's executive producers are Jay Bienstock and Mike Fleiss. The show's presenter is Matt Rogers, a finalist on American Idol 3.

 Production 
The show was recorded in Kennesaw, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, specifically on the 2500 block of Fairlawn Downs NW in the Legacy Park community's Annandale Main. For the program, producers built a  tall wall around the competitors' neighborhood to enforce their isolation from the outside world. Electricity and gas utilities for most household luxuries were cut off from each family's home.

Production for the show began in early June 2009. The families being placed into lockdown within the constructed barriers beginning on June 15.

 Gameplay 
The program's gameplay is extremely similar to that of the American version of Big Brother (specifically Big Brother 2). In each episode, families will compete in a challenge in order to win rewards and safety from elimination. The winner will name two families to face the neighbourhood vote. The families will then vote to force one family to leave the neighborhood for the remainder of the series. In the finale, it is presumed that the six eliminated families will return to the neighborhood to vote for the show's winner.
