PureSolo is an application creation company specialising in music and vocal recording technology for a range of mobile devices.

Once users download their chosen PureSolo app from their preferred store, they gain access to a catalogue containing thousands of professionally produced backing tracks and accompaniments. Once a track has been selected, users can record their performance using the app’s own built-in recorder.

Once completed, a recording can then be exported to social and video networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. User profiles can also created on PureSolo apps where members can upload a photo, share feedback, follow favourite artists and promote their tracks.

The current catalogue contains recordable versions of songs for karaoke, guitar, and accompaniment.  With 35 different genres of music, from rock and hip hop through to jazz and Classical, there is a wide variety of tracks to choose from for over 20 different instruments."Behind the music: PureSolo gives Karaoke a revamp", The Guardian, 2 July 2010
