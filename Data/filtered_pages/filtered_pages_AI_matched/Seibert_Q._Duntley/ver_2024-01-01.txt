Seibert Quimby Duntley was an American physicist. He was born in Bushnell, Illinois on October 2, 1911. 
Education
He received an SB in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1933. Duntley received an MS degree from California Institute of Technology in 1935 and an Sc.D. in physics from MIT in 1939. 
Career
While at MIT, Duntley met and worked with Karl Taylor Compton, Harold Eugene Edgerton, and many other prominent physicists. Duntley's primary interest was in applied physics particularly the optics of turbid media.S. Q.

He started the Visibility Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939/40. It was the brainchild of Duntley and MIT physics chair Dr. Arthur C. Hardy.  It was focused on applying optics to such problems as camouflage, misdirection of aerial bombardment, target location, visibility of submerged objects at sea.  In 1952, Roger Revelle and Quimby Duntley agreed that the laboratory would become part of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, and the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships agreed to pay for the move.History of the Scripps Visibility Lab http://www.physics.miami.edu/optics/ken/OtherPapers/A25_VA_OOXVI_2002.pdf The work of the laboratory centered on the transmission of visible light through the atmosphere and water and the related problems of image formation and recognition. The nature of much of the research required measurements of the optical properties of the ocean or atmosphere for which no instruments existed. As a result of these requirements, many unique and very specialized instruments were developed by the laboratory, many of which were based on concepts or optical designs devised by Duntley.  He earned the academic rank of professor in 1966 and taught at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and at the Department of Applied Physics and Information Science (APIS) at UCSD until his retirement.
