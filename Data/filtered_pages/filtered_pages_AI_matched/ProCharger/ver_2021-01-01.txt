Billet impellers are manufactured from large diameter sticks of 7075 T-6 aluminum, which are cut to height on the saw, contoured on a CNC lathe and then machined on a CNC mill (5 axis, 4 axis or 3 axis, depending on complexity).  On its street-legal superchargers, ProCharger offers a choice of noise levels, with the quieter "stealth" gearset featuring a helical design.Supercharger Systems and Upgrades - Pressurized Power - Modified Mustangs & Fords Magazine  Quality control includes running every supercharger that leaves the facility, rather than random sampling.Procharger HQ Tour Truckin Magazine  The engineering team utilizes 3D computer-aided design software, rapid prototyping equipment, a large test lab, and engine and chassis dynamometers during the R&D process.ProCharger Shop Tour: How Superchargers Are Made - StangTV
