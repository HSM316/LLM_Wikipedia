The range is in the process of becoming Ireland's first designated wilderness area, a 10-15 year project including remaking forest roads as walking trails and setting up huts for sustainable camping. The wilderness, when finished, will cover 16,000 hectares including a large amount of Ballycroy National Park and Coillte land.
