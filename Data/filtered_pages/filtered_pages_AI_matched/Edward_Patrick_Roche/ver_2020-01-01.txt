He was appointed Archbishop by Pope Pius X. and consecrated by Monsignor Stagni, Apostolic Delegate to Newfoundland at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist 29 June 1915.

He suffered from tuberculosis, however it was treated in New York and was able to return to his pastoral duties.

Responsible for the developments of many educational institutions he was significantly responsible for the development of St. Clare's Mercy Hospital.

He opposed the confederation of Newfoundland and Canada as did many other Catholic clergy, and articulated his view prior to the 1948 referendums. In reaction to this, the Loyal Orange Association advised Protestants to resist Catholic influence by supporting union with Canada.  The results were correlated with demographics, and a majority of districts on the Avalon peninsula with mostly Catholic voters supported responsible government instead of confederation.
