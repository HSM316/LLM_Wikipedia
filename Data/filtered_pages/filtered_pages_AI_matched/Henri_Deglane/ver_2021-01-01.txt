Henri Deglane (22 June 1902 â€“ 7 July 1975) was a French wrestler. He was an Olympic Champion in Greco-Roman wrestling and AWA World Champion.

In May 1931, Deglane faced Ed "Strangler" Lewis for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in Montreal in a two-out-of-three falls match. After two falls, Deglane had feigned being bitten by Lewis, when in reality he had been bitten in the locker room. This led to Deglane being awarded the title via disqualification and a dispute over who was actually acknowledged as champion over the next two years.

In July 1937 in Paris, France, Deglane lost his European Heavyweight Championship title to American Al Pereira.http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=titles&titel=1055
