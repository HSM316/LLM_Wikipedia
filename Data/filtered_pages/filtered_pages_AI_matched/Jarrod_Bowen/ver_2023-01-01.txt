 Style of play 
Regarded as a quick, direct, mobile, energetic player with good technique and an eye for goal, Jarrod Bowen is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball in order to create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates. A versatile forward, he primarily plays as a winger on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind the defence towards goal. He can also play in the centre as main striker, behind the main striker as either an attacking midfielder or second striker.

Personal life
Bowen's father, Sam, was a former semi-professional footballer. Whilst at Merthyr Tydfil, for whom he scored five goals on his debut for in August 1996, Sam won a trial with West Ham under the management of Harry Redknapp, before the move fell through due to Merthyr's financial demands for Sam's services. Sam also scored hat-tricks on his debuts for Forest Green Rovers and Worcester City, leading to the South Wales Argus labelling him a "debut king" upon his transfer to Newport County in January 2004.

In October 2021, Bowen was reported to be in a relationship with reality television personality Dani Dyer.
