Style of play
Bowen has been compared to former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich legend Arjen Robben through his footballing talent, with sports journalist Daniel Emery stating, "He is a budget Arjen Robben in the way that he plays. Championship defenders know exactly what he is going to do, but they simply cannot stop it. He gets the ball on the channel on the right and looks to cut inside onto his left foot and find the far corner. Despite it being his trademark move, defenders still struggle to prevent him from getting his shot off. Would Premier League defenders stifle him? It remains to be seen."
