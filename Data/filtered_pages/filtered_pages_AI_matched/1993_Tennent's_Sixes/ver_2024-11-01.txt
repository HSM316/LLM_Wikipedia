 Incidents and events 
Davie Irons of Partick Thistle was voted Player of the Tournament.
Darren Jackson of Hibs' goal against Aberdeen was the 900th goal scored in the tournament's history.
Tosh McKinlay of Hearts' goal against Airdrie was the 1000th goal scored in the tournament's history. He and Davie Cooper (scorer of the 1st ever goal) were later presented with a special quaich each.
 Partick Thistle's win over Motherwell at 7 6 was the equal highest scoring game in the competition's history. 
 Huntly (Highland League Cup holders) played Vale of Leithen (from the EoSFL) in an exhibition match.
Hibs exited the group stage in dubious fashion. Referee Bill Crombie penalized Hibs for time wasting in the Celtic match, despite Hibs being in possession of the ball with two players still in the opponents half. Celtic scored from it and as a result of that goal St Johnstone qualified at the expense of Hibs because of goal difference.
The 1993 edition brought the sponsors Tennent Caledonian's total investment to over £3,000,000 in the history of the tournament.
