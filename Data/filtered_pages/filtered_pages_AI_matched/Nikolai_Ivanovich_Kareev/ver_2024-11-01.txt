Nikolai Ivanovich Kareev (; 6 December 1850 – 18 February 1931) was a historian and philosopher from the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. He was educated at Moscow and earned his doctorate in history in 1884.

Life

Like many other intellectuals in Russia, Kareev was deeply influenced by the liberal, progressive, constitutional, and Socialist movements developing in Russia in the late nineteenth century.  Peter Kropotkin, the Russian Anarchist, describes him as one of the few who correctly understood the French Revolution, because he had studied "movements preceding the revolution of July 14".
