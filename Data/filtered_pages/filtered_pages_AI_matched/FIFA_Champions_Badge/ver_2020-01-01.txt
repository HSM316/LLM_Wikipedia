Ronaldo wears the FIFA Champions Badge (upper left) on his Real Madrid jersey; Madrid held a FIFA badge continuously for 1,098 days, a record by any club team.

The FIFA Champions Badge is a jersey-emblem in the shape of a gold and white shield, awarded by FIFA to the reigning world champions of FIFA competitions, both at national team level (e.g. World Cup, Women's World Cup, Futsal World Cup, and FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup), and at club team level (e.g. Club World Cup). 

The badge can only be worn on the first-term jerseys (not on reserve team jerseys, or on training clothing), of the reigning titleholders, and is thus a temporary award.  FIFA made the first award of the badge in February 2008 to A.C. Milan, the then reigning 2007 FIFA Club World Cup champions.

This official FIFA badge contrasts with informal symbols worn by various teams to signify important victories or trophies, such as stars. 

Award

The badge has the shape of a shield measuring 78 millimetres by 58 millimetres, and shows the image of the relevant trophy, with the inscription FIFA WORLD CHAMPIONS, next to the year in which the relevant FIFA competition had been won.  The badge comes in two colour schemes – gold letters on a white background, and white letters on a gold background.  The winning national team or club team carries the badge on their shirt until the end of the next edition of the relevant FIFA tournament; thus, it is only worn by reigning champions.

The badge can be displayed on jerseys from the day the team becomes FIFA world champions, up to and including the day of the final of the next staging of the competition (e.g. if the team wins the competition again, they can hold the badge uninterrupted). The badge can only be worn on the club's first-team jerseys – being the team that won the relevant FIFA world competition – and cannot be worn on any derivative or retrospective form of the club's current first-team jersey, or on any related club training clothing, or by the club's reserve teams/any other of the club's teams.

Non-FIFA licensing

Separate agreement can be required to wear the badge in non-FIFA organised competitions; for example, in 2009, the English FA granted Manchester United, the reigning 2008 FIFA Club World Cup holders, permission to wear the badge during F.A. Cup fixtures but not in Premier League fixtures, and a similar arrangement was sought for Liverpool F.C. when they became 2019 FIFA Club World Cup holders; however, the English FA granted Liverpool F.C. the right to use it for one home premiership fixture against Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. on 29 December 2019.  In contrast, Real Madrid were allowed to wear their FIFA Champions Badge on their jerseys during all of their Spanish La Liga fixtures.

History
Carli Lloyd wears the FIFA Champions Badge on her United States women's national soccer team jersey; the US women's team has held the award continuously since 5 July 2015, a national team record.

The first official award of the badge was made in February 2008 to the reigning holders of the FIFA Club World Cup, Italian club A.C. Milan, who had won the title in 2007. At the time of the award to A.C. Milan, FIFA declared that the three previous winners of the FIFA World Club Cup, Corinthians, São Paulo FC, and Sport Club Internacional, could also wear the badge until a new winner was crowned in the December 2008 World Club Cup final.  However, when Corinthians won the badge in the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA confirmed that it was their first time officially winning the FIFA Champions Badge.

In September 2008, the badge was extended to the FIFA World Cup and was presented to Italy, who were reigning champions (having won it in 2006), thus becoming the first national team to wear the badge. 

In 2009, the badge was extended to the FIFA Women's World Cup, and awarded to Germany, reigning champions from 2007; and in 2011 it was won by Japan. 

The badge was further extended to the FIFA Futsal World Cup in 2012, where is was first won by Brazil. 

In 2013, the badge was extended to the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, where it was first won by Russia.

Records

On 22 December 2019, Liverpool F.C. ended Real Madrid’s uninterrupted reign as FIFA Club World Cup Champions Badge holders that lasted 1,098 days from the 18 December 2016; it was the longest continuous period for which any club team has held a FIFA Champions Badge.

The United States women's national soccer team has held a FIFA World Cup Champions Badge uninterrupted since 5 July 2015, when it won the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, which is the longest continuous period for which any national team has held a FIFA Champions Badge.
