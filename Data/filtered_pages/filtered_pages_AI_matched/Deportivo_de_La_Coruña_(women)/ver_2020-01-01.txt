Deportivo entered in the women's football in the 1980s after absorbing Karbo C.F. that changed it's name to Karbo Deportivo de La Coruña completely integrated into the structure of Deportivo de La Coruña, also using the colors and shield of Deportivo. The team won the first official women's football competitions in Spain (the current Copa de la Reina, called Spanish Championship before the foundation of the women's football league) until 1985.

The section was dissolved in 1988 due to the economic problems that the R.C. Deportivo, plunged into a suffocating debt and with the men's team on the verge of relegation to Segunda División B, as well as an increase in expenses for the increasing professionalization of women's football, a year before Superliga was created.
