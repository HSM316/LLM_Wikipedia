(2000). Written on the body: The tattoo in European and American history / edited by Jane Caplan. London: Reaktion.  Redcloud was covered in tattoos, which fascinated Broadbent. This fascination would lead Redcloud to introduce Broadbent to his tattoo artist, Charlie Wagner. In 1927, Wagner, alongside several other tattoo artists, including Tony Rhineagear, Joe Van Hart, and Red Gibbons, tattooed a bodysuit of over 565 tattoos on Broadbent. Charlie Wagner was friends with the circus man Clyde Ingalls. When Ingalls discovered Broadbent’s passion for tattooing, he offered her a position at the circus. In the same year, Broadbent began exhibiting her art with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. While working at the circus, Broadbent also trained as a steer rider who would perform with circus performer Tom Mix. Later in Broadbent’s career, she learned how to ride horses and mules.Betty Broadbent—Tattooed Beauty http://thehumanmarvels.com/?p=148	

Broadbent’s tattoos varied in theme. On Broadbent’s back, she had a tattoo of the Madonna and child. The art on her lower limbs included a tattoo of Charles Lindbergh on her right leg and a tattoo of Pancho Villa on her left. One of Broadbent’s more famous tattoos took over six sittings, a spread-eagle that stretched from one shoulder to the other. On May 3, of 1939, the New York Times would quote Broadbent stating, “It hurt something awful, but it was worth it.” While working in a sideshow in 1939, Broadbent challenged the traditional views of beauty for women during the 1930s by participating in a beauty pageant at the 1939 New York World's Fair.Betty Broadbent at 1939 World's Fair
