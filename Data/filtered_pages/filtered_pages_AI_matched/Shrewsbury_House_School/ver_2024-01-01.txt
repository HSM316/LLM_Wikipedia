Shrewsbury House School, commonly referred to as SHS or Shrewsbury House, is an independent day preparatory school for boys aged 7 to 13, in Surbiton at the edge of Greater London close to the Surrey border, its historic county, in England. Established in 1865 it is among the minority of extant Preparatory Schools founded before the year 1900.

A proportion of pupils achieve results at Common Entrance Examinations to gain entry to schools such as public schools.

The school has been an educational trust since 1979 administered by a Board of Governors some of whom are among its trustees. All of the Governors, except two of the educationalists and the medical expert, are former parents.

History

Shrewsbury House School was founded in 1865 by Rev. Henry Wilson, a local clergyman, in the centre of Surbiton and derived its name from the Wilson family’s association with the town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire.

In 1910 the School moved to Haulkerton, a large Victorian Arts and Crafts mansion dating, from the mid-nineteenth century, on Ditton Hill. The main house was renamed Shrewsbury House and the School has remained there ever since.

For the next 70 years, the School was operated by a series of private owners, most notably Henry Hamilton-Miller, who gave the School his family coat of arms and the motto Alta Peto. In 1979, the School became a charitable trust, administered by a Board of Governors, known as the Shrewsbury House School Trust.

In 2009, the school took over the pre-preparatory department of nearby Milbourne Lodge School, which was renamed Shrewsbury Lodge School and later Shrewsbury House Pre-Preparatory School, after The Rowans School, Wimbledon, joined the Shrewsbury House School Trust in 2017
