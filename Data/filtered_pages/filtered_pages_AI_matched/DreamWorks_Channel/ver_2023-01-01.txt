 History 
 As a standalone TV Channel 
DreamWorks Animation announced plans to launch its own TV channel on 9 December 2014 starting in Asia, rolling out over 19 countries in the second half of 2015. Singapore-based broadcaster HBO Asia was contracted to handle marketing, sales and technical services for the channel in Southeast Asia. The studio's first foray into television channel operations in any part of the world was represented with the launch of its first dedicated channel on 1 August 2015 in Thailand through a joint venture through with CTH.

A Middle East and North Africa feed of the channel launched on 1 August 2016 in partnership with the beIN Channels Network.

The channel was placed under the NBCU International executive vice president of Lifestyle and Kids, Duccio Donati, in August 2017, following the NBCU/Comcast takeover of DreamWorks Animation. This paired the channel with E! international channels and NBCU Lifestyle Channel content. On 1 January 2018, NBCUniversal International Networks took over HBO Asia's role with DreamWorks Channel in Southeast Asia.

The channel launched on KPN in the Netherlands on 23 July 2019.

The channel launched as a one-month pop-up channel in Australia via Foxtel on channel 700 throughout June 2020 and returned as a regular 24/7 network the following year.

The Sub-Saharan African feed of the channel originally launched on StarTimes on 3 August 2020, but closed/shut down on 17 February 2022 and was supplemented by Nickelodeon on StarTimes ON in July 2022. MultiChoice and NBCUIN jointly announced on 8 March 2022 that the channel would launch on DStv a week later on 18 March. On its launch, the channel took over the service channel number slot previously held by Disney XD which was shut down on 1 October 2020 and supplement eToonz alongside PBS Kids. The Sub-Saharan African channel is available on the DStv Compact, DStv Compact Plus and DStv Premium subscription packages in South Africa and on the DStv Premium and DStv Compact Plus subscription packages in the rest of Africa, although the channel was made available on the lower-tiered DStv Family and DStv Access subscription packages until 18 April to promote Team Zenko Go, The Bad Guys and The Boss Baby: Back in the Crib. From 27 June to 15 July 2022, the channel was made available on DStv Family alongside Disney Channel to promote Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight and Illumination's Minions: The Rise of Gru.

The Philippines feed of the channel launched via Cignal on 11 September 2021, with aired productions dubbed in the Filipino language. It was also launched on SkyCable in mid-November that same year, though SkyCable uses its original English feed instead.
