Atropa acuminata, also known as maitbrand or Indian belladonna, is a close relative of deadly nightshade of Europe and North Africa and, like it, is an extremely poisonous plant valued in medicine for its richness in tropane alkaloids with anticholinergic, deliriant, antispasmodic and mydriatic properties. The specific name acuminata signifies acuminate i.e. 'tapering to a long point' - in reference to the distinctive shape of the leaves.http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=86842&flora_id=5
