The Lillian Massey Building's longer facade in this photo is located along Queen's Park; the shorter facade fronts onto Bloor Street.
The Lillian Massey Building is a Neoclassical building located in Downtown Toronto, at the southeast corner of Queen's Park and Bloor Street along the Mink Mile and across from the Royal Ontario Museum. It was designed by architect George Martell Miller (1855–1933) and built between 1908 and 1912 for the University of Toronto's Household Science program created by Lillian Massey Treble, daughter of wealthy Canadian business man, Hart Massey. It presently houses the offices of the University of Toronto's Department of Classics and Centre for Medieval Studies, the offices of the University of Toronto's Division of University Advancement, and Club Monaco’s flagship retail store renovated by Fort Architects. 

Architecture
Designed by George Martell Miller in the Neoclassical style, the building features Indiana Limestone facades with columns topped with Ionic capitals. There are several pediments including one supported by columns forming the grand portico fronting Queen's Park. The interior of the University of Toronto part of the building has been kept almost unchanged, featuring marble tile flooring and finishes, while the Club Monaco interiors were modified to fit the needs of a retail store. 

Fort Architects renovated the interior of Club Monaco's part of the building with drywall and hardwood flooring before installing shelves. The original underground pool was also covered by a false floor to house the men's section of the store. Landscaping is kept to a minimum as tree planters are used in front of the Club Monaco facade to frame its entrance.
