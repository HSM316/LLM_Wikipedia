The Chilliwack Cultural Centre is a performing arts venue located in downtown Chilliwack, one hour east of Vancouver, British Columbia. The $22 million cultural facility celebrated its grand opening on September 25, 2010 with a concert by Lisa Howard, Jason Graae, David Burnham, Jessica Hendy, and Scott Coulter.

The facility is located on City-owned land at The Landing, adjacent to existing sports and recreation facilities, as well as Prospera Centre, and took two years to build.
