Ghiath Matar was a Syrian activist who became known for giving flowers and roses to army soldiers in his home town of Daraya.

Death
Ghiath was arrested on 6 September 2011 by the security forces of the Syrian government. Four days later, his body was returned to his family with clear scars and sores resulting from severe torture. His funeral was attended by the ambassadors of the United States, Japan, Germany, France and Denmark. When Ghiath died, his wife was expecting their first baby. The baby was named after his father.

Ghiath Matar became a symbol of peaceful resistance of the Syrian revolution.
