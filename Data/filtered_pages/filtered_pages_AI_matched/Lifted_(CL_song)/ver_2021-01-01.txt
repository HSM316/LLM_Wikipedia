"Lifted" is a song by South Korean singer and songwriter CL. It was released as her debut American single on August 19, 2016.

Background
The song was written by CL, Asher Roth, and Teddy Park, with the production being handled by the latter. It heavily samples the song "Method Man" by Wu-Tang Clan.

Critical reception
Colette Bennett of The Daily Dot said "something about [the song] seems too simple" and went on to say that "CL's rapping is strong as usual" and "the song has a chill, reggae-inspired vibe". Billboards Tamar Herman stated that the song "diverges sharply from CL's image as one of South Korea's most prominent female rappers and eschews her typical aggressive style. Referencing drugs and liquor liberally while roaming around New York City, this isn't the same CL that K-pop fans are used to. Built for listening to on a hazy summer day, 'Lifted' takes a step back from CL's typical raps, aside from a quick bit at the beginning of the song." Nolan Feeney of Entertainment Weekly labeled it "a solid-gold banger".

Music video
A music video for the song, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on August 18, 2016.

Live performances
CL performed the song live for the first time on The Late Late Show with James Corden on September 15, 2016. It was also performed throughout CL's Hello Bitches Tour in late 2016. She also performed the song on SBS Gayo Daejun, the first time the song was performed in Korea.
