The Grace Mellman Community Library (Temecula County Center Library), located in Temecula, California, is a member of the Riverside County Library System.  As a full-service library, it has over 80,000 items, and offers materials, programs, and services for all ages which include guest speakers, free movie nights and a monthly book club.

To reach the children's room, students pass through a "magic tunnel", an experience shared by many first-grade students in the city.

After the city experienced tremendous growth, a second library, the Temecula Public Library, opened on December 14, 2006.

Volunteer services, such as staffing a used bookstore, are provided by the Friends of the Temecula Libraries.

Library hours vary per day of the week, but is closed on Sundays and Federal holidays.
