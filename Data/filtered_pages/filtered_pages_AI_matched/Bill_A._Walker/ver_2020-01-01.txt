Bill A. Walker (29 August 1886 â€“ 8 November 1934) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Essendon in the VFL.

Walker, also known by his nickname 'Johnnie', was recruited from the Collingwood Juniors. A ruckman, he was a member of Essendon's 1911 and 1912 premiership teams. His 14 goals in 1915 was enough to top Essendon's goal-kicking.
