Football
Essendon (VFL)
Walker, also known by his nickname 'Johnnie', was recruited from the Collingwood Juniors.Gossip in General from All Quarters, The Herald, (Friday, 28 April 1911), p.2.

A ruckman, he made his senior VFL debut in 1911 and was a member of Essendon's 1911 and 1912 premiership teams. Walker's 14 goals in 1915 was enough to top Essendon's goal-kicking. Although selected to represent the VFL in a match against a combined Bendigo Football League team, played in Bendigo on 3 July 1912, he did not play in the game.Football, (Thursday, 4 July 1912), p.8.

Although he missed the team's first match, against Collingwood, he played in the remaining eleven matches of the (truncated due to World War I) 1915 season.

Essendon did not compete in the VFL in 1916 and 1917. Walker did not resume his career in 1918, when Essendon re-entered the competition.

VFL Tribunal (30 July 1913)
In July 1913 Walker, who played in a long-sleeved guernsey, was reported by both Dan Feehan, the match steward, and Jack Elder, the central umpire, for striking (ex-Essendon) Fitzroy's Jim Martin with his elbow during the 26 July 1913 match against Fitzroy.

In the evidence given to the tribunal it was established that Mertin had, indeed, been elbowed by somebody; and that the perpetrator had been wearing a short-sleeve guernsey. Martin gave evidence that it was not Walker who had struck him, but it was Jack Woolley. Jack Woolley also appeared before the tribunal, stating that he had worn a short-sleeved guernsey, and that it was he, rather than Walker, who had had struck Martin with his elbow. The charge against Walker was dismissed.Rough Football: Charges of Elbowing, The Age, (Thursday, 31 July 1913), p.11.Football: League Players Reported: Mistaken Identity,The Argus, (Thursday, 31 July 1913), p.4.Elbow Room, The Herald, (Friday, 1 August 1913), p.3.
