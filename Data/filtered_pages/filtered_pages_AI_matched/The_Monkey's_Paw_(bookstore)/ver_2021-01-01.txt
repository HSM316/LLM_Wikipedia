The Monkey's Paw is an independent used bookstore in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, specializing in books in eclectic, odd, or miscellaneous categories. The store was located in the Dundas West Portugal Village but moved in the Spring of 2016 to Bloor St. West
Toronto. It is well known for its eclectic store front display of arcane and absurd books.

The Monkey's Paw was created in 2006 by the owner Stephen Fowler after moving from San Francisco in 2002 where he previously worked in numerous bookstores. The impetus for opening the bookstore was due to the need to support his family with another income source. The inspiration and book selection methods of the store is based on his work in a previous San Francisco bookstore that placed books that were too unique, specific, or unusual for a single-subject category under a miscellaneous section "Floop". Many, including the owner, consider the store itself a showcase and homage to the printed book, which they believe to be dying medium. Due to the notoriety and uniqueness of the bookstore, Fowler was invited to join the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers.

The Biblio-mat
In November 2012, the store introduced a Biblio-mat machine which dispenses a random book for a $2 coin.
The New York Timess Style Magazine quoted the owner, "It's the store where you'll find the book you didn't know you were looking for." As of November of 2020, the price per book has been jacked up to $3.
