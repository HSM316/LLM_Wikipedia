Edward Asa Raymond (also, Asa Raymond, Junior "... that Asa Raymond, Junior, may take the name of Edward Asa Raymond.") was a Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Massachusetts from 1849-1851 "Edward Asa Raymond, Grand Master of Masons in Massachusetts, 1849-51, was named Sovereign Grand Commander ... In a Supreme Council meeting in Boston in August 1860 ... The following day, the Council met without the Grand Commander ... adopted a resolution that the Council should elect a new Sovereign Grand Commander. ... Raymond continued to claim the title ... As Hays and Raymond were now both dead, emotions were cooler. In May 1867, the “Union of 1867” was signed formally uniting both organizations..." His later tenure as Grand Sovereign Commander of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite was marked by a schism in 1860 which resulted in two competing organizations which both claimed legitimacy. This schism was eventually resolved in 1867, after Raymond's death.
