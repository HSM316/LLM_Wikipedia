Genesis Points table
The Order of Merit used a points system, called Genesis Points. Points were awarded based on the player's position in each event. 1,000 points were awarded to the winner, 600 points for second place, down to 5 points for those finishing outside the top 60. All 17 events had the same points. Lee Hyung-joon did not win any tournaments but made the cut in all 17 events and was second twice and third three times.
