The Heresy Act 1382 (5 Ric. 2. Stat. 2. c. 5) was an Act of the Parliament of England. The Act stated that the Chancellor should issue commissions for the arrest of heretical preachers by the authority of certificates from the bishops.

The Act was repealed in a later Parliament of the same year as the knights of the shires claimed it had not passed the House of Commons.Dudley Julius Medley, A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History. Sixth Edition (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1925), p. 601.
