 Most important scientific contributions 
 Experimental demonstration of discrete solitons and their dynamical properties: Opened up one of the most prolific fields of research in nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear integrated optics of the last decade.  
 Demonstration of Anderson Localisations and band gap structures in waveguide arrays: Leading to a new generation of "affordable" Meta material-like structures.
 Kerr spatio-temporal solitons in a planar glass waveguide (light bullets) and liquid crystals, X waves in bi-dispersive media, self-accelerating non-diffractive beams
 Ultrafast, extremely low power nonlinear optics in glass and semiconductor integrated waveguides
 Pioneer in the field of nonlinear optics in the THz Regime: A state of the art high power THz source to probe the nonlinear interaction of intense few-cycle terahertz pulses, demonstration of nonlinear wavelength conversion using THz waves, opening the door to new THz characterization techniques, and the demonstration of the first THz Optical Isolator.
