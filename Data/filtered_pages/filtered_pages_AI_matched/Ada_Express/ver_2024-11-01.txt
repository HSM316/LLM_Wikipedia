The Ada Express () is a limited stop regional train service operating between Gebze, Kocaeli and Adapazarı. It was inaugurated on 5 January 2015 as a replacement for the popular Adapazarı Express train service. However, unlike its predecessor, the Ada Express Adapazarı Gebze Tren Saatleri  does not make local stops and run as often and it does not operate into central Adapazarı. Trains mostly consist of TVS2000 cars and use E68000 series locomotives for motive power. Turkey's National Electric Train has also been in use on the Ada Express since May 27, 2023.
