The Caturiges (, ) were a Ligurian tribe  in the ancient Roman province of Alpes Maritimae, at first located on the Druentia river (modern Durance), towards its source, west of Vapincum (modern Gap), but later extending into Viennensis and Narbonensis. Their capital was Catorimagus (or Caturigomagus), also known as Caturiges (modern Chorges), situated between Dea Vocontiorum (modern Die) and Ebrodunum (modern Embrun).
The tribal name is derived from the theonym Caturix, a Gallic war god who was identified with Mars in Gallo-Roman religion.

The Caturiges are mentioned by Julius Caesar (Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 1.10):
... Here (in the Alps) the Ceutrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges, ...Caesar, Bell.
