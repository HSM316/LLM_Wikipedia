The Caturiges (Gaulish: "kings of combat"; , ) were a Gallic tribe of the Iron Age, dwelling in the Alpes Cottiae around present-day Chorges and Embrun.

 Name 
They are mentioned as Caturiges by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Pliny (1st c. AD),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 1:10:4Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 3:137; 3:125 and as Katourgídōn (Κατουργίδων) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).Ptolemy. Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis, 3:1:35, s.v. Caturiges.

The ethnonym Caturiges ('kings of combat') stems from the Gaulish root catu- ('combat, battle') attached to riges ('kings'; sing. rix).

The city of Chorges, attested as Caturrigas in the 4th c. AD (Cadorgas in 1062, Chaorgias in 1338) is named after the tribe.

 Geography 
The territory of the Caturiges was located on the upper course of the Durance river. The Caturiges were initially encompassed in the Roman province of Alpes Cottiae, then in the province of Alpes Maritimae after the reign of Diocletian (284–305 CE).

Their capitals were Caturigomagus (modern Chorges) and Eburodunum (modern Embrun).

 History 
In the mid-first century BCE, the Caturiges are mentioned by Julius Caesar as a tribe hostile to Rome.

... Here (in the Alps) the Ceutrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges, ...Caesar, Bell.
