Playscape Racing was an Australian motor racing team that competed in Australian touring car racing between 1989 and 1998.

History
At the 1988 Bathurst 1000, explosives entrepreneur Kevin Waldock's Blast Dynamics came on board as a sponsor of Miedecke Motorsportâ€™s Ford Sierra RS500. For 1989, Waldock contracted Miedecke Motorsport to build and maintain customer RS500. However following the destruction of Andrew Miedecke's own car at Lakeside, this car was taken over by Miedecke and another car built for Waldock, debuting at the Oran Park 300.

The car was painted yellow, a livery all Playscape Racing cars would carry. Following Miedecke closing the team and joining Mobil 1 Racing, Waldock formed his own team on the Gold Coast with Miedecke Motorsport personnel including Ross and Jim Stone.Stones not ready to roll away from V8 Supercars racing Speedcafe 15 December 2012 In 1991, Playscape finished third at the Sandown 500 and fifth at the Bathurst 1000.
