The Women's Progress Commemorative Commission is a U.S. bipartisan commission established pursuant to the Women's Progress Commemoration Act (Public Law 105-341, 1998-10-31) under President Bill Clinton. The bill was introduced by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and Senator Chris Dodd. The commission was tasked with identifying and preserving websites significant to American women's history. It was established in honor of the 150 year anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. The commission's first meeting was held 2000-07-12 in Seneca Falls, New York to develop a scope. Subsequent meetings, some sponsored by the National Park Service, included discussions regarding assistance from United State governors as well as problems with data collection.
