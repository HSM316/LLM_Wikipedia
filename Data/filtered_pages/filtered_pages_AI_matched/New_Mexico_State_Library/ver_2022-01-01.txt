The New Mexico State Library is a government library in Santa Fe.  It was established by the New Mexico legislature in 1961 from the library extension service that had previously been part of the Museum of New Mexico.  Notable parts of the collection are the Southwest Collection and publications from the state and federal government. In addition to lending and preserving materials, the state library also provides funds to public libraries throughout New Mexico and runs a rural bookmobile.
