Issues

Capital punishment
Washburne spent the 2015 legislative session pushing for more severe capital punishments for specific aggravators as chair of the House Courts and Criminal Code Committee. Senate Bill 385, which passed the Senate and has moved on to the House, would allow for defendants to receive the death penalty or a conviction of life without parole if they are charged of committing murder on a school grounds or in a place of religious worship. Washburne, who is a strong supporter of capital punishment, says that both of those situations warrant being added to the list of aggravators, which already includes defendants charged with dismembering a body.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 2015
Washburne also voted for Indiana's version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on April 2, 2015. He supports the law, which protects Indiana businesses and business owners' freedom of religion and does not allow for interference from state and local government. Washburne says it's important that citizens of Indiana have religious freedoms, even those that others "might be appalled by."
