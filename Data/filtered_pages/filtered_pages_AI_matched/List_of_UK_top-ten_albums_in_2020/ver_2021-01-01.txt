right|200px|alt=|Irish singer-songwriter and former One Direction member Niall Horan reached number-one in the UK Albums Chart in March 2020 with his second studio album Heartbreak Weather, making him the third Irish artist to reach the top of the chart in the space of five months, after Dermot Kennedy and The Script.
The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical albums and digital downloads. Since 2015, the album chart has been based on both sales and streaming. This list shows albums that peaked in the top ten of the UK Albums Chart during 2020, as well as albums which peaked in 2019 but were in the top 10 in 2020. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).

One-hundred and ninety-eight albums were in the top ten this year. Thirteen albums from 2019 remained in the top ten for several weeks at the beginning of the year. Lil Uzi Vert was among the many artists who achieved their first top 10 album in 2020.

The first new number-one album of the year was Heavy Is the Head by Stormzy. Overall, forty different albums have peaked at number-one so far in 2020, with Taylor Swift (2) having the most albums hit that position. An asterisk (*) in the "Weeks in Top 10" column shows that the album is currently in the top 10.
