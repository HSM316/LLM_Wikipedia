right|200px|alt=|Dua Lipa's second studio album Future Nostalgia entered the chart in April 2020 at number two before climbing to the top spot the following week. The album spent 51 non-consecutive weeks in the top 10, including four non-consecutive weeks at number-one, and became the third best-selling album of 2020.
The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical albums and digital downloads. Since 2015, the album chart has been based on both sales and streaming. This list shows albums that peaked in the top ten of the UK Albums Chart during 2020, as well as albums which peaked in 2019 and 2021 but were in the top 10 in 2020. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).

One-hundred and ninety-eight albums were in the top ten this year, while Post Human: Survival Horror by Bring Me the Horizon was released in 2020 but did not reach its peak until 2021. Fine Line by Harry Styles debuted in 2019 and re-entered the top 10 in 2020, but its peak position was not until 2021. Christmas by Michael Bublé was originally released in 2011, launched a new chart run in 2019, reaching a peak on its latest run in 2020 and again in 2021, when it returned to number-one. Heavy is the Head by Stormzy was the only album from 2019 to reach its peak in 2020. Little Mix scored the fastest-selling album of 2020 by a British act with Confetti. Thirteen albums from 2019 remained in the top ten for several weeks at the beginning of the year. Lil Uzi Vert was among the many artists who achieved their first top 10 album in 2020.

The first new number-one album of the year was Heavy Is the Head by Stormzy. Overall, forty-one different albums peaked at number-one so in 2020, with Taylor Swift (2) having the most albums hit that position.
