History
The college was founded in 1942 after voters in Napa County passed a bond initiative in 1941.  From 1942 to 1964, it operated as a four-year junior college, incorporating grades 11 through 14. The original campus was located on the same property as Napa High School.  The college was later moved to its current location in 1965 when a campus was established on surplus state property which originally was part of land belonging to Napa State Hospital.
