Alain Pons (born 16 September 1995) is a Gibraltarian football midfielder who currently plays for St Joseph's and the Gibraltar national football team.

Club career
Pons came through the youth ranks at AD Taraguilla in Spain, breaking into the senior team in 2013 before moving to his home country of Gibraltar to sign for Lincoln Red Imps. While studying at University of Central Lancashire, he remained contracted to Lincoln, occasionally playing for the first team while also representing UCLan's football team. Returning to Gibraltar after his studies, he signed for Gibraltar United, but this stay would be short lived as he would re-sign for Lincoln in January 2017. Again, he would feature primarily in the reserve teams, appearing on the bench several times but not playing. In August 2019, Pons signed for St Joseph's.https://twitter.com/StJosephsFCGib/status/1164470676188741632 Pons joins Saints] St Joseph's FC. 22 August 2019. Retrieved 22 August 2019.
