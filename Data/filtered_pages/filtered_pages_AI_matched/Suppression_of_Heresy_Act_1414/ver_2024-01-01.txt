The Suppression of Heresy Act 1414 (2 Hen. 5. Stat. 1. c. 7) was an Act of the Parliament of England. The Act made heresy an offence against the common law and temporal officers were to swear to help the spiritual officers in the suppression of heresy. Justices of the peace were given the power of inquiry; to issue an order to arrest; and to hand over the suspected heretic to the ecclesiastical court for trial. 

Controversy: Spurious quotation
A typical modern English rendition of a notorious section of the Act has it

However, those words do not seem to appear in the Act; they summarize and interpret the Act, with some embellishment, but at some time have been mistaken as the actual words of the Act.

John Foxe in Acts and Monuments provided an English translation of the Latin Act.This text given in e.g., 1583 Edition, Book 5, p.594 https://www.dhi.ac.uk/foxe/index.php?realm=text&gototype=&edition=1583&pageid=594 1576 edition has his introductory text:

Foxe then gives the 1415 Act in English translation. The equivalent passages seem to be first that judicial officials:

The initial vetting as to whether the person has heresies, errours, or Lolardies was up to the religious not secular authorities. The discovery of Lollard literature is not to be taken as evidence of heresy etc, but just as information: the indited person is innocent until proven guilty. If found to be heretics, they should be handed back to the secular authority and have a jury trial of men of independent means.https://www.dhi.ac.uk/foxe/index.php?realm=text&gototype=&edition=1576&pageid=572#top

Indeed, on Foxe's reading he cannot find that this Act explicitly allowed burning of Lollard heretics: "by what lawe or statute of the realme were these men brent?"https://www.dhi.ac.uk/foxe/index.php?realm=text&gototype=&edition=1570&pageid=719  Furthermore, Foxe denied having written in a previous edition that "there was no other cause of devising this sharpe law & punishmÄ“t against these men, but onely for havyng the Scripture bookes," which he said was a misreading of a margin note. https://www.dhi.ac.uk/foxe/index.php?realm=text&gototype=&edition=1576&pageid=588&anchor=sharpe
