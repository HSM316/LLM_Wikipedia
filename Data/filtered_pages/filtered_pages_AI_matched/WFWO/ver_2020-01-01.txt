WFWO (89.7 FM) was a radio station located in Medina, New York and broadcasting at a frequency of 89.7 MHz (Channel 209) with 400 watts of effective radiated power from an antenna 40 meters height above average terrain. The station was owned by FellowshipWorld, which had previously carried its programming on AM 1120 in Buffalo. 

WFWO signed on in 2010. On February 12, 2013, WFWO went silent.WFWO station details from fcc.gov It applied for an extension of its special temporary authority to remain silent on November 1, 2013. The station had been rebuked by the FCC for attempting to broadcast from a tower in Buffalo instead of their city of license (Medina) without FCC permission. On August 26, 2014, the FCC cancelled WFWO's license.

A separate license on the 89.7 frequency was awarded to the neighboring village of Albion shortly thereafter. That station, W209BF, operates on a much lower power (38 watts) and simulcasts the Family Life Network.
