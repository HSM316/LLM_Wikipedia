Bender, who achieved a personal-best 4,445 points to place second last year in Albuquerque, N.M., reflects on her breakthrough performance and her ambition to challenge for the title this season. She examines the USATF Indoor Combined Events Championships being showcased separately from the rest of the USATF Indoor Championships for the first time since the women's pentathlon and men's heptathlon were held in Annapolis, Md. Bender analyzes the return of Annie Kunz to the pentathlon at the USATF Indoor Combined Events Championships for the first time since winning the title in 2020 with 4,610 points in Maryland. She also speaks about the 12-athlete pentathlon field not including JaiCieonna Gero-Holt, a junior at Emerald Ridge High in Washington who has the potential to challenge the national high school record this year. Bender revisits her experience in August in Germany representing the U.S. at the Thorpe Cup in Marburg, her second opportunity to compete for the Americans including 2019, and being part of the victorious women's heptathlon lineup. She highlights fellow Americans Michelle Atherley and Erin Marsh winning heptathlon gold last year at the Thorpe Cup and Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, respectively. Bender also expresses gratitude for Texas State assistant coach Kendall Gustafson for mentoring her in the field events, along with Mississippi State assistant coach Gray Horn guiding her in the sprint events, as well as Memphis Grizzlies strength and conditioning coach Eric Schmitt for being part of her support system after moving from California in the fall. She explains her ambition to surpass 6,000 points in the heptathlon this year, along with her goal to eclipse the 4,600-point pentathlon barrier in Indianapolis.3rd  4392 points 1030 points 8.44 seconds  867 points   743 points   825 points  927 points2:12.622023 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships2nd  4445 points2023 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships USATF 1063 points 8.44 seconds  984 points   752 points   1007 points  977 points2:13.252022 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships 8th DNF  points2022 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships USATF 1021 points 8.48 seconds  736 points   745 points   DNS  DNS Representing Santa Barbara Track Club2020 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships 4th 4277 points2020 USA Indoor Track & Field Championships Results - 2/7/2020 United States Naval Academy, Wesley A Brown Field House, Santee Road, Annapolis, MD, USA USATF 1013 points 8.52 seconds  855 points   684 points   834 points  891 points  2:15.13 Representing UC Santa Barbara2018 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships 5th 4149 points2018 USA Indoor Track & Field Championships Results - 2/16/2018 to 2/18/2018 Albuquerque Convention Center  USATF 993 points 8.61  830 points   680 points   777 points  869 points  2:16.68
