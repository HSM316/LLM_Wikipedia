Binder has filed 15 U.S. and European patents in the area of Custom Plastic Surgery Implants, Method for Reduction of Migraine Headache Pain, Flexible support wrap, and Anesthesia conduit.

In 1992, Binder discovered the use of Botox to alleviate the suffering of those with chronic migraine headaches. He reported that patients who had cosmetic injections around the face reported relief from chronic headache. This was initially thought to be an indirect effect of reduced muscle tension, but it is now known that the toxin inhibits release of peripheral nociceptive neurotransmitters, suppressing the central pain processing systems responsible for migraine headache. In 2010, the FDA approved intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine headache.
