The Negro American Association was the name of two different minor league Negro baseball leagues.

 Negro American Association (1939) 
The first Negro American Association was organized in 1939, lasting one season.  This league was to be a farm system for major league-caliber Negro league teams during the years of segregated baseball, but was not profitable.

 Negro American Association (1948–1949) 
Another Negro American Association was organized in 1948, lasting two seasons. This league was formed after the integration of Major League Baseball and was meant to rival the existing Negro American League. 

Included in the founding 12 teams were four established teams from the Negro Southern League (NSL), including the steadfast Atlanta Black Crackers, and another five teams from a new league, the Negro Carolina League (NCL).  

After the collapse of the Negro National League (NNL) in 1948, the three-time Negro World Series champion Homestead Grays joined the league and crushed the competition.  The league folded after the 1949 season.
