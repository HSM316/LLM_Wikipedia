Benítez began playing football in his home town team called The Picada.http://afterdeportivo.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/martin-benitez-%E2%80%9Cgracias-a-mi-tio-estoy-en-independiente%E2%80%9D-2/  He caught the eye of Boca Juniors who offered a trial that never materialized.

As a result, Benitez quit football because of depression. He was encouraged back into football by his family and Independiente called him up for a trial in 2009.

He travelled to the Netherlands with the reserve team to play a friendly against Ajax. Although the team lost 5–1, he scored the only goal against goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer.

On October 13, 2011, he was called up to the first team by coach Ramón Díaz.

His debut came on November 19, when Independiente defeated Club Olimpo 3-0 playing the last twenty minutes of the match. His debut goal came on December 4, 2011, against Newell's Old Boys in a 1–1 draw.

His second goal via a header came on December 8, 2011, against San Lorenzo de Almagro.http://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-primera/Necesidades-diferentes_0_605339802.html
