Portugal and port wine
He first sailed for Oporto in 1836 but was unable to land because of bad weather. He returned to England, married and returned to Oporto the following year by way of Vigo, Spain. He was the sole partner of Taylor, Fladgate & Co., after Joseph Taylor's death in 1837. Morgan Yeatman joined the partnership in 1839 and they changed firm's name to Taylor, Fladgate, & Yeatman. This partnership was brought about by the agency of the London importer Matthew Clark, who was married to a cousin of Fladgate and a long term associate of Taylor, but Fladgate and Yeatman ceased using Clark in 1845, causing a crisis in that firm.unpublished memoir by Mrs. Catherine Clark in possession of Charles Gordon Clark

Footnote

In the Factory House records, Margaret's name was recorded solely as Margaret Collett and not Margaret Collett Dalgleish. That Collett was an integral part of her maiden name is confirmed by the parish records for St. Leonard's, Streatham, Surrey, where Margaret was born 24 November 1817, as three of her siblings are also shown as bearing the Collett Dalgleish surname: Maria, b. 1 November 1811; James, b. 11 October 1814; and Alexander, b. 9 December 1815. This is further supported by the 1881 UK Census entry for Henry Wood's household at Woodside Lodge, Leavesden, Watford, Hertfordshire, which records the presence of three of Margaret's sisters who were born in London: Henry's wife Louisa Collett Wood age 54, and two of his sisters-in-law: Rebecca Collett Williams, widow, age 56, and Elizabeth Collett Dalgleish, unmarried, age 70. Furthermore, another of Margaret's sisters, Ellen Collett Dalgleish, is shown in the British Chaplaincy records as marrying John Land Teage in Porto on 14 April 1852.
