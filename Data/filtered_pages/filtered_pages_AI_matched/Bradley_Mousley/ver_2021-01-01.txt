Bradley Mousley (born 3 January 1996) is an Australian tennis player. Mousley won the Australian Open boys' doubles title in both 2013 and 2014.

In August 2014, Mousley received a one-year ban, backdated to 30 May 2014, after testing positive for ecstasy in March. Mousley had admitted he had taken the drug at a party in March, and was originally given a two-year ban, but since the drug was not taken with the intent to enhance his performance, the ban was dropped to 12 months.

Tennis career

2019
Considering his efforts as a junior, Mousley reached his first senior ITF final, in Hua Hin, at the relatively advanced age of 23.  Unfortunately he had injured his knee badly enough to withdraw from his singles semi-final earlier in the day, and struggled to move freely from the start of his doubles final.  He and Ajeet Rai were well-beaten by the top-seeded Ratiwatana twins in just 40 minutes.
