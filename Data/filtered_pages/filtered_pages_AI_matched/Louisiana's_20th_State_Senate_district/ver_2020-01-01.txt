Louisiana's 20th State Senate district is one of 39 districts in the Louisiana State Senate. It has been represented by Republican Senator Norby Chabert since 2009; Chabert will be succeeded by Mike Fési in 2020.

Geography
District 20 is located in Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes along the Gulf of Mexico, including some or all of Thibodaux, Lockport, Cut Off, Golden Meadow, Houma, Dulac, and Chauvin.

The district overlaps with U.S. congressional districts 1 and 6, and with Louisiana House of Representatives districts 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.

Recent election results
Louisiana uses a jungle primary system. If no candidate receives 50% in the first round of voting, when all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, the top-two finishers advance to a runoff election.
