IThe Sheepshanks dome is in between the Flamsteed house (on the right), and the Great Equatorial dome on the far left (partially obscured by a tree).
The Sheepshanks was operated from the Altazimuth Pavilion from 1963 to 1982.
Sheepshanks equatorial was a 6.7 inch (170Â mm) refracting telescope established in 1838 at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The telescope was donated to the observatory by Richard Sheepshanks. The telescope had an objective double lens made by Cauchoix of Paris, and it was about 8 feet long (2.4 meters). The telescope was originally mounted by Grubb on an equatorial mounting with a clockwork drive. The telescope overall rested on a stone pillar.

From 1835 to 1963 it was in the Sheepshanks dome at the Greenwich observatory for the most part, and from 1963-1982 in the Altazimuth Pavilion. In the early 1980s it was placed in storage and has been there ever since. The telescope's Sheepshanks dome was in between the later Great Equatorial Building and the prime Meridian.

The focal length of the telescope is about 1.9 meters (6.2 feet) in one source, and another says 8 feet 2 inches. The telescope tube was made of wood.

An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the new Sheepshanks telescope:

Still in service over half a century later, an 1896 report by Christie, W. H. M. had this to say about the Sheepshanks at that time:

One of the instruments for the telescope was a wire micrometer.

The Sheepshanks refractor became the largest aperture telescope at Greenwich. 

 Observations 
One of its observations was of Comet Encke. The Sheepshanks was used to observe the moon occulting stars in 1905. Some of the stars that were observed include Bradley 687, 130 Tauri, and 26 Geminorum- among others. 

In addition to the occultation of stars by the Moon, the Sheepshanks equatorial is also reported to have been used to observe the moons of Jupiter.

 Disambiguation 
There are other telescopes bearing the name Sheepshanks, for example the Sheepshanks telescope, No 3; this was a telescope of 4.6 inches aperture and 5 feet of focal length and used with spectroscope in the 1860s. There was also telescope at a Cambridge completed in 1898.
