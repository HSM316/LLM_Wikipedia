Ch'ilsŏng Gate is the northern gate of the inner castle of the walled city of Pyongyang (Pyongyang Castle). Located in the scenic Moranbong Park, the gate was originally built in the sixth century as an official Koguryo construction, although present construction dates from 1712. The gate takes its name (which literally means "seven stars") from the seven brightest stars in the Great Bear constellation (also known as the Big Dipper). This constellation was revered in traditional Korean religion - for example, many Buddhist temples in Korea contain a "Chilsong shrine" or other similar structure.

Ch'ilsŏng Gate is National Treasure #16 in North Korea.
