 
Dadabhoy Rustomji 'Dady' Havewala (sometimes spelt Havewalla) (27 November 1908 â€“ 21 July 1982) was an Indian cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1934 to 1941.

Havewala became famous in India before he played first-class cricket. In the final of the Times of India Shield in Bombay in December 1933, he scored 515 (with 32 sixes and 56 fours)Wisden 1983, p. 1245. as well as taking 11 wickets.Bombay Baroda & Central India Railways v St Xavier's College, Mumbai 1933-34 It was the highest score in Indian cricket until 2013, when Prithvi Shaw made 546. When Havewala was around 120, a ball bowled by the opposing captain G. N. Lalljee hit the stumps and deflected without dislodging the bails. After reaching 200 he wanted to retire but was asked by his captain Muley to slog and get out. Havewala started to hit out and some of his sixes landed among railway wagons in the Marine Drive yards. He reached his 300 after around a further twenty minutes, and ended the day at 453 not out. A large crowd attended the match on the next day, when Havewala was caught at deep mid off from a mishit.G.
