Poet
The start of Marine Petrossian’s literary career coincided with the ending of the Soviet Union. Her first book was published in Yerevan in 1993, just two years after Armenia, formerly Soviet Republic, became independent.

The poems of this volume were translated into French by Vahe Godel and in 1995 French Editions Comp’Act published J’apporterai des pierres by Petrossian. Encouraged by success of the book (a favorable review, among others, was published in Le MondePatrick Kéchichian, «Fleur épineuse». Le Monde des Livres, 22.09.1995) Editions Comp’Act soon published the second book of Marine Petrossian, Erevan, 2003.

Since then, Petrossian has published another four volumes of poetry in Armenia.

In 2015, Argentinian publisher Audisea published Disparó el arma by Petrossian, comprising poems translated into Spanish by Alice Ter-Ghevondian. The presentation of the book took place at the National Library of Argentina and well-known newspaper Página/12 invited Petrossian to interview.. Retrieved 11 November 2015

Petrossian has been writer-in-residence at Djerassi Artists Residency, Woodside, California, as Artist Laureate of UNESCO-Aschberg bursaries (2005); at Q21, MuseumsQuartier Vienna (2013);  as well as at Omi International Arts Center, New York City (2015).

Essayist 
Petrossian’s essay "Antipoetry, or When the Poet Does Not Seek an Alibi" Անտիպոեզիա, կամ երբ բանաստեղծը չի փնտրում ալիբի (Antipoetry, or When the Poet Does not Seek an Alibi): Գրական թերթ, #10, 4 օգոստոս, 2000թ. has aroused intense discussions in Armenian literary circles. In this essay, Petrossian speaks about "antipoetry"—poetry that does not look like poetry and challenges the prevailing notion of poetry—and asserts that it is the leading tendency in contemporary Armenian poetry.

Marine Petrossian is largely known in Armenia also as a columnist. In 2007-2009, a period of tense political developments before and after Armenian presidential election, 2008, she led a weekly column in Haikakan jamanak (Armenian Times) daily, the main opposition newspaper. Her essays on political issues of the day had an unprecedently large readership and made her a public figure in Armenia: many TV programs invite her to comment on public issues. 18 September 2015.
