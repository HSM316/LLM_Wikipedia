In GemCraft, players are given gems to combine and place into towers. Different combinations of gems produce different effects, such as splash damage, Damage over time and triple damage. The player's life bar and magic energy are represented by the same statistic - mana. With mana, the player can purchase towers, gems, trenches, traps, and combine gems. A key aspect of strategy in GemCraft is to increase the player's mana gain to high levels, enabling creation of stronger and stronger gems. Combining two gems creates a single gem of higher power, or 'level'. The shape of the gems change with each level (or Grade).

Plot
The series is set in a fictional fantasy world and depicts the battles of wizards against a powerful demon known as "The Forgotten". Wizards used to regularly summon demons to do their bidding until they brought forth a demon too powerful for them to control, who was also capable of subduing other demons under her command. Described as "a fully black female torso with disfigured arms, a head with long hair and no face", the Forgotten commands her legions in order to conquer the "Spiritforge", the last bastion of the wizards, in order to become omnipotent. There is no known way to destroy The Forgotten or to banish her back to the Demon Realm from which she was summoned. Instead, she can be sealed away by a powerful artifact known as the "Gem of Eternity", but it can only contain her for a few decades before someone steals the gem, allowing her to escape, and each time she escapes, a new gem must be crafted in order to capture her again.
