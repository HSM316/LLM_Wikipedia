"Control" is the second North American single released from alternative rock band Garbage's fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, and was sent to radio stations across United States in October 2012. The band mastered a radio version of the song for airplay featuring a third chorus in place of the breakdown that marks the album version of the song. Garbage later pressed a limited edition 7" vinyl single for "Control" and released it through their website. It was backed with a remix of the lead single "Blood for Poppies".

On June 26, 2012, "Control" became the soundtrack to the trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man.

Background
"Control" is about giving up any control in your life, surrendering yourself to whatever is going on," explained Shirley Manson, "...and committing yourself to it in that moment." The band were inspired by the song "When the Levee Breaks" by Led Zeppelin and used it as a reference point to bring guitars into the mix and seeing how far they could push their sound and channel the groove. "Control" features a harmonica part performed by Butch Vig.
