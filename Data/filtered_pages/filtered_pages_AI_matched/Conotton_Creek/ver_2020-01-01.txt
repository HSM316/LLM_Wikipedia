Conotton Creek ( ) is a tributary of the Tuscarawas River, 38.7 miles (62.3 km) long, in eastern Ohio in the United States.  Via the Tuscarawas, Muskingum and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 286 square miles (741 km²) in Carroll, Harrison and Tuscarawas County, Ohio.  The source is at 1240 feet and the mouth is at 874 feet. Dover Dam, downstream on the Tuscarawas river, is normally dry, but can impound a reservoir on Conotton and tributaries to a pool elevation of 916 feet for downstream flood control by the Corp of Engineers.  From its source in eastern Harrison County, Ohio the creek flows west northwest through Jewitt, Scio, Conotton, Bowerston, Leesville, Sherrodsville, New Cumberland and Somerdale before reaching its mouth in central Tuscarawas County, Ohio. The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway is situated in the valley.  Ohio State Route 151 runs in the valley from near the source to Bowerston.  Ohio State Route 212 run along the valley from Bowerston to the mouth.  The Conotton Creek Trail runs from Bowerston to Jewett.

The stream was declared navigable by the Ohio legislature in 1808, but the act was repealed in 1816, probably to allow the construction of mill dams.
