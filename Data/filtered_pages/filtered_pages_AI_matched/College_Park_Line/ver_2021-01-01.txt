The 83, 83X, and 86 operate out of Landover division 7 days a week. Both 83 and 86 originally operated out of Bladensburg Division from February, 1973, all the way up until June, 2019 when they were shifted to make room for other routes at Bladensburg Division when Northern division closed due to structure failures. During the week, Route 83 operates every 30-60 minutes between 4:30 AM and 12:35 AM with service continuing until 2:00 AM on Fridays, while Route 86 operates every 30-60 minutes between 5:00 AM and 9:45 PM. On Saturdays, the 83 provides service on a 60-minute headway from 5:30 AM to 2:00 AM, while the 86 provides service also on a 60-minute headway from 8:25 AM to 7:35 PM. On Sundays, the 83 runs from 6:35 AM until 12:20 AM and the 86 runs from 7:11 AM until 5:00 PM every hour. Route 83X only operates three trips between Cherry Hill Park Campground and College Park station during the morning hours (8:30 AM-10:00 AM) from the third Monday in June through the second Friday of August each year.

The 83 is shortened to operate daily between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and Mt. Rainier terminal only during early morning and late night service. These shortened trips were originally under Route 82 which was renamed the 83 in 2016. Select Route 83 trips operate between Rhode Island and College Park during Friday and Saturday late nights only.

 History 
 Background 
Route 81

250px|left|The 81 running to Cherry Hill in 2015
81 originally operated as part of the North Capitol Street Line, alongside route 80, between Fort Totten station & West Potomac Park until the summer of 1997, when it was rerouted to operate between the  Rhode Island Avenue station & Cherry Hill Campground as part of the "Maryland Line" alongside routes 82, 83, and 86, in order to replace the segment of 83's former routing to the Greenbelt station, which was discontinued when 83 was rerouted to serve the College Park - U of MD station instead. Routes 81 & 83 operate on almost the same exact routing between the Rhode Island Avenue station, only with the exception that 81 would serve the Greenbelt station, while 83 would serve the College Park - U of MD station. In order to avoid redundancy with the C2 Metrobus Route that operated on the same exact routing as 83 formerly operated on between the intersection of Greenbelt Road & Rhode Island Avenue (Branchville) and the Greenbelt station between Monday through Saturday of each week, 81 would only operate on Sundays when the C2 Metrobus Route did not operate. On the other hand, once route 81 joined the "Maryland" Line, 83 was rescheduled to only operate between Monday through Saturday of each week, in order to avoid redundancy with route 81.

Route 82
The 82 Maryland Streetcar Line, which used to be the primary route that operated as part of the "Maryland Line", operated between West Potomac Park and Branchville until replaced by buses in 1958. The 82 streetcar line used to operate even further north of Branchville all the way up to Laurel. However, the route was truncated to terminate at Branchville during the late 1940s. The 82 route was extended from Branchville to the Seven Springs Village Apartments once they opened between the 1960's and early 1970's, via Rhode Island Avenue, Edgewood Road, Baltimore Avenue, and Cherry Hill Road. However; a few select 82 trips operated further north on Rhode Island Avenue and terminated at the Hollywood subdivision of College Park instead.The 82 streetcar line was eventually taken over by WMATA and officially became a Metrobus route in 1973 when WMATA bought various streetcar companies. WMATA kept mainly kept the 82 route the same as its streetcar routing, only with the exception that WMATA rerouted 82 to divert off Rhode Island Avenue NE onto the intersection of Washington Place NE to serve Rhode Island Avenue station when it opened on March 27, 1976, before returning back to the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue NE, and operating on its usual routing towards West Potomac Park via Downtown Washington D.C.

Route 86
86 originally operated under the Capital Traction Company under the G6 streetcar line before it was formed into Capital Transit. 86 was created as a new Capital Traction Company bus route to replace the G6 streetcar line, which was discontinued around the late 1950's. 

Route 86 was created on March 27, 1976 when Rhode Island Avenue station opened operating between the intersection of Dartmouth Avenue & Calvert Road in College Park and West Potomac Park, . The 86 operates on portions of the old G4 Streetcar line which ran between Downtown Washington D.C. and within the city of Hyattsville, MD and the G6 Streetcar Line, which ran from Branchville to Beltsville until replaced by buses between 1949 & 1958.

1978 Changes
On September 24, 1978, WMATA truncated route 82's from West Potomac Park to Rhode Island Avenue station due to riders having an option of getting off at Rhode Island Avenue to catch the Red Line to get downtown much faster. Riders also had the option of getting off at other Metro stops downtown where they could catch other routes to get towards West Potomac Park. This changes also affected Routes 84, 85, 86, and 88. Parts of the former route 82 routing was replaced by a new route B6 operating between  Rhode Island Avenue station to  Metro Center station connecting Downtown.

Route 83 was also created on September 24, 1978, that would travel parallel to Route 82 except make limited stops and ease crowding during weekday peak hours only.

1993 Changes
On December 11, 1993 when the Green Line portion between Fort Totten and Greenbelt opened, Route 82 was truncated to only operate between the Rhode Island Avenue station and Mount Rainier terminal at the intersection of Municipal Place & Rhode Island Avenue during early morning, late night, and rush hours only being replaced by Route 83 which was given daily service and extended to Cherry Hill keeping the same routing, only with the exception of being minority rerouted to serve Greenbelt station.

Route 86 was also extended from its previous College Park terminus, all the way to the Centerpark Office Park (Calverton), in order to replace the segment of R2's former routing between Prince Georges Plaza and Calverton, via East - West Highway, Baltimore Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, as well as on Powder Mill Road between the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and Beltsville Drive, that was discontinued.

1997 Changes
81 originally operated as part of the North Capitol Street Line, alongside route 80, between Fort Totten station & West Potomac Park until the summer of 1997, when it was rerouted to operate between the  Rhode Island Avenue station & Cherry Hill Campground as part of the "Maryland Line" alongside routes 82, 83, and 86, in order to replace the segment of 83's former routing to the Greenbelt station, which was discontinued when 83 was rerouted to serve the College Park - U of MD station instead. Routes 81 & 83 operate on almost the same exact routing between the Rhode Island Avenue station, only with the exception that 81 would serve the Greenbelt station, while 83 would serve the College Park - U of MD station. In order to avoid redundancy with the C2 Metrobus Route that operated on the same exact routing as 83 formerly operated on between the intersection of Greenbelt Road & Rhode Island Avenue (Branchville) and the Greenbelt station between Monday through Saturday of each week, 81 would only operate on Sundays when the C2 Metrobus Route did not operate. On the other hand, once route 81 joined the "Maryland" Line, 83 was rescheduled to only operate between Monday through Saturday of each week, in order to avoid redundancy with route 81.

2003 Changes
On May 15, 2003, due to the fact that the WMATA Metrobus Stop/Terminal in front of the former GC Murphy Department Store site inside Prince Georges Plaza Shopping Center, were both demolished in order to make room for the construction of a brand new Target store, the 86 route was rerouted to no longer directly enter and loop inside the Prince George's Plaza Shopping Center, requiring passengers wanting to either board or alight at the Prince George's Plaza Shopping Center, to board/alight the bus, by either walking across to the Prince George's Plaza station, or the WMATA Metrobus Stops at the intersections of either East - West Highway & Belcrest Road (to board/alight the 86 route towards Calverton), or Belcrest Road & East - West Highway (to board/alight the 86 route towards the Rhode Island Avenue station).

2004 Changes
Route 86 managed to keep its original routing in the city of College Park via College Avenue, Dartmouth Avenue, and Calvert Road even after College Park–U of MD station opened up. But route 86 didn't directly serve College Park station, instead having a stop close to the western end of the station on Calvert Road. Passengers wishing to board and alight at College Park–University of Maryland station on route 86 would had to board/alight at the intersection of Dartmouth Avenue & Calvert Road as it was the closest 86 bus stop to the western entrance of the station on Calvert Road.

On June 27, 2004, route 86 was permanently rerouted at the request of the city of College Park to directly serve the College Park - U of MD station by operating along the 83's routing along Baltimore Avenue, Paint Branch Parkway, and River Road instead of operating along College Ave, Dartmouth Ave, and Calvert Road.

2007 Changes
Due to the construction of a new curb next to the new Mosaic Apartments built right next to Prince George's Plaza station around June, 2007, all WMATA Metrobus Routes that have previously exited Prince George's Plaza station from the northbound side, had to do so by exiting the Prince George's Plaza station via a right turn onto East-West Highway and left onto Belcrest Road. Route 86 was in the direction of Calverton to exit Prince George's Plaza station northbound, right onto East-West Highway and remain straight on East-West Highway to past Belcrest Road but was able to keep its entire routing in the direction of Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station the same as the route was still allowed to turn left from East-West Highway onto Belcrest Road, make a right turn from Belcrest Road to enter Prince George's Plaza station, and make a right turn southbound on Belcrest Road. 

2011 Changes
On June 20, 2011, WMATA added a new route to the College Park Line called "83X" as a plot route during the summer in order to provide additional direct service from Cherry Hill Campground to College Park–University of Maryland station operating four weekdays trips only from 8:30 am to 10:00 am only from the third Monday in June through the second Friday through August.

2014 Proposed Changes
During WMATA's Fiscal Year of 2015, WMATA proposed to split Route 83 and 86 into four routes. Route 83 and 86 would terminate at College Park station from Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and be renamed Route 83S and 86S or keep their same names. The second portion was to be named route 83N and 86N or route R6 and R8 and will operate between College Park station and Cherry Hill (83N/R6) and Calverton (86N/R8) keeping the same routing with route 83 and 86. All existing service would still be covered but passengers will have to transfer at College Park station in order to continue their trips. If the proposal had gone through, it would mark the return of the R6 and R8 (unless it was switched to Route 83N/86N) service as they haven't operated since 1993 under the "Queens Chapel Road Line" (R6) and "Riggs Road Line" (R8).

2015 Proposed Changes
During WMATA's FY2016 budget, it was proposed for route 83 to be given Sunday service replacing route 81 and discontinuing Sunday service to Greenbelt station. Routes 83 and 86 would replace route 81 in College Park while route C2 would replace route 81 between Greenbelt station and University of Maryland. The reason of the changes was for WMATA making the College Park Line easier to understand towards riders. 

2016 Changes
On March 27, 2016, route 81 service between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and Cherry Hill Campground was discontinued and replaced by route 83. Route 83 also added Sunday service replacing the 81 but no longer serving Greenbelt station where it was replaced by route C2. Route C2 also added Sunday service to replace Route 81 portion between Greenbelt Road and Greenbelt station.

December 2016 changes
On December 18, 2016, Route 82 was discontinued and was replaced by the 83. Short trips between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and Mount Rainier were made 83 routes instead during late nights and early mornings. Also, due to Metro closing at midnight during that time period because of SafeTrack maintenance, select Route 83 trips were introduced to operate between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood and College Park–University of Maryland station on Friday and Saturday late nights only.

March 2017 Changes
On March 19, 2017, route 83 short trips between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and Mount Rainier during weekday peak-hours  were discontinued and replaced by route G9.

September 2019 changes
Beginning on September 1, 2019 for nine months, the College Park Metrobus loop was temporarily closed for construction of the Purple line at College Park station having all stops located along River Road. As of a result, route 83 and 86 were temporarily rerouted along River Road having to turn around on the roundabout along Haig Drive to return to its regular route going both directions.

April 2020 Changes
Beginning on April 20, 2020, parts of Calvert Road was closed due to the ongoing construction of the Purple line. Routes 83, and 86 were temporarily rerouted to turn on Calvert Road to serve the west side of College Park–University of Maryland station since vehicles cannot travel along parts of Calvert Road. The routing was similar to route 86's routing from 2004 before it was rerouted to College Park station.

June 2020 Changes
In May 2020, WMATA announced that route 83X will not operate during for the 2020 summer season due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Metro's reduced service since March 16, 2020. Alternative service would be provided by routes 83 and 86.

September 2020 Proposed changes
On September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to reduce the frequency of buses to every 60 minutes on both routes 83 and 86 and eliminate all route 86 Sunday service due to low federal funding. Route 86 has not operated on Sundays since March 15, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
