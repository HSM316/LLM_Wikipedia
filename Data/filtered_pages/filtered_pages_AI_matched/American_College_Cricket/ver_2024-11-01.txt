American College Cricket is the national collegiate organization that has developed and governs cricket in American (and some Canadian) universities. The mission of the organization is to develop cricket in colleges in the United States and Canada. Since being founded in 2008 the organization has grown to include over 90 member colleges. Each year a national championship is held in Florida, primarily at the CBRP Cricket Stadium, during spring break. Aside from the main tournament, regional tournaments are held as well as a league between colleges.

As part of its mission to develop cricket in America, American College Cricket made the first broadcast of Cricket in the United States via web streaming in March 2010. From October 2011, American College Cricket has broadcast its matches through TV Asia across the USA & Canada.

At the end of each season, a set of awards are given out. These include The Bart King Award (the best one or two students who have played cricket having mainly played another sport and not having any previous experience), Newcomer of the Year and Player of the Year.& College Players of the Year.
