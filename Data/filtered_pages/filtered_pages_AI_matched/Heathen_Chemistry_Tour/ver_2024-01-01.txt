The Heathen Chemistry World Tour was a concert tour by English band Oasis, which took place between 2002 and 2003. The tour was in promotion of their record Heathen Chemistry. While the tour was successful, it was plagued by major incidents including lead singer Liam Gallagher's voice giving out during three of the band's gigs and resulted in him walking off stage and guitarist Noel Gallagher had to take over on vocals, a car crash that left Noel, bassist Andy Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington in hospital and resulted in the North American leg getting cut short and a bar brawl in Munich, Germany involving Liam, drummer Alan White and several members of their crew that left Liam getting his teeth knocked out, White getting brain scans, Liam getting fined with £35,000 and the German leg getting pushed into March 2003. This is the band's last world tour with White, before his dismissal in January 2004.
