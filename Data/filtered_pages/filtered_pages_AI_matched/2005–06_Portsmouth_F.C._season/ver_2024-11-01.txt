During the 2005–06 season, Portsmouth competed in the FA Premier League. It was Portsmouth's third consecutive season in English football's top-flight.

Season summary
Manager Alain Perrin was sacked in November with Portsmouth struggling in the relegation zone. Joe Jordan was appointed caretaker manager after the sacking of Perrin.  He was replaced by Harry Redknapp, who had walked out of arch-rivals Southampton after being refused permission by the club to talk to Portsmouth about the managerial vacancy. For a while it looked as if Redknapp's efforts were in vain, with Portsmouth eight points adrift of safety at the end of February. However, by the end of March that had been cut to just three (with a game in hand over seventeenth-placed West Bromwich Albion) and eventually Portsmouth managed to secure survival with a 2–1 win at Wigan Athletic to send West Brom and Birmingham City down.

Kit
Portsmouth signed a deal with Jako to produce the club's kit. Oki became the kit sponsors. The strip was manufactured by Pompey Sport, but after the kit deal with Jako, they were rebadged with its logo. The home shirt was atypical for Portsmouth, as it had a large white space under the collar on the rear where players' names were printed. The away was red and gold, whilst the third was white and navy. The white strip was only worn three times, away at Manchester United, Aston Villa and West Ham United respectively.
