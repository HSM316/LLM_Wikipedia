right|Photon Sieve
A photon sieve is a device for focusing light using diffraction and interference. It consists of a flat sheet of material full of pinholes that are arranged in a pattern which is similar to the rings in a Fresnel zone plate, but a sieve brings light to much sharper focus than a zone plate. The sieve concept, first developed in 2001,Sharper images by focusing soft X-rays with photon sieves, L. Kipp, M. Skibowski, R. L. Johnson, R. Berndt, R.
Adelung, S. Harm, and R. Seemann, Nature 414, 184
(2001). is versatile because the characteristics of the focusing behaviour can be altered to suit the application by manufacturing a sieve containing holes of several different sizes and different arrangement of the pattern of holes.

Photon sieves have applications to photolithography.Photon-sieve lithography, Rajesh Menon and Dario Gil, J. Opt. Soc. Am.

When the size of sieves is smaller than one wavelength of operating light, the traditional method mentioned above to describe the diffraction patterns is not valid. The vertorial theory must be used to approximate the diffraction of light from nanosieves.Ultrahigh-capacity non-periodic photon sieves operating in visible light.Kun Huang, et al.Nature Communications 6, 7059(2015).  In this theory, the combination of coupled-mode theory and multiple expansion method is used to give an analytical model, which can facilitate the demonstration of traditional devices such as lens, holograms and etc Photon‐nanosieve for ultrabroadband and large‐angle‐of‐view holograms Kun Huang,et al.
