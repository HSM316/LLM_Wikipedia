Caleb Cornett (born May 19, 1987), better known by his stage name Amtrac, is an American DJ, electronic music producer, singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter.

Career
Born and raised in Morehead, Kentucky, he now lives in Louisville, Kentucky and is signed to Miami, Florida -based management company Super Music Group.
His first music video, "Came Along", debuted on MTV's Clubland in October 2011.

About the song, tastemaker website RCRDLBL said "Amtrac, the solo project of Kentucky's Caleb Cornett, has just the right mixture of pop and cutting-edge sonics to break through the void. On 'Came Along,' Amtrac guides a rapid, crunchy beat and electric piano figures to a thoroughly mature songwriting space. He's restless, though. This poise quickly evolves into spliced samples flickering across the track in microtonal dotsâ€”a true dancefloor deconstruction."

Amtrac played at Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Forecastle Festival and Osheaga Festival in 2013.

In 2013, Amtrac remixed Kaskade's single "Atmosphere" and the remix was released on Ultra Records. He also appeared on the Atmosphere tour with stops at Brooklyn's Barclay's Center Miami's American Airlines Arena, Navy Pier in Chicago, and Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles.

In 2014, Amtrac played Ultra Music Festival, Mysteryland USA, EDC Las Vegas, Moonrise Festival and supported Kygo on his first tour throughout the US & Europe. He also did a co-headline tour throughout the US with DJ/producer, Kastle, in which they collaborated on single "Hyperspace" in name of the tour. Other music releases in 2015 came as a 2-song EP for Black Book Audio and a single "Those Days" on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records. "Those Days" featured a vocal sample from legend Stevie Wonder and was approved by his team for official release.

In 2015, Amtrac was invited to play on Holy Ship and played BPM Festival in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. He followed up his release on Toolroom Records with a new single for them titled "Hold On", this time featuring a vocal sample from Marvin Gaye. Other festivals played in 2015 included CRSSD Fest in San Diego, Shambhala Festival, Digital Dreams Festival in Toronto, Escapade Festival in Ottawa, Splash House in Palm Springs, Paradiso Festival in Washington state & Your Paradise in FIJI. He closed out 2015 by headed out on tour w. Gorgon City as direct support for their North American tour.

2016 saw Amtrac heading to Asia for Shipsomnia and then straight to Mexico for another play at BPM Festival. He self-released his "Lost In Motion" EP in January, which received much praise within the DJ community. He followed the release of the EP with a headline tour of North America. He returned to Miami for WMC and shortly after did his first Mixmag Lab. He returned to EDC Las Vegas and Mysteryland in Bethel Woods, New York. He released a 2-song EP on Kidnap Kid's label "Birds That Fly" in August 2016 and a few weeks later released another 2 song EP on Waze & Odyssey's label Street Tracks. He joined Pete Tong for the NYC Edition of his All Gone Pete Tong showcase and is slated for upcoming appearances at III Points Festival in Miami.
