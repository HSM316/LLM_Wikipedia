Properties
Cleistanthus collinus (Karra) contains a plant poison also called oduvan (Tamil), kadise (Kannada), Vadisaku (Telugu), Oduku (Malayalam) and Gaja Madara (Sinhala) . Ingestion of its leaves or a decoction of its leaves causes hypokalemia (kaliuresis and cardiac arrhythmias), metabolic acidosis, hypotension and hypoxia probably due to distal renal tubular acidosis, ARDS and toxin induced vasodilatation respectively.Benjamin SPE, M Edwin Fernando, JJ Jayanth, Preetha B; Cleistanthus collinus poisoning. J Assoc Physicians India 2006 Sep; 54:742-44 Hypokalemia and acidosis probably also induces rhabdomyolysis resulting in myoglobinuric kidney failure and neuromuscular weakness. Its effects are probably mediated by injury to the distal renal tubules, pulmonary epithelium and peripheral blood vessels due to glutathione depletion (animal studies have shown benefit with N-acetylcysteine).
