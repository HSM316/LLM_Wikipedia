In April 2011, Martínez won the 122-pound super bantamweight championship of the World Boxing Association after defeating Trinidadian Lisa Brown. In June of that year, she made her defense of the title and defeated fellow Panamanian Paulina Cardona. In September, she again successfully defended her title by defeating Dominican Marilyn La Cachorrita Hernández, a fight that Romina Arroyo of Argentina refereed.

After a two-year and three month hiatus starting on 20 April 2013 (that day being defeated by Alicia Ashley), Martínez returned to the boxing scene to challenge Liliana Palmera.
