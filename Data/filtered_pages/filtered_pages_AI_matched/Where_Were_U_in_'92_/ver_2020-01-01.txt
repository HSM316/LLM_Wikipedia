Where Were U In '92? is the debut studio album by British electronic producer Zomby, released in 2008 by Werk Discs.

The album's title refers to the opening line from the M.I.A. song "XR2" and is a homage to the rave scene of the early 1990s, reflected by Zomby's mixture of his usual chiptune-inflected UK garage style with the more upbeat, rave stylings of breakbeat house. Zomby used equipment from the period, such as the Akai S2000 sampler and Atari ST computer.http://www.4ad.com/artists/zomby
