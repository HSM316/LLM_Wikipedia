 Reception 
"Stop the Presses" received generally positive reviews from critics. Les Chappell of AV Club, who gave the episode an "Aâˆ’", praised the show for its ability to "craft episodes that ... are easily identifiable as 'the XX episode'" with "Stop the Presses" being labeled "the first episode of BoJack to become unstuck in time". Jenny Jaffe of Vulture gave the episode four out of five stars, writing that the episode "has a few worrisome moments, but over and over, it pulls itself back from the edge".
