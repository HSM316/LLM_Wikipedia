 Life 
Zemljak studied at the Graz University of Technology from 1912 to 1914, later attending the German Technical College in Prague. Following his 1920 graduation, Zemljak worked in Zagreb, where he completed a number of projects.

In 1929, Zemljak visited Germany and the Netherlands where he came into contact with neoplasticism and the work of Jacobus Oud.

Zemljak's style was characterized by the fusion of elements of the international style with features of traditional Croatian architecture.
