Welcome Mart was an Australian supermarket chain that was founded by David and Holdings in Canberra and New South Wales in 1992, the same time they rebranded some of Canberra's supermarkets as Festival. They rebranded all the Foodmaster Supermarkets. The first stores opened in Downer, Fraser, Dickson, McKellar, Melba, Kingston, Kambah, Macquarie, Queanbeyan, Latham, Holder and Isaacs.

In 1994, one supermarket opened in Theodore.

Eventually, by 2014, almost all Welcome Mart Supermarkets were bought out. The Isaacs Welcome Mart was rebranded as a general supermarket in 2000, and in 2014, it rebranded and now operates as Shoplands.
