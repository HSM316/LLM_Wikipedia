Zhang Peiyuan  (traditional Chinese: 張培元)(died 1934) was a Han chinese general, commander of the Ili garrison. He fought against Uighur and Tungans during the Kumul revolt, but then secretly negotiated with the Tungan general Ma Zhongying to form an alliance against Sheng Shicai and the Soviet Union. Zhang's army had about 3,000 soldiers. They almost destroyed Sheng's armies when the Soviet Union invaded Xinjiang and overran Zhang's forces. Zhang committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviets at the Muzart Pass during a snow storm.
