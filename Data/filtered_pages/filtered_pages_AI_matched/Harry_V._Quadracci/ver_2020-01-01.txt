Harry V. Quadracci (January 10, 1936 â€“ July 29, 2002) founded Quad/Graphics with his wife Elizabeth Quadracci.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/business/harry-v-quadracci-66-chief-of-magazine-printing-company.html

 Work at Krueger 
Quadracci worked at W.A.Krueger, but eventually left when a managerial disagreement led to a strike. He was not included when the president of the company reached a settlement, and he felt the negotiating was done behind his back. He interpreted it as a signal that he would not eventually fulfill the role as president of the company. He then left to form his own company.

 Humble beginnings
Quadracci leased a 20,000 square foot building in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. By 1974 the company had 35 employees.

 Landing big contract 
In 1977, Quadracci was able to land Newsweek, and in 2000 landed National Geographic.

 Philanthropy 
In 2001, Harry V. Quadracci and his wife Elizabeth Quadracci, helped finance the addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum designed by Santiago Calatrava. The Quadracci's donated $10 million in a donation-matching challenge they spearheaded. The addition was named the Quadracci Pavilion.http://www.livinglakecountry.com/sussexsun/news/betty-quadracci-dies-at-age-75-b99160561z1-235250771.html
