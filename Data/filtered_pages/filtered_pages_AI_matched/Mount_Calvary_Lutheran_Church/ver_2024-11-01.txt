Mount Calvary Lutheran Church, also known as Hawksbill Church, Hacksbill Church, Hoxbiehl Church, and Gomer's Church, is an historic Lutheran church with adjacent cemetery located near the town of Luray in Page County, Virginia, United States.

History
It is not known when this congregation was established. In 1765 John Schwarbach, who apparently was temporarily rendering pastoral services, conveyed  of land to Peter Painter and Jacob Shaffer, trustees of this church.Frederick County, Virginia, Deed books, Frederick County Courthouse, Winchester, Virginia, John and Margaret Schwarbac to Peter Painter and Jacob Shafer, 6 August 1765, Deed book 10, pages 544-546. The church was first called the “Hoxbiehl” or “Hacksbill” (Hawksbill), later “Comer’s Church” due to so many members by that name, and lastly “Mount Calvary.” This church was first served by the Pennsylvania Ministerium, Bathaser Sauer having attended a convention as a lay delegate.U.S. Works Progress Administration of Virginia Historical Inventory, County: Page, Class: Church, "Mt. Calvary Church," PA-59, Research made by Vivian Black, Luray, Virginia, 18 January 1936, page 1; digital images, Library of Virginia (http://image.lva.virginia.gov/VHI/html/20/0594.html : accessed 19 August 2019). In 1813,Bericht der Verrichtungen während des Synody des Luth. Ministeriums, gehalten im Staat Nord Carolina, im Jahr unser Herrn 1813, mit einigen Anhängen (Neu Market, Virginien: Ambrosius Henkel, 1814), page 12; digital images, HathiTrust Digital Library (https://www.hathitrust.org/ : accessed 19 August 2019). it was one of the five valley churches to unite with the Evangelical Lutheran North Carolina Synod, and in 1820 it joined the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod.

Mount Calvary was originally a union church shared by members of the Lutheran and Reformed faiths. The insistence on conducting all church functions in the German language led to the cancellation of the union agreement in 1832, when the Reformed people formed a separate congregation.Klaus Wust, translator, The Record of Hawksbill Church 1788-1850 Page County, VA (Edinburg, Virginia: Shenandoah History, 1979), p. 8.

The church served an active congregation until 1959, when regular services ceased.Potterfield, McRae 1998, 2008, section 8, p. 5.

Mount Calvary was the mother church of five other congregations in Page County that were organized, directly or indirectly, from her membership: Morning Star (organized 29 November 1873), Grace (organized 10 March 1877), St. Mark’s (organized 1876), St. James’ (Rileyville, organized 1884), and Beth Eden (organized 31 December 1896).C.

Church buildings
It is not known in what year a church was first built on this site. However, on August 6, 1765, Johannes Schwarbach, who apparently was temporarily rendering pastoral services, conveyed  of land to Peter Painter and Jacob Shaffer, trustees of the church.

The old log church stood in front of and to the right of the present building. In 1937, one could still see where the ground had been disturbed for the foundation. It was rectangular in shape, with two front entrances. It was used not only as a church, but also as a school. Near the old church and on the lower side of the. graveyard was a two-story log building that was also used as a school.U.S. Works Progress Administration of Virginia Historical Inventory, County: Page, Class: Church, "Mt. Calvary Church," PA-59, Research made by Vivian Black, Luray, Virginia, 18 January 1936, pages 1-2; digital images, Library of Virginia (http://image.lva.virginia.gov/VHI/html/20/0594.html : accessed 19 August 2019).

The current structure is the third church at the location, and was constructed in 1848.Potterfield, McRae 1998, 2008, section 8, p. 4.  The building is a two-story rectangular brick structure with a metal gable roof.Potterfield, McRae 1998, 2008, section 7, p. 1. Since its construction, the church has seen no additions and only minor alterations to the interior and exterior of the building. The site includes a small cemetery and a non-contributing wooden outhouse.Potterfield, McRae 1998, 2008, section 7, p. 2. , the church was undergoing restoration with the possibility of using the building again.

The church was listed on the Virginia Landmarks Register on June 17, 1998, and the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 2008.

Church register
The only existing church register for Mount Calvary was acquired in 1817. The early entries are in German. The register is  long and about  wide. The book is in two parts and has two title pages. In 1979, the book was in the possession of Harry L. Comer of Page County, Virginia.Klaus Wust, translator, The Record of Hawksbill Church 1788-1850 Page County, VA (Edinburg, Virginia: Shenandoah History, 1979), pages 3, 12-13. There are at least two English translations of its pages:

 Finck, William J., translator. Early Records of Mt. Calvary Lutheran Church, Page County, Virginia. St. Louis: Joseph Willard Baker, October 10, 1969.
 Wust, Klaus, translator. The Record of Hawksbill Church 1788-1850 Page County, VA. Edinburg, Virginia: Shenandoah History, 1979.

Tradition says that an earlier church register was lost in the Civil War.Klaus Wust, translator, The Record of Hawksbill Church 1788-1850 Page County, VA (Edinburg, Virginia: Shenandoah History, 1979), page 12.
