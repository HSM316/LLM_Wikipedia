History and legend

According to an ancient tradition recorded in Lebor Gabála Érenn, three rivers "burst forth" during the reign of Fíachu Labrainne as High King of Ireland. One was Innbhear Mainge — the Maine. The Annals of the Four Masters contains the same story, but spells it Mand.

The Metrical Dindshenchas records Inber Cíchmaine, cid cress, gáet co líth-baile láech-bress Maine ergna, úais ella, mac Medba ocus Ailella. ("At Inber Cichmaine, though it be narrow, was slain (a mighty onslaught) far-famed Maine, son of Medb and Ailell, exulting in fury of warlike combats.")

The Maine was the traditional division of the Kingdom of Desmond: south of the Maine was controlled by the Gaelic MacCarthys, while north of the Maine was controlled by the Norman Earl of Desmond.
