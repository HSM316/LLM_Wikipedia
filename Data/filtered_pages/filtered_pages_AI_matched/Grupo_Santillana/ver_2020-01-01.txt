Grupo Santillana, born Santillana Ediciones Generales, is a Spanish publisher founded in 1959 by Jesús de Polanco and Francisco Pérez González.

From 2008 and due to the high debts of the group PRISA, Santillana made disinvestments to guide itself. In 2008 the bookshop Crisol, which come to have fourteen subsidiaries in Spain, two in Buenos Aires and one in Lima, closed. In 2010 it was sold the 25% of shares.

In 2014 Santillana sold all its trade publishing (including the Alfaguara and Objetiva publishing houses) to Penguin Random House for €72 million. Santillana then shifted its focus towards educational publishing.
