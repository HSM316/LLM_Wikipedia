The 1966 Oregon State Beavers football team represented Oregon State University during the 1966 NCAA University Division football season. Four home games were played on campus in Corvallis at Parker Stadium and two at Civic Stadium in Portland.
Under their second season head coach Dee Andros, the Beavers were 7–3 overall and 3–1 in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU, later Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8). Only one of the four conference teams from the state of California was on the schedule; champion USC shut out OSU in Portland.

Following a 1–3 start, OSU won its last six games, and were ranked nineteenth in the final UPI Coaches Poll.

The starting quarterbacks this season were senior Paul Brothers and sophomore Steve Preece. Workhorse senior fullback Pete Pifer became the school's all-time leading rusher, overtaking Sam Baker.
