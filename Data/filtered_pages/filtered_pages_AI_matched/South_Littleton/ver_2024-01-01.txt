History

Though Neolithic human activity has been documented in the area, it is thought the first permanent settlements were constructed during Romano-British times (the important Roman road of Ryknild Street runs by the area). Other nearby Romano-British at Ullington, Blakes Hill and Littleton Pastures have been documented, and all were thought to be in continuous occupation until the late 4th century. Archeological evidence suggests the area was completely abandoned after the end of the Roman occupation of Britain.

The area had been repopulated to an extent by the time of the Domesday Book, which documents the Littletons twice. Later stone buildings remain in the villages today. The parish remained largely as an agricultural area until the late 1940s. Today, very few of the inhabitants of the parish are employed in agriculture.
