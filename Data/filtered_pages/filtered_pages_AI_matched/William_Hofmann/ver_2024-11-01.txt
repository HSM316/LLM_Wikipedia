William Hofmann (born 30 March 1968) was an American artist celebrated for his artistic portrayals of the Pacific coastlines and the landscapes of the American West. Hoffman, a self-taught artist, embraced painting later in life after his first visit to a gallery. Initially focusing on detailed seascapes capturing tranquil coastal moments, he later transitioned to Western themes. Hoffman passed away in 1995 in Big Bear Lake, CA.
