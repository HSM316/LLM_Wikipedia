Personal life
Glanville began dating actor Eddie Cibrian in September 1998 and the couple got married on May 12, 2001. They have two sons, Mason Edward (b. 2003) and Jake Austin (b. 2007). The couple divorced in 2010 after Cibrian had an extramarital affair with singer LeAnn Rimes, who was also married at the time. "Marriages break up all the time. People have affairs. Happens every day. It matters how you handle yourself after and if you're actually remorseful. I've never found LeAnn to be remorseful. I found her to be like, 'Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I got your family'", Glanville said in 2013. She was in good terms with Rimes and Cibrian by mid-2018.

Glanville was sued by model Joanna Krupa for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress related to false comments about Krupa made by Glanville on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live television show. After several years of legal process Glanville issued a public apology to Krupa. Glanville discussed the settlement agreement she reached with Krupa on her podcast Unfiltered Blonde in 2019 and stated that she paid around $500,000.00 in legal fees and settlement costs. Glanville stated on her podcast Unfiltered Blonde in March 2019 that this amount of money was her entire savings and that she had been saving for a home. Glanville also stated on the same podcast that she believed it was Lisa Vanderpump's fault that she could not buy a house and was "forced" to spend all of her savings because, according to Glanville, Vanderpump would not support Glanville in depositions.

In her free time, she enjoys "dancing, cooking, golfing, Pilates, hiking, staying active in her charities and building Lego castles with her boys."
