The circumstances surrounding the affair and divorce were a part of Glanville's book Drinking and Tweeting: And Other Brandi Blunders. In a 2013 interview, Glanville commented, "Marriages break up all the time. People have affairs. Happens every day. It matters how you handle yourself after and if you're actually remorseful. I've never found LeAnn to be remorseful. I found her to be like, 'Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I got your family.'"

In 2015, Glanville was sued by model and fellow Real Housewife Joanna Krupa for defamation related to comments made by Glanville on Watch What Happens Live. The lawsuit was settled in 2017 for $500,000.00, and Glanville issued a public apology to Krupa.
