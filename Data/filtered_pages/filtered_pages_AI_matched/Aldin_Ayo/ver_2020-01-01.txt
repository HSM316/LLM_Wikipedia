Coaching career

Career Beginnings
Ayo's first experience in coaching began in his hometown in Sorsogon City, calling the shots for the Aemilianum College Knights varsity team, as well as his high school alma mater's varsity squad. He also had a basketball clinic called ABC (Ayo Basketball Clinic) Ideas, which started as a means to fund an ailing basketball program for Aemilianum College, but was shut off a year after. By the time he became councilor, he continued to conduct basketball clinics for free, until he started getting the attention of then-national youth coach Eric Altamirano, who invited him to the Nike Elite Basketball Camp, and later on, to the National Basketball Training Center.  In 2012, he joined the Alaska-Jr. NBA and JR. WNBA Camp and was awarded the Coach of the Year. His experience in the grassroots level and youth camps have earned him an invitation from then assistant coaches Glenn Capacio and Louie Gonzales to join the Kia Sorento (now Mahindra Enforcer) coaching staff in the PBA under Coach Manny Pacquiao, which he accepted.

Letran Knights
In 2014, Ayo was named the new head coach of his alma mater's varsity team, the Letran Knights, besting the likes of former college teammate Kerby Raymundo and PBA legend and fellow Letran alumnus Samboy Lim. In 2015, even with a small lineup yet applying pressure mayhem defense and relentless run and gun offense, he led the Knights to win the NCAA Championship since 2005 and dethrone their archrivals, the erstwhile five-time champion San Beda Red Lions. He left the Knights to coach the DLSU Green Archers, citing problems with his family and the business. In 2016, he and FEU Tamaraws coach Nash Racela both received the Coach of the Year award by the UAAP and NCAA Press Corps in the 2016 College Basketball Awards.

De La Salle Green Archers
In 2015, Ayo was named the new head coach of the De La Salle Green Archers following Juno Sauler's resignation after the Archers were eliminated from the Final Four. He would go on to win a championship title in his first season, which included a memorable undefeated streak by the team.

UST Growling Tigers
On January 3, 2018, Coach Ayo signed with the University of Santo Tomas Growling Tigers basketball team to be their head coach replacing former coach Rodil "Boy" Sablan who resigned on November 2017. This will be his second time coaching a Dominican school after leading Letran to a title in 2015.

One year after taking over as head coach, Ayo led the UST Growling Tigers to the UAAP Season 82 Men's Basketball Finals by winning against the FEU Tamaraws and UP Fighting Maroons in the stepladder semifinals before meeting the Ateneo Blue Eagles. The Growling Tigers eventually lost in two games to the Blue Eagles, who completed a 16-game winning streak and won their third straight UAAP Men's Basketball Championship title under head coach Tab Baldwin. https://sports.inquirer.net/372400/ust-knocks-off-feu-moves-on-to-face-up-in-uaap-season-82-stepladder-semishttps://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/up-fighting-maroons-ust-growling-tigers-face-off-for-spot-in-uaap-finals-a2437-20191110?ref=article_next_featuredhttps://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/ust-tigers-beat-up-maroons-force-do-or-die-match-for-place-in-finals-a2437-20191110https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/survives-early-ust-storm-advances-uaap-82-finals/169721https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/715638/ateneo-ust-battle-for-the-crown-in-uaap-season-82-men-s-basketball-finals/story/https://www.spin.ph/basketball/uaap-men/belangel-a-demon-as-ateneo-holds-off-ust-to-complete-perfect-16-0-season-a2437-20191120https://sports.inquirer.net/374139/ateneo-makes-uaap-history-sweeps-ust-for-3rd-straight-title-uaap-season-82https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/11/20/ateneo-finishes-ust-finishes-job-perfect-season-63544
