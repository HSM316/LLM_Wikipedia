History
The Prague garrison's history is closely associated with the city's military history. The first fortified Prague military garrison was established in 1621, making it the oldest in the area that is now the Czech Republic, and one of the oldest in Europe. The first commander of this garrison was Generalissimus Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Prince of Waldstein and the Duke of Frydlant. In centuries that followed, the Prague garrison had become the most important military garrison in the country and since 1918 it was the central seat of the military leadership of independent Czechoslovakia and the ÄŒSSR. After a military reorganisation of the armed forces took place on April 1, 2004, the Garrison Command of Prague was formed and was made the center of the armed forces garrison commands.
