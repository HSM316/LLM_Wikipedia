Care for Casualties (C4C) is a British charity launched in early 2009 to raise funds in order to assist British servicemen and women from The Rifles who have been wounded or injured during service in Iraq or Afghanistan, as well as helping their families.

 History 
C4C was launched in early 2009, by Major General Rupert Jones, who was then commanding officer of 4th Battalion The Rifles, Karen Charman-Allen, mother of Rifleman Philip Allen, who was killed in November 2009 as part of Operation Herrick with 2nd Battalion The Rifles, and Regimental Secretary Lt Col John Poole-Warren. Since the formation of The Rifles in 2007, they have seen continued commitment to both Afghanistan and Iraq, with over 60 Riflemen killed, and over 300 injured in that time. With the increase in post traumatic stress disorder among soldiers, the appeal was launch to combat this. At the launch Jones said: ‘This week  I will bury three of my riflemen – men too young to die. Only yesterday I sat with one of my young riflemen who lost both legs and an arm. His focus is not on what he has lost but what he has.’
