Release
The film was a moderate hit at the box office. The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name by producers C. H. Ganeswara Rao and P. Indira in 2000.

N. Pandian later began work on Perazhagi starring Ajith Kumar in 1998 for Shogun Films, and a further project for Anbalaya Films simultaneously. Neither film eventually materialised, and as a result, his next release was 365 Kadhal Kadithangal in 2010.https://web.archive.org/web/20030814102411/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/17-04-98/cinenews.htm#1

The producer Ashok Samrat, encouraged by the success of Priyam, began another venture soon after titled Kalvettu featuring Murali and Divya Unni. The film was later stalled due to production trouble, and Samrat opted out of the film industry.https://web.archive.org/web/20010515042211/http://www.cinesouth.com/masala/23082000/news02.shtml
