Reception
The film was a moderate hit at the box office. R. P. R. of Kalki praised the music, cinematography and Prakash Raj's acting and added the film's first fifteen minutes feels dragged but the pace picks up after the arrival of Prakash Raj. D. S. Ramanujam of The Hindu wrote, "Arun  Kumar and newcomer Manthra make a pleasing pair,  romancing without any inhibition, Ganeshram's camera making the best use of the  seashore  fort  and  its ramparts  in  the  song  and  dance portions. Prakashraj displays a lot of dash in his approach,  the wolf in sheep's clothing effect being brought about without  much sweat".
