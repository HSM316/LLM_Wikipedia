"Flowers Become Screens" is the debut single by the Canadian electronic music group Delerium featuring singer Kristy Thirsk from their 1994 album Semantic Spaces. The B-side of the single is the track "Incantation" from the same album. In some territories, "Incantation" was used as the A-side of the single instead of "Flowers Become Screens".

"Flowers Becomes Screens" was remixed by Deepsky in 2000 as a bonus track on the album Poem.

Both songs have a music video directed by William Morrison and Paddy Gillen.
