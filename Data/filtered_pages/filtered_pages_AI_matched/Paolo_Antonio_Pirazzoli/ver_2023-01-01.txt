Paolo Antonio Pirazzoli (1939-2017) was an Italian/French geomorphologist.

 Life 
Pirazzoli was born in Venice, and acquired French citizenship in 1978. He studied Civil Engineering at Palermo, and went to work in France. Made redundant by the engineering company he was working for, he turned to a career in geography, earning a PhD in Geography (1976), titled “Les variations du niveau marin depuis 2000 ans” [Variations in sea-levels over 2000 years]. His main research centred on Quaternary sea-level changes, and shorelines (Holocene, Pleistocene) all over the world. As head of research at CNRS, Paris, he led several international projects, and was scientific editor for a number of journals, including Global and Planetary Change (Elsevier). The International Association of Geomorphology awarded him Honorary Fellowship in 2013, for his services to the discipline. He was married to archaeologist and art historian Michèle Pirazzoli-t’Serstevens.Christophe Morhange, "Paolo Antonio Pirazzoli (1939-2017) An exceptional career dedicated to coastal geomorphology - In memoriam" http://earthquakegeology.com/materials/other_materials/paolo_antonio_pirazzoli/who_was_Paolo_Antonio_Pirazzoli.pdf
