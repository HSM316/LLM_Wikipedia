Manav (Sanskrit: मानव, pronounced 'Maanav'/ Mɑnʌv, meaning "human") is India's first humanoid robot which was developed in the laboratory of A-SET Training and Research Institutes by Diwakar Vaish (Head of Robotics and Research, A-SET Training and Research Institutes) in late December 2014. It debuted at the IIT-Bombay Techfest 2014-15 in Mumbai.

 Design 
 Manav stands at 2 feet tall and has a weight of 2 kilograms. It is equipped with onboard sound processing and visual processing so it can respond to commands.
 Thanks to the onboard processor and various sensors, Manav can perform various activities like walking, dancing with the only requirement of human voice commands.
 Manav has the capability of Binocular vision processing, giving it the ability to perceive depth and perspective.
 The Robot was designed in a span of 2 months.
 Manav's outer body was designed in A-SET's own 3D printing laboratory and is made of Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic.
 Manav has a total of 21 degrees of freedom, two of which provide the movement of the head allowing it to nod and look around. 1 degree of freedom goes to the waist which allows it to articulate the waist movement allowing for a more human-like movement.
 The robot comes with a rechargeable Lithium polymer battery which can keep it running for one hour.
 The Robot can be purchased with multiple micro-controllers and battery sizes according to the requirements of the user.
 The robot is also equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
