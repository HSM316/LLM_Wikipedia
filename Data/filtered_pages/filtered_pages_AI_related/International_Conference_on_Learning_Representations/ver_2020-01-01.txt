The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)  is a machine learning conference held every Spring.  The conference includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers. The first ICLR was held in Scottsdale, Arizona. Since its inception in 2013, ICLR has employed an open peer review process to referee paper submissions (based on models proposed by Yann LeCun). In 2019, there were 1591 paper submissions, of which 500 accepted with poster presentations (31%) and 24 with oral presentations (1.5%).
