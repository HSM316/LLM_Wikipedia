Data thinking is the generic mental pattern observed during the processes of picking a subject to start with, identifying its parts or components, organizing and describing them in an informative fashion that is relevant to what motivated and initiated the whole processes.

The term was created by Mario Faria and Rogerio Panigassi in 2013 when they were writing a book about data science, data analytics, data management and how data practitioners were able to achieve their goals.
