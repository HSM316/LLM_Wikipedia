A cardinal tree (or trie) of degree k, by analogy with cardinal numbers and by opposition with ordinal trees, is a rooted tree in which each node has  positions for an edge to a child."Representing trees of higher degree" (2005)
by David Benoit, Erik D. Demaine, J. Ian Munro, Rajeev Raman, Venkatesh Raman and S. Srinivasa Rao  Each node has up to  children and each child of a given node is labeled by a unique integer from the set {1, 2, . . . , k}. For instance, a binary tree is a cardinal tree of degree 2.
