Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functionsJonas Mockus (2012). Bayesian approach to global optimization: theory and applications. Kluwer Academic. that doesn't require derivatives.

History
The term is generally attributed to Jonas Mockus and is coined in his work from a series of publications on global optimization in the 1970s and 1980s.Jonas Mockus: On Bayesian Methods for Seeking the Extremum. Optimization Techniques 1974: 400-404Jonas Mockus: On Bayesian Methods for Seeking the Extremum and their Application. IFIP Congress 1977: 195-200J. Mockus, Bayesian Approach to Global Optimization.

Strategy

Since the objective function is unknown, the Bayesian strategy is to treat it as a random function and place a prior over it. The prior captures beliefs about the behavior of the function. After gathering the function evaluations, which are treated as data, the prior is updated to form the posterior distribution over the objective function. The posterior distribution, in turn, is used to construct an acquisition function (often also referred to as infill sampling criteria) that determines the next query point.

There are several methods used to define the prior/posterior distribution over the objective function. The most common two methods use Gaussian Processes in a method called Kriging. Another less expensive method uses the Parzen-Tree Estimator to construct two distributions for 'high' and 'low' points, and then finds the location that maximizes the expected improvement.

Examples
Examples of acquisition functions include probability of improvement, expected improvement, Bayesian expected losses, upper confidence bounds (UCB), Thompson sampling and hybrids of these.Matthew W. Hoffman, Eric Brochu, Nando de Freitas: Portfolio Allocation for Bayesian Optimization. Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI): 327–336 (2011) They all trade-off exploration and exploitation so as to minimize the number of function queries. As such, Bayesian optimization is well suited for functions that are expensive to evaluate.

Solution methods
The maximum of the acquisition function is typically found by resorting to discretization or by means of an auxiliary optimizer. Acquisition functions are typically well-behaved and are often maximized with implementations of Newton's Method such as Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm or the Nelder-Mead method.
