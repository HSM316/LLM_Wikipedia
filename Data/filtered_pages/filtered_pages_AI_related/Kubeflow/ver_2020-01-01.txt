Kubeflow is a free and open-source machine learning platform co-founded by David Aronchick, Jeremy Lewi and Vishnu Kannan, built by developers at Google, Cisco, RedHat, CoreOS and CaiCloud,  and first released at Kubecon North America in 2017. Kubeflow is designed to enable using machine learning pipelines to orchestrate complicated workflows running on Kubernetes (e.g. doing data processing then using TensorFlow or PyTorch to train a model, and deploying to TensorFlow Serving). Kubeflow was based on Google's internal method to deploy TensorFlow models to Kubernetes called TensorFlow Extended.
