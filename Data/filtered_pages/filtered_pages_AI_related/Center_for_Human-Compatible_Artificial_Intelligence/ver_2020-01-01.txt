The Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) is a research center at University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) focusing on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) safety methods.  CHAI was founded in 2016 by a group of academics led by UC Berkeley computer science professor and AI author Stuart J. Russell. Russell is known for co-authoring the widely used AI textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.

CHAI's faculty membership includes Bart Selman and Joseph Halpern from Cornell University, Pieter Abbeel from UC Berkeley, and Michael Wellman from the University of Michigan. 
CHAI is associated with numerous publications relating to AI safety, including papers presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning and the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 

CHAI's approach to AI safety research focuses on value alignment strategies, such as inverse reinforcement learning.

Funding

In 2016, the Open Philanthropy Project (OpenPhil) recommended a grant of $5,555,550 over five years to support CHAI. CHAI received an additional grant of $200,000 from OpenPhil in 2019.
