In mathematics, vague sets are an extension of fuzzy sets.

In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single value in the interval [0,1] reflecting its grade of membership. This single value does not allow a separation of evidence for membership and evidence against membership.

Gau et al."Vague sets". proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership functions: a true membership function and a false membership function.
This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.

Mathematical definition
A vague set  is characterized by
 its true membership function 
 its false membership function 
 with 

The grade of membership for x is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in . This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degenerates to a fuzzy set, if  for all x.
The uncertainty of x is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as .
