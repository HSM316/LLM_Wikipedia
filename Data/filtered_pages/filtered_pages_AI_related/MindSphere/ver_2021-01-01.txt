MindSphere is an open cloud platform or “IoT operating system”“MindSphere — open IoT operating system - Software - Siemens Global Website”. siemens.com. Retrieved 2017-10-13. developed by Siemens for applications in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT).Naujoks, Stefanie. “MindSphere – Siemens cloud for industry: What is it all about?” pac-online.com.

MindSphere stores operational data and makes it accessible through digital applications (“MindApps”) to allow industrial customers to make decisions based on valuable factual information.Weinländer, Markus. (2017) Industrielle Kommunikation: Basistechnologie für die Digitalisierung der Industrie. Beuth Verlag. pp. 59-60. . The system is used in applications such as automated production and vehicle fleet management.Reinheimer, Stefan. (ed.) (2017) Industrie 4.0: Herausforderungen, Konzepte und Praxisbeispiele. Springer Verlag. p. 26. .

Assets can be securely connected to MindSphere with auxiliary MindSphere products (e.g. Data Capture Unit, MindConnect IoT2040 or MindConnect Nano) that collect and transfer relevant machine and plant data.

Examples include real-time telemetric data from moving assets like cars, time series data and geographical data, which can be used for predictive maintenance or to develop new analytical tools.5. Srnicek, Nick. (2017) Platform Capitalism. Polity Press. .

 Overview 
As cloud-based PaaS (platform as a service), MindSphere collects and analyzes all kinds of sensor data in real time. This information can be used to optimize products, production assets and manufacturing processes along the entire value chain.Dowling, Michael; Eberspächer, Jörg; Neuburger, Rahild; Noll, Elisabeth; Zisler, Kristina. (2016) Neue Produkte in der digitalen Welt. Books on Demand. . MindSphere’s open application interfaces make it possible to obtain data from machines, plants or entire fleets irrespective of the manufacturer. These interfaces include OPC Foundation’s OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA).Weinländer, Markus. (2017) Industrielle Kommunikation: Basistechnologie für die Digitalisierung der Industrie. Beuth Verlag. pp. 56. .

To help customers create their own software applications and services, MindSphere is equipped with open application programming interfaces (APIs) and development tools. This allows OEMs to integrate their own technology.Schmalz, Kurt; Winter, Albrecht. (2016) “Trends in Vacuum Technology and Pneumatics in the Context of Digitalization”. qucosa.de. Retrieved 2017-10-09.

MindSphere is based on the concept of closed feedback loops enabling the bi-directional data flow between production and development:Williamson, Jonny. (2017) “Mindsphere: the next step in digital factories”. themanufacturer.com. Retrieved 2017-09-04. Real-world plants, machines and equipment can be connected to MindSphere in order to extract operational data. Valuable information (e.g. “digital twins” of machines) can then be extrapolated from the raw data through analytics and utilized to optimize products as well as production processes and environments in the next cycle of innovation.Dillon, Stuart; Schönthaler, Frank; Vossen, Gottfried. (2017) The Web at Graduation and Beyond: Business Impacts and Developments. Springer Verlag. p. 266.
