Aidoc’s technology analyses medical images directly after the patient is scanned and notifies the radiologist of cases with suspected critical findings, assisting with prioritization of time-sensitive and potentially life-threatening cases in order to expedite patient care. It has been used by the University of Rochester Medical Center, Global Diagnostics Australia, and other medical centers.
