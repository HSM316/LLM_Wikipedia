Aidoc is an Israeli company that develops computer-aided simple triage systems.

The systems are in use in more than 300 medical centers, including Yale New Haven Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Sheba Medical Center.

History
Aidoc was founded in 2016 by Elad Walach (CEO), Michael Braginsky (CTO) and Guy Reiner (VP R&D).

In April 2017, the company raised $7M, led by TLV Partners.AIDoc Medical raises $7M to bring AI to medical imaging analysis, TechCrunch, April 26, 2017

In April 2019, the company raised $27M, led by Squarepeg capital. Additional investments make a total of $41.5M invested until April 2019.Aidoc, Crunchbase

In August 2018, Aidoc gained FDA clearance for its intracranial hemorrhage system, and in May 2019 it received clearance for the pulmonary embolism system.

In January 2020, the system for detecting large-vessel occlusions (LVOs) in head CTA examinations got FDA clearance.

In May 2020, the pulmonary embolism system was CE marked.

Products and market
Aidoc has developed a suite of artificial intelligence products that flag both time-sensitive and time-consuming (for the radiologist) abnormalities across the body. The algorithms are developed with large quantities of data to provide diagnostic aid to a broad set of pathologies. The company offers an array of algorithms that span across the body including Intracranial hemorrhage, spine fractures (C, T & L), free air in the abdomen, pulmonary embolism and more. It developed "Always-on AI", a term coined by Elad Walach which refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is "Always-on" - constantly running in the background and automatically analyzing medical imaging data, identifying urgent findings and sparing radiologists from "drowning" in vast amounts of irrelevant data.

Aidoc's solutions cover medical conditions prevalent in all settings (ED/inpatient/outpatient), including level 1 trauma centers, outpatient imaging centers, teleradiology groups and are set up in over 200 medical centers worldwide. Notable customers include the University of Rochester Medical Center, Global Diagnostics Australia, Antwerp University Hospital, and AZ Maria Middelares hospital. According to the company, Aidoc has deep integrations with numerous PACS and workflow software providers (GE, Agfa, Nuance).

Clinical Research
A clinical study on Aidoc’ accuracy of deep convolutional neural networks for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) was performed by the University Hospital of Basel and presented at the European Congress of Radiology, showing that the Aidoc algorithm reached 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity.
 Clinical research has also been performed to test the diagnostic performance of Aidoc's deep learning-based triage system for the flagging of acute findings in abdominal computed tomography (CT) examinations. Overall, the algorithm achieved a 93% sensitivity (91/98, 7 false-negative) and 97% specificity (93/96, 3 false-positive) in the detection of acute abdominal findings.

Additional clinical research on Aidoc's Intracranial Hemorrhage algorithm accuracy was presented at the European Congress of Radiology by Antwerp University Hospital, evaluating the use of its deep learning algorithm for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast enhanced CT of the brain.  The University of Washington completed a study on the accuracy of Aidoc's intracranial hemorrhage algorithm .
