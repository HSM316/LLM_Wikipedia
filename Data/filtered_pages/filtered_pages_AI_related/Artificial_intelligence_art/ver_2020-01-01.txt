The artificial intelligence art has greatly developed since 2018 with the discovery of generative adversarial networks (GANs), and how machine learning algorithms could be used to generate images.

 First sale 
The first auction sale of artificial intelligence art was at Christie's Auction House in New York. The AI artwork sold for $432,500 which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The artwork was created by "Obvious", a Paris-based collective consisting of Hugo Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier.

Process
"Obvious" uses a two step process to create their art.  The first step is the "Generator", the second is the "Discriminator".  The process is fed with images of existing art works and the "Generator" attempts to create new art works based on that input.  The role of the "Discriminator" is to see if it can spot which works are computer generated.  If it fails to spot a piece, that piece is considered successful.

First published collection of artificial intelligence art images
On April 30 2019 the world’s first collection of images produced using AI was published through Amazon. The collection was produced by a UK based team "AIArtMedia". 

Racism Warnings
Artificial intelligence art experts and police have warned against using bad training data to classify people after website ImageNet Roulette let people upload their images. The AI then reproduced the image along with an annotation.
