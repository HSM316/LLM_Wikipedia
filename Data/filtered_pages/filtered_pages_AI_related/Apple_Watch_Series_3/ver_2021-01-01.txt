Apple used advertising points to emphasize the need for this product to track fitness goals. The "3 Ring Goal" for tracking the users fitness level while the device is being used has been improved for accuracy and workout plans. Apple Watch Series 3 added cellular connectivity for the first time in an Apple Watch. The four major US carriers (AT&T, Sprint Wireless, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless) all support Apple Watch Series 3 and use the same mobile number as the user's iPhone.

 Features 
The Apple Watch Series 3 featured LTE cellular connectivity for the first time in an Apple Watch, enabling users to make phone calls, iMessage and stream Apple Music and podcasts directly on the watch when their iPhone is not nearby. The watch comes with an electronic SIM card and shares the same mobile number as the user's iPhone. Add-on plans start at $10/month from the four major US carriers.

Apple Watch Series 3 has a dual-core Apple S3 processor that is 70% faster than the Apple S2 and enables Siri voice responses.

The cellular-capable watch has a red digital crown while the non-LTE version has a plain digital crown. It has a built-in NFC chip which can be used for Apple Pay. Apple claims 18 hours of battery life. Each model of the Series 3 comes in a 38- or 42-millimeter body, with the larger size having a slightly larger screen and battery.
