The Argument Web is a large-scale Web of interconnected arguments created by individuals as they express their opinions and interact with the opinions of others.Rahwan, Iyad, Fouad Zablith, and Chris Reed. "Laying the foundations for a world wide argument web." Artificial intelligence 171, no. 10-15 (2007): 897-921. The Argument Web aims to make online debate intuitive for participants such as mediators, students, academics, broadcasters and bloggers, to create a Web infrastructure that allows for the storage, automatic retrieval and analysis of linked argument data, and to improve the quality of online argument and debate.Bex, Floris, John Lawrence, Mark Snaith, and Chris Reed. "Implementing the argument web." Communications of the ACM 56, no. 10 (2013): 66-73. The Argument Web can be described as a portion of a larger Semantic Web.Rahwan, Iyad. "Mass argumentation and the semantic web." Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web 6, no. 1 (2008): 29-37.
