Nvidia DGX is a line of Nvidia produced servers and workstations which specialize in using GPGPU to accelerate deep learning applications.

 DGX-1 
DGX-1 servers feature 8 GPUs based on the Pascal or Volta daughter cards with HBM 2 memory, connected by an NVLink mesh network.

The product line is intended to bridge the gap between GPUs and AI accelerators in that the device has specific features specializing it for deep learning workloads. 
The initial Pascal based DGX-1 delivered 170 teraflops of half precision processing, while the Volta-based upgrade increased this to 960 teraflops.

 DGX-2 
The successor of the Nvidia DGX-1 is the Nvidia DGX-2, which uses 16 32GB V100 (second generation) cards in a single unit.  This increases performance of up to 2 Petaflops with 512GB of shared memory for tackling larger problems and uses NVSwitch to speed up internal communication.
