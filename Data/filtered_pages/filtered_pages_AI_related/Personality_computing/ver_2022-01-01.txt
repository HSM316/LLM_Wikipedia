Personality computing is a research field related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology that studies personality by means of computational techniques from different sources, including text, multimedia and social networks.

 Overview 
Personality computing addresses three main problems involving personality: automatic personality recognition, perception and synthesis. Vinciarelli, Alessandro, and Gelareh Mohammadi. "A survey of personality computing." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 5.3 (2014): 273-291. Automatic personality recognition is the inference of personality type of target individuals from their digital footprint, automatic personality perception is the inference of the personality attributed by an observer to a target individual based on some observable behavior, and automatic personality synthesis is the generation of the style or behaviour of artificial personalities in Avatars and virtual agents.

Self-assessed personality tests or observer ratings are always exploited as the ground truth for testing and validating the performance of artificial intelligence algorithms for the automatic prediction of personality types.Celli, Fabio, et al. "Workshop on computational personality recognition (shared task)." Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Personality Recognition. 2013. There is a wide variety of personality tests, such as the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)Isabel Briggs Myers and Peter B Myers. 2010. Giftsdiffering:  Understanding personality type.  Davies-Black Publishing. or the MMPI, but the most used are tests based on the Five Factor Model such as the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.Paul  T  Costa  and  Robert  R  McCrae.  2008.   The  re-vised neo personality inventory (neo-pi-r).In G.J.Boyle,  G  Matthews  and  D.  Saklofske  (Eds.).  TheSAGE  handbook  of  personality  theory  and  assessment2:179–198

Personality computing can be considered as an extension or complement of Affective Computing, where the former focuses on personality traits and the latter on affective states. A further extension of the two fields is Character Computing which combines various character states and traits including but not limited to personality and affect.

History
Personality computing begun around 2005 with few pioneering research works in personality recognition showing that personality traits could be inferred with reasonable accuracy from text, such as blogs, self-presentations,Argamon, Shlomo, et al. "Lexical predictors of personality type." (2005).Oberlander, Jon, and Scott Nowson. "Whose thumb is it anyway?: classifying author personality from weblog text." Proceedings of the COLING/ACL on Main conference poster sessions. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2006.Mairesse, François, et al. "Using linguistic cues for the automatic recognition of personality in conversation and text." Journal of artificial intelligence research 30 (2007): 457-500. and email addresses.Back, Mitja D., Stefan C. Schmukle, and Boris Egloff. "How extraverted is honey. bunny77@ hotmail. de? Inferring personality from e-mail addresses." Journal of Research in Personality 42.4 (2008): 1116-1122. In 2008, the concept of "portable personality" for the distributed management of personality profiles has been developed.

Few years later begun the research in personality recognition and perception from multimodal and social signals, such as recorded meetingsPianesi, Fabio, et al. "Multimodal recognition of personality traits in social interactions." Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Multimodal interfaces. ACM, 2008. and voice calls.Mohammadi, Gelareh, and Alessandro Vinciarelli. "Automatic personality perception: Prediction of trait attribution based on prosodic features." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 3.3 (2012): 273-284.

In the 2010s the research focussed mainly on personality recognition and perception from social media, in particular from Facebook,Quercia, Daniele, et al. "The personality of popular Facebook users." Proceedings of the ACM 2012 conference on computer supported cooperative work. ACM, 2012.Schwartz, H. Andrew, et al.

In the same years Automatic personality synthesis helped improving the coherence of simulated behavior in virtual agents.Faur, Caroline, et al.

Scientific works demonstrated the validity of Personality Computing from different digital footprints, in particular from user preferences such as Facebook page likesKosinski, Michal, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel. "Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2013): 201218772. and showed that machines can recognize personality better than humansYouyou, Wu, Michal Kosinski, and David Stillwell.

 Applications 
Personality computing techniques, in particular personality recognition and perception, have applications in Social media marketing, where they can help reducing the cost of advertising campaigns through psychological targetingMatz, S. C., et al. "Psychological targeting as an effective approach to digital mass persuasion."
