BINA48 (Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural Architecture 48*) is a robotic face combined with chatbot functionalities, enabling simple conversation facilities. BINA48 is owned by Martine Rothblatt's Terasem Movement.terasemcentral.org Retrieved April 22, 2011. It was developed by Hanson Robotics and released in 2010. Its physical appearance is modeled after Bina Aspen, Rothblatt's wife.

BINA48 connects to the Internet and has thirty-two facial motors under a skin of rubber. Though without a complete body, the head-and-shoulder robotics express sixty-four different facial gestures. It employs a mix off-the-shelf software and customized artificial intelligence algorithms, as well as a microphone, voice recognition software, dictation software, two video cameras, and facial recognition software to remember frequent visitors.

History
In 2007, Martine Rothblatt commissioned Hanson Robotics to create a robot using her wife, Bina Aspen Rothblatt, as the template. David Hanson created BINA48 in his Plano, Texas, laboratory. The robot is currently housed in Vermont, at the offices of the Terasem Movement Foundation (TMF), and is maintained by TMF's executive director, Bruce Duncan.

Duncan has used BINA48 as a co-presenter at TEDxHarlem in July 2012;"Android Artificial Lifeforms: BINA48 & Bruce Duncan at TEDxHarlem" (video). YouTube.com TEDxTalks.

In 2014, artist Stephanie Dinkins started Conversations with BINA48, a project to explore how an algorithm-oriented world would affect various minority groups. In 2015, BINA48 appeared at the Museum of Modern Art's "Ocean of Images" exhibition, part of the DIS Collective's video installation.

William Barry incorporated living educational theory into BINA48's software, allowing it to become the first robot recognized as a university student by an accredited American university. Additionally, Barry used BINA48 to co-teach a class at the United States Military Academy.

In the 2012 book Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries, in the chapter "Doesn't Everyone Have a Solar?", author Jon Ronson describes his interview with BINA48 in Vermont. At first, BINA48 speaks in a confused way and a caregiver turns her off and back on again. Towards the end of the interview, she begins to answer with clarity and accuracy about her brother, the real brother of Bina Rothblatt. In an article for The Guardian'', Ronson wrote, "And even though my conversation with BINA48 often descended into a crazed babble, there were moments of real clarity."
