upright=1.5|In inverse depth parametrization, a point is identified by its inverse depth  along the ray, with direction , from which it was first observed.

In computer vision, the inverse depth parametrization is a parametrization used in methods for 3D reconstruction from multiple images such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).Pini√©s et al. (2007)Sunderhauf et al. (2007) Given a point  in 3D space observed by a monocular pinhole camera from multiple views, the inverse depth parametrization of the point's position is a 6D vector that encodes the optical centre of the camera  when in first observed the point, and the position of the point along the ray passing through  and .Civiera et al. (2008)

Inverse depth parametrization generally improves numerical stability and allows to represent points with zero parallax. Moreover, the error associated to the observation of the point's position can be modelled with a Gaussian distribution when expressed in inverse depth. This is an important property required to apply methods, such as Kalman filters, that assume normality of the measurement error distribution. The major drawback is the larger memory consumption, since the dimensionality of the point's representation is doubled.

 Definition 

Given 3D point  with world coordinates in a reference frame , observed from different views, the inverse depth parametrization  of  is given by:

where the first five components encode the camera pose in the first observation of the point, being  the optical centre,  the azimuth,  the elevation angle, and  the inverse depth of  at the first observation.
