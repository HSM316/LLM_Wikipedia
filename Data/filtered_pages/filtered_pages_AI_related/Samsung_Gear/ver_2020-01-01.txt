Samsung Gear is a line of wearable computing devices produced by Samsung Electronics.

The first device in the series, the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch, was announced in 2013. Since then, the line has expanded to include fitness bands and earbuds, as well as more smartwatches.

In February 2019, Samsung announced a new smartwatch, new fitness bands, and new earbuds under the "Samsung Galaxy," rather than "Samsung Gear," brand, thus potentially switching wearable products to that name.
