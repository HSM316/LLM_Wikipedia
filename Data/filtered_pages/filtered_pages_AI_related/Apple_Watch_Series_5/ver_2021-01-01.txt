 
The Apple Watch Series 5 is the sixth-generation model of the Apple Watch. It was released on September 20, 2019 during an Apple Special Event alongside the iPhone 11. Its principal improvement over its predecessor is the inclusion of an always-on display. It has received mostly positive reviews from critics, with reviewers praising the always-on display, but criticizing that there are few improvements from the previous watch. It was discontinued on September 15, 2020, following the release of Apple Watch Series 6.

Overview
The Apple Watch Series 5 includes an always-on display with energy saving LTPO OLED screen and low-power screen driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. The always-on display was not included in the Apple Watch Series 4. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling which enables emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more power-efficient S5 processor, improved ambient light sensor, doubling of storage capacity to 32 GB, and the addition of a magnetometer, which enables a compass function. It also brought back the "Edition" tier, with a ceramic model absent from the previous generation, and a new titanium model which comes in two colors: Natural and Space Black.
