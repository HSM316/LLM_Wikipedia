 Software 
Notion is a collaboration platform with Markdown and including kanban boards, tasks, wikis and databases. It is a workspace for notetaking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management. It has file management in a single workspace, allowing users to comment on ongoing projects, participate in discussions, and receive feedback. It can be accessed by cross-platform apps and by most web browsers.

It includes a "clipper" for screenshotting content from webpages. It exists for users to schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, set reminders, keep agendas, and organize their work. LaTeX support allows writing and pasting equations in block or inline form.

Users can sign in to Notion using their Google account, Apple ID or email.

 Features 
Notion does not require specialized training to use. It uses AI and a library of free and fee-based templates, with the Notion AI functionality, users can write and improve content, summarize existing notes, daily standup, adjust the tone, translate or check text. Security features include Security Assertion Markup Language single sign-on and private team spaces for their Business and Enterprise tiers.

Notion enables its users to integrate with more than 70 other SaaS tools, such as Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Zoom, Jira, Cisco Webex, Zapier, and Typeform.

 Blocks 
Everything in Notion is made up of blocks. Including text, images, tables, and pages themselves. This allows users to easily customize a page by adding and moving blocks in various ways. In June 2021, Notion released a 'synced block', which is a type of block that, when copied and pasted across different pages in a user's workspace, shows edits between them.

 Databases 
One of Notion's features is its database. Databases are used for storing information and can hold any number of rows and columns. By default, each row will have two pre-populated properties: 'Name' and 'Tags'. Users can add more properties, such as date, checkbox, multi-select, URL, and more. When creating databases, users can choose to either create it 'inline', within an already existing page, or as its own page.

 Templates 
Notion users can make and use templates. Notion hosts its own template gallery, where users can browse through templates made by other Notion creators. However, not all of these templates are free to use. Some creators profit from selling Notion templates. Jason Ruiyi Chen, from Singapore, made $239,000 by selling his Notion templates to his Twitter audience. Thomas Frank, a YouTuber with 2.8 million subscribers as of February 2023, made $1 million in 2022.

 Notion AI 
Notion AI uses artificial intelligence, which enables prediction of some results, text generation and solving arithmetic. It will also work with other datasets in response to an input by the user of the AI. This AI can automate some tasks, and assist the user to make a paragraph or outline from a single line of text. Notion AI has its own subscription set which is $10/monthper person. The service is powered by the API of Anthropic.

 Pricing 
Notion has a four-tiered subscription model: Free, Plus, Business and Enterprise. Users can also earn credit via referrals. As of May 2020, the company changed the Personal plan to allow unlimited blocks.
