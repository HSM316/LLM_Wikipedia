AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order is a 2018 non-fiction book by Beijing, China-based Kai-Fu Lee, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) pioneer, expert on China and a venture capitalist.  Lee previously held executive positions at Apple, then SGI, Microsoft, and Google before creating his own company, Sinovation Ventures.

 Themes 
In his September 2018 The New York Times Opinion piece, Thomas L. Friedman cited AI Superpowers in his summary of the emerging global dominance of China in AI. According to Kai-Fu Lee, "If data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia." Lee advances several arguments for why he thinks the artificial intelligence industry in China will excel in the artificial intelligence arms race:

 Training deep learning models requires more of a brute force method than innovation; well suited to China's supposedly higher quantity but lower quality of software engineer compared to the US
 China has fewer data protection regulations (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe) than other countries, so Chinese software collect more data on users.
 Chinese tech startup culture is more "aggressive" than that of other countries', with fewer intellectual property restrictions and fewer barriers to vertical integration
 The participation of China's central government in funding and raising the status of the AI industry

 Reception 
Senator Mark Warner named AI Superpowers as his recommended book for The 2018 POLITICO 50 Reading List. Foreign Affairs criticized the book for promoting zero-sum thinking and hyping Chinese state investment in tech ventures that often underperform relative to expectations; for focusing on deep learning to the exclusion of other forms of artificial intelligence; and for overgeneralizing the usefulness of Chinese data sets.
