Predix is General Electric's software platform for the collection and analysis of data from industrial machines. General Electric plans to support the growing industrial internet of things with cloud servers and an app store. GE is a member of the Industrial Internet Consortium which works to aid the development and use of industrial internet technologies.

Predix as a cloud-based PaaS (platform as a service) is claimed to enable industrial-scale analytics for asset performance management (APM) and operations optimization by providing a standard way to connect machines, data, and people. GE expects Predix software to do for factories and plants what Apple's iOS did for cell phones. Built on Cloud Foundry open source technology, Predix provides a microservices based delivery model with a distributed architecture (cloud, and on-machine).

 Overview 
Predix aims towards system wide optimization and to create a detailed model that spans entire systems such as aircraft operations. The model allows better optimization of each part of the system (such as a turbine blade) as well as optimization of the entire system (such as airline operations).

Predix is developed by GE Digital in San Ramon, California near Silicon Valley and originally its own business unit. In September 2015 it became re-integrated into General Electric's IT division.

In November 2016, Forrester Research published The Forrester Waveâ„¢: IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 and recognized GE's Predix as a leader in the evaluation.
