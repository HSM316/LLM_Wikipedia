Repl.it is a San Francisco-based start-up and an online IDE (integrated development environment). Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "read–evaluate–print loop". The service was created by Jordanian programmer Amjad Masad and Jordanian designer Haya Odeh in 2016. Repl.it allows users to write code and build apps and websites using a browser. Additionally, Repl.it allows users to share projects through various ways. A "Repl" at Repl.it is an interactive programming environment. You can create a workspace in most popular programming languages, where you are given a container on a virtual machine where your code can run. In any given Repl, there are two main parts - the editor and the console.

The editor uses Monaco, the same technology that powers Visual Studio Code. On mobile, the editor is Ace.

Repl.it has a premium tier called the Hacker plan. It allows for more storage space, private code, and unlimited collaborators on a project. The GitHub Education plan includes 3 months free of the Hacker plan.

There are over 60 different programming languages on repl.it, including Python, Ruby, HTML, and Java, along with lesser-known, esoteric languages like LOLCODE and Brainfuck.

The company has received funding from Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, and others. The company has over 500,000 weekly active developers and over 3 million users.
The Repl.it site also has a Talk forum. This forum is used by many developers around the world to share their creations. They also host code jams on Talk, and jam contest prizes often vary from a temporary account upgrade, money, cryptocurrency, or a gift card. Community made "jams" are also sometimes hosted on Repl.it's Talk, with the same purpose.
