Sycamore is the name of Google's quantum processor comprising 54 qubits. In 2019, Sycamore completed a task in 200 seconds that Google claimed, in a Nature paper, would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer 10,000 years to finish. Thus, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy. To estimate the time that would be taken by a classical supercomputer, Google ran portions of the quantum circuit simulation on the Summit (supercomputer), which is the most powerful classical computer in the world. Later, IBM would make a counter argument, claiming that the task would only take 2.5 days on a classical system like Summit.
