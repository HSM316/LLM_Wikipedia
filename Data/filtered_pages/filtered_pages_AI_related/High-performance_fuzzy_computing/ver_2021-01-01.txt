The term high-performance fuzzy computing (HPFC) refers to
those technologies able to exploit supercomputers and computer clusters
to perform high performance fuzzy logic computations.
Thus HPFC is just a special case of the much more general high-performance computing.
In the specific case of fuzzy logic, however, there exist more traditional ways to achieve high performance, that could be considered HPFC but in a broader sense, like the
hardware implementations on DSP or FPGA.
More recently, another alternative has emerged: fuzzy computing on GPU.
