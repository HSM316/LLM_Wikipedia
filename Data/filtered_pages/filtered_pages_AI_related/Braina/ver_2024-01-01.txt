Braina is an intelligent personal assistant and speech-to-text dictation application for Microsoft Windows marketed by Brainasoft. Braina uses natural language interface and speech recognition to interact with its users and allows users to use natural language sentences to perform various tasks on their computer. The application can find information from the internet, search and play songs, and videos of user's choice, take dictation, find and open files, set alarms and reminders, performs math calculations, controls windows and programs etc.

The name Braina is a short form of Brain Artificial. The software adapts to the user's behavior over time to better anticipate needs. Commands may either be spoken or typed. There is a free version with limited facilities, and a paid Pro version.

The software can transcribe speech from audio or video files. It enables a voice interface for ChatGPT, and allows using responses of in-house large language models as well as ChatGPT directly in any software or website.

A 2015 review in TechRadar was generally favourable, praising it as accurate but saying that the user interface looked dated, awarding 4 stars out of 5. In addition to the desktop version for Windows operating systems, Braina is also available as an application for mobile terminals on which Android and iOS operating systems reside. These versions have a feature for remote management of other terminals connected via Wi-Fi: remote control of a Windows computer, customizable RTU. Braina can also be used with cloud technology.
