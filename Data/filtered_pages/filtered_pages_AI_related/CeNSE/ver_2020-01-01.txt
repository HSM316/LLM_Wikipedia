CeNSE or the Central Nervous System of the Earth is a project by Hewlett-Packard, and others to place sensors everywhere. 

The idea is that sensors will transmit data at the speed of light (taking into account delay on networks). If an earthquake was to have its epicenter 20 miles away, you could know about it 10 seconds before you felt the ground shake. That’s the promise behind one of the newest products coming out of Hewlett-Packard’s labs. By installing a trillion tiny sensors to collect data about the world around us, HP is trying to build a central nervous system for the earth. HP will first deploy CeNSE to help Shell drill for oil.
