Just as ImageNet can be thought of as a database of classified visual objects, Inception helps classification of objects in the world of Computer_vision. One such use is in Life Sciences, where it aids in the research of Leakumia. As referenced at DeepDream it was "codenamed 'Inception' after the film of the same name".
