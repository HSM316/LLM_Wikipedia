Oculus Rift S is a virtual reality headset created by Oculus VR released on March 20, 2019. The device is the second device in the Oculus Rift lineup, replacing the first generation Oculus Rift CV1. At the time of its launch, the Rift S was commercialized at the same price point of $399 (with a recent price slash to $299) as the CV1, featuring the same hardware requirements and software compatibility as the CV1.

 History 
In June 2015, Oculus VR co-founder Palmer Luckey revealed that Oculus was already working on a successor to the original Rift and planned to release it in around 2–3 years from the original Rift release. The headset would feature higher resolution screen and inside-out tracking and would enable room scale experiences.

In October 2018, Oculus VR co-founder and former CEO until 2016 Brendan Iribe left Oculus VR, allegedly due to both parts having "fundamentally different views on the future of Oculus that grew deeper over time." Iribe wanted to deliver comfortable VR experience competitive on the high-end market while Oculus leadership aimed to lower the VR gaming entry barrier. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Oculus parent company Facebook Inc., repeatedly stated that Oculus goal is to bring a billion users into VR. Iribe was said to be overseeing the development of the second generation Oculus Rift, which was canceled the week prior to his departure.

Oculus Rift S was announced during GDC 2019 on March 20, with shipments starting on May 21 the same year.

On September 16, 2020, Facebook announced the discontinuation of the Rift S in favor of the Oculus Quest 2 with sales ending in spring 2021.

 Hardware 

 Display 
Rift S uses a single fast-switch LCD panel with a resolution of 2560×1440 with refresh rate 80 Hz, down from the CV1's 90 Hz. Compared to the original Rift, the screen in the Rift S is expected to deliver higher detail image with reduced screen-door effect.

Also, compared to the original Rift, the Rift S uses "next generation" lens technology, introduced in Oculus Go, which almost entirely eliminates god rays. The field of view is 115º, compared to 110º on the Rift CV1. The headset features software-only inter pupillary distance (IPD) adjustment, because it uses a single screen instead of dual displays.

 Audio 
As opposed to earphones attached to the strap as on the CV1, built-in audio on the Rift S uses speakers embedded in the headset itself, positioned slightly above the user's ears.

 Oculus Insight 
The Rift S uses the same "Oculus Insight" inside-out tracking system used by the Oculus Quest, whereby five cameras built into the headset (two on the front, one on either side, and one looking directly upwards) that track infrared diodes in the controllers, as well as input from the accelerometers in the headset and controllers, and a prediction engine , are used to spatially track the headset and controller (removing the need for external sensors mounted in the play area).

Passthrough+ is provided as a safety feature, which displays output from the cameras in monoscopic black and white when the player exits their designated boundaries. Passthrough+ also makes use of "Asynchronous SpaceWarp" to produce a comfortable experience with minimal depth disparity or performance impact.

 Halo headband 
Rift S features a halo headband which, according to Oculus, has a better weight distribution, better light blocking, and will be more comfortable overall. The headset was co-developed with Lenovo, incorporating their experience in the VR and AR space and feedback from the Lenovo Legion gaming community. The device has a knob at the rear of the band which brings the device forward and backward. The top strap is there to make it snug on the wearer's head, while a button underneath the right side of the headset is used to release the headset from its support, allowing it to be adjusted to be closer or farther from the user's eyes. The device lacks physical adjustment for inter-pupillary distance (IPD), but this setting is supported in software, according to Oculus.

 Controllers 
The second-generation Oculus Touch controllers included with the Oculus Rift S
Oculus Rift S uses the same second generation Oculus Touch controllers used in the Oculus Quest. The controllers are similar to the ones used by the original Oculus Rift, except with the tracking ring on the top (to be seen by the headset's built-in cameras) instead of being on the bottom (to be seen by the Constellation cameras.)

 Software 

 Software compatibility and Cross-play 
Oculus announced intention to support every existing and future game on the Rift platform for the Rift S and the original Rift. Furthermore, a game purchased for one device can later be played on another (that is, say, a game bought on Oculus Quest can be played on Rift S). Multiplayer games that support both platforms will let players play with one another regardless of their devices.

 Passthrough+ 
Oculus Passthrough is a feature of Oculus Rift S and Oculus Quest which allows user to see the real world via the built-in cameras. This is used during the initial setup process for defining the Guardian barrier (the blue mesh barrier that prevents user from walking into physical objects like walls and furniture) and the level of the floor, or when the user gets close to exiting or steps outside the barrier. During the setup process, the surrounding is displayed as a black and white representation.

 Reception 
The Rift S received mixed reviews. The Verge felt that the Insight system was "easily a match for the old Rift tracking cameras" and helped make setup less complicated, and that its halo strap was more comfortable than that of the Oculus Quest, but felt that some of its other changes were downgrades over the previous model and Quest — including replacing its headphones with directional speakers, the lack of hardware IPD adjustment, and a screen whose resolution only slightly higher than the Rift CV1 but lower than the Oculus Quest.
Wired described the device as a "giant half-step" that brings Oculus closer to the modern "virtual realities" yet stops short of the competition.

Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey criticized the lack of hardware IPD, stating that the software-only adjustment was not comparable in any way to an actual physical IPD adjustment mechanism. He estimated that about 30% of the population — including himself — would not be able to use the Rift S comfortably. In comparison, the original Rift CV1 was designed to support any IPD between the 5th and 95th percentile (58mm and 72mm, respectively), making the device comfortable for 90% of the population.

 Hidden messages in Touch Controllers 
On April 12, 2019, Nate Mitchell, co-founder of Oculus VR and head of VR product at Facebook, explained via Twitter that "some 'easter egg' labels meant for prototypes accidentally made it onto the internal hardware for tens of thousands of [Oculus Quest and Rift S] Touch controllers." The messages on final production hardware say 'This Space For Rent' and 'The Masons Were Here,' while a few development kits contained 'Big Brother is Watching' and 'Hi iFixit! We See You!'
