In mathematics, the Sugeno integral, named after M.Â Sugeno,Sugeno, M. (1974) Theory of fuzzy integrals and its applications, Doctoral. Thesis, Tokyo Institute of Technology is a type of integral with respect to a fuzzy measure.

Let  be a measurable space and let  be an -measurable function.

The Sugeno integral over the crisp set  of the function  with respect to the fuzzy measure  is defined by:
 
where .

The Sugeno integral over the fuzzy set  of the function  with respect to the fuzzy measure  is defined by:

 

where  is the membership function of the fuzzy set .

 Usage and Relationships 

Sugeno integral is related to h-index.
