Picollator is an Internet search engine that performs searches for web sites and multimedia by visual query (image) or text, or a combination of visual query and text. Picollator recognizes objects in the image, obtains their relevance to the text and vice versa, and searches in accordance with all information provided.

 Description 

Picollator identifies human faces in the images and creates a database of people's faces. This allows the user to search for other images of the submitted person, lookalikes and/or similar images in images found on websites. Picollator can be used in any language.
