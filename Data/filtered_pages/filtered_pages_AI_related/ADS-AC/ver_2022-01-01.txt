ADS-AC is an experimental open source program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System (ADS), a proposed mechanism for Artificial Consciousness (AC).

Theory
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.
