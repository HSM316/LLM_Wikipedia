Stochastic semantic analysis is an approach used in computer science as a semantic component of natural language understanding.

Stochastic models generally use the definition of segments of words as basic semantic units for the semantic models, and in some cases involve a two layered approach.Language Understanding Using Two-Level Stochastic Models by F. Pla, et al, 2001, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science 

Example applications have a wide range. In machine translation, it has been applied to the translation of spontaneous conversational speech among different languages.W. Minkera, M. Gavald√†b and A. Waibel Stochastically-based semantic analysis for machine translation in Computer Speech & Language Volume 13, Issue 2, April 1999, Pages 177-194 In the area of spoken language understanding the fact that spoken sentences often do not follow the grammar of a language and involve self-corrections, repetitions, and other irregularities, the use of stochastic semantic has been suggested as a natural fit to achieve robustness to deal with noise due to the spontaneous nature of spoken language.R.
