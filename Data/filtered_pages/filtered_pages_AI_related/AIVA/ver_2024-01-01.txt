AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist) is an electronic composer recognized by the SACEM.

Description
Created in February 2016, AIVA specializes in classical and symphonic music composition. It became the world's first virtual composer to be recognized by a music society (SACEM).
By reading a large collection of existing works of classical music (written by human composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart) AIVA is capable of detecting regularities in music and on this base composing on its own. The algorithm AIVA is based on deep learning and reinforcement learning architectures. Since January 2019, the company offers a commercial product, Music Engine, capable of generating short (up to 3 minutes) compositions in various styles (rock, pop, jazz, fantasy, shanty, tango, 20th century cinematic, modern cinematic, and Chinese).

AIVA was presented at TED Pierre Barreau: How AI could compose a personalized soundtrack to your life, TED 2018: the Age of Amazement by Pierre Barreau.
