IHMC Levin Center

The Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition (IHMC) is a not-for-profit research institute of the State University System of Florida, with locations in Pensacola and Ocala, Florida. IHMC scientists and engineers investigate a broad range of topics related to building technological systems aimed at amplifying and extending human cognitive, physical and perceptual capacities. These include artificial intelligence, robotics, human-centered computing, agile and distributed computing and many related areas."Manning up: IHMC Explores the Intersection of Man and Machine."

History
IHMC was founded by Dr. Kenneth M. Ford, Dr. Alberto Cañas, and Dr. Bruce Dunn on the campus of the University of West Florida, in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  IHMC was the first interdisciplinary academic research institution that allowed computer scientists, philosophers, and psychologists to collaborate on human centered computing projects.Kenneth M. Ford, et al. "Coordinating Behavior of Distributed Systems," AI Magazine, Summer 2010.    Also: State University System of Florida, Board of Governors; online publication. The first class of IHMC researchers included eminent scholars such as Henry E. Kyburg Jr., Clark Glymour, Pat Hayes, James F. Allen, Robert Hoffman, and Joseph D. Novak all of whom are credited for laying the foundational work for how humans interact with machines in the modern world.https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.197.4167&rep=rep1&type=pdf

In 2004, after nearly two decades of research as part of the University of West Florida, the Florida Legislature, under the K-20 Education Code, established IHMC as an independent, statewide research institute.Florida Statute 1004.447. This classification change allowed IHMC to develop and maintain research affiliations with multiple Florida universities.State University System of Florida, Board of Governors. Online publication.  By 2010 IHMC had been recognized by the U.S. Economic Development Administration for the institute's impact on downtown Pensacola.U.S. Economic Development Administration / U.S. Department of Commerce; online publication.  Around that time, the institute was seeking to expand it's research footprint, which led to IHMC opening a new research facility in downtown Ocala in central Florida.Barnett, Cynthia. "Human, Machine Research Institute Joins Ocala's Downtown". Florida Trend. Summer 2010.

In a direct response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster the United States Department of Defense began a series of global robotics competitions to push humanoid robots to the realm of usability for first responders in disaster scenarios.  The first leg of these competitions, labeled the Virtual Robotics Challenge, pitted 26 teams from across the globe with the common goal of programming a virtual humanoid robot avatar to complete multiple tasks modeled after real world challenges that first responders experience.https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/osrf-prepares-for-darpa-virtual-robotics-challenge  The IHMC Robotics team finished first in the Virtual Robotics Challenge, which awarded the top 8 teams an Atlas robot built by Boston Dynamics and funding to compete in the DARPA Robotics Challenge.  In December 2012 the IHMC Robotics team placed second overall in the DARPA Robotics Trials, the first phase of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, which awarded IHMC the funding to compete in the final three year leg of the competition.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: https://www.ocala.com/article/LK/20130704/news/604143826/OS/https://www.afcea.org/content/darpa-announces-eight-robotics-challenge-trials-winnersDavis, Brett.

During that time, the same IHMC researchers competing in the DARPA Robotics Challenge also developed an innovative series of running robots in the FastRunner project,Ackerman, Evan. "This Is What DARPA's Robot Ostrich Will Look Like". IEEE Spectrum. Nov. 14, 2011. and IHMC's Natural Language Processing researchers were selected by DARPA to participate in the Big mechanism program which used computers to analyze vast amounts of research and identify underlying mechanisms in complex systems.“Big Mechanisms Seeks the ‘Whys’ Hidden in Big Data.” DARPA website, Feb. 20, 2014.

In 2016 IHMC completed construction on the award winning Levin Center for IHMC Research 30,000-square-foot building in downtown Pensacola, with expanded laboratories, research areas and offices."IHMC breaks ground on new 30,000-square-foot-building." Pensacola News Journal. (Feb. 9, 2015).https://ricksblog.biz/levin-center-for-ihmc-research-wins-peoples-choice-award/ Also that year, IHMC senior research scientist Jerry Pratt was named to the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame, followed in 2017 by IHMC Director Kenneth M. Ford.Florida Inventors Hall of Fame web page. http://www.floridainvents.org

IHMC's paraplegic mobility research team participated in the inaugural Cybathlon in 2016.  The Cybathlon was the worlds first international competition for cyber-assisted athletes, and like the Olympics takes place every four years. Exoskeleton pilot Mark Daniel utilized IHMC's fourth paraplegic mobility device MinaV2 to compete in Cybathlon 2016 and the Quix Mobility Platform developed for the Mobility Unlimited Challenge sponsored by the Toyota Mobility Foundation to compete in the Cybathlon 2020.https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezebz4/the-cybathlon-where-paraplegics-walk-againhttps://cybathlon.ethz.ch/enhttps://mobilityunlimited.org

Outreach
IHMC sponsors a number of outreach efforts in the local community, including a public Evening Lecture Series in both Pensacola and Ocala. The series has hosted dozens of notable speakers and in 2011 was recognized by STEMflorida Inc., a not-for-profit group that promotes science, technology, engineering and math education. IHMC also supports local education through programs such as its Science Saturdays, I LOVE Science, and robotics open houses and summer camps.National Robotics Week web site; 2015 Events; iRobot Corp. http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/events.php 

In early 2000, IHMC began production on the Evening Lecture Series.  Each lecture features a visiting researcher, thought leader, or public figure and focuses on educating the public on a variety of topics. There are over two hundred IHMC Evening Lectures hosted on YouTube as of December 2020.https://www.youtube.com/user/TheIHMC

STEM-Talk is a bi-weekly podcast produced by the institute. The podcast launched on March 1, 2016 with guest Peter Attia discussing his research into health and longevity.https://www.ihmc.us/stemtalk/episode001/  As of December 2020, there are 116 episodes with subjects discussing a wide variety of research topics.https://www.ihmc.us/stemtalks/
