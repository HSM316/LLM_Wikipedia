 Production 
The sound was designed by Andrew Dubber and Sean James Donnelly. The music was performed by Victoria Kelly and Joost Langeveld.

The show was designed with a story arc spanning a full year in mind, but was cancelled after six months and ending the show on a cliffhanger. In 2006, Dubber sketched what he remembered of how the writers and producers imagined it may have continued.Andrew Dubber. "The End of Claybourne", Andrew Dubber's blog, May 2006.
