Mircea Luca was born on 3 August 1921 in [[Zalău]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and he started to play football in 1932, aged 11 at the junior center of [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]].<ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/> He made his debut for the senior squad at age 18 under coach [[Ferenc Nyúl]] who used him as a [[Forward_(association_football)#Winger|winger]] on 18 November 1939 in the last game of the [[1938–39 Divizia B]] season which was a 6–1 home win over [[CSM Câmpia Turzii|Industria Sârmei Câmpia Turzii]].<ref name=4ever/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1938-1939/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1938–39 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref> In the first home game of the [[1938–39 Divizia B|following season]], Luca was also used as a winger by new coach Janos Szaniszló, scoring a brace in a 7–0 victory with [[Stăruința Oradea]], these being his only two goals in his total of five appearances in the season, at the end of which the club finished second and gained promotion to [[Liga I|Divizia A]].<ref name=4ever/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1939-1940/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1939–40 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref>

Mircea Luca became "U" Cluj's captain in 1941, in the hardest period of the club's history, as in 1940, the team moved from [[Cluj-Napoca]] to [[Sibiu]] as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]], when the northern part of [[Transylvania]] was ceded to [[Hungary]].<ref name=gandul/><ref name=transilvania2/><ref name=ucluj/> In 1945, after the end of the [[Second World War]] and the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|return of the northern part of Transylvania]] to Romania, "U" returned to its home in Cluj.<ref name=gandul/><ref name=transilvania2/><ref name=ucluj/> During these years some players left to play for [[Bucharest]] teams but Luca refused to do so, also the team's biggest performance was the reaching of the [[1942 Cupa României final]], in which however Luca did not play in the eventual defeat in front of [[FC Rapid București|Rapid București]].<ref name=gandul/><ref name=ucluj/><ref name=RSCUP>{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/romanian_cup/1941_1942.shtml|title= Romanian Cup – 1941–1942|publisher=RomanianSoccer|access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref> After the war in which some of the club's players died, the team had to earn its right to play in Cluj, by playing against [[Ferar Cluj]] who during the war competed in the [[Nemzeti Bajnokság I|Hungarian league]] under the name ''Kolozsvár AC'', finishing on the third place in [[1943–44 Nemzeti Bajnokság I|one season]] and had more experienced and international footballers.<ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/> According to historian Gheorghe Bodea who was at the game, the differences between the two teams could be seen since the players entered the field as the ones of Ferar had modern new equipment while the players of "U" appeared in equipment that was five years old.<ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/> Bodea also claims that the game was dominated at first by Ferar but Universitatea resisted with Luca being the leader of the defense, at one moment in the game he got his arch broken during an aerial duel, teammate [[Sever Coracu]] bandaging him in order to continue the game.<ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/> With Luca taking care of the defense and Coracu of the offense, "U" Cluj won with 4–0, Luca being named "Man of the match".<ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/> In December 2007 in an interview for the ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]'' newspaper, Luca said:"Only I know how I gathered them for a match with Ferar (...) They had a strong team, as Cluj never had, one like a racing horse. We won that match 4–0, one that I care a lot about and that ended Ferar's hegemony in Transylvania".<ref name=GSP/> 

In the summer of 1946, the [[Romanian Football Federation]] decided that Universitatea Cluj had to play a play-off against [[FC Victoria Cluj|Victoria Cluj]] in order to earn the right to play in the [[1946–47 Divizia A]] season.<ref name=4ever/> During the first leg, while the score was 1–1, [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Nicolae Szoboszlay]] got injured, so Luca took his place, managing to not concede a goal, as the game ended with a draw.<ref name=4ever/> The second leg was won by ''The Red Caps'' with 3–1, thus earning their right to play in the first league where they would stay for the following three seasons, relegating in 1949.<ref name=4ever/> During this period the team also reached the [[1949 Cupa României final]] in which coach [[Iuliu Baratky]] used Mircea Luca all the minutes in the eventual 2–1 loss in front of [[FC Steaua București|CSCA București]].<ref name=4ever/><ref name=RSCUP2>{{cite web|url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/romanian_cup/1948_1949.shtml|title=Romanian Cup – 1948–1949 |publisher=RomanianSoccer|access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref> In the [[1950 Divizia B]] season, Luca played 19 games, helping the club finish on the first place and gain back promotion to the first league, he even played in a 2–1 win over [[CFR Cluj|Locomotiva Cluj]] from the beginning as a goalkeeper because the usual goalkeeper, Crăciun got injured with two days before the game.<ref name=4ever/><ref name=4ever2>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1950-1951/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1950 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref> In the following six years, the team played in the first league with Luca's style of play being appreciated by the journalists, also on 20 November 1955 during an away match with [[FC Petrolul Ploiești|Flacăra Ploiești]], goalkeeper Ghibănescu got injured, so Luca went again in the goalpost but this time the game ended with a 4–1 loss.<ref name=4ever/> In the [[1956 Divizia A|1956 season]], the team finished on the 12th place, relegating to Divizia B, the last game of the season being Luca's last game of his career, a 5–2 home loss in front of [[Club Atletic Oradea|Progresul Oradea]].<ref name=4ever/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1956-1957/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1956 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.romaniansoccer.ro/statistici/fotbal/universitatea-cluj-1956.htm | title=Universitatea Cluj 1956 season| publisher=Romaniansoccer.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref> He has a total of 176 appearances with one goal scored in Divizia A, also he is known for playing for at least one game on all the main positions in football: goalkeeper, defender, [[midfielder]] and forward.<ref name=4ever/>

==Managerial career==
After retiring from his playing activity, he always remained close to Universitatea Cluj, being president or coach, especially in hard times.<ref name=transilvania/><ref name=gandul/><ref name=4ever/><ref name=ucluj/> Luca first coached "U" in the second half of the [[1963–64 Divizia A]] season, the team finishing on the 9th place.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1963-1964/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1963–64 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref> He coached the team once more but just for one round by the end of the [[1972–73 Divizia A]] season, obtaining a draw in the [[Cluj derby]] with [[CFR Cluj]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.4everucluj.ro/istorie/1972-1973/ | title=Universitatea Cluj 1972–73 season| publisher=4everucluj.ro| language=Romanian}}</ref> 

==Personal life==
He also worked as an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]] surgeon.<ref name=transilvania/><ref name=4ever/><ref name=transilvania2/><ref name=ucluj/> A book about the history of Universitatea Cluj, written by journalist [[Ioan Chirilă]] called ''Șepcile Roșii'' ({{langx|en|The Red Caps}}), ends with a analysis by Dr. Mircea Luca about the club:"Universitatea Cluj won and lost when no one expected. Even its victory in the [[1964–65 Cupa României|Cupa României]] is the result of some calendar coincidences, when the students found the maximum form through the laws of chance. "U" tried several times to be more more than it can. It tried to forget what it was. It tried, in the last resort, to stop being "U", sacrificing the lovely black horseshoe on its student chest, in the name of wanting to be what it could never be. Universitatea Cluj will always be just a champion of unsettled enthusiasms. Can there be a more beautiful title?".<ref name=GSP/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcucluj.ro/istorie|title=Istorie |publisher=Fcucluj.ro|trans-title=History|access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref> In 1994, he received the Honorary Citizen of Cluj-Napoca title.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.prosport.ro/fotbal-intern/liga-2/expozitia-u100-a-fost-vandalizata-foto-cum-arata-acum-panourile-care-intruchipeaza-legendele-universitatii-18321287 | title=Expoziția "U100" a fost vandalizată!

With this death, the symbolism of "U" ended. I am very saddened by the loss. Such love as his for the colors of the team, has never existed in the history of the team", also [[Remus Câmpeanu]] who was "U" Cluj's president at that time said:"For me, he was a model, both as a person and as a player. He loved this team, with whom he stayed both through thick and thin. We were proud of him and we will continue to be proud. I would like to have people like him near the team".<ref name=GSP/> 

On 1 December 2013 a bronze statue of him was revealed to the public by his nephew, Ovidiu Luca and former "U" Cluj players [[Nicolae Szoboszlay]] and [[Remus Câmpeanu]] in front of the [[Cluj Arena|Cluj Arena stadium]], also in front of the statue was placed a marble plaque that says: "Dr. Mircea Luca 1921–2008.
