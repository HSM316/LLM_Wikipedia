The '''S4''' is a railway service of the [[St. Gallen S-Bahn]] that provides hourly service between {{rws|Sargans}} and {{rws|Rapperswil}} via {{rws|St. Gallen}}, connecting stations in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden|Appenzell Ausserrhoden]]. The section near [[Lake Constance]] ({{lang|de|Bodensee}}) is also part of the [[Bodensee S-Bahn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://s-bahn-bodensee.com/de/# |title=S-Bahn Bodensee |accessdate=2023-06-11 |lang=de}}</ref> [[Südostbahn]] (SOB), a private company primarily owned by the federal government and the canton of St. Gallen, operates the service.

Between 2013–2023 it operated over a [[circle route|circular route]] ({{langx|de|Ringzug}}), also running over the [[Ziegelbrücke–Sargans railway line]] south of the [[Walensee]]. 

== Operations ==
The S4 operates hourly between {{rws|Sargans}} and {{rws|Rapperswil}} via {{rws|St. Gallen}}. The service is operated by [[Stadler Rail]] [[Stadler FLIRT|Flirt/Flirt-3]] [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]] of Südostbahn (SOB). 

The S4 operates with the [[S6 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S6]], [[S17 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S17]] and [[InterRegio|IR]] ''[[Voralpen-Express]]'' between Rapperswil and {{rws|Uznach}}, combining for four trains per hour and direction. The S4 does not call at intermediate stations {{rws|Blumenau}} and {{rws|Schmerikon}}. The S4 and the [[S2 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S2]] combine for half-hourly service between {{rws|Wattwil}} and {{rws|Altstätten SG}}. Service between St. Gallen and [[St. Margrethen]] is more frequent due to the additional [[S5 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S5]], which runs hourly. Between Wattwil and Uznach, the S4 combines with the IR ''Voralpen-Express'' for a half-hourly service.

The service links the [[Alpine Rhine Valley]] and the city of [[St. Gallen]] with the ''[[Obersee (Lake Zurich)|Obersee]]'' region, via  [[Herisau]], the capital of the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, and the [[Toggenburg]] Valley.

== History ==
[[File:Murg Flirt.jpeg|304px|thumb|right|A counter-clockwise S4 at {{rws|Murg}} in 2020]]
Prior to the December 2013 timetable change, the S4 operated between St. Gallen and {{rws|Uznach}}. Local service between Uznach and {{rws|Sargans}} was handled by an hourly regional service that ran between {{rws|Ziegelbrücke}} and {{rws|Chur}}.<ref name="fpf900">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2012/900.pdf | title = Zürich HB–Ziegelbrücke–Sargans–Chur | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=5 July 2012 | accessdate = 25 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref> Service southeast of St. Gallen toward Sargans was handled by various local services, but only the ''{{ill|Rheintal-Express|de}}'' operated over the whole route.<ref name="fpf880">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2012/880.pdf | title = St. Gallen–Rorschach–Buchs SG–Sargans–Chur | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=December 2011 | accessdate = 25 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref>

[[Südostbahn]] introduced the new S4 on 15 December 2013 as a [[circle route|circle line]] ({{langx|de|Ringzug}}), which was sometimes referred to as the '[[Alpstein]] round trip' (''Alpsteinrundfahrt'').<ref>SOB.ch: https://unterwegs.sob.ch/de/stories/rundfahrt-saentis</ref> Until 9 December 2023, the service operated hourly in both a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction. A full journey around the circle took approximately three hours. In {{rws|Uznach}}, which lies to the west of the junction between the [[Uznach–Wattwil railway|Uznach–Wattwil]] and [[Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke railway|Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke line]]s, the trains reversed their direction of travel before continuing on the circle route.<ref>{{cite web | title=S4 – Erster Ringzug der Schweiz | url=https://issuu.com/voralpen-express/docs/aa | accessdate=16 December 2023 | lang=de | last=Südostbahn}}</ref>

With the 10 December 2023 timetable change, the circular operation ended. The S4's new termini became {{rws|Rapperswil}} and Sargans, respectively, and the new [[S17 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S17]] began running between Rapperswil and Sargans via {{rws|Ziegelbrücke}}. However, the trainsets operating as S4 and S17 services continue as the respective other line from Sargans, so that passengers can still take the circular route around Alpstein without changing trains in Sargans; a change of trains is nonetheless required in either Uznach or Rapperswil.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-04 |title=Mehr Züge nach Rapperswil und neue Liniennummern: So verkehren die Züge künftig am Obersee |url=https://direkt.sob.ch/news-detail/mehr-zuege-nach-rapperswil-und-neue-liniennummern-so-verkehren-die-zuege-kuenftig-am-obersee |access-date=2023-12-16 |website=Schweizerische Südostbahn AG (SOB) |language=de}}</ref> Rerouting of the S4 and introduction of the new S17 service were made possible through the expansion to [[double-track|dual track]] between {{rws|Uznach}} and {{rws|Schmerikon}} (constructed between 2021 and 2023) on the Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke railway line.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-05-04 |title=Ausbauten Obersee und Doppelspur Uznach–Schmerikon |url=https://company.sbb.ch/de/ueber-die-sbb/projekte/projekte-zuerich-ostschweiz/s-bahn-obersee.html |access-date=2023-12-17 |website=SBB.ch |language=de}}</ref>
