The '''S4''' is a railway service of the [[St. Gallen S-Bahn]] that provides hourly service over a [[circle route|circular route]] ({{lang-de|Ringzug}}) that includes {{rws|St. Gallen}}, {{rws|Uznach}}, and {{rws|Sargans}}, in the [[canton of St. Gallen]]. [[Südostbahn]], a private company primarily owned by the federal government and the canton, operates the service.

[[File:SOB RABe 526 002 (52423042062).jpg|304px|thumb|right|Stadler Flirt3 EMU (in operation since 2019)]]
The S4 operates hourly in both a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction. A full journey around the circle takes approximately three hours. In {{rws|Uznach}}, which lies to the west of the junction between the [[Uznach–Wattwil railway|Uznach–Wattwil]] and [[Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke railway|Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke line]]s, the trains reverse their direction of travel.  The S4 circle line is sometimes referred to as the '[[Alpstein]] round trip' (''Alpsteinrundfahrt'').<ref>SOB.ch: https://unterwegs.sob.ch/de/stories/rundfahrt-saentis</ref> The service is operated by [[Stadler Rail]] [[Stadler FLIRT|Flirt/Flirt-3]] [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]] of Südostbahn (SOB). 

The S4 offers half-hourly services in combination with other services between the following stations: with the [[S6 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S6]] (St. Gallen S-Bahn) between {{rws|Ziegelbrücke}} and [[Uznach]], with the [[InterRegio|IR]] ''[[Voralpen-Express]]'' between Uznach and [[St. Gallen]], and with the [[S2 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S2]] of St. Gallen S-Bahn between [[Wattwil]] and [[Altstätten SG]]. Service between St. Gallen and [[St. Margrethen]] is more frequent due to the additional [[S5 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S5]] (St. Gallen S-Bahn), which runs hourly.

== History ==
Prior to the December 2013 timetable change, the S4 operated between St. Gallen and {{rws|Uznach}}. Local service between Uznach and {{rws|Sargans}} was handled by an hourly regional service that ran between {{rws|Ziegelbrücke}} and {{rws|Chur}}.<ref name="fpf900">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2012/900.pdf | title = Zürich HB–Ziegelbrücke–Sargans–Chur | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=5 July 2012 | accessdate = 25 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref> Service southeast of St. Gallen toward Sargans was handled by various local services, but only the ''{{ill|Rheintal-Express|de}}'' operated over the whole route.<ref name="fpf880">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2012/880.pdf | title = St. Gallen–Rorschach–Buchs SG–Sargans–Chur | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=December 2011 | accessdate = 25 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref>
