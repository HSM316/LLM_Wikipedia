== Career ==

=== NXT ring announcer and sporadic Raw appearances (2016-2019) ===
Romero signed with [[WWE]] in May 2016, having previously worked for [[Nickelodeon]] as a touring [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]], and for [[Walt Disney World]] and [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], as a cast member.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/mike-rome-interview|title=NXT ring announcer Mike Rome on his boy band background, his most embarrassing moment and more|work=WWE|first=Byron|last=Saxton|author-link=Byron Saxton|date=January 6, 2017|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>  He began working as a ring announcer for the [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT brand]] on its Florida loop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/daily-updates/daily-update-wwe-extreme-rules-mcgregor-espn-213201|title=Daily Update: WWE Extreme Rules preview, Conor McGregor speaks|work=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|author-link=Dave Meltzer|date=May 22, 2016|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> He was also the ring announcer at the [[Cruiserweight Classic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/article/102930/second-wwe-cruiserweight-classic-spoilers-report-live-notes.html|title=SECOND WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CLASSIC SPOILERS REPORT & LIVE NOTES|publisher=PWInsider.com|first=Andrew|last=Twiss|date=June 23, 2016|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> and made his debut on WWE programming on the September 7, 2016, episode of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]''. His [[ring name]] is a shortened version of his [[middle name]] and his [[surname]], and he initially went by his full middle name and the shortened version of his surname, before it was changed before a ''NXT'' taping to differentiate himself from [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msnZqYZ5Q0o|title=Mike Rome on his tattoos, WrestleMania 36, Alexa Bliss, his voice cracking on TV, ring announcing|via=YouTube|first=Chris|last=Van Vliet|author-link=Chris Van Vliet|access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref> Rome would make his main roster debut on the January 16, 2017, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', in a backstage segment interviewing [[Nia Jax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LQS7ez41-U|title=Nia Jax shows no remorse after ambushing Sasha Banks: Raw, Jan. 16, 2017|via=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> He would continue to make appearances on both ''NXT'' and ''Raw'', with his final ''NXT'' appearance as an interviewer at [[NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn 4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/nxt-takeover-brooklyn-iv-live-results-ciampa-vs-gargano-264031|title=NXT TakeOver Brooklyn IV live results: Ciampa vs. Gargano|work=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|first=Chris|last=Aiken|date=August 18, 2018|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> From then on, Rome would appear regularly on the main roster shows.

Rome has occasionally been used on ''Raw'' or otherwise to further storylines. In an backstage segment in July 2018, [[Alexa Bliss]] was promoting ''Table for 3'' on the [[WWE Network]], when Rome walked by and interrupted her, thinking she was asking him out on a date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=119&v=7J75Ns85t90|title=Do you want to go to dinner with Alexa Bliss?: WWE Network Pick of the Week, July 13, 2018|via=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> As part of WWE's online content, Rome would portray a delusional character who was sure he would be having dinner with Bliss.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdYxeOzVNp0|title=Mike Rome apologizes to Alexa Bliss: Raw Exclusive, July 16, 2018|via=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nelPOhhwd4|title=Alexa Bliss gives Mike Rome his just desserts: WWE Exclusive, July 26, 2018|via=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AAgiRDiQ_8|title=Alexa Bliss keeps Mike Rome waiting: WWE Exclusive, Aug. 9, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAadAP6_b8|title=Bliss recalls going to a high school dance in a neck brace: Network Pick of the Week, August 31 2018|via=YouTube|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>

=== Raw ring announcer (2019-2023) ===
Starting in January 2019, Rome became the main Raw ring announcer after previous announcer [[JoJo (wrestling)|JoJo]] quietly left that position. Beginning in April 2019, Rome, much like his ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' counterpart Greg Hamilton, was forced by [[Shane McMahon]] to introduce him to the ring with emphasis on the phrase "best in the world" (relating to McMahon's gimmick at the time).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2019/04/15/4-15-wwe-raw-results-kellers-report-on-superstar-shake-up-including-more-fallout-from-wrestlemania-35/|title=4/15 WWE Raw Results: Keller's report on Superstar Shake-up including more fallout from WrestleMania 35|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Wade|last=Keller|author-link=Wade Keller|date=April 15, 2019|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> On one occasion, Rome's voice gave out towards the end, resulting in McMahon and [[Roman Reigns]] visibly [[corpsing|laughing]], as well as Michael Cole and [[Corey Graves]] making fun of him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2019/07/08/7-8-wwe-raw-results-kellers-report-on-week-two-of-heyman-as-executive-director-romans-mystery-partner-return-of-rey-mysterio-extreme-rules-hype/|title=7/8 WWE Raw Results: Keller's report on Week Two of Heyman as Executive Director, Roman's mystery partner, return of Rey Mysterio, Extreme Rules hype|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Wade|last=Keller|author-link=Wade Keller|date=July 7, 2019|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref> According to Hamilton, Rome was legitimately sick that night, and later commended him for still pulling off the announcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isvWd71uI_Q|title=Greg Hamilton on ring announcing, Shane's "Best in the World" intro, Shinsuke Nakamura, cooking|via=YouTube|first=Chris|last=Van Vliet|author-link=Chris Van Vliet|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref>

On December 27, Rome won the [[WWE 24/7 Championship]] at a [[House show|WWE Live event]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. [[The Bollywood Boyz|Samir Singh]] had just won the title off [[R-Truth]] for his third reign, and wanted Rome to announce him as the new champion, prodding him as he did so. Instead, Rome rolled Samir up to win the title and was about to announce himself as the new champion, before [[The Bollywood Boyz|Sunil Singh]] surprised him with a roll up to regain the title, also for his third reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2019/12/28/12-27-wwe-in-pittsburgh-pa-seth-aop-vs-ko-viking-raiders-ring-announcer-mike-rome-becomes-24-7-champion-briefly-becky-vs-asuka-vs-charlotte-aleister-vs-murphy-styles-vs-orton/|title=12/27 WWE in Pittsburgh, Pa.: Seth & AOP vs. KO & Viking Raiders, Ring Announcer Mike Rome becomes 24/7 Champion (briefly), Becky vs. Asuka vs. Charlotte, Aleister vs. Murphy, Styles vs. Orton|first=John|last=Washabaugh|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=December 27, 2019|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wwe/status/1211041229246517254|title=At #WWEPittsburgh, @MikeRomeWWE became the 24/7 Champion, but not long enough to announce it...|website=Twitter|access-date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>

Following the release of Greg Hamilton in October 2021, he had been announcing on both ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' until January 14, 2022 when Samantha Irvin was called up to the main roster from ''[[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]]'' to serve as the ring announcer for ''SmackDown''.

=== SmackDown ring announcer (2023-present) ===
During the [[2023 WWE Draft]], Rome and Irvin were both drafted to switch announcing positions taking effect May 8, 2023. As a result, Rome would become the new ring announcer for ''SmackDown,'' starting with the May 12 episode.
