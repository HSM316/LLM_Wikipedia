==Premise==
Asuta Tsurumi is a Japanese teenager who manages a restaurant with his father. When a fire breaks out at the restaurant, Asuta enters the burning building to retrieve his father's cooking knife, and finds himself in another world with nothing but the clothes on his back and his father's knife. He encounters Ai Fa, a woman who is a member of a group of people living at the edge of a forest, and teaches the community about the value of well-cooked food using a [[Wild boar|boar]]-like animal known as giba.

==Reception==
Rebecca Silverman of [[Anime News Network]] gave the first volume a grade of B−, praising its handling of cultural differences and the quality of the English translation. She wrote: "''Cooking with Wild Game'' isn't the most thrilling of books, but it is setting up to perhaps spend more time on things that aren't excessive amounts of game-preparation... If you enjoy cooking stories, this is an interesting one, even if it has yet to achieve a perfect balance of its story elements."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Silverman|first=Rebecca|date=27 February 2019|title=Cooking with Wild Game Novel 1|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cooking-with-wild-game/novel-1/.143819|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-23|website=Anime News Network|language=en|archive-date=2020-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108111030/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cooking-with-wild-game/novel-1/.143819}}</ref>
