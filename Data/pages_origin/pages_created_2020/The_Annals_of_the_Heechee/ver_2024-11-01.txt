'''''The Annals of the Heechee''''' is a science fiction novel by the American writer [[Frederik Pohl]], published in 1987 by [[Ballantine Books]]. It is about a dead space explorer's machine-stored version who is trying to discover why the Assassins, a mysterious type of pure energy beings, are threatening the stability of the universe. It is part of Pohl's [[Heechee|Heechee Saga]], which is about the [[Heechee]], a fictional alien race created by Pohl. The Heechee developed advanced technologies, including interstellar space travel, but then disappeared.
==Plot ==
The novel is about the multimillionaire space explorer Robinette Broadhead's efforts to solve a mystery. Even though he died in a previous novel in the series, his personality is stored on a machine. Broadhead is trying to resolve the issue of the "Assassins", which are pure-energy beings that stopped the [[expansion of the universe]] and triggered its contraction. The Assassins have concealed themselves in a black hole. Broadhead and the Heechee are trying to find them. When the Assassins come out, they converse with one of Broadhead's data-gathering computer programs and they reveal that they are not enemies.

==Reception==
''Kirkus Reviews'' stated in 1987 that Pohl's Heechee series "...has been growing steadily less involving", and calls ''The Annals of the Heechee'' the "...dullest of the lot".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frederik-pohl-7/the-annals-of-the-heechee/|title=The Annals of the Heechee |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 March 1987 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |access-date=30 December 2019 }} </ref> ''Kirkus Reviews''' states that the novel has "[n]o plot, a subplot that fizzles, chunks of cosmological explication, uninteresting aliens, and thoroughly boring characters" and calls it "...one of the least engaging Poh[l] [books] in many a year, and thus strictly for Heechee addicts."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frederik-pohl-7/the-annals-of-the-heechee/|title=The Annals of the Heechee |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 March 1987 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |access-date=30 December 2019 }} </ref>

[[David Langford]] reviewed ''The Annals of the Heechee'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #98, and stated that "Though the quality of writing stays at an unflashy 'good average' throughout, this is a classy example of hard SF as it sometimes used to be."<ref name="WD98">{{cite magazine  | last =Langford | first =Dave | author-link =David Langford | title =Critical Mass  | magazine =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =98  | pages =19   | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = February 1988  }}</ref>
