'''''Eocollis''''' is a [[genus]] in [[Acanthocephala]] (thorny-headed worms, also known as spiny-headed worms).

==Taxonomy==
The genus was described by Van Cleve in 1947. The [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] does not indicate that any [[phylogenetic]] analysis has been published on ''Eocollis'' that would confirm its position as a unique order in the family [[Neoechinorhynchidae]].<ref>{{cite web

The life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|definitive host]] and then ingested by an arthropod, the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|intermediate host]]. Although the intermediate hosts of ''Eocollis'' are ???. When the acanthor [[molt]]s, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the [[mesenteron]] or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the [[larva]]l or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor is passed in the [[feces]] of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|paratenic hosts]] (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for ''Eocollis''.<ref>{{cite book
