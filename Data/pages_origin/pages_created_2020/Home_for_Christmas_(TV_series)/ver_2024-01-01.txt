Christmas: Netflix introduces new star-studded festive rom-com
|last=Keitumetse|first=Maako|language=en|accessdate=9 December 2023}}</ref>

== Synopsis ==
Johanne (Broch) is a nurse in her 30s, working at a hospital in Norway. During [[Advent]] dinner, she feels pressured by her family to be in a relationship. She lies and tells them that she has a boyfriend, and that he will accompany her to Christmas dinner.

[[File:Felix Sandman.melodifestivalen2018.18d874.1500330.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Felix Sandman]], who plays Jonas, has already starred in another Netflix original series, [[Quicksand (TV series)|''Quicksand'']]]]

Johanne then tries to find a boyfriend through [[speed dating]], [[internet dating]], and other means. She goes on dates with several men, including 18 year old Jonas ([[Felix Sandman]]), and the much older Bengt Erik ([[Bjørn Skagestad]]). She also has a brief sexual encounter with Eira, one of her female coworkers.

None of this results in Johanne finding a boyfriend. In the last episode of season one, coworker Dr. Henrik tells her that he loves her. They are interrupted by a medical emergency before she can respond.  She then goes to her parents' house for Christmas dinner. During dinner, the doorbell rings. The first season ends with a shot of Johanne's face as she opens the door, possibly for one of her suitors.

== Production ==
The series takes place in [[Oslo]], with winter scenes taking place in the [[copper mining]] town [[Røros]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.roros.no/netflix-tar-deg-med-hjem-til-jul/|title=Netflix tar deg med hjem til jul|last=|first=|date=12 November 2019|website=Destinasjon Røros|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214110533/https://www.roros.no/netflix-tar-deg-med-hjem-til-jul/|archive-date=14 December 2019|accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adressa.no/pluss/meninger/2019/12/06/Slik-snyter-Netflix-R%C3%B8ros-for-verdensreklame-20551074.ece|title=Slik snyter Netflix Røros for verdensreklame|last=Lundemo|first=Trygve|date=6 December 2019|website=[[Adresseavisen]]|language=no|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> Unexpected warmth resulted in snow being transported from [[Røros Airport]] to create the winter scenes.<ref name=":1" /> It was produced by the Oslo Company, and financed and distributed by Netflix as an [[Netflix original series|original series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.no/tv/ice/christian-steen/oslo-company/oslo-company-mistet-storkunde-klare-for-netflix-milepal/2-1-620329|title=Oslo Company mistet storkunde – klare for Netflix-milepæl|last=Johannessen|first=Stian Øvrebø|date=14 June 2019|website=[[Dagens Næringsliv]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214110527/https://www.dn.no/tv/ice/christian-steen/oslo-company/oslo-company-mistet-storkunde-klare-for-netflix-milepal/2-1-620329|archive-date=14 December 2019|accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref>

The idea for the show was created by two advertisement students, Amir Shaheen and Kristian Andersen, who derived the concept from the popular [[Nordic Christmas calendar|Nordic TV Christmas calendars]],<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://kampanje.com/medier/2019/12/netflix-lagde-serie-av-skoleoppgaven-til-kristian-og-amir/|title=Reklamestudentene Kristian og Amir fikk ideen til den første norske Netflix-serien|last=Andersen|first=Jacob|date=3 December 2019|website=Kampanje|language=no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214110631/https://kampanje.com/medier/2019/12/netflix-lagde-serie-av-skoleoppgaven-til-kristian-og-amir/|archive-date=14 December 2019|accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> televised [[advent calendar]]s with an episode broadcast each day of December until [[Julaften (Norway)|Christmas Eve]].

Leah Thomas of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' said "This soap opera drama series will have your jaw dropping with all the twists turns imaginable.

Actually, I don't know if I even want her to end up with anyone, and I think that’s the entire point."<ref name="cosmo" />
