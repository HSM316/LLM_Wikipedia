Ahn heard a rumor that writer [[Lee Woo-jung]] and director [[Shin Won-ho (director)|Shin Won-ho]] were working on a medical drama. She got an offer to audition for it, even though she didn't know the title or what it was about. She went to the audition and read a few lines without much information. She thought she didn't get the role because she didn't hear from them for a few months. But when she found out the drama was called "Wise Doctor's Life," she realized she really liked it. Later, she was asked to audition again for a specific character named Choo Min-ha. After that, she was told there would be a full reading soon.
