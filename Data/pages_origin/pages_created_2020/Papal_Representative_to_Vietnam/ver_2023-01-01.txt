The '''Papal Representative to Vietnam''' is an official of the diplomatic service of the [[Holy See]] responsible for articulating and defending the interests of the Holy See to officials of the [[Catholic Church]], civil society, and government offices in [[Vietnam]]. The Holy See and the government of Vietnam have not established diplomatic relations and the position of Papal Representative to Vietnam is not a diplomatic one, though he is a member of the diplomatic service of the Holy See and the government of Vietnam agreed to the creation of the position in 2011.<ref name=gomes>{{cite news | publisher = Vatican News | url = https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-05/pope-francis-nuncio-singapore-vietnam-zalewski.html | access-date = 31 December 2019 | date= 22 May 2018 | first= Robin | last = Gomes | title= Pope appoints papal representative to Singapore, Vietnam }}</ref> Since then, the Papal Representative to Vietnam has also held the title [[Apostolic Nunciature to Singapore|Apostolic Nuncio to Singapore]] and resided there.

The Holy See managed its affairs in Vietnam through a Delegation to Indochina established on 20 May 1925.<ref>{{cite book | access-date = 26 December 2019 | title = Acta Apostolicae Sedis | url= https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-17-1925-ocr.pdf | date = 1925 | volume = XVII | page = 291 }}</ref> [[Pope John XXIII]] changed its name to the Delegation to Vietnam and Cambodia on 17 June 1964.<ref>{{cite book | access-date = 26 December 2019 | title = Acta Apostolicae Sedis | url= https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-56-1964-ocr.pdf | date = 1964 | volume = LVI | pages =916–7}}</ref> Such relations as existed between the Holy See and the government ended with the formation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976. More than thirty years later, as the parties negotiated a new relationship, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] met with Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguyen Tan Dung]] in 2007 and with Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Minh Triet]] in 2009. In agreeing in 2011 to the appointment of a Papal Representative to Vietnam, the government retained the right to approve the appointee, as is customary for diplomatic appointments, and to approve the Representative's working visits to Vietnam.<ref name=gomes/>
