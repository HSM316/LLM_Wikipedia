==Compilation and creation process==
In 2010, the del Re family of [[Boyce, Virginia]], who had been singing from publications of Ananias Davisson for 25 years, were joined by other singers who reviewed thousands of nineteenth-century shape-note songs from over seventy sources, as well as new compositions.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hall |first=Rachel Wells |date=July 29, 2013 |title=The making of the Shenandoah Harmony |url=http://originalsacredharp.com/2013/07/29/the-making-of-the-shenandoah-harmony/ |magazine=Sacred Harp Publishing Company Newsletter |location=Carrollton, GA |publisher=Sacred Harp Publishing Company |access-date=1 January 2020 }}</ref> Members of the Music Committee composed alto parts when they were lacking. New compositions by living composers were reviewed, and dozens were included—not as a separate section, but integrated with traditional tunes. The Music Committee limited their selections to songs that would be accepted by contemporary singers: "All killer, no filler," as member Leyland del Re explained to a journalist.<ref>"Our quote was 'all killer, no filler,'" del Re says. "The songs that made it deserve to be back out there — they're gorgeous."{{cite news |last=Baldwin |first=Brent |title=Family Affair: The Richmond Shape Note Singers teach new generations to sing the oldest American folk songs |url=https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/family-affair/Content?oid=1878421 |work=Style Weekly |location=Richmond VA |access-date=1 January 2020 }}</ref>
