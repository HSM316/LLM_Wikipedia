The '''Shenandoah Harmony''' is a [[shape note|four-shape]] tune book of 459 songs in for social singing, published in 2013 as a "curatorial" compilation of fasola repertoire from the mid-Atlantic region,<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Davis |first=Clinton |date=2016 |title=Beyond Revival: Composition and Compilation Amidst the Sacred Harp Revival |type=PhD |chapter=Chapter 5 From Seeking To Dwelling |publisher=UC San Diego |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8zd276rf |access-date=22 December 2019}}. Another tunebook based on the "curatorial themes of regionality and place" mentioned by Davis is the ''The American Vocalist'' of Maine. </ref> paying special attention to the works of [[Ananias Davisson]] (1780 – 1857).<ref>"The original inspiration for The Shenandoah Harmony  was to create a tunebook that included the best of the shape-note songs collected, printed, and published by Ananias Davisson from 1816 to 1826 in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia." {{cite web | title =  Shenandoah Harmony: A New Four-Shape Tunebook»About | url = https://www.shenandoahharmony.com/about-us/ | accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The importance of the Shenandoah Valley for the emergence of a distinctive Southern shape-note singing tradition has been noted by many musicologists.<ref>Harry Eskew, ''Shape-note hymnody in the Shenandoah Valley, 1816-1860.''

All-day singing events based on the ''Shenandoah Harmony'' have emerged not only in the mid-Atlantic region,<ref>Recordings of all-day singings in Northern Shenandoah Valley (near the grave of Ananias Davisson) and in Lehigh Valley (PA) are posted to the {{cite web | title = The Shenandoah Harmony YouTube Channel | url = https://www.youtube.com/user/ShenandoahHarmony| accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> but also in the UK, Ireland, and Germany.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ellen Lueck, ''Sacred Harp Singing In Europe: Its Pathways, Spaces, And Meanings'' | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c71e/53149775822dfd18a2ae6e99488017e1c6a5.pdf | accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>List of singings at the ''Shenandoah Harmony'' page. {{Citation | url = https://www.shenandoahharmony.com/singings/ | title = All-Day Singings | accessdate = 13 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all  }}</ref> The popularity of the regional tunebook outside of the core area can be attributed to a design that has been optimized for sight-singing: "visually attractive, the songs are easy to read ... and the book feels good in your hand,"<ref>{{cite web | last = Taaffe | first = Brendan | title = Book Review—The Shenandoah Harmony, ''Country Dance & Song Society'' (Easthampton, MA) | url = https://www.cdss.org/programs/cdss-news-publications/news-article-archives/articles/cdss-news-spring-2014-book-review | accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Another reason is that shape note singers love minor-key songs;<ref>Buell E. Cobb, Jr., in ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' (University of Georgia Press, 2004), p. 34, states that "the high percentage of "minor music" in the [[Sacred Harp]] (roughly two songs out of five) is an anachronism"; in fact, only 23% of ''Sacred Harp'' songs are minor, but they are indeed sung about 40% of the time. </ref> and the ''Shenandoah Harmony'' satisfies this peculiarity more than any other publication in current use: 52% of the tunes being minor.<ref>"The editions of ''The Kentucky Harmony'' and ''The Tennessee Harmony'' are roughly 60% minor; even the early editions of ''The Easy Instructor'' are over 50% minor. As our book has evolved, we’ve added songs from other sources; the finished book will have about 52% minor songs." {{cite web | first = Rachel | last = Hall | title = ''One of the most beautiful of those old minors'' | url = https://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2012/one-of-the-most-beautiful-of-those-old-minors/| accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> A third reason is that, although many shape note singers know of Ananias Davisson as the composer of the iconic tune ''Idumea,'' the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'' does not contain any other songs by him;<ref>{{cite web | last = fasola.org | title = Indexes for The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition: Composers | url = https://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?v=composer | accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}
</ref> thus, having an entire book inspired by Davisson appealed to many traditional shape note singers.<ref>"Admired for its scholarship, curation, and design, its use has quickly surpassed any other recently published tunebook of its kind."

The curatorial focus is on the [[Kentucky Harmony]] (1816) and subsequent publications by Ananias Davisson, who lived in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] but cultivated a network of singing-school teachers and composers in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.<ref>David W. Music, "Ananias Davisson, Robert Boyd, Reubin Monday, John Martin, and Archibald Rhea in East Tennessee, 1816-26", ''American Music'' Vol. 1, No. 3 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 72-84.</ref>  The ''Shenandoah Harmony'' contains 24 compositions by Ananias Davison, 52 songs from his ''[[Kentucky Harmony]],'' and 46 songs from ''Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony.'' Works by other composers from his era have also been revived: five tunes by [[ Elkanah Kelsey Dare]], originally published in ''[[John_Wyeth#Wyeth's_Repository_of_Sacred_Music,_Part_Second| Wyeth's Repository, Part Second]]'' (1813); 13 by [[William Hauser]] (and another 13 from  ''[[The Hesperian Harp]]'' compiled and published by him in 1848); and 9 by Lucius or [[Amzi Chapin]].<ref>Song counts are from the "Index" at the back of the ''Shenandoah Harmony'' (no pagination for end matter). </ref> Reflecting the vitality of the tradition as practiced today are dozens of new compositions by singers living at time of publication (2013).<ref>"Given that the original project had as its crux the tunes from Ananias Davisson's publications in the second and third decades of the 19th century, the decision to include more than sixty 20th- and 21st-century compositions in The Shenandoah Harmony was a bold one, but a wise one." {{cite web | last1 = Macadam | first1 = Sheila Girling |first2 = Edwin | last2 = Macadam | title = The Shenandoah Harmony, 2012 - A ray of light in an otherwise troubled world  | url = http://ukshapenote.org.uk/articles/ShenandoahHarmony_2012.htm | accessdate = 23 December 2019 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Tunes that already appear in the [[Sacred_Harp#Other_Sacred_Harp_books|1991 Denson edition of ''The Sacred Harp'']] were avoided.<ref>However, alternative versions of some tunes are provided, such as alternate words for Stafford (page 78 in both books), replacing the anti-Semitic lyrics [https://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?p=78] of [[Isaac Watts]] with uplifting poetry by [[Joseph Hart]].</ref>
