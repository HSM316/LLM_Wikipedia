The '''C. S. Soule House''' is a historic house at 304 Laurel Avenue in [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]]. The house's builder and construction date are uncertain, but it was most likely built circa 1880. Its first documented resident was C. S. Soule, the pastor at the Highland Park Presbyterian Church and a professor at the Highland Hall women's school; Soule lived in the house from 1880 to 1886. The house has a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] design with several front-facing [[gable]]s, a three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] window, and an open porch. The property originally had a barn behind the house; this was demolished in 1978, and an attached two-car garage was added the following year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Susan S. |last2=Cook |first2=Nancy W. |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Highland Park Multiple Resource Area |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64000175.pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=January 1, 2020 |date=September 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rehn |first1=Judy |title=Highland Park Multiple Resource Inventory Sheet: C.
