The band is nicknamed "Canadaâ€™s Marching Ambassadors".

The band was formed in 1926, as part of the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment. In 1959, the band left the [[Canadian Army]] to form the famed [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|Drum Corps]], "Canada's Marching Ambassadors". Following the [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the band fell out of place in reformed [[Canadian Army]] and was finally restructured as an independent unpaid organization in 1973.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=031WegRPmM8C&pg=PA345&dq=toronto+signals+band&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEpcSxq-HmAhVICc0KHRJfCmcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=toronto%20signals%20band&f=false</ref> The band continued as a voluntary organization, maintaining the traditions of the military band. In 1999, the Band welcomed women to join the ranks, which today, comprises 20% of its membership.<ref>https://www.optimists-alumni.org/toronto_signals.htm</ref><ref>http://torontosignals.ca/32SigTorontoSignalsBand.shtml</ref>
