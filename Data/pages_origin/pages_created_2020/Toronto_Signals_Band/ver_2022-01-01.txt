The band is nicknamed "Canada’s Marching Ambassadors".

The band was formed in 1926, as part of the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment. In 1959, the band left the [[Canadian Army]] to form the famed [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|Drum Corps]], "Canada's Marching Ambassadors". Following the [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the band fell out of place in reformed [[Canadian Army]] and was finally restructured as an independent unpaid organization in 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lord |first1=Cliff |last2=Lord |first2=Chris |last3=Watson |first3=Graham |title=The Royal Corps of Signals: Unit Histories of the Corps (1920-2001) and Its Antecedents |date=24 February 2014 |publisher=Helion & Company Limited |isbn=9781874622925 |page=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=031WegRPmM8C&dq=toronto+signals+band&pg=PA345 |access-date=6 September 2021}}</ref> The band continued as a voluntary organization, maintaining the traditions of the military band.
