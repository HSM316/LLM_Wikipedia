== Career ==
Cromwell is best known for establishing the Shelburne County Cultural Awareness Society after a landfill was proposed in her local community. The proposed landfill would have destroyed African Nova Scotian archaeological items, and the society successfully campaigned against the landfill. The success of the campaign against the landfill resulted in the incorporation of the Black Loyalist Heritage Society.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackloyalist.com/?page_id=18|title=Our Volunteer Board {{!}} Black Loyalist Heritage Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Cromwell led the Black Heritage Society until 2002, and again from 2008 to 2016.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/academics/convocation/history_traditions/honorary_degree_recipients/hon_degree_2017/elizabeth_cromwell.html|title=Elizabeth Gallion Cromwell|website=Dalhousie University|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> An archaeological dig near Cromwell's family home revealed over 10,000 artefacts from the late 1700s.<ref name=":0" /> In 1996 the Black Loyalist Heritage Society secured a national historic site and monument board in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]] to recognise the landing of the [[Black Loyalist|black loyalists]] in Canada in 1783.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://novascotia.ca/iga/2019recipients.asp|title={{!}} novascotia.ca|website=novascotia.ca|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> When [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]] was founded in 1783 it was the largest settlement of free black people in [[North America]].<ref name=":0" />

The society acquired numerous properties to display their expanding collection of artefacts and information. Working with the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] Cromwell created an exhibition called ''Remembering Black Loyalists, Black Communities''. The exhibition soon became a permanent display.<ref name=":0" /> It developed a heritage walking trail for visitors that encouraged visitors to explore the museum, a burial ground and an early settlement.<ref name=":0" /> Cromwell hired historical researchers to protect the histories of the African Nova Scotians by collecting genealogical information on the [[Black Loyalist|black loyalists]]. The operational hub for the Black Loyalist Heritage Society was a bungalow on Old Birchtown Road.<ref name=":0" /> The bungalow was destroyed by a mysterious fire, but the case of arson never went to trial.<ref name=":0" /> In the weeks following the fire there were several race-related threats against Cromwell and the society.<ref name=":0" /> Cromwell coordinated fundraising to rebuild the centre. In 2015 Cromwell helped to formally open the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://understoreymagazine.ca/article/birchtown-conversation-elizabeth-cromwell/|title=Birchtown / Conversation with Elizabeth Cromwell -|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>
