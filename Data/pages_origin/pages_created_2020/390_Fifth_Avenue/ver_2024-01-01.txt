'''390 Fifth Avenue''', also known as the '''Gorham Building''', is an [[Italian Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] ''[[palazzo]]''-style building at [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[36th Street (Manhattan)|West 36th Street]] in the [[Midtown Manhattan]] neighborhood of [[New York City]], United States. It was designed by [[McKim, Mead & White]], with [[Stanford White]] as the partner in charge, and built in 1904&ndash;1906. The building was named for the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], a major manufacturer of sterling and silverplate, and was a successor to the former Gorham Manufacturing Company Building at [[889 Broadway]]. The building features bronze ornamentation and a copper [[cornice]].

390 Fifth Avenue was occupied by the Gorham Manufacturing Company between 1905 and 1923. It was then home to [[Russeks]] department store from 1924 to 1959, and then Spear Securities from 1960, who changed the street level facade. It was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 1998, after the lower floors were significantly altered from their original design.

[[File:5 Av Oct 2021 102.jpg|thumb|36th Street annex|left]]There is an annex on 36th Street, which is the same height as the original building. The base is composed of a storefront, topped by three sets of sash windows, corresponding to the height of the base in the original building. The remaining stories are composed of six pairs of windows, one on each level. The ground-level arcade and attic loggia do not stretch around to the annex.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> The top of the facade contains a parapet below the original cornice.<ref name="NYCL p. 6"/>

==== Base ====
The entirety of the base originally had a double-height [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] running along it. The arches were supported at ground level by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns,<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /><ref name="NY1960">{{cite New York 1960|page=1108}}</ref><ref name="p571725176">{{cite news |date=5 Sep 1903 |title=Gorham Store Opened: Retail Departments Now in 5th-ave.

Most of the easternmost arch on 36th Street, and all of the arches on Fifth Avenue, were replaced in 1960 with a storefront composed of an aluminum and glass grid.<ref name="nyt20001022" /><ref name="NY19602">{{cite NY1960|pages=1108}}</ref> The remaining arches on 36th Street were preserved, with the main entrance to the building being located within the westernmost arch.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> Each of the arches at the base corresponded to two vertical window [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] on the upper floors. There are six bays on the upper floors on the Fifth Avenue facade and 14 such bays on the 36th Street facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" />

==== Upper stories ====
The middle four stories are plainer in design compared to the base.<ref name="p2109906334" /><ref name="p571725176" /><ref name="Roth p. 306" /> A cartouche with lions was installed above the windows on the fourth floor.<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /> On the Fifth Avenue side, there is a balcony spanning the two middle bays on the fifth floor, and on the 36th Street facade, another balcony spans the four center bays on the fifth floor. On the cornice above the sixth floor of the Fifth Avenue facade, there is a frieze, with a cartouche in the center flanked by a pair of lions. The cartouche on Fifth Avenue contains the inscription "[[Anno Domini|ANNO D.]] MCMIIII", representing 1904, the year the building started construction. A simple frieze runs above the sixth floor of the 36th Street facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /><ref name="ABM p. 187" />

On the loggia-style facade of the upper two floors, each bay is separated by a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] column.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> An [[entablature]] runs atop the loggia, wrapping along both sides.<ref name="ABM p. 186" /><ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> There was a {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} cornice above the eighth floor.<ref name="NY1960" /><ref name="Wilson1983" /><ref name="Roth p. 306">{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|p=306}}</ref> The copper cornice was once [[polychrome]] and [[Gilding|gilded]].<ref name="p571725176" /> Over the years, the cornice has corroded to a green color.<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /><ref>{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|pp=306–308}}</ref>

=== Interior ===
The interior was supported by [[Guastavino tile]] arches and contained a superstructure of steel beams. The fireproofing consisted of [[fire clay]], [[masonry]], and [[Portland cement]]. At the time of the building's construction, it was one of the first in New York City to be constructed of Guastavino arches.<ref name="ABM p. 186" /><ref name="p571725176" /> On the first floor, eight columns supported the Guastavino-tiled ceiling.<ref name="p2109906334" /> The second story had higher ceilings than the other floors, as the space measured {{convert|15|ft}} high.<ref name="p1677047111">{{cite magazine |date=27 Sep 1924 |title=Rare Individuality Achieved In New Russeks Store: Unusual Spaciousness And Dignified Appointments Characterize Home Of Fifth Avenue Establishment —Stocks On Upper Floors Concealed Behind Specially Constructed Fixtures |magazine=Women's Wear |volume=29 |issue=75 |pages=16 |id={{ProQuest|1677047111}}}}</ref> ''Architects' and Builders' Magazine'' described the building a having a steel frame "combined with ribs and domes [that were] self-supported and self-decorating".<ref name="ABM p. 186" /> The stairways and elevators were also clad with bronze.<ref name="ABM pp. 186-189" /><ref name="p571701120">{{cite news |date=October 8, 1905 |title=New-York Shops in Buildings Like Palaces |page=A2 |work=New-York Tribune |id={{ProQuest|571701120}}}}</ref> Each story spanned {{convert|125000|ft2}}.<ref name="p1325298853">{{cite news |date=12 Nov 1961 |title=Landmark Salvaged: Former Store Reborn As Men's Wear Center |page=D4 |work=New York Herald Tribune |id={{ProQuest|1325298853}}}}</ref>

When the building was used as a Gorham store, each floor had a different function.

When women's department store [[Russeks]] moved into the building in 1924, the floors were redecorated slightly to give the appearance of individual shops.<ref name="p1677080006">{{cite magazine |date=25 Sep 1924 |title=Russek's Open New Home On Fifth Avenue: Shoppers On Hand Early To Dedicate Enlarged Establishment Now Occupying Gorham Building. |magazine=Women's Wear |volume=29 |issue=73 |pages=1 |id={{ProQuest|1677080006}}}}</ref> The first story sold accessories such as undergarments, perfume, and toiletries; it contained marble floors and walnut fixtures. The second story, used for selling furs, was covered in Caen stone and light-stained oak. The third story sold dresses and had stone decorations, a tan carpet, and display niches at each corner. That story also contained three [[Louis XVI style]] lounges, as well as women's dressing rooms decorated in enamel. The fourth story sold suits and cloaks and was decorated in walnut; there was a Louis XVI style room on that floor as well. The fifth story, which sold millinery and shoes, also had walnut decorations, and the floor had a blue carpet. On all five stories, there were stockrooms behind the partitions.<ref name="p1677047111" /> Between 1959 and 1960,<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /> part of the ground story was converted into a lobby that was decorated in marble, bronze, and stainless steel. The upper stories became offices.<ref name="p1325298853" />

The owner proposed painting 80 sheets of signboard, each measuring {{convert|4|by|8|ft}}; the signboards would then be affixed to the exterior.<ref name="nyt20001022" /><ref name="Stern (2006) pp. 537-538">{{harvnb|Stern|Fishman|Tilove|2006|ps=.|pp=537&ndash;538}}</ref> The plan would have cost $7 million.<ref name="nyt20130613" /> The LPC opposed the proposal, and the Schwalbes withdrew the plan before the LPC could vote on it.<ref name="Stern (2006) p. 538">{{harvnb|Stern|Fishman|Tilove|2006|ps=.|p=538}}</ref> The Schwalbes then hired architect [[Arthur Kahane]] to draw up plans for a full restoration of the building in the 2010s.<ref name="nyt20130613" />

== Reception ==
In its early years, 390 Fifth Avenue was lauded for its design. Augustin-Adolphe Rey, a French architectural critic, referred to 390 Fifth Avenue as "the most beautiful business building in the world" in 1904.<ref name="nyt20130613" /> Three years later, ''Architectural Record'' dubbed the building "a surprise and a joy",<ref name="nyt20000227" /> and that "compared to the Gorham Building, the Tiffany Building is by way of being frivolous".<ref name="nyt20130613" /> A critic in 1912 said that following the construction of the Tiffany & Co, Gorham, and [[Knickerbocker Trust Company]] buildings, "the standard of excellence in commercial architecture was raised to a height previously unknown."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Price|first=C. Matlack|date=May 1912|title=A Renaissance in Commercial Architecture|url=https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/archives/backissues/1912-05.pdf?-1819911600|journal=The Architectural Record|volume=31|pages=449}}</ref>

Some of the building's praise concerned Stanford White's role in its design. in 1908, a critic for ''New York Architect'' said that 390 Fifth Avenue was among McKim, Mead & White's "best designs [...] for a commercial edifice, both from a monumental and practical point of view".<ref name="NYA-1908" /> Another writer referred to the building as White's "best piece of work" as well as "perhaps the [United States'] most beautiful store building".<ref name="Baker1989" />
