'''390 Fifth Avenue''', also known as the '''Gorham Building''', is an [[Italian Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] ''[[palazzo]]''-style building at [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] and [[36th Street (Manhattan)|West 36th Street]] in the [[Midtown Manhattan]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. It was designed by [[McKim, Mead & White]], with [[Stanford White]] as the partner in charge, and built in 1904&ndash;1906. The building was named for the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], a major manufacturer of sterling and silverplate, and was a successor to the former Gorham Manufacturing Company Building at [[889 Broadway]]. The building features bronze ornamentation and a copper [[cornice]].

390 Fifth Avenue was occupied by the Gorham Manufacturing Company between 1905 and 1923. It was then home to [[Russeks]] department store from 1924 to 1959, and then Spear Securities from 1960, who changed the street level facade. It was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 1998, after the lower floors were significantly altered from their original design.

=== Facade ===
Along Fifth Avenue and 36th Street (respectively located to the east and north), the [[facade]] is made up of three horizontal segments: the base on the lowest two stories; the middle four stories; and the [[loggia]]-like attic section on the highest two stories.<ref name="NYCL p. 4">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1998|ps=.|p=4}}</ref><ref name=Wilson1983>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard Guy|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/mckim-mead-white-architects/oclc/9413129|title=McKim, Mead & White, architects|date=1983|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=978-0-8478-0491-7|location=New York|language=English|oclc=9413129|page=35}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|pp=305–306}}</ref> The sections of the facade are divided by three sets of [[Course (architecture)|string courses]].<ref name="ABM-1906" /> The northeast corner of the facade is rounded similarly to that of the [[Judge Building]].<ref name="Roth p. 308">{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|p=308}}</ref> The facades to the south and west, which face other buildings, are made of brick.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> As built, the Gorham Building was much taller than surrounding structures.<ref name="Roth p. 305">{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|p=305}}</ref>

The entirety of the base originally had an [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of arches running along it. The arches were supported at ground level by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /><ref name="NY1960">{{cite New York 1960|page=1108}}</ref> [[Bas-relief]]s, removed by 1936, were in the spandrels at the top of the arcade.<ref name="NYCL p. 3" /> There were three arches on the Fifth Avenue side and seven arches on the 36th Street side. Most of the easternmost arch on 36th Street, and all of the arches on Fifth Avenue, were replaced with a storefront composed of an aluminum and glass grid. The remaining arches on 36th Street were preserved, with the main entrance to the building being located within the westernmost arch.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> Each of the arches at the base corresponded to two vertical window [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] on the upper floors. There are six bays on the upper floors on the Fifth Avenue facade<ref name="ABM-1906" /> and 14 such bays on the 36th Street facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" />

The middle four stories are plainer in design compared to the base.<ref name="Roth p. 306"/> A cartouche with lions was installed on the top of the fourth floor.<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /> On the Fifth Avenue side, there is a balcony spanning the two middle bays on the fifth floor, and on the 36th Street facade, another balcony spans the four center bays on the fifth floor. On the loggia-style facade of the upper two floors, each bay is separated by a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] column. An [[entablature]] is located at the top of the loggia, wrapping along both sides.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> On the cornice above the sixth floor of the Fifth Avenue facade, there is a frieze, with a cartouche in the center flanked by a pair of lions. The cartouche on Fifth Avenue contains the inscription "[[Anno Domini|ANNO D.]] MCMIIII", representing 1904, the year the building started construction. A simple frieze runs above the sixth floor of the 36th Street facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> There was a {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} cornice above the eighth floor.<ref name="NY1960" /><ref name=Wilson1983/><ref name="Roth p. 306">{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|p=306}}</ref> The copper cornice at the top of the building, once having been [[polychrome]] and [[Gilding|gilded]], has corroded to a green color.<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /><ref>{{harvnb|Roth|1983|ps=.|pp=306–308}}</ref>

[[File:5 Av Oct 2021 102.jpg|thumb|36th Street annex]]

The 36th Street annex is the same height as the original building. The base is composed of a storefront, topped by three sets of sash windows, corresponding to the height of the base in the original building. The remaining stories are composed of six pairs of windows, one on each level. The ground-level arcade and attic loggia do not stretch around to this annex.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> The top of the facade contains a parapet below the original cornice.<ref>{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1998|ps=.|p=6}}</ref>

=== Interior ===
The interior was supported by [[Guastavino tile]] arches, with a steel frame inside. The fireproofing consisted of [[fire clay]], [[masonry]], and [[Portland cement]].<ref name="ABM-1906" />

Inside, each floor had a different function. The first floor, used as a gold and silverware showroom,<ref name="NYCL p. 2" /> had wide and shallow arches containing ornamental [[relief]]s.<ref name="nyt20130613">{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=June 13, 2013|title=Two Architectural Gems in a Changed Setting|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/realestate/two-architectural-gems-in-a-changed-setting.html|access-date=December 29, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Custom designs were shown on the second floor, while bronze objects and ecclesiastical and hotel merchandise were located on the third floor.

In 1884, the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]] opened its New York City showroom on [[889 Broadway]], at 19th Street in the [[Ladies' Mile Historic District]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1884/05/28/archives/a-large-stock-of-silverware.html|title=A Large Stock of Silverware.|date=May 28, 1884|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By the first decade of the 20th century, factories and lofts were opening in the area around 889 Broadway.<ref name="nyt20001022">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/22/realestate/streetscapes-1905-gorham-building-fifth-avenue-36th-street-recreating-stanford.html|title=Streetscapes/The 1905 Gorham Building, at Fifth Avenue and 36th Street; Recreating a Stanford White Design -- Using Paint|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=October 22, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Furthermore, stores on Ladies' Mile began to move further north into larger space.<ref>{{Cite landmarks|page=274}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJQsAAAAMAAJ|title=The Greatest Street in the World: The Story of Broadway, Old and New, from the Bowling Green to Albany|last=Jenkins|first=Stephen|publisher=G.P.

The Gorham Manufacturing Company was one of the earliest companies to consider moving uptown. In 1903, its president Edward Holbrook leased the future site of 390 Fifth Avenue, at the southwest corner with 36th Street. At the time, much of the land was owned by [[John Jacob Astor IV]].<ref name="NYCL p. 2">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1998|ps=.|p=2}}</ref> Holbrook hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] for the building's design, with [[Stanford White]] as principal. Holbrook requested that the Fifth Avenue building be fireproof, and that its layout be able to accommodate the "needs of a great commercial enterprise".<ref name="NYCL p. 2" /> Because the building was not intended to host any other tenants, 390 Fifth Avenue was designed entirely to the Gorham Manufacturing Company's specifications.<ref name="NYA-1908">{{cite journal|year=1908|title=Gorham Building|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924018938138?urlappend=%3Bseq=349|journal=The New York Architect|volume=2|pages=349–350|hdl=2027/coo.31924018938138?urlappend=%3Bseq=349|via=HathiTrust}}</ref> Fireproofing was considered especially important due to the value of Gorham's merchandise;<ref name="NYCL p. 4" /> when it opened, one journal estimated that while the building was worth $1.25 million (equal to about ${{Inflation|index=US|value=1.25|start_year=1906}} million in {{Inflation year|index=US}}), its merchandise was worth twice as much.<ref name="ABM-1906">{{cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c005893188&view=1up&seq=214|title=Commercial Palaces|date=February 1906|work=Architects' and builders' magazine|pages=186, 189|via=HathiTrust|access-date=December 30, 2019|volume=38}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
In its early years, 390 Fifth Avenue was lauded for its design. Augustin-Adolphe Rey, a French architectural critic, referred to 390 Fifth Avenue as "the most beautiful business building in the world" in 1904.<ref name="nyt20130613" /> Three years later, ''Architectural Record'' dubbed the building "a surprise and a joy",<ref name="nyt20000227" /> and that "compared to the Gorham Building, the Tiffany Building is by way of being frivolous".<ref name="nyt20130613" /> A critic in 1912 said that following the construction of the Tiffany & Co, Gorham, and [[Knickerbocker Trust Company]] buildings, "the standard of excellence in commercial architecture was raised to a height previously unknown."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=C. Matlack|date=May 1912|title=A Renaissance in Commercial Architecture|url=https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/archives/backissues/1912-05.pdf?-1819911600|journal=The Architectural Record|volume=31|pages=449}}</ref>

Some of the building's praise concerned Stanford White's role in its design. in 1908, a critic for ''New York Architect'' said that 390 Fifth Avenue was among McKim, Mead & White's "best designs [...] for a commercial edifice, both from a monumental and practical point of view".<ref name="NYA-1908" /> Another writer referred to the building as White's "best piece of work" as well as "perhaps the [United States'] most beautiful store building".<ref name="Baker1989" />
