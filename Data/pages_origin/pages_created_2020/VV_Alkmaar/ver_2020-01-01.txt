'''Voetbalvereniging Alkmaar''' is a club that competes in the Dutch women's [[Eredivisie (women)|Eredivisie]] and the only one not affiliated with a (men's) professional club.

From 2007 until 2011 [[AZ Alkmaar]] had a successful women's section, but when they decided to pull the plug on the women's team for financial reasons, most of the players moved to nearby [[Telstar (women)|Telstar]], who were starting up a women's section. The team continued to train in [[Alkmaar]] and because the offices were there as well. It was decided after the 2016/17 season to separate from Telstar, move to Alkmaar and form a new club.<ref>[http://nos.nl/artikel/2160763-vrouwen-van-telstar-zoeken-hun-heil-onder-de-vlag-van-alkmaar.html (Dutch) Vrouwen van Telstar zoeken hun heil onder de vlag van Alkmaar], NOS, 1 maart 2017</ref>
