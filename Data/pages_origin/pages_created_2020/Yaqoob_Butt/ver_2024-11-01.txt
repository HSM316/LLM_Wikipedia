'''Yaqoob Ijaz Butt''' (born 9 September 1988) is a [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].<ref>{{Soccerway|yaqoob-ejaz-butt/288965|accessdate=21 June 2020}}</ref> Born in Denmark, he represented [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]] at the international level.<ref name=":0">{{NFT player|id=51200|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>

== Club career ==
Butt started his career at [[Stenløse BK|Stenløse]], and subsequently played at the [[Danish football league system|lower divisions of Denmark]]. In 2014, Butt was approached by [[Thai League 1]] club [[Roi Et PB United F.C.|Roi Et PB United]] in a 5 million [[Thai baht]] deal, though the move seemingly failed to materialise.

== International career ==
Butt hunted for national team call up, first approaching the [[Pakistan Football Federation]] in 2007 at the age of 18. While he was eventually not called up due to being too young and incomplete documentation being another reason, he came into radar again in 2010, when ''Pakistan International XI'', a team made up of European based players of Pakistani origin played against [[Woking F.C.|Woking FC]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pakistan International XI Squad |url=https://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/2204/pakistan-international-xi-squad/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=Woking Football Club}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic game on Sunday evening |url=https://www.wokingfc.co.uk/news/article/2213/historic-game-on-sunday-evening/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=Woking Football Club}}</ref> Butt was subsequently called by the Pakistan national team coach [[Graham Roberts]] for the [[Football at the 2010 Asian Games – Men's tournament|2010 Asian games]], but incomplete documents prevented his participation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-10-02 |title=Five expats in Pakistan`s football squad for Asiad |url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/1001112/five-expats-in-pakistan-s-football-squad-for-asiad |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=Our Staff |date=2010-10-02 |title=PFF reduces Asian Games probables to 24 |url=https://www.nation.com.pk/02-Oct-2010/pff-reduces-asian-games-probables-to-24 |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=www.nation.com.pk}}</ref>

He received his first international cap in a friendly against [[Nepal national cricket team|Nepal]] ending in a 1–0 victory for Pakistan in 2013, as a replacement for the injured international defender [[Atif Bashir]] under the coach [[Zaviša Milosavljević]]. He then played in a two-match tour against [[Maldives national football team|Maldives]] in the same month, making an impact as a substitute in the last 15 minutes in the game, where his corner led to Pakistan scoring a last minute equalizer.<ref name=":0" />

In March 2013, he participated in the [[2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification]], playing against [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan national football team|Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Macau national football team|Macau]].<ref name=":0" /> He was subsequently called for the [[2013 SAFF Championship]].

After being left out for both the [[Football at the 2014 Asian Games – Men#Group F|2014 Asian Games]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC first round|2018 FIFA World Cup's Asian qualifiers 1st round]] of March 2015,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wasim |first=Umaid |date=2015-01-04 |title=Shamlan's demand may see foreign-based players miss out on 2018 qualifiers |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1154919 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231022070646/https://www.dawn.com/news/1154919 |archive-date=2023-10-22 |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref> Butt returned after almost 5 years away in a friendly against Palestine in 2018. He last played in 2019 in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC first round|2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]] against [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]], as Pakistan failed to advance to the next round.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wasim |first=Umaid |date=2019-04-18 |title=Pakistan players hope to play World Cup qualifier against Cambodia |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1476746 |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
His brother, [[Yousuf Butt]], is also a footballer and has played alongside him for [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=The Newspaper's Sports |date=2010-10-02 |title=Asian Games camp PFF includes brothers from Denmark By Our Sports Reporter |url=https://www.dawn.com/2010/10/02/asian-games-camp-pff-includes-brothers-from-denmark-by-our-sports-reporter/ |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}</ref> Butt also went to school with [[Hassan Bashir]] in Denmark, who eventually played alongside him in the national team.
