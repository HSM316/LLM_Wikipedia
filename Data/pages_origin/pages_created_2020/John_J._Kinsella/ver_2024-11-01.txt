The stained-glass windows of [http://church.stjames-lutheran.org/ St. James Ev. Lutheran Church] at 2101 N Fremont, Chicago, were created in 1917. "St. James Lutheran Church has magnificent Kinsella windows of the [[:File:John J. Kinsella Nativity Window at St. James Ev. Lutheran Church.jpg|Nativity]], the [[:File:John J. Kinsella Resurrection Window at St. James Ev. Lutheran Church.jpg|Resurrection]], and [[:File:John J. Kinsella Gethsemane Window at St. James Ev. Lutheran Church.jpg|Gethsemane]] set in modified Gothic traceries and ornate perpendicular Gothic canopies. All are of exceptional technical and artistic merit, but the most outstanding for its balance of subject and color is the [[:File:John J. Kinsella Gethsemane Window at St. James Ev. Lutheran Church.jpg|Gethsemane window]]. Especially moving is the kneeling figure of Christ seeking divine guidance, symbolized by the brilliant ray of light which shines down upon him."<ref>{{Cite book|last=R.|first=Erne|title=Chicago Stained Glass|last2=Frueh|first2=Florence|publisher=Loyola University Press|year=1983|isbn=9780829404357|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> "A characteristic of this glass is that the panels are sometimes two and three panes thick to produce just the right hue and textures. This is especially true of the deep reds and blues. The memorial panels at the bottom of each window, in German, are a reminder that this parish, founded in 1869, was for many years a German-speaking congregation."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Lane|first=George|title=Chicago Churches and Synagogues|publisher=Loyola University Press|year=1981|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref>

While the St. James Kinsella windows were under construction, the site was visited by Archbishop Mundelein and his building committee. "The new archbishop reportedly upbraided his committee for not placing this quality of glass in the Catholic churches being built in the city."<ref name=":0" /> "Mundelein soon afterwards commissioned the Kinsella Co. to do the windows in the St. James Chapel of Quigley Seminary on Rush and Pearson streets."<ref name=":0" />
