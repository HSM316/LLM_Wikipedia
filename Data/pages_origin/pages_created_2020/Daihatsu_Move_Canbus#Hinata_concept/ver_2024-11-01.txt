The {{nihongo|'''Daihatsu Move Canbus'''|ダイハツ・ムーヴキャンバス|Daihatsu Mūvu Kyanbasu|lead=yes}} is a retro-styled semi-tall [[kei car]] with [[Sliding door (car)|rear sliding door]]s manufactured by the [[Japan]]ese carmaker [[Daihatsu]] since 2016. Despite adopting the "[[Daihatsu Move|Move]]" nameplate, the car shared its underpinnings with the [[Daihatsu Tanto|Tanto]] instead.

== Etymology ==
The name "Canbus" is a combination of the verb "Can", describing the car's ability, and the noun "Bus", describing the car's bus-like shape and inspiration from the [[Volkswagen Type 2]], which was also known as the "Bus".<ref>{{cite news |last=Stocksdale |first=Joel |date=2016-09-16 |title=Daihatsu's Move Canbus could very well be the world's cutest car |url=https://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/16/daihatsus-move-canbus-worlds-cutest-car/ |website=Autoblog |publisher=[[Yahoo (2017–present)|Yahoo!]] |location=US |access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>

== Overview ==
The Move Canbus borrowed its overall design from the '''Hinata''' [[concept car]]. The Hinata was first showcased at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#2015|2015 Tokyo Motor Show]] alongside the Tempo [[food truck]] and Noriori [[wheelchair accessible van]] concepts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mihalascu |first=Dan |date=2015-10-06 |title=Daihatsu Hinata, Tempo & Noriori Concepts Heading To Tokyo Show |url=https://www.carscoops.com/2015/10/daihatsu-hinata-tempo-noriori-concepts/ |website=Carscoops |publisher=Carscoops |location=US |access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>
