== History ==
The Military Sexual Trauma Movement was founded in 2018 by Janelle Marina Mendez, a veteran of the [[United States Marine Corps]], as a grassroots platform to combat the issue of [[sexual assault in the United States military|sexual violence assault in the United States military]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/pamela-heal-military-sexual-trauma-movement|title=Sexually harassed and labeled a ‘liar,' now this Navy veteran is trying to heal|date=2019-10-02|website=Connecting Vets|language=en|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref> Mendez currently serves as the CEO and chairwoman of the board of directors for MSTM, which is headquartered in [[Hudson Valley]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Mendez had previously started a support group on Facebook for male and female survivors of military sexual trauma in 2018. The Facebook group was attacked by users from the closed Facebook group Marines United, which had been at the center of the [[United States Armed Forces nude photo scandal]] after it was revealed that Marines United was engaging in widespread [[revenge porn]] and sexual harassment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/opinion/valley-views/2018/10/02/military-continues-fail-rape-and-sexual-assault-victims-column/1370276002/|title=Military continues to fail rape and sexual assault victims: Column|website=The Poughkeepsie Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref>

The Military Sexual Trauma Movement has worked nationally to raise awareness and advocate for new legal reforms which would offer greater protections to members of the Armed Forces, including testifying before [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dav-wi.org/women-veterans-committee-understanding-military-sexual-trauma/|title=Women Veterans Committee – Understanding Military Sexual Trauma – DAV Department of Wisconsin|last=davwi|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref> Among the reforms sought by the MSTM are the extension of state benefits to veterans who experienced MST and were dishonorably discharged, and the legalization of [[medical cannabis]] use for veterans who suffer from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/pamela-heal-military-sexual-trauma-movement|title=Sexually harassed and labeled a ‘liar,' now this Navy veteran is trying to heal|date=2019-10-02|website=Connecting Vets|language=en|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> The MSTM allows service members to report violence, harassment and disparaging behavior online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/marine-disciplined-urging-suicide-trump-july-4th-tanks|title=Marine disciplined for urging people who opposed tanks at Trump’s July 4th event to kill themselves|date=2019-08-29|website=Task & Purpose|language=en|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref>
