The '''1896–97 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season''' was the 2nd season of play for the program.

==Season==
Though the team had lost its founder and driving force to graduation ([[Malcolm Greene Chace]]), Yale continued to support it's men's hockey team. The second season saw a series of firsts for the program, including its first home game, its first game against an eventual [[Ivy League]] member and its first losing season. The team did not have a coach, however, [[John A. Hall (American football)|John Hall]] served as team manager.

Most of Yale's games were played against [[Sports club|amateur athletic clubs]] but all games were counted for the Bulldogs' record.
