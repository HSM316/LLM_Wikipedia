==Reception==
In the March 1998 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #245), [[Allen Varney]] noted that Chaosium's first four supplements set in the Dreamlands "fail to offer any vision of what to do there." With this fifth Dreamlands adventure, Varney felt Chaosium was finally on the right track, saying, "''The Dreaming Stone'' is more than a pretty good adventure; it's a demonstration of how to adventure in the neglected Dreamlands. The scenario goes wrong in encrusting its dream-fantasy with obsolete random encounters and gratuitous Christian imagery, but it still establishes a characteristically Lovecraftian atmosphere amid gaudy wonders." However, Varney was disappointed in the production values, pointing out "poor layout, skimpy artwork, and lousy proofreading." He concluded that "Though ''Stone'' compares well with some other recent Call of Cthulhu products [...] Chaosium’s flagship line needs a graphic overhaul and a visionary line editor to restore the glory days of the 1980s."<ref name=dragon245>{{cite journal|last=Varney|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Varney| date=March 1998 |title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=245|pages=102–103}}</ref>
