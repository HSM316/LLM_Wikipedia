She has won numerous titles at the [[Asian Para Table Tennis Championships|Asia and Oceania Championships]] (in 2009 and 2011), [[Asian Para Games]] (in 2010, 2014 and 2018) and the [[Asian Para Table Tennis Championships|Asian Championships]] (in 2017 and 2019).

Mao was a table tennis prodigy before her disability. She represented her home province [[Jiangsu]] in national competitions in 2005, when she was 10 years old. However, later that year, an injury and a misdiagnosis caused a [[hip dislocation|dislocated hip]], which forced her retirement. She began playing seriously again after meeting para table tennis coach Yuan Feng in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://epaper.qlwb.com.cn/qlwb/content/20170510/ArticelC06002FM.htm |title=残奥会冠军将来最想做公益 |last=Guo Liwei |language=zh |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=8 January 2020 |newspaper=Qilu Evening News}}</ref>
