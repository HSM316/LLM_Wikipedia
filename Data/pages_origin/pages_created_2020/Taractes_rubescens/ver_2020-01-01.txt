'''''Taractes rubsecens''''' is a species of [[pomfret]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bramidae]]. ''T. rubescens'' is closely related, and quite similar, to ''[[Taractes asper]]'', but adults can most easily be distinguished by the bony keel present on the caudal peduncle.<ref name = Mead>{{cite journal | author1 = G. W. Mead|  year=1972 | title = Bramidae | journal = Dana Report | volume = 81 | pages = 1â€“166}}</ref> In fact, this bony keel is unique to ''Taractes rubescens'' and will distinguish it from all other [[Bramidae|bramids]].

==Distribution==

[[Tokiharu Abe]] suggested in personal communications with [[Giles Mead]] that ''T. rubsecens'' adults are likely distributed throughout the tropical oceanic Pacific. <ref name = Mead /> Specimens at various stages of development have been collected throughout the [[Pacific Ocean]], from the [[Sea of Japan]] to the coast of [[Hawaii]]. Limited collections have been made in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and off the coast of [[Trinidad]]. ''T. rubscens'' had never been scientifically documented in the [[Indian Ocean]]<ref name = Mead /> until recently in 2010, where it was reportedly collected in the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Arabian Sea]].<ref name = Ali>{{cite journal | author1 = A.M.
