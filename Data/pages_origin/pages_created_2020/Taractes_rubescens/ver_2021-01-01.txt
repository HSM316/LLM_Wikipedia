'''''Taractes rubsecens''''', the '''pomfret''', '''keeltail pomfret''', '''knifetail pomfret''' or '''black pomfret''', is a species of marine [[ray-finned fish]], a [[pomfret]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bramidae]]. ''T. rubescens'' is closely related, and quite similar, to ''[[Taractes asper]]'', but adults can most easily be distinguished by the bony keel present on the caudal peduncle.<ref name = Mead>{{cite journal | author1 = G. W. Mead|  year=1972 | title = Bramidae | journal = Dana Report | volume = 81 | pages = 1â€“166}}</ref> In fact, this bony keel is unique to ''Taractes rubescens'' and will distinguish it from all other [[Bramidae|bramids]].

==Diet==
''T. rubescens'' have a varied diet consisting of marine [[invertebrates]] (including [[Decapoda|decapods]] and [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]])<ref name = Carvalho-filho>{{cite journal | author1 = A. Carvalho-filho| author2 = G. Marcovaldi| author3 = C.L.S. Sampaio| author4 = M.I.G. Paiva| author5 = L.A.G Duarte| year=2009 | title = First report of rare pomfrets (Teleostei: Bramidae) from Brazilian waters, with a key to Western Atlantic species | journal = Zootaxa | volume = 2290 | pages = 1-26}}</ref> and, presumably, small fishes.

==Habitat and Ecology==
As with most [[Bramidae|bramids]],''T. rubescens'' are [[epipelagic|epi]]- [[mesopelagic]] fish that are typically found at depths between 0-600m. <ref name = Carvalho-filho /> They are highly migratory<ref name= Mead/><ref name = Carvalho-filho/> and believed to be solitary<ref name = Carvalho-filho/>.

They are frequently found in the stomachs of large [[pelagic]] predator fishes, including [[billfish]] and [[tuna]], suggesting that they play an important role in the diets of fast swimming, predatory fishes.

==Distribution==

[[Tokiharu Abe]] suggested in personal communications with [[Giles W Mead jr]] that ''T. rubscens'' adults are likely distributed throughout the tropical oceanic Pacific. <ref name = Mead /> Specimens at various stages of development have been collected throughout the [[Pacific Ocean]], from the [[Sea of Japan]] to the coast of [[Hawaii]]. Limited collections have been made in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and off the coast of [[Trinidad]]. ''T. rubscens'' had never been scientifically documented in the [[Indian Ocean]]<ref name = Mead /> until the year 2010, where it was reportedly collected in the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Arabian Sea]].<ref name = Ali>{{cite journal | author1 = A.M. Ali| author2 = A.H. McNoon| year=2010 | title = Additions to benthopelagic fish fauna of the Aden Gulf-Arabian Sea (Actinopterygii: Bramidae and Sternoptychidae)| journal = Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 5 | pages = 23-32}}</ref> Despite their widespread distribution, they remain quite uncommon.
