==Reception==
In the April 1990 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #156), [[Ken Rolston]] called this "good, gritty cyberpunk, well organized and entertaining, with a solid action-adventure story line." Rolston complimented the adventure for being broken into short and manageable episodes, and also for allowing enough leeway to allow for the players' "characterization and divergent problem solving." Rolston concluded with a thumbs up, saying, "The ''Shadowrun'' game is one of the hottest role-playing settings at present, and this is a good example of how that setting can translate into dramatic action-adventure role-playing."<ref name=dragon156>{{cite journal|last=Rolston|first=Ken|author-link=Ken Rolston| date=April 1990 |title=Role-playing reviews |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=156|pages=86}}</ref>

[[Stephan Wieck]] reviewed ''Dreamchipper'' for ''[[White Wolf (magazine)|White Wolf]]'' #20, rating it 4 out of 5 overall, and stated that "I found ''Dreamchipper'' to be a very good adventure. {{sic|It's}} plot centers around cyberpunk technology and involves some of the psychological strangeness prevalent in cyberpunk literature."<ref name="WW20">{{Cite magazine |last= Wieck|first= Stephan |authorlink= Stephan Wieck|date=April–May 1990 |title= Cyberpunk Reviews |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=20|pages=52|url=https://imgur.com/a/1aTT9nr}}</ref>

In the May 1990 edition of ''[[Games International]]'', [[Lee Brimmicombe-Wood]] admired the production quality of the book, which he called "up to the usual excellent standard." He also liked the "street atmosphere" of the scenario, and complimented it because "the annoying fantasy element doesn't intrude." Brimmicombe-Wood concluded by giving this adventure an average rating of 7 out of 10, saying, "''Dreamchipper'' runs at a slower pace than its predecessor ''[[Mercurial (Shadowrun)|Mercurial]]'', but there's much more scope for character interaction and there are enough lead-ons to make it an excellent kick-off for any campaign."<ref name=gi>{{cite magazine|last=Brimmicombe-Wood|first=Lee|authorlink=Lee Brimmicombe-Wood| date=May 1990 |title=Shadowrun: Dreamchipper|journal=[[Games International]]| issue=14|pages=40–41}}</ref>
