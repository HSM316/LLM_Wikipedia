==Early career==


Attracted to the bohemian milieu of Paris like other Hungarians including [[Brassaï|Brassai]] and [[André Kertész|André Kertesz]], André settled there in 1925 amongst exiled supporters of Count [[Mihály Károlyi]], temporary president of the Hungarian Republic, all opposed to the dictatorial [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy]] regime. They included the sculptor [[István Beöthy]] and his wife, the painter Anna Beöthy-Steiner (1902–1985).  On 2 October 1928, she married Kertész who was her neighbour in the [[Montmartre]] Hôtel de la terrasses. Kertesz who had just purchased his first [[Leica Camera|Leica]] and was getting commissions from the prestigious ''[[Vu (magazine)|Vu]]'' magazine, with credits on several covers.

She and Kertesz lived together at 75 [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] next to the constructivist gallery/bookshop ''L’esthétique'' founded by their friend, the painter Evsa Model, husband of [[Lisette Model]]. Like Brassai, who also knew them, she was influenced in her photography by Kertesz, but like Brassai she nevertheless eschewed the [[35 mm format|35mm camera]] for a [[Voigtländer|Voigtlander]] Bergheil 9×12 folding camera that took [[Photographic plate|glass plates]] (which by the 1920s were quite outmoded).

== Independence ==
In 1928, André produced her first nude photos and in 1936 some were published in ''Arts et Métiers Graphiques'' to which she had contributed from 1932, as well as to ''Paris Magazine'' and ''Verve'', when she moved into a building on the Rue du Père-Cotentin to partner with two other photographers, [[Florence Henri]] and [[Ilse Bing]]. The move was the result of her divorce from Kertész that year; after he abandoned her for his mistress (who would become his second wife) [[Élisabeth Sali]]. From his first name, and out of continued affection for him, she created a male alias 'Rogi André'. On meeting Lisette Model she gave her the advice her husband had given her: “Never photograph something you for which you have little enthusiasm, but only what interests you passionately."<ref>Jim McQuaid and David Tait, Interview with Lisette Model, 1977</ref>

She befriended the French and immigrant [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] including their leader [[André Breton]] for whom in 1934 she photographed [[Jacqueline Lamba]]‘s performances at Le Coliseum cinema and dance hall at 65 Rue de Rochechouart where several times a week she could be seen swimming naked. One was published to accompany Breton’s text in  ''[[Minotaure#No. 7: June 10, 1935|Minotaure]]'' in 1935 and subsequently reproduced in his ''[[André Breton#Works|L’Amour Fou]]''.<ref>Margaret Cohen, "Underwater Optics As Symbolic Form", ''French Politics, Culture & Society'', Vol. 32, No. 3, Winter 2014 doi:10.3167/fpcs.2014.320301</ref>

By 1941 André had prospered, but because of World War II, she was forced to flee in the free zone and take refuge in [[Touraine]] because of her Jewish origins, but shortly after, she managed to hide in Paris, thanks to with the help of gallery owner Jeanne Bucher who hid her in her daughter's bedroom.

==Recognition==
In 1935, the photographer and theoretician of photography [[Emmanuel Sougez]], writing in the journal ''Arts et Métiers Graphique''<ref>[[Louis-Victor Emmanuel Sougez|Emmanuel Sougez]], ''Deux femmes, quatre-vingt hommes'', in ''Arts et Métiers graphiques'' , n. 48, 15 August 1935, p. 40-45.</ref><ref>Anne Reverseau, (2015) "Arts et métiers graphiques en de fotografie" in ''Arts et métiers graphiques. Art and design in the interwar period'', s. dir. Kr. Van Gansen, Netherlands: Peeters.p. 30-37</ref> compared the photography of Rogi André and that of [[Laure Albin Guillot]], and criticized the former for posing her [[Environmental portrait|subjects in their environment]]. Some critics have noted in her portraits an influence of Cubism, for example in the portrait of Dora Maar (c. 1940) in which she creates a geometric composition using the play of shadows and lights.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=BNF - Dossier thématique - Le Portrait|url=http://classes.bnf.fr/portrait/grande/phn11.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-01|website=Bibliothèque nationale de France}}</ref> Her pictures appeared in the annual ''Photo Graphie'' for 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1947.<ref>

In 1936, she presented four portraits in the international photography exhibition at the [[Pavillon de Marsan]] in Paris and in 1937, with others by Florence Henri and [[Man Ray]], many were featured in an exhibition ''Origines et développement de l'art international indépendant'' at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Musée du Jeu de Paume]], 30 July to 31 October 1937.<ref>{{Cite book|last=texte|first=Musée du Jeu de paume (Paris) Auteur du|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k991580k|title=Origines et développement de l'art international indépendant : exposition / organisée par le Musée du Jeu de Paume du 30 juillet au 31 octobre 1937|date=1937|language=EN}}</ref> They appeared also in the major exhibition ''Photography, 1839-1937'' organised by [[Beaumont Newhall]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, Mar 17–Apr 18, 1937, and in MoMA's ''Portrait Photographs,'' Jul 9–Sep 28, 1969, and ''Portraits'' Nov 4–Dec 7, 1943.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exhibition history {{!}} MoMA|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/history|access-date=2021-01-01|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en}}</ref> Her portraits were also published in ''Le Point : revue artistique et littéraire''  and other magazines at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 1937|title=Le Point : revue artistique et littéraire|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6102056f|access-date=2021-01-01|website=Gallica|language=EN}}</ref>

==Late career==
From 1950, André resumed painting, though meanwhile showed in an international group exhibition of portrait photography in the Galeries Mazarine et Mansart of the Bibliothèque nationale, in 1961.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adhémar|first=Jean (1908-1987) Auteur du texte|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k64591740|title=Salon international du portrait photographique : [exposition, Paris], Bibliothèque nationale, Galeries Mazarine et Mansart, 1961 / [catalogue réd. par Jean Adhémar] ; [préf. de Julien Cain]|last2=texte|first2=Bibliothèque nationale (France) Auteur du|date=1961|language=EN}}</ref> In 1962, while living on restricted means, she attended the Academy of painter [[André Lhote]], while continuing to do photographic work on commission. A friend, Bernadette Dufort,  generously helped her by developing her negatives for free and by making prints in her own darkroom.

On April 11, 1970, Rogi André died in Paris, in poverty and obscurity, and her modest possessions were put on sale at the [[Hôtel Drouot]]. Part of her archives, and in particular her prints, were however saved from destruction or loss thanks to the efforts of [[Jean-Claude Lemagny]], curator responsible for contemporary photography at the Department of Prints and Photography, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], who acquired them for the collection.
