Attracted to the bohemian milieu of Paris like other Hungarians including [[Brassaï|Brassai]] and [[André Kertész|André Kertesz]], André settled there in 1925. Indeed, on 2 October 1928, she married Kertész who was her neighbour, although this marriage was short-lived and, from his first name, she created a new identity 'Rogi André'. 

She produced a series of portraits of personalities in the arts during starting in the 1930s.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Butler, Cornelia H | author2=Schwartz, Alexandra | author3=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=Modern women : women artists at the Museum of Modern Art | publication-date=2010 | publisher=Museum of Modern Art : Distributed in the United States and Canada by D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers | isbn=978-0-87070-771-1 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/modernwomenwomen0000unse }}</ref> Several are in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/4996#works|title=Rogi André (Rozsa Klein) {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> They include [[Fernand Léger]], [[Florent Fels]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], and also [[André Derain]], with a 1939 print of his portrait being held by London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].<ref name="NPG" /> In 1937, she photographed [[Dora Maar]].<ref name="Phillips">{{cite web |title=Dora Maar, Paris |url=https://www.phillips.com/detail/rogi-andre-nee-rosa-klein/NY040212/104 |website=Phillips |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>
