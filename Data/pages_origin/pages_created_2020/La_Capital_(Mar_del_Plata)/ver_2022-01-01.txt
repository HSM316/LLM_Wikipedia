'''''La Capital''''' is a local daily newspaper published in [[Mar del Plata]], [[Argentina]], founded in 1905.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=26 May 2005|title=La Nueva Provincia|url=https://www.lanueva.com/nota/2005-5-26-9-0-0-cumplio-cien-anos-el-diario-la-capital|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31|website=La Nueva|language=es}}</ref> 

The newspaper was founded by Italian immigrant Victorio Tetamanti in 1905, its first edition being published on 25 May, on the 95th anniversary of the [[May Revolution]]. Tettamanti was a former steward at landowner Miguel Martinez de Hoz's ranch or ''[[estancia]]'' near Chapadmalal, southwest of Mar del Plata. Tettamanti and Martinez de Hoz were both members of the ''Comite Mar del Plata'' ("Mar del Plata Comitee"), with strong links to the local upper class, and shared the same conservative ideology. The paper was instrumental to the election as Mar del Plata's mayor of  Jose Heguilor, another member of the committee, in 1906. The municipality faced a series of crisis from 1906 to 1911, a period characterized by the collapse of local elected governments and direct rule by [[Commissioner|commissioners]] appointed by the [[Buenos Aires Province|province of Buenos Aires]] senate. In this new context, ''La Capital''  eventually gave support to the ''Junta de Resistencia'' ("Board of Resistance"), a political space that pressed for the continuity of local-elected authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mardelplata-ayer.com.ar/sufragios.html|title=SUFRAGIOS|website=www.mardelplata-ayer.com.ar|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> A democratic process followed, which ended up in 1920 with the election of socialist mayor [[Teodoro Bronzini]]. [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialism]] remained in power until yet another provincial intervention in 1929.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-BwU9fKX4sC&q=ceretti+socialismo+1920+bronzini&pg=PA78|title=Las puertas al mar: consumo, ocio y política en Mar del Plata, Montevideo y Viña del Mar|last=Bartolucci|first=Monica|publisher=Biblos|year=2002|isbn=9789507863264|pages=78|language=es}}</ref>
