==Background==
Originally, England were scheduled to tour India in September and October 2020 to play the ODI and T20I matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/cricket/complete-schedule-of-indian-cricket-team-in-2020-including-the-all-important-tour-of-australia-and-t20-world-cup-1.957676 |title=Complete schedule of Indian cricket team in 2020 including the all-important tour of Australia and T20 World Cup |work=The National |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> However, after the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was [[2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup|postponed by one year]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1733341 |title=Men's T20 World Cup postponement FAQs |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=20 July 2020}}</ref> the [[2020 Indian Premier League]] was rescheduled to be played in its place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/53693968 |title=England's white-ball tour of India postponed until 2021 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 August 2020}}</ref> In February 2020, the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) announced that they would like to play a [[day/night cricket|day/night]] Test match at the refurbished [[Sardar Patel Stadium|Motera Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28714863/india-play-day-night-test-australia-ahmedabad-england |title=India to play day-night Test in Australia, Ahmedabad likely to host pink-ball Test against England |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> The [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) confirmed the changes to England's tour in August 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.co.uk/england/men/news/1749739/england-men-s-white-ball-tour-to-india-postponed-until-early-2021 |title=England men's white-ball Tour to India postponed until early 2021 |work=England and Wales Cricket Board |accessdate=7 August 2020}}</ref>
