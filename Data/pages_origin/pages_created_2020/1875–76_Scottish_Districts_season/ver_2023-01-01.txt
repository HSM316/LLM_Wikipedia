The '''1875-76 Scottish Districts season''' is a record of all the [[rugby union]] matches played by Scotland's district teams.

It includes the Inter-City fixtures between [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District]] and [[Edinburgh District (rugby union)|Edinburgh District]]; and the [[East of Scotland District (rugby union)|East of Scotland District]] versus [[West of Scotland District (rugby union)|West of Scotland District]] trial match.

==History==

The first Inter-City match of the season was played under the 20-a-side rules. Like many Inter-City matches before, this produced a nil-nil draw. It was noticed that this format drew fewer spectators. During the match [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District's]] [[Malcolm Cross]] was seriously injured and had to be stretchered from the ground.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aUREAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rLEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483,6173325|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>

In 1876, it was realised that fewer players on the park might increase the chances of teams scoring. The second match of the Inter-City fixtures was thus played under the now standard 15-a-side rules. The smaller teams provided – as ''The Glasgow Herald'' reported – the best Inter-City match ever played; and the attendance, having dropped with the nil-nils previously with the 20-a-side format, was also boosted to 5,000 spectators. Despite the much better match, the score once again ended nil-nil.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d0xEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rrEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140,1660789|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>

Directly after the second inter-city match, the SRU met to discuss a fixture between East and West districts. This would be a chance for players outside the Glasgow and Edinburgh districts to play. The East and West fixture thus became the main trial match for the Scotland international team. The Scotland international team was due to play its English counterparts on 8 March 1876; hence the East v West district match was to be held on Saturday 26 February 1876.<ref name="auto"/>

The first [[East of Scotland District (rugby union)|East of Scotland District]] v [[West of Scotland District (rugby union)|West of Scotland District]] trial match ended in a draw; it was noted that both sides had to touch down the ball once behind their own goal-line to prevent the other side scoring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000540/18760228/166/0007|title=|url-access=subscription|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref>
