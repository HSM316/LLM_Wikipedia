The '''1875-76 Scottish Districts season''' is a record of all the  [[rugby union]] matches for Scotland's district teams.

It includes the Inter-City fixtures between [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District]] and [[Edinburgh District (rugby union)|Edinburgh District]].

==History==

The first Inter-City match of the season was played under the 20-a-side rules. Like many Inter-City matches before this produced a nil - nil draw. It was noticed that this format drew less spectators to witness the match. During the match it was noted that [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District's]] [[Malcolm Cross]] was seriously injured and had to be stretched from the fround.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aUREAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rLEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483%2C6173325</ref>

In 1876, it was realised that less players on the park might increase the chances of teams scoring. The second match of the Inter-City fixtures was thus played with the now standard 15-a-side rules. The reduction of players provided - as The Glasgow Herald reported - the best Inter-City match ever played and the attendance, having dropped with the nil-nils previously with the 20-a-side format, was also boosted to 5,000 spectators. Despite the much better match, scoring remained at a premium and the match once again ended nil-nil.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d0xEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rrEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140%2C1660789</ref>
