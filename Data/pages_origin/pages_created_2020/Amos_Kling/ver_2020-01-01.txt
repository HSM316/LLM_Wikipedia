'''Amos Kling''' (June 15, 1833--October 20, 1913) was an American businessman. He was the father-in-law of U.S. President [[Warren Harding]].

Kling was born on June 15, 1833 in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] and was of German descent. He moved to [[Mansfield, Ohio]] and took up farming, then to [[Marion, Ohio]] at the age of 22. Kling took a job as a clerk in Bain's Hardware store and soon saved up enough money to buy the store. He met Louisa Bouton during a trip to [[New Canann, Connecticut]] in the late 1850s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Katherine A.

He was on the boards of the Marion Telephone Company, the Marion National Bank, and the [[Columbus and Toledo Railroad]], as well as owning a share in the Marion Hotel. The family moved to a large white mansion in the late 1860s. He had Florence learn business skills by having her do accounting at the hardware store at a young age and ensured she received a good education.<ref>Sibley 2009, p. 12.</ref> Florence eloped with Henry "Pete" deWolfe, whose father had a poor relationship with Kling, at the age of 19 and a son [[Marshall Eugene DeWolfe|Marshall]] was born on March 22, 1880. Henry deWolfe soon lost interest in providing for the family and divorced Florence in the spring of 1886.<ref>Sibley 2009, pp. 13-14</ref> After the divorce, Kling and his wife raised the boy while Florence was free to make a living as a piano teacher.<ref>Anthony 1998, pp. 32-33</ref>

When Kling found out that his daughter was dating a young newspaper publisher named [[Warren Harding]] in 1886, he was furious. Harding had previously been critical of Kling's dealings with the government, but what most infuriated Kling was a rumour that Harding had partial black ancestry. Kling responded by threatening to disinherit Florence and began to spread the rumour further. By the time Harding found out about this, he threatened to beat up Kling though they never came to blows.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1=John |title=Warren G.
