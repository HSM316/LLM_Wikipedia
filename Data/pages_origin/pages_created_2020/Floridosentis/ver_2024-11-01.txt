'''''Floridosentis''''' is a [[genus]] in [[Acanthocephala]] (thorny-headed worms, also known as spiny-headed worms).

==Taxonomy==
The genus was described by Ward in 1953. Phylogenetic studies have been published on this genus.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/?term=txid84279[organism:exp]%20AND%20phylogenetic_study[prop]</ref>

==Description==
''Floridosentis'' species consist of a proboscis covered in hooks and a long trunk. 

==Species==
The genus ''Floridosentis'' <small>Ward, 1953</small> contains species.{{#tag:ref|A [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial authority]] in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than the present genus.|group=lower-alpha}}
* '''''Floridosentis mugilis''''' <small>(Machado-Filho, 1951)</small>
* '''''Floridosentis pacifica''''' <small>Bravo-Hollis, 1969</small>

==Distribution==
The distribution of ''Floridosentis'' is determined by that of its hosts.

The life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|definitive host]] and then ingested by an arthropod, the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|intermediate host]]. Although the intermediate hosts of ''Floridosentis'' are ???. When the acanthor [[molt]]s, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the [[mesenteron]] or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the [[larva]]l or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor are passed in the [[feces]] of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be [[Host_(biology)#Types_of_hosts|paratenic hosts]] (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for ''Floridosentis''.<ref>{{cite book
