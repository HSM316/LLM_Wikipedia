"'''Toss a Coin to Your Witcher'''" is an original song from the [[Netflix]] TV series ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'', composed by [[Sonya Belousova]] and [[Giona Ostinelli]] with lyrics by Jenny Klein, and sung by [[Joey Batey]] (as [[Jaskier (fictional character)|Jaskier]]) in the second episode. It became a [[Viral phenomenon|viral hit]] shortly after the series' release in late December 2019. The song was remixed by fans in [[YouTube]] videos and received new covers within days.

The song was created specifically for the TV series, and does not appear in the novels the series is based on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-the-witcher-creator-on-season-2-viral-song-production-2020-1|title=Netflix's 'The Witcher' creator on the grueling 178-day production, what to expect in season 2, and why the show's viral song is actually 'horrific'|last=Clark|first=Travis|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> The idea for the song was initiated by screenwriter Jenny Klein, who was assigned to write the screenplay for the second episode of the show. It had been established that the episode would be the introduction of the bard [[Jaskier (fictional character)|Jaskier]] (played by [[Joey Batey]]) to [[Geralt of Rivia]] ([[Henry Cavill]]).<ref name="ew origins"/> As Jaskier's talkativeness would wear on Geralt, the writers needed to find a reason why Geralt would let Jaskier travel with him, and showrunner [[Lauren Hissrich]] came up with the idea that among Jaskier's songs would be one that would help prove Geralt's generally peaceful intentions to those who distrust him and give him some respect, which would also be a mirror of the story for Yennefer of Vengerberg ([[Anya Chalotra]]), a quarter-elf sorceress also trying to do good despite her appearance; in the episode, the song is played over images of both Geralt and Yennefer.<ref name="ew origins"/> Since Klein was the writer for this episode, she was tasked to come up with the lyrics as well. Besides working out the necessary poetry, Klein reviewed the original ''Witcher'' novels, and it struck her that Geralt never got paid for the work he did, inspiring her to the key line "Toss a coin to your Witcher". Klein said that once she had this line, the rest of the lyrics took about ten minutes to finish off.<ref name="ew origins">{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/tv/the-witcher-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-anatomy-of-a-song/ | title = Anatomy of a song: How The Witcher earworm 'Toss a Coin to Your Witcher' was made | first=  Sydney | last = Bucksbaum | date = March 7, 2020 | accessdate = March 13, 2020  |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>

The lyrics were then given to composers [[Sonya Belousova]] and [[Giona Ostinelli]] to score as one of the first musical elements they did for the show.<ref name="ew origins"/> They had planned to try a range of styles to see what best suited the song while keeping some contemporary element, including a possible [[rap]] style.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> However, one of their earliest attempts hit the mark for them right off the bat and they decided to stay with that, working over the next eight months to get the right sound that they wanted, bringing in a range of musical instruments from around the globe to test.<ref name="ew origins"/> The final recording for the song used on the show was made in London on July 4, 2019, at which point Batey was sick, though Belousova credits Batey for soldiering on to give them enough material to work with.<ref name="ew origins"/> When the final production for the show was made about six months later, Batey performed a lip-sync for the song.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/how-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-became-2019s-most-unlikely-earworm/|title=How 'Toss A Coin To Your Witcher' Became An Unlikely Earworm|date=2020-01-07|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>

==Content==
The song lyrics are based on the events of the show's second episode, which is also the first meeting of the bard [[Jaskier]] (the in-universe author of the song) and [[Geralt of Rivia]], the titular witcher and the show's main protagonist.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-heres-where-to-hear-the-song-from-netflixs-hit-series/|title=Toss A Coin to Your Witcher: Here's where to hear the song from Netflix's hit series|last=Gonzalez|first=Oscar|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>  After recognizing Geralt at a bar, Jaskier follows him on a journey to investigate an alleged grain-stealing monster, and the pair end up being captured by Filavandrel aén Fidháil, the leader of an [[elf|Elven]] uprising.  Released after narrowly avoiding execution together, Jaskier concludes that Geralt is burdened by his "[[The Last Wish#"The Lesser Evil"|Butcher of Blaviken]]" moniker and decides to help him fix the publicity problem.  He then composes the song praising Geralt's heroics, the narration of which [[tall tale|takes great liberty]] over what actually happened during their imprisonment.
