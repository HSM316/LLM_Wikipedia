== Cover artwork ==
The cover art consists of four human figures on a beach who have had toes superimposed over their faces. The original release featured a nude woman standing over a crouched man, but the North American release replaced this with a lamb. The art was designed by art group [[Hipgnosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hipgnosiscovers.com/toefat.html|title=Toe Fat|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>
