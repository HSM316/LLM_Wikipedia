'''Alexander A. Borbély''' (born 1939 in Budapest) is a Hungarian-Swiss pharmacologist known for his research in [[sleep]]. He proposed the two-process model of sleep regulation in 1982 which postulates there are two complementary processes (S and C, which stands for Sleep and Circadian, respectively) which together account for one's sleep schedule.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borbély|first=A.
