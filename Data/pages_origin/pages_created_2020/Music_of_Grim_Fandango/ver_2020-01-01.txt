==Background and context==
===The game===
{{Main|Grim Fandango}}
''Grim Fandango'' is a [[graphic adventure]] computer game directed by [[Tim Schafer]] and released by [[LucasArts]] in 1998.<ref name="Variety 2018"/> Set in the Mexican folklore's [[Day of the Dead|Land of the Dead]] and with strong [[film noir]] twist, the story follows Department of Death's travel agent Manny Calavera who acts as a guide for recently departed souls as they travel through the Land of the Dead on their way to their final destinations.<ref name="Variety 2018"/><ref name="Gameblog 2012"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> This land, meant to be only a place of passage to the final heavenly destination, has been settled by undeserving souls turning it into a land full of film noir-inspired crime and corruption, and making the travel of many departed souls more difficult and treacherous. The player follows Manny on a mission to save Mercedes “Meche” Colomar, a good soul thrust into and trapped in this corrupted world.<ref name="Variety 2018"/><ref name="Theslanted 2018"/><ref name="Gameblog 2012"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/>

The game is one of most acclaimed adventure games of all time,<ref name="Theslanted 2018"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> considered the last great adventure game to be released during the golden age of the adventure game genre.<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/> While composer Peter McConnell himself credits the outstanding directorial work of Tim Schaffer,<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> critics emphasized that one of the key components in the excellence of the game was McConnell's outstanding soundtrack.<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Gameblog 2012"/>
===Team and collaborations===
Tim Schaffer, Peter McConnell and other members of the development team had had long and overlapping careers from previous projects at LucasArts.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> For McConell, who had joined LucasArts at the urging of [[Michael Land]], another acclaimed composer of LucasArts,<ref name="AMO 2012"/> that included working on the music of other notable computer games, including ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'' (1992), ''[[Sam & Max Hit the Road]]'' (1993), ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' (1993), ''[[Full Throttle (1995 video game)|Full Throttle]]'' (1995).<ref name="Uproxx 2013"/><ref name="LGI 2003"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> 

In composing for ''Grim Fandango'', McConnell benefitted from having been a big jazz and film noir fan since his time in college.<ref name="AMO 2012"/> Also, he had previously had his first experience in composing jazz in his work for ''Monkey Island''; a team of composers (Michael Land, [[Clint Bajakian]], and McConnell) split their work by the several islands in which the story of the game was set, and within McConnell's island (named Booty), he experimented with clarinet sounds.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

McConnell and Schaffer's professional collaboration started with ''Day of the Tentacle'', then continued with ''Full Throttle'' (possibly in part due to McConnell having a rock band at the time, which suited the genre of the game). However, it was with ''Grim Fandango'' that the relationship between the two became very close and set the stage for numerous subsequent collaborations, with McConnell becoming Schaffer’s "go-to man".<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> After both of them departed LucasArts, they collaborated on titles including [[Psychonauts]] (2005),<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> [[Brütal Legend]] (2009), and [[Broken Age]] (2015).<ref name="Minnesota radio 2014"/><ref name="polygon-mcconnell 2014"/><ref name="Gameinformer 2016"/>

Very early in the process project leader and writer [[Tim Schaffer]] handed to McConnell black and white concept art of the characters sketched by [[Peter Chan (artist)|Peter Chan]],<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> his collection of [[Humphrey Bogart]] films, and some vinyl records of a type Mexican folk music called [[Son mexicano|Son]], which McConnell described as "very raw, using crude folk instruments"<ref name="GANG 2015"/> that included hand percussion, violins, and [[Charango|charangos]].<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="VidaExtra 2018"/> 

Having Schaffer established the mood and tone of the project, McConnell said that aside from the the listening material, Schaffer did not give him much direction; "In my experience, Tim leads more by inspiring than by directing".<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/>

When years later McConnell was asked how he reacted when he first played the game, he said that "some games just really strike you when you first see the main character in the game environment. You think, 'Wow, this is something really different.' I remember feeling that when I first saw Manny walking around in Rubacava: 'A walking skeleton? Cool! And in this dark wet street like something from a different time, yet colorful and beautiful.'"<ref name="Uproxx 2013"/>

McConnell also noted how the game's mélange of themes was musically very "potent" as it brought together diverse music styles including folk, noir jazz, and classic underscore. To him, the whole game felt very inspirational, as dialogue, story, and the puzzles all worked together as an "opera";<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> "one big cohesive flow of music and voice" that made it really special to score.<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/>

Of the films provided by Schaffer, McConnell focussed his attention in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''; The first one scored by [[Adolph Deutsch]] and the other three by [[Max Steiner]]. He watched them "about a hundred times",<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> and for the latter two being able to get copies of their scores from the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] archives.<ref name="Rötter 2017"/><ref name="Music and Game 2012"/><ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> He also acknowledged the influence of the films [[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]] and [[The City of Lost Children]], the latter a french sci-fi/fantasy movie that informed the oceanic part of the game.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

[[File:Charango - cuerdas al aire.ogg|thumb|left|Notes of a [[charango]]. McConnell chose to use the Charango in the score in part after Tim Schaffer's brother had brought one from Mexico. The Charango was traditionally made of an Armadillo shell, and which McConnell saw as being acoustically similar to mandolin, but with an "earthier, more delicate, and haunting sound".<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/>]]

One South American record that was influential was a Peruvian-style record by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] titled ''Ronrocco'' released at the time, that made heavy use of charangos.<ref name="AMO 2012"/> It also coincided with Tim Schaffer's brother having brought one such instrument from a trip in Mexico.<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> All this led to McConnell eventually incorporating the charango as one of the unique sounds of the score, along with the [[Andean states|Andean]] flutes [[quena]] and [[Tarka (flute)|tarka]].<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> Despite the strong Latin American influences and themes, McConnell decided to not attempt to compose a particularly ethnic score, but to be "organic"; and to "evoke a texture that was real".<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> 

{{quote box|quote= ''Grim'' came at the perfect time: the swing revival was taking off in those days with bands like [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]] and [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], and the [[Day of the Dead]] was just entering pop culture. In the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] in San Francisco, you could go to a club like Bruno’s and hear hot new swing bands like The Red Hot Skillet Lickers mix original sounds with old standards, then duck around the corner to a taqueria and hear a [[mariachi]] band play, and on the Day of the Dead there would be a huge parade at night. Almost every musician in the original ''Grim Fandango'' score, from the brass to the mariachi players to the Peruvian flutist, played in or came from the Mission District.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>|source= – Peter McConnell, 2015 |width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

McConnell explained how since his college days, [[Duke Ellington]] had been a "huge influence" for him, and kept a head shot in his office studio at LucasArts. For this project McConnell listened Ellington's opus copiously.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> Finally, for ocean-related music, McConnell read scores of several [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] works.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/>

Time and place had an important influence as well; McConnell was drawn to and inspired by the vibrant and diverse culture (musical and otherwise) of the San Francisco [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]], which he called the "crown jewel"<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> of the city that included rock clubs, jazz clubs, taquerias with mariachis bands, and Mexican folklore.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

===Composition process===

When later interviewed, McConnell noted his satisfaction of being given ample lead time to compose and produce the score;<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> he first began to work on the project in early 1997,<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/><ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/> about a year and a half prior to the game's release.<ref name="sfgate review"/> He worked to develop three types of musical pieces: event-triggered episodes, ambient pieces, and underscoring for [[cutscene|cut scenes]].<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> Tim Schaffer's guidance and the cultures that shaped the game were the basis for the composition.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/>

{{quote box|quote= One special occasion was our hijacking Tim [Schafer] and leading him to the recording studio where a bunch of us improvised on bongos, tin whistles and shakers while he talked through the story and its meaning, like a [[beatnik]] poetry reading.<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/>|source= – [[Clint Bajakian]], 2015|width=25%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}

In order to create a soundtrack that would follow the story of the game and mesh with the different settings within it, McConnell and his team created a digital interface system of little buttons that represented places in the game as a way to visually represent the score. They then recorded Tim Schaffer talking about the game, and turned it into little snippets that were assigned to those plot points. Each point could then be clicked and hear Schaffer's explanations of it.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> This was done using LucasArts [[iMUSE]] proprietary [[adaptive music]] system that McConnell himself had co-created with [[Michael Land]] a few years earlier.<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/><ref name="Sweet 2012"/>

McConnell would then come up with a theme by humming a tune, record it in a [[Cassette tape|cassette]], play it back to Schaffer, and eventually replace the plot points narration with those tunes.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/>  Then they developed a [[MIDI]] score, to serve as a "mock up", leading to the recording of the final score that would include live musicians for some parts.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> 

Rather than fully develop each piece one at a time, his approach was to create a short sketch for each situation in the game of about 15 second long, and then move on as soon as he felt he had hit the target and gotten the gist of the mood. This allowed him to be more productive, as it was easier and less stressful to later on in the process develop full pieces based on already existing sketches, instead of rushing to develop completely novel compositions from scratch as completion deadline neared.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> At his peak rate, he noted that there were weeks during which he composed as much as two minutes of finished music a day, which he considered a "heavy regimen".<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/>

McConnell used the limited MIDI composition palette of the time, a couple [[E-mu Systems|EMU]] [[E-mu Emulator|E4 samplers]] (with 128MB RAM each), a [[Roland Sound Canvas|Roland GMIDI Sound Canvas]], and one or two other [[Sound module|sound modules]].<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/>

===Themes and recording===

McConnell went on to compose and produce ''Grim Fandango'''s original soundtrack, that combined a orchestral score, South American (Peruvian,<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> Mexican) folk music, swing jazz from the noir era, jazz from other periods, bebop, and big band music.<ref name="CGW Review"/><ref name="CGW Hall of game induction"/><ref name="TechRaptor Grosso 2015"/><ref name="Fact Magazine 2015-04"/><ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> It also included some elements from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings cultures.<ref name="adventure classic"/><ref name="Fact Magazine 2015-04"/> In the original production the orchestral elements of the score were digitally synthesized, due to the common budgetary and technological limitations on gaming audio of the time.<ref name="Rock, Paper, Shotgun 2015-04-24"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> On the other hand, the jazz parts were recorded live, something uncommon at the time.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

[[File:Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) procession in San Francisco, 2006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Day of the Dead]] (Dia de los Muertos) procession in San Francisco in 2006. This procession is part of the Mexican foklore that can be found in the Mission district of San Francisco and that imbued the spirit of the game and soundtrack.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>]]

McConnell understood that the atmosphere of the game was bringing together a noir story that was familiar to  the Anglo-American audience, with a latin culture that may have been less familiar. So he developed the score to be based on the jazz that would be most recognizable, and taking the culturally specific part (the Latin jazz and the Latin folk music) and weaving it into the score "sort of taking it for granted rather than pointing it up", with the goal of naturally leading the audience from their comfort zone and then make an "unfamiliar world more familiar."<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

An example of the rich atmospheric goals of the music is recounted by the French online publication [[w:fr:Gameblog|Gameblog]], that described the "Mr. Frustration" track as "Sometimes bebop, sometimes melancholic, sweet or sensual, whether led by a saxophone, a trumpet or a guitar, jazz is the predominant style of the ''Grim Fandango'' soundtrack, all reminiscent of the snug atmosphere of casinos and bars between the two world wars.".<ref name="Gameblog 2012"/> It also described "Lost Souls' Alliance" as evoking a general feel for Hispanic music: "the rhythm, the guitar chords, the flute ... We are transported to Mexico, with some long notes of electric guitar reminiscent of the Western [genre], [and] a small side of '[[rockabilly]] ballad' that makes us travel instantly to this corner of the planet, and that period at the onset of the twentieth century."<ref name="Gameblog 2012"/>

{{quote box|quote= More than any other project that I've worked on, it's the most like an opera, so that the music is so integrated into the story, it's so present in the story and it is so much a part of the shape and direction of the story – I think the way to experience is to just sit down, you know, if you possibly can start to finish, just listen to it.<ref name="Making-of documentary 2015"/> |source= – Peter McConnell, 2015 |width=25%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}

The Mission district, having been a source of inspiration with its rich and eclectic music scene, also turned out to be key in the recording of the score, with all the live musicians being connected to it.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> In recording with the musicians, McConnell noted that one of the important ways to keep the recording "fun and efficient" was to be clear on what he wanted as a producer and to "discern what each musician can bring to the music"; some players may be shine as readers, while others improvise "something amazing" by just providing "a few melodic and stylistic guidelines and [cutting] him or her loose".<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> On Grim Fandango he quickly learned that with music heavily based on swing jazz, getting the best results often required not being too attached to the written score, no matter how good he thought his original ideas were.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/>

Especially given the disparate themes of ''Grim Fandango'', McConnell kept the score cohesive by building it on a "backbone"<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> of classic Max Steiner-style orchestral underscoring.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/>  The orchestral part was was digitally created,<ref name="Rock, Paper, Shotgun 2015-04-24"/> as the team did not consider doing live orchestra because at the time "games didn’t occupy a place in the culture that could obtain that level of production."<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="PC Gamer 2014"/>

To make the digital pieces sound more "organic" and "not quantized" and orchestra-like, McConnell tried to be "very free with the tempo" so even though he was using a [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], it would sound like a the conductor was watching the sequences of the game during the performance, following the old-school movie scoring methods.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

===Release===

The full length of the score within the game was about three hours long,<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> with an approximate 110 pieces.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> A 43-minute version with 32 tracks was concurrently released in 1998 as a CD album, sold at the LucasArts online company store.<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="liner notes 1998"/>

==Critical reception==

The soundtrack was very well received at its original release, and it continued to receive praise years after, often considered one of the best game soundtracks of all time.<ref name="MeriStation 2015"/><ref name="IGN 1998"/><ref name="SEMO"/><ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="game revolution review"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="The Ringer 2018"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015-02"/>

At its original release, ''[[IGN]]'' called it a "beautiful soundtrack that you'll find yourself listening to even after you're done with the game".<ref name="IGN 1998"/> [[Square Enix|SEMO]] said "the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they're in a bar back then".<ref name="SEMO"/> RPGFan said "the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended."<ref name="RPGFan"/> ''[[Game Revolution]]'' in its game review praised it as one of the "most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an ear drum used to be."<ref name="game revolution review"/> 20 years later [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] noted retrospectively that since the original release of the soundtrack it had been consistently praised;<ref name="ABC 2019"/> despite the technical limitations imposed on its original production "it was still considered [at the time of its release] a stellar album to listen to, even without the context of the game, which speaks to the composer’s tremendous skill and musicality."<ref name="ABC 2019"/>

Years after the release, the soundtrack continued to receive critical acclaim.<ref name="ABC 2019"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' noted in 2011 that "it remains as killer today as it was when the game launched in 1998."<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]'' in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games, acclaimed ''Grim Fandango'' for including "one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history".<ref name="PC Gamer Best games 2014"/> In 2017 ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine also listed it as one of the "100 best video game soundtracks of all time".<ref name="Fact Magazine 2015-04"/> Kotaku noted that even among other lauded games that were successful in incorporating jazz in their scores to great advantage (''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[The Operative: No One Lives Forever]]'', and ''[[L.A. Noire]]''), ''Grim Fandango'''s stood apart.<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> Further comparing it with ''[[Music of L.A. Noire|L.A. Noire]]'', ''Kotaku'' added that it "doesn't come close to the variety and vivaciousness of McConnell's ''Grim Fandango'' score. From the dark, plunger-muted swing of 'Swanky Maximo' to the mellow, guitar-accompanied lobby-trombone of the appropriately named 'Frustration Man', it's simply good, video game-related or no."<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> It further lauded "the epic saxophone of 'She Sailed Away', the chord-less free jazz of 'Blue Casket Bop', or the menacing bari sax/bass clarinet duet of 'Rubacava'"<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> as highlights of an overall outstanding score.<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/>  ''Alternative Magazine Online'' in 2015 noted that upon its original release it "instantly became one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time" and that the remastered version went even further.<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015-02"/>

When the game and its soundtrack were remastered and re-released, they also garnered praise. Radio host Emily Reese called the score "amazing",<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> further adding how she really enjoyed how McConnell wrote the various sections of the orchestra: "It seems [McConnell was] able to capitalize on really specific characteristics of the instruments; like you'll have the brass play in a militaristic style, or you'll have the bassoons or baby base clarinets being very mischievous, strings will do something where they are trembling(...)."<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> ''Fact'' noted of the game that the game returned twenty year later in a new edition "to the masterpiece-accolades (and sales) it deserved all along. Its remastering kept the soul of the game intact while polishing what needed to be polished: the graphics, animation, controls, and most importantly, the music."<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> 

Several critics also noted how the music was a key contribution to enhancing the overall experience of the game.<ref name="CGW Review"/><ref name="Space Time Play 2007"/><ref name="Retro 2017"/> For example, at the time of the original release ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'''s review remarked that "a musical score (...) accompanies the art to complete the experience."<ref name="CGW Review"/> 20 years later, ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' noted that the best example in the game of the blending of cultures was its soundtrack, by combining elements of an orchestral score, with more traditional South American strings, and the jazz and swing music of the film noir era, becoming "commonly celebrated as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Great adventure games such as ''Grim Fandango'' feature worlds so cohesive and rich with detail that they’re transportive for the player, and McConnell’s soundtrack is the glue that binds the game’s elements."<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' noted upon revisiting the game in 2011 how "I was struck by just how much McConnell's soundtrack (...) elevates the basic game."<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> in 2015 ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact magazine]]'' noted that "few soundtracks have ever felt more integral to the success of a video game"<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> and that "the game’s blend of styles would never have held together so well if it weren’t for McConnell’s masterful ability to fuse Mexican folk music with Duke Ellington-era big band jazz and noir scores in the spirit of Adolph Deutsch."<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/>

In 1999's [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the soundtrack was nominated in the category of "Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music".<ref name="Academy award"/> It was also lauded by GameSpot, which awarded it the "Best PC Music awards",<ref name="GameSpot Best PC Music awards"/> and included it in the "Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks" list in 1999.<ref name="gamespot best soundtracks"/>

At the time of the original release of ''Grim Fandango'' and its soundtrack, few video game music awards existed. Other video game [[Video_game_music#Awards|music awards]], such as from [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA]] or the [[w:fr:Game Audio Network Guild|Game Audio Network Guild]], began to be awarded in the 2000's, and therefore ''Grim Fandango'''s soundtrack at the time of its release could not opt to compete for them.<ref name="Eurogamer 2004"/><ref name="gamasutra 2003"/> However, since then it has been included in several rankings of best video game music.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="PC Gamer Best games 2014"/><ref name="Fact Magazine 2015-04"/>

===Background and context===

McConnell had made the most of the resources he had for the score's original production, which meant devoting more of them where they could make the greatest impact, while cutting corners in other areas. Even though, for example, he wished he had been able to find a better-sounding piano sample, he did not regret not recording the piano live as it would have meant compromising the quality of more important parts given the time and budget constraints.<ref name="Electronic Musician 1999"/> However, he had long wished to revisit the score if the opportunity arose, to fix and enhance the various aspects that had not been viable during the original production. He noted that "Grim’s music was a little bit ahead of [its] time",<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> and it suffered because of that.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> He also lamented that just two years after the release of ''Grim Fandango'', orchestral recording in gaming took off.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

The ''Grim Fandango'' game had been originally developed and published by LucasArts, which in 2012 was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. In 2013 Disney made the strategic decision to turn LucasArts into a publisher-only of video games, and licensing out its intellectual property. Tim Schaffer, who had also long been eager to revisit and re-release the game and make it available to new platforms and to new generations, ceased the opportunity and was able to acquire the rights to the game, in partnership with [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]].<ref name="polygon remastered"/><ref name="VG247 2014"/> 

So in 2013 when Schaffer, having acquired the rights, offered McConnell the unique opportunity to remaster the soundtrack, McConnell was ready to jump in.<ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/> He believed that while the original jazz music came out well, the orchestral part, done with 1997-era digital samples and a limited budget, did not fully match his vision.<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="PC Gamer 2014"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> He believed that remaking the latter would make the greatest difference: "If you want to do something really great with this score, biggest bang for the buck is going to be to take those orchestral movements and record them live."<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

With the support of staff (who McConnell called “friends of Grim” by either having worked on the original project or had grown up with it as a favorite game)<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> at [[Disney Interactive]], LucasArts, and Sony Computer Entertainment, Schaffer's [[Double Fine]] studio worked to remaster the game, and re-released it in 2015.<ref name="polygon remastered"/><ref name="NewMediaRockstars 2015"/>

===Data recovery===

The remastering of the soundtrack started with the retrieval of the original 16-year-old data, in a process dubbed by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' as "digital archeology".<ref name="polygon remastered"/> The music tracks were on archaic [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT backup tapes]] stored in the LucasArts/Disney archives. Rob Cowles, a marketer at LucasArts was credited for saving the assets while LucasArts was being acquired by Disney in 2012.<ref name="polygon remastered"/><ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="NewMediaRockstars 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> Subsequently, Derek Williams was credited for finding them.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/>

{{quote box|quote= My colleague [[Jory Prum]] (...) is kind of a tech genius [who worked on recovering the old data]. (...) I’m sitting there biting my nails because we were relying so heavily on that data to really be able to do anything significant with the score. Otherwise we would have just had to remaster the stereo files which would have been a minor tweak at best.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/>  |source= – Peter McConnell, 2015|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

Once the original tapes were found, <ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> the next challenge was to retrieve the data from within them.<ref name="GANG 2015"/> McConnell remarked how their retrieval was a technical feat requiring specialized hardware and expertise<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> [[Jory Prum]] (who then did the sound mixing for the orchestral pieces) spent two months recovering the data,<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> with the use of DLT drive, an old Mac with a [[SCSI]] drive, and an old piece of software called [[Retrospect (software)|Retrospect Remote]].<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> The fact that McConnell was able to open a [[Pro Tools]] session from 1997 on a new version of Pro Tools also proved key in being able to use the files.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> Except for the anecdotal disappearance of two [[cymbal]] hits, this process succeeded in recovering all the data of the three-hour score.<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> McConnell called this recovery process "a chain of miracles" since "if any of the links had not held up, we would have had very little to work with at all."<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> McConnell further gratefully credited the retrieval success to numerous people who were devoted fans of the game, calling it a "labor of love".<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/>

===Improvements and re-recording===

Just like with the original game development, project lead Tim Schaffer had very little input into the soundtrack's re-mastering, except that "he was very supportive of the effort to make the music the highest quality possible."<ref name="GANG 2015"/>

{{external media | float = | width =  | video1 =[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LWFt7Q7OEE Grim Fandango Remastered: “The Resurrection of Sound” with composer Peter McConnell] Official making-of documentary of the remastered soundtrack (8:20 minutes) |title= External video |caption=   }}

Given the unique opportunity to re-visit a project first developed 17 years earlier in his career, McConnell was asked how different would the soundtrack be if he had developed it from scratch at the time of remastering. McConnell noted that if he were to start from scratch he would have taken the exact same approach, with the exception of the "crazy tempo"<ref name="GANG 2015"/> changes that he had never thought a real orchestra would have to perform;<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> some parts were originally played live into a sequencer without regard for [[Bar (music)|bar lines]] and retrospectively he would have taken a different approach.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> He also noted that there had been a small number of things that had long "bugged"<ref name="GANG 2015"/> him from the original release ("the occasional klunker, or ham-fisted move")<ref name="GANG 2015"/> that he finally got the chance to fix them. Hover, overall, "the pleasant surprise in the process was how well much of the original material held up".<ref name="GANG 2015"/>

To stay within the budget, McConnell felt he had to chose carefully which pieces would get the most attention and how.<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> After the original [[Pro Tools]] sound files were recovered, Peter McConnell found that some of the digital samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|re-mix]], [[Sampling (music)|re-sample]], add additional tracks,<ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/> and re-orchestrate different parts of the score.<ref name="polygon remastered"/><ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/><ref name="La Vanguardia 2015"/><ref name="ABC 2019"/> 

These tasks were assigned to three teams: an audio team at Sony recorded live tracks and remixed 45 minutes of jazz tunes<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="NewMediaRockstars 2015"/> (which included a few new live parts and some new solos);<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> another team at Pyramind Studios in San Francisco replaced old samples with better sounds in another 45 minutes of music and re-mixed all of the cut scenes in six languages;<ref name="GANG 2015"/> and finally the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] (MSO) recorded about a 30 minutes of orchestral music.<ref name="ABC 2019"/><ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="McWhertor 2014"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> 

====Melbourne Symphony Orchestra====
[[File:Anthony inglis conducting melbourne symphony orchestra.jpg|thumb|Picture of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestral part of the original soundtrack was digitally synthesized. One of the major improvements in the re-mastered release of 2015 was the recording of the orchestral parts by the Melbourne symphony orchestra.<ref name="ABC 2019"/>]]

The involvement of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in the orchestration of the Grim Fandango soundtrack grew out of several prior collaborations that McConnell had had with the orchestra. The connection first happened when Special Projects Manager of the orchestra Andrew Pogson reached out to McConnell in early 2013 to do a [[Pops orchestra|pops concert]] performance of ''Grim Fandango''. At the time, McConnell had been working on the soundtrack for ''[[Broken Age]]'', a new adventure game by Tim Schaffer.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> Pogson, having been a [[Crowdfunding|financial backer]] for ''Broken Age'', pushed to have MSO record that score, making it the the first time for the MSO to be involved in such a project. After that collaboration coming to fruition, working together in orchestrating ''Grim Fandango'' became "the next logical step"<ref name="GANG 2015"/> and it felt "like working with old friends"<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/>.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> McConnell praised MSO, for their outstanding level of musicianship and focus and care; how they worked well together, and reinforced yet again his notion from his early days in LucasArts that having a great team was of the highest value.<ref name="GANG 2015"/>

During the original production of the score McConnell had never imaged that it would one day be re-recorded with a live orchestra. That meant that his composition was unconstrained by considerations of flow and changes of tempo that a real orchestra would have to contend with.<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> Rather, in order to make it sound more lively during the original digital production, McConnell had intentionally incorporated many tempo changes.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> While it would have been possible to live recordings of full songs with big tempo changes, it would require intensive rehearsal, meaning more time and costs. So when the opportunity came to re-record with the MSO, McConnell tried to save time by planned the recording by breaking cues into smaller segments,<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> recording those one by one, and then put them back together like a puzzle.<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/>

====Pyramind studios====

Pyramind studios composers Clint Bajakian and Jeremy Garren imported McConnell’s original audio mixes into [[Steinberg Cubase|Cubase 7]] along with MIDI tracks that were assigned to modern sample libraries residing on two [[Master/slave (technology)|slave]] PCs running Vienna Ensemble Pro loaded with leading sample libraries. Bajakian also added live classical guitar parts that were not covered in 1998 using the same instrument he played back then. The team faced the challenge to adjust MIDI parameters to maximize realism and sonic quality while preserving McConnell’s original artistic intent.<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/>

To accomplish this, Garren noted that “this meant focused attention to mixing, [[Equalization (audio)|EQ'ing]], and programming articulation data on an individual instrument basis to bring each phrase and gesture in line with Pete's original intentions. It meant a constant back and forth with the original music and imagining, ‘What should this sound like today?’”<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/> and Bajakian added, “For us to do this right, we had to also wrap our minds around the ‘extra-musical’ content of the music – the concepts, the references, the puns – the ideas that interact like characters in a play”.<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/>

===Outcome===

McConnell noted that the one element that he and his team did not get "so perfectly" in the original release was the film noir orchestral part, and that that was what they were "really able to do in a big way" with the remastering work. He also noted that between the remixes and the live symphony "it turned out to be the score the way it was always meant to be heard",<ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> also adding that "I have to say I'm glad I took extra care on the themes because I feel they were really able to blossom in the new live recordings."<ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/>

McConnell estimated that he put in himself about 800 hours into the remastering project, in arranging, sample replacement, preparing for orchestration, mixing, and reviewing the music, resulting in over 2 hours of music that was completely overhauled, in addition to the 45 minutes of music the team had already recorded live in the original version.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> The outcome was described by McConnell as a score that had been “re-arranged, re-voiced, re-orchestrated, re-recorded, re-mixed, re-mastered and – most of all – retrieved”<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> (and  in a couple of key spots, even “re-composed").<ref name="Pyramind Studios 2015"/>

The stand-alone remastered soundtrack was released concurrently with the remastered game in 2015 (17 years after the original release). The soundtrack was distributed under [[Nile Rodgers]]' label [[Sumthing Distribution|Sumthing Else]].<ref name="Fact Magazine 2015-05"/><ref name="Sumthing 2015 - director's cut release"/> In 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary, the remastered soundtrack was released in vinyl.<ref name="Theslanted 2018"/><ref name="Blip blop - vinyl release"/><ref name="iam8bit - vinyl release"/>

==Releases==

==Live performances==
In 2013 McConnell collaborated with [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] to do a [[Pops orchestra|pops concert]] performance of ''Grim Fandango''.<ref name="GANG 2015"/> Around 2015 McConnell prepared a [[Suite (music)|suite of music]] for performance by the [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/> Celebrating its 20th anniversary, a live performance of script-reading with live music was performed in 2018 at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/><ref name="GamesRadar 2018"/> Later the same year, and also in celebration of the anniversary, an evening gala was organized in tribute of the soundtrack during the inaugural edition of the Game Music Festival in the [[National Forum of Music]] of Poland. Parts of the score was performed live, with a 100 pages of musical arrangements prepared by Bartosz Pernal in cooperation with McConnell, who attended and performed in the event.<ref name="pixelpost 2018"/><ref name="ppe.pl 2018"/><ref name="tuwroclaw 2018"/><ref name="jarock.pl 2018"/><ref name="Gamemusic Festival 2018"/> In 2018 ''Grim Fandango'' 's main theme song was one of the pieces performed by the [[Danish National Symphony Orchestra]], and subsequently included in the album ''Gaming in Symphony''.<ref name="Danish National Symphony Orchestra 2018"/><ref name="Gaming in Symphony 2019 LP"/><ref name="Gaming in Symphony 2019 MP3"/>

==Legacy==
''Grim Fandango'''s soundtrack is considered a classic,<ref name="Game Tyrant 2015"/> receiving critical acclaim in its original release of 1997,<ref name="IGN 1998"/><ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="gamespot best soundtracks"/><ref name="GameSpot Best PC Music awards"/><ref name="Academy award"/> and remaining a critics' favorite in ensuing years, including 17 years later in its remastered re-release in 2015. Its ability to "glue"<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/> together the game's elements and "elevate"<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> it is seen as one of the high points of the video game music genre.<ref name="The Ringer 2018"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="Gameblog 2012"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Space Time Play 2007"/> 

The ''Grim Fandango'' score remained decades later one of McConnell's most famous scores (With "Mr. Frustration Man" or "Swanky Maximino" being some of his favorite piece because of the solo performances<ref name="AMO 2012"/>).<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/> For McConnell personally, he saw this as a special project in his musical career, calling  ''Grim Fandango'' "almost like an opera" for how integrated were the music with the story.<ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> The project cemented a close working relationship between Schaffer and McConnell that continued for decades after their work together at LucasArts.<ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/><ref name="Retro 2017"/>

The fact that the soundtrack had stood the test of time, was attributed by McConnell to a combination of "story and the world are so rich and potent, and deal with timeless themes on a level rarely attained in a game", the rich musical heritage of film noir scores and freedom of jazz, the talent of the musicians inspired by the musical effervescence of San Francisco's mission district;<ref name="Kotaku 2011"/> "The score was literally in the air, like it was meant to be. All you had to do was catch it."<ref name="Alternative Magazine Online 2015"/> And while the video game soundtracks are meant to be created in support of the larger goal of an integrated interactive experience of dialogue, graphics, story, and sound, ''Grim Fandango'''s soundtrack also stands on its own, with critics noting that it can be appreciated independently of the game it was created for.<ref name="IGN 1998"/><ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="Gameblog 2012"/> The music was also performed for live audiences.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Game Reactor 2015"/><ref name="The Ringer 2018"/><ref name="GamesRadar 2018"/><ref name="pixelpost 2018"/><ref name="ppe.pl 2018"/>

The soundtrack is also notable for being one of the best examples of early [[adaptive music]] systems.<ref name="Politis et al 2016"/><ref name="Collins 2008"/><ref name="Uproxx 2013"/> With McConnell having created tracks for almost every location and character in ''Grim Fandango'',<ref name="adventure classic"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/> these were weaved into a continuous sequence of music, seamlessly transitioning to different pieces as the player progressed through the game,<ref name="Politis et al 2016"/><ref name="Sweet 2012"/> making it the most cinematic soundtrack of any LucasArts game.<ref name="Music and Game 2012"/> This was accomplished with the use of the pioneering [[iMUSE]] software, previously created by McConnell and [[Michael Land]], and it heralded the age of dynamic and cinematic music experiences in video games.<ref name="Politis et al 2016"/><ref name="Sweet 2012"/><ref name="Music and Game 2012"/><ref name="Collins 2008"/>

==Personnel==
McConnell dubbed the Grim Fandango score as the "the mission district score",<ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/> as virtually all the performers and a lot of the inspiration came from it.<ref name="GANG 2015"/><ref name="Fact 2015-06"/><ref name="Kotaku 2011"/><ref name="Minnesota Public Radio 2015"/><ref name="VentureBeat 2015"/>

It deserves a separate kudos of its own. Composed by Peter McConnell (who has also composed the soundtracks for The Curse of Monkey Island and Psychonauts), the music consists of mainly jazz, bebop, and blues, with various influences from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings culture. What makes the soundtrack so great is that there is a different track for almost every location, or if not, for each character in the game. }}</ref>

It’s an absurd combination, sure, but never a simple one, and often it’s McConnell’s score, influenced equally by Spanish folk music, big band jazz, and iconic noir soundtracks, which added that essential weight. He helped us laugh at the initial premise of Grim Reapers essentially being dull travel agents, but more so — from Lola’s death to Manny’s showdown with Domino to the entire Casablanca-inspired centerpiece — it made us really care about this world and these (literal) lost souls.}}</ref>

Composed by LucasArts’ own Peter McConnell, Grim Fandango’s soundtrack is commonly celebrated as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Great adventure games such as Grim Fandango feature worlds so cohesive and rich with detail that they’re transportive for the player, and McConnell’s soundtrack is the glue that binds the game’s elements.(...)So revered are the sounds of Grim Fandango, that a script reading/concert was held at this year’s E3 to celebrate the game’s 20-year anniversary. Composer Peter McConnell played selections from the soundtrack and the original voice actors—with the added support of superfan Jack Black—took the stage to reprise their roles.}}</ref>

The orchestra in the soundtrack was originally fully digital, due to the technological limitations on gaming audio at the time.
