'''SS ''Harvey Cushing''''' was a [[Liberty ship]] built in the [[United States]] during [[World War II]]. She was named after [[Harvey Cushing]], an American [[neurosurgeon]], [[pathologist]], writer and [[draftsman]]. A pioneer of brain surgery, he was the first exclusive neurosurgeon and the first person to describe [[Cushing's disease]].

==Construction==
''Harvey Cushing'' was laid down on 5 September 1943, under a [[Maritime Commission]] (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1210, by the [[St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida; she was sponsored by [[Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney]], the daughter of the namesake, and was launched on 31 October 1943.{{sfn|St. John's River SBC|2010}}{{sfn|MARCOM}}

==History==
She was allocated to [[Marine Transport Lines, Inc.]], on 11 November 1943. On 30 August 1946, she was laid up in the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama. She was sold for commercial use, 9 December 1946, to the government of [[Italy]], for $544,506. She was removed from the fleet on 25 February 1947. ''Harvey Cushing'' was renamed ''Eretteo'' and reflagged in Italy. On 20 September 1965, she ran aground on [[Sakhalin Island]], and broke in two. She was refloated by the [[Soviet Union]] and towed to [[Sovetskaya Gavan]], where she was most likely scrapped.{{sfn|MARAD}}
