== History ==

Construction was launched in 2013 under the leadership of Iraqi ''Al Karama Company'', which is affiliated to the [[Ministry of Industry and Minerals (Iraq)|Ministry of Industry and Minerals]]. Five years later, due to slowdowns and delays in project delivery, it was agreed to assign the contract to the Italian-Swedish company ''Sport System'' to finalise construction in 8 months. This allowed the work to be fully completed and the project to be inaugurated in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.wna-news.com/en/news.php?item.1120|title=Sport System Company will implement Al-Kut, Olympic Stadium with a capacity of 20 000 spectators|website=en.wna-news.com|access-date=2020-08-31}}</ref>
