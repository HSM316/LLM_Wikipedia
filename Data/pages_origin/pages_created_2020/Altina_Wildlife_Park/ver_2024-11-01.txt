In October 2023, two [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]]s (''Varecia variegata'') were paired for potential breeding. However, in early December, the female gave birth to three babies (2x M, 1x F), which was a complete surprise to staff. As the [[gestation]] is longer than their pairing, the female had been pregnant before being transported from [[Darling Downs Zoo]] in [[Queensland]], and [[DNA testing]] will reveal the identity of the father.<ref name="2023-12-14_ABC">[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-14/altina-wildlife-park-baby-lemurs-search-father-dna-tests/103224262 Altina Wildlife Park to use DNA tests to find mystery father of black-and-white ruffed lemur triplets], Monty Jacka, [[ABC News Online]], 2023-12-14</ref>
