'''Madison Lake''' is a [[reservoir]] in [[Madison County, Ohio]] located east of [[London, Ohio|London]], at {{coord|39|52|25|N|83|22|29|W|display=inline}}.<ref>{{gnis|1042876}}</ref> The community of [[Madison Lake, Ohio|Madison Lake]] sits on the western shore of the lake.

==History==
Work on the lake was started in 1946, when land was deeded to the state for the purpose of building a lake.  A [[Madison Lake Dam|dam]] was built across Deer Creek in this location, and the {{convert|6|feet|adj=on}} deep, {{convert|98|acre|adj=on}} lake was filled within a year. In 1950, the lake was turned over to the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]]. The {{convert|183|acre}} of land surrounding the lake has since become [[Madison Lake State Park]].<ref name=ODNR>''[http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/madisonlake#tabr2 Madison Lake History]'', [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]], 2012.</ref>
