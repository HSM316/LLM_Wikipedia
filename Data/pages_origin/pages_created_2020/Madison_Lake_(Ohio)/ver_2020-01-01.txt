'''Madison Lake''' is a [[reservoir]] in [[Madison County, Ohio]] located east of [[London, Ohio|London]], at {{coord|39|52|25|N|83|22|29|W|display=inline,title}}.<ref>{{gnis|1042876}}</ref>.

==History==
Work on the lake was started in 1946, when land was deeded to the state for the purpose of building a lake.  A [[Madison Lake Dam|dam]] was built across [[Deer Creek]] in this location, and the {{conv|6|feet}}, {{conv|98|acre}} lake was filled within a year.  In 1950, the lake was turned over to the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]].  The land surrounding the lake has since become [[Madison Lake State Park]].<ref name=ODNR>"[http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/madisonlake#tabr2 Madison Lake History]".
