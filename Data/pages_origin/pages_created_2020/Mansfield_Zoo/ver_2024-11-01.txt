'''Mansfield Zoo''' is a {{Convert|30|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[zoo]] located around ten kilometres outside [[Mansfield, Victoria]]. Established in 2000, it is privately owned by Bronwen Wilson and Dave Murphy. 

Mansfield Zoo is home to over 220 animals, including both Australian and exotic species. Some of the animals, such as the [[kangaroo]]s and [[deer]], are free-roaming and can be hand fed by visitors who purchase animal feed at the zoo. The zoo also has four African [[lion]]s, (including two rare [[white lion]]s); visitors can watch the daily lion feedings. From September to May, visitors are also able to camp in the zoo for up to two days.

==History==
Mansfield Zoo was established by Steve Junghenn in early 2000. The [[wildlife park]] initially contained only [[deer]] and other Australian animals, but it had two [[African Lion|lions]], brothers Kitwe and Monbu, by 2005. Junghenn eventually put the property up for sale.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://mansfieldzoo.com.au/ |access-date=2023-10-23 |website=Mansfield Zoo |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Munro |first=Peter |date=27 May 2016 |title=I bought a zoo: Bronwen Wilson |url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/i-bought-a-zoo-bronwen-wilson-20160425-goe45y.html |url-access=limited |access-date=24 October 2023 |website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> 

Not content with her life in suburban [[Melbourne]], Bronwen Wilson and her husband Rodney sold their house and business. In December 2005, they bought Mansfield Zoo for $800,000, moving to [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] with their two school-aged children Alisha and Jordan.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Webb |first=Carolyn |date=26 December 2011 |title=This domestic zoo was an idea whose time has come |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/this-domestic-zoo-was-an-idea-whose-time-has-come-20111225-1p9k3.html |url-access=limited |access-date=24 October 2023 |website=[[The Age]]}}</ref> Wilson's only prior experience with lions was two weeks of work experience at [[Melbourne Zoo]]. Though Wilson was adamant on holding on to the zoo, her husband disagreed with her decision to move to rural [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. He moved away after their divorce in 2007; Alisha went with him several months later. Wilson struggled as a single mother and zoo manager. In 2008, she met neighbouring farmer Dave Murphy, who became her new partner and co-manager of Mansfield Zoo. They are aided by Wilson's now-adult children.<ref name=":0" />

The lion Monbu died in 2011, followed by his brother 18 months later. The male [[White lion|white lions]] Djuma and Matimba were transferred from the [[National Zoo & Aquarium]] in 2012.<ref name=":0" /> They were joined by the [[African Lion|African lion]] Robbie (Rubani) and lioness Delilah in May 2014.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Suiter |first=Jocelyn |date=31 October 2014 |title=Cuddle up to the lions at Mansfield Zoo during a sleepover in the shadow of Mt Buller |url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/cuddle-up-to-the-lions-at-mansfield-zoo-during-a-sleepover-in-the-shadow-of-mt-buller/news-story/02234993246b8cbaf21e0fba533613f5 |access-date=23 October 2023 |website=[[Herald Sun]]}}</ref>
