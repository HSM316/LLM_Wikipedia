==Reception==
In the November 1994 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #211), [[Rick Swan]] calls this adventure "a tight little chiller worthy of [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' game." Swan noted the many "stomach-churning" scenes, saying "the cartoonish excesses [...] make this one of the most outrageous scenarios in ''Shadowrun'' history." Although he liked the many "evocative touches", Swan thought that "the designers were better at dreaming up ideas than developing them. Too often, for example, the story is driven by coincidence." Swan also disagreed with the finale, which encourages the party to flee rather than fight. He concluded by giving the adventure an average rating of 4 out of 6, saying, "Flaws aside, ''Double Exposure'' remains [an] accessible, fast-paced adventure, and a great way to spend a weekend."<ref name=dragon211>{{cite journal|last=Swan|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Swan| date=November 1994 |title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=211|pages=90–91}}</ref>
  
In the next edition of ''Dragon'' (Issue #212, December 1994), [[Allen Varney]] also reviewed ''Double Exposure'', and called it "suspenseful." He commented that "Some scenes don’t make a lot of sense, but they sure are creepy!", and concluded that ''Double Exposure'' was "an inventive and off-beat ''Shadowrun'' adventure in its own right."<ref name=dragon212>{{cite journal|last=Varney|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Varney| date=December 1994 |title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=212|pages=94}}</ref>
