'''Thomas Vigh Jr.''' (born November 27, 1964) is an American professional [[stock car racing]] driver. He currently competes part-time in the [[ARCA Menards Series]] and [[ARCA Menards Series East]], driving the No. 01 and 11 cars for [[Fast Track Racing]]. He previously competed part-time for the team in [[2018 ARCA Racing Series|2018]] and full-time in [[2019 ARCA Menards Series|2019]], both in the team's No. 10 car. In 2019, he was the Rookie of the Year award winner.

==Racing career==
Vigh began his racing career on local dirt tracks prior to racing in ARCA.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tommyvighracing.com/bio |title=About |website=Tommy Vigh Racing |publisher=Squarespace |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref> He started racing in 1996, competing in [[street stock racing]] events, and soon after in pro stock and sportsman races as well, finishing fifth in the OCFS Sportsman Series standings in 2018.<ref name="Vigh2020">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Traverse |url=http://raceproweekly.com/rpw/2020/02/rpw-column-tommy-vigh-jr-getting-back-to-the-basics-for-2020-season/ |title=RPW Column: Tommy Vigh Jr. Getting Back To The Basics For 2020 Season |website=Race Pro Weekly |date=February 2, 2020 |accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref>

He made his first three ARCA starts for [[Andy Hillenburg]]'s [[Fast Track Racing]] team, driving their No. 10 car at [[Madison International Speedway|Madison]] as well as the two dirt races at [[Illinois State Fairgrounds|Springfield]] and [[DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack|DuQuoin]] with sponsorship from Extreme Kleaner. He got top-15 finishes in each race, with a 15th-place finish at Madison and 13ths on both dirt tracks.

He and his sponsor returned to Fast Track and the No. 10 to run the [[2019 ARCA Menards Series|2019]] season-opener at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Krall |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/2010986-tommy-vigh-jr-and-extreme-kleaner-partner-with-fast-track-high-performance-racing-for-season-opener-at-daytona |title=Tommy Vigh, Jr. and Extreme Kleaner Partner With Fast Track High Performance Racing for Season Opener at Daytona |website=ARCARacing.com |date=January 14, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728221434/https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/2010986-tommy-vigh-jr-and-extreme-kleaner-partner-with-fast-track-high-performance-racing-for-season-opener-at-daytona |archivedate=January 14, 2019}}</ref> which later turned into a full-season run for rookie of the year by April.

Because rookie [[Christian Eckes]] won the championship, he became ineligible to also win the rookie of the year award in addition to his title according to ARCA rules, so Vigh, who was second place behind Eckes in rookie points, was given the award at season's-end. He became the oldest rookie of the year winner in ARCA Series history, earning it at age 54.<ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Krall |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/2019/11/13/tommy-vigh-jr-has-solid-2019-season-expected-to-be-named-bounty-rookie-of-the-year-at-series-awards-banquet/ |title=Tommy Vigh, Jr. has Solid 2019 Season; Expected to be Named Bounty Rookie of the Year at Series' Awards Banquet |website=ARCARacing.com |date=November 13, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>

Vigh did not return to the No. 10 full-time in [[2020 ARCA Menards Series|2020]], and was replaced in that ride by [[Ryan Huff]]. However, he did go back to running part-time for Fast Track, with his first start of the season coming at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. After initially being on the entry list in the team's No. 11 car, the team moved him to the No. 01 (which was to be driven by Dick Doheny) before the race due to Willie Mullins securing a ride with the team in the days leading up to the race, where he was put in the No. 11. Vigh finished nineteenth in both of his ARCA starts in 2020, his second coming at [[Pocono Raceway]]. He also made one start for Fast Track Racing in the [[ARCA Menards Series East]] at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]].

Vigh stated prior to the 2020 season that he would be competing in dirt modified races at [[Orange County Fair Speedway]] as well as in street stock events again.<ref name="Vigh2020"/>

==Personal life==
Vigh is from [[Otisville, New York]], although he currently lives in [[Parsippany, New Jersey]]. 

He and his wife Pamela Van Dunk own Big Momma Motorsports, which is Vigh's street stock and sportsman team.<ref name="Vigh2020"/>

In addition to racing, Vigh works as a shop fabricator for Statewide Line Striping and has been a longtime ambassador for his sponsor, Extreme Energy Solutions, based in [[Sparta, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Dericks |url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/sparta/articles/sparta-business-and-brand-ambassador-race-driver-going-to-daytona-2 |title=Sparta Business and Brand Ambassador Race Driver Going to Daytona |website=Sparta TapInto |date=January 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>
