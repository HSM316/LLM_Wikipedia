'''Thomas "Tommy" Vigh Jr.''' (born November 27, 1964) is an American professional [[stock car racing]] driver. He most recently competed full-time in the [[ARCA Menards Series]], driving the No. 10 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for Fast Track Racing.

==Racing career==
Vigh began his racing career on local dirt tracks and in . Prior to racing in ARCA, <ref>{{cite web |url=https://tommyvighracing.com/bio |title=About |website=[[Tommy Vigh]] Racing |publisher=Squarespace |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>

He made his first three ARCA starts for [[Andy Hillenburg]]'s [[Fast Track Racing]] team, driving their No. 10 car at [[Madison International Speedway|Madison]] as well as the two dirt races at [[Illinois State Fairgrounds|Springfield]] and [[DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack|DuQuoin]] with sponsorship from Extreme Kleaner. He got top-15 finishes in each race, with a 15th place finish at Madison and 13ths on both dirt tracks.

He and his sponsor returned to Fast Track and the No. 10 to run the [[2019 ARCA Menards Series|2019]] season-opener at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Krall |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/2010986-tommy-vigh-jr-and-extreme-kleaner-partner-with-fast-track-high-performance-racing-for-season-opener-at-daytona |title=Tommy Vigh, Jr. and Extreme Kleaner Partner With Fast Track High Performance Racing for Season Opener at Daytona |website=ARCARacing.com |date=January 14, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>, which later turned into a full-season run for rookie of the year by April.

Because rookie [[Christian Eckes]] won the championship, he became ineligible to also win the rookie of the year award in addition to his title according to ARCA rules, so Vigh, who was second place behind Eckes in rookie points, was given the award at season's-end. He became the oldest rookie of the year winner in ARCA Series history, earning it at age 54.<ref>{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Krall |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/2013055-tommy-vigh-jr-has-solid-2019-season-expected-to-be-named-bounty-rookie-of-the-year-at-series-awards-banquet |title=Tommy Vigh, Jr. has Solid 2019 Season; Expected to be Named Bounty Rookie of the Year at Series' Awards Banquet |website=ARCARacing.com |date=November 13, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He is from [[Otisville, New York]], although he currently lives in [[Parsippany, New Jersey]].

In addition to racing, Vigh works as a shop fabricator for Statewide Line Striping and has been a longtime ambassador for his sponsor, Extreme Energy Solutions, based in [[Sparta, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Dericks |url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/sparta/articles/sparta-business-and-brand-ambassador-race-driver-going-to-daytona-2 |title=Sparta Business and Brand Ambassador Race Driver Going to Daytona |website=Sparta TapInto |date=January 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>
