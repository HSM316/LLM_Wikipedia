== Launch ==
Kosher.com began by creating partnerships with Jewish media companies, including [[Artscroll]], [[Mishpacha Magazine]], [[Ami Magazine|Ami]] Magazine, and [[Binah Magazine]], and putting their popular kosher recipes online for the first time, where anyone can access them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thejewishnews.com/2017/06/21/skinny-summer-cooking-kosher-com/|title=Skinny Summer Cooking from Kosher.com|first=Jackie|last=Headapohl}}</ref>

== Shows ==

=== Season One ===
The first season, 2017, featured ongoing shows centered around one person or theme. [[Jamie Geller]] starred in a show about going behind the scenes in kosher restaurants, Esty Wolbe had a show for easy family recipes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/11/02/united-states/why-30000-orthodox-women-belong-to-this-recipe-sharing-facebook-group|title=Why 30,000 Orthodox women belong to this recipe-sharing Facebook group|date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> and there was a "hands and pans" style of show called Shortcuts.

=== Season Two ===
In 2018, most of the earlier shows continued to run. In addition, a new format of show launched in the summer- a cooking competition called Food Fight. The show featured female kosher cooks and had four rounds, each one eliminating a contestant until the winner was chosen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forward.com/food/406628/food-fight-is-the-orthodox-community-s-answer-to-chopped/|title=‘Food Fight’ Is The Orthodox Community’s Answer To ‘Chopped’|website=The Forward}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/food-fight-knockout/|title=‘Food fight’ knockout|first=Abigail Klein|last=Leichman|website=jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com}}</ref>

A few months later, Kosher.com created a new show starring Rorie Weisberg, the winner of Food Fight. Her show is called Living Full 'n Free and it's about healthy cooking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/life/food/restaurants/2018/10/19/kosher-features-monsey-rorie-weisberg/1680891002/|title=Rockland chef will showcase healthy foods on new Kosher.com web series|first=Jeanne|last=Muchnick|website=lohud.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishlinkbwc.com/index.php/food/10467-health-coach-rorie-weisberg-presents-living-full-n-free-on-kosher-com|title=Health Coach Rorie Weisberg Presents ‘Living Full ’n Free’ on Kosher.com|first=Vicki|last=Jakubovic /Kosher.com|website=www.jewishlinkbwc.com}}</ref>

=== Season Three ===

Once again, in 2019, Kosher.com released a cooking competition in the summer. Following the format of Food Fight, the show was a four-round elimination series, but took place in Oxnard, California in a kosher restaurant, and the competitors were men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/life/2019/07/11/ventura-county-michelin-star/1634751001/|title=Cafe Society: Michelin-star chefs shine in Ventura County|website=Ventura County Star}}</ref> This decision got some criticism from journalists on Twitter, for featuring only men to the exclusion of women in contrast to the previous year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Laura_E_Adkins/status/1146102029108031489|title=Just received a PR about a cooking competition "SKILL’IT"|website=Twitter}}</ref> Jewish [[comedian]] [[Elon Gold]] served as the host of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/301379/l-a-kosher-chefs-compete-in-skillit-cook-off/|title=L.A. Kosher Chefs Compete in ‘Skill’it’ Cook-Off|date=July 10, 2019|website=Jewish Journal}}</ref>

In December 2019, a new show geared for kids launched, called Nosh and Nibble.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jewishtimes.com/102212/new-web-series-captures-the-fun-of-cooking-for-kids/arts_life/|title=New Web Series Captures the Fun of Cooking for Kids|first=J. T.|last=Staff|date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> The first episodes featured Rylee Gluck, an 11 year old making dishes such as personal dessert pizzas. The show is geared for kids and will feature other children in future episodes.
