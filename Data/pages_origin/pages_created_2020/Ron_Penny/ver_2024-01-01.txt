'''Ronald Penny''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|FRACP|sep=,}} (28 December 1936 – 21 December 2019<ref name="ajn">{{cite news |last1=Levi |first1=Joshua |title=A hero of the early days of AIDS |url=https://ajn.timesofisrael.com/ron-penny-honoured/ |accessdate=31 December 2019 |work=Australian Jewish News |date=21 December 2019}}</ref>) was an Australian immunologist who made the first diagnosis of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Australia in 1982.

==Early life==
Penny was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] in 1936, and in 1938 his [[Jewish]] family settled in Australia as religious refugees.<ref name="smh2002">{{cite news |title=From harm and injustice |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/from-harm-and-injustice-20021003-gdfoti.html |accessdate=31 December 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 October 2002 |language=en}}</ref>

==Medical career==
In 1960, Penny graduated with honours from [[Sydney Medical School]], and undertook further study in [[haematology]], [[oncology]] and immunology in Britain and the United States. In 1967, he returned to Australia and began work at Sydney's [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]], where he set up the first clinical immunology unit in New South Wales. Two years later, the unit was transferred to [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital]].<ref name="usydmed">{{cite web |title=Penny, Ronald |url=https://sydney.edu.au/medicine/museum/mwmuseum/index.php/Penny,_Ronald |website=The University of Sydney School of Medicine Online Museum |publisher=University of Sydney |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>

In October 1982, Penny and his team at St Vincent's made the first diagnosis of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Australia, just over a year after the first clinical reporting of the disease in the United States.<ref name="smh2002" />

In 1983, Penny conducted a survey in New South Wales to better understand the connection between the spread of AIDS, sexual behaviour, and drug usage. He used anonymization methods to protect the respondents from legal jeopardy based on their responses.<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 1983 |title=AIDS Watch: Forum Heralds New Phase |work=Campaign |issue=93 |url= |access-date=}}</ref> In addition to identifying sources of primary HIV infection, Penny also worked to address the community and public health aspects of the epidemic, from debunking misconceptions about the transmission of HIV and the resulting discrimination against [[homosexual]] men, and adjusting community behaviour to better control transmission such as [[condom]] use and safer [[Drug injection|intravenous drug]] use.<ref name="usydmed" />

==Awards and honours==
In the [[1993 Queen's Birthday Honours (Australia)|1993 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Penny was made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) for "service to medical research and education particularly in the field of clinical immunology".<ref name="ao1993">{{cite web |title=Professor Ronald PENNY |url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/883837 |website=Australian Honours Search Facility |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>
