====Day Three====
Rahane was bowled by Cummins for 22 from 70 balls in the 55th over. Pujara anchored the innings, adding 50 off 176 balls as India collapsed from 3/142 to 244 all out,<ref name=":11">{{Cite news|last1=Lemon|first1=Geoff|last2=Howcroft|first2=Jonathan|last3=Howcroft|first3=Jonathan|last4=Howcroft|first4=Jonathan|date=9 January 2021|title=Australia v India: third Test, day three – as it happened|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jan/09/australia-v-india-third-test-day-three-live|access-date=12 January 2021|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> as Vihari, Ashwin and Bumrah were all run out.

India had a target of 407 to win the match in four sessions. India had another promising first wicket stand, until Gill was claimed for 31 in the 23rd over by Hazlewood. Sharma's wicket was claimed by Cummins in the 31st over as he attempted a pull shot but was caught at backward square leg by Starc.<ref name=":22" /> India was 2/98 from 34 overs at stumps, with Pujara on 9* and Rahane 4*.

Vihari and Ashwin survived the rest of the overs without too much trouble, as India played the match out for a draw. They did have a scare in the 123rd over, as Starc caught the edge of Vihari's bat, but the chance was dropped by the keeper Paine.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Lemon (earlier)|first1=Geoff|last2=Howcroft (later)|first2=Jonathan|last3=Howcroft|first3=Jonathan|date=11 January 2021|title=Australia and India draw third Test – as it happened|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2021/jan/11/australia-v-india-third-test-day-five-live|access-date=12 January 2021|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The chance of the match ending in a win for either team was dropping at this point, as the five wickets for Australia and 88 runs proved too difficult for either team to manage. Vihari finished with 23* (161) and Ashwin was 39* (128).

====Day One====
The start of the game saw a massive difference in terms of experience between the two sides. Indian bowlers had a combined total of 13 wickets, with T Natarajan and Washington Sundar making their debuts following injuries to Bumrah and Ashwin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-ind-4th-test-stats-australia-with-1033-wickets-in-the-xi-india-with-13-1247900| title=Stats - Australia with 1033 wickets in the XI; India with 13 | work= ESPNcricinfo| access-date= 27 February 2021}}</ref> However, this did not deter the Indian bowling who started with the session by dismissing both Warner and [[Marcus Harris (cricketer)|Marcus Harris]] in the first hour. This was followed by determined batting by Smith and Labuschagne. Labuschagne finally got his much deserved century late in the day with Australia ending on 5/274. India suffered further injury setbacks when Navdeep Saini left the field owing to groin pain.

====Day Two====
Day two started with India fighting back and dismissing Paine early. Some lower order resistance resulted in Australia reaching 369 before being dismissed at the stroke of lunch. India lost Gill early in their reply. However, Rohit Sharma and Pujara steadied the innings. However, Sharma fell due to his intention to attack Nathan Lyon, who was playing his 100th Test.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-ind-4th-test-brisbane-nathan-lyon-s-plan-just-trumped-the-rohit-sharma-method-1248047| title=Reckless Rohit?

====Day Three====
Day three started with Pujara and Rahane leading India's reply. However, Pujara was dismissed by Hazlewood. Rahane fell soon after and with Mayank Agarwal, playing in middle order and Pant falling in the second session India were in trouble at 6/186. This was followed by the most enterprising partnership of the match with debutant Washington Sundar and [[Shardul Thakur]], playing only his second Test, counter punching.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-ind-4th-test-brisbane-washington-sundar-beating-the-big-boys-since-sixth-grade-1248238 |title=Washington Sundar, beating the big boys since sixth grade | work= ESPNcricinfo| access-date= 27 February 2021}}</ref> They both scored sixties and with their 123 run partnership made sure India got as close to Australia's total as possible. Australia ended the day on 0/21.

====Day Four====
Day four started with Warner and Harris leading the charge for Australia. Runs were scored fairly easily before Thakur got Harris out after an opening wicket partnership of 89 runs. Warner was soon dismissed by Sundar with Australia ending on 4/149 at Lunch. The post-lunch session saw Green and Smith consolidate Australia's position before Smith was dismissed for 55 by Siraj. Rain caused early tea with Australia on 7/243. Post tea session saw Siraj get his maiden five-wicket haul as Australia were finally dismissed for 294 setting India a target of 328 runs, or bat out 114 overs.<ref name="Sirajfive" /> India ended the day on 0/4 as rain brought an early end to proceedings.

====Day Five====
India lost Rohit Sharma early on the last day. This was however followed by a 114 run partnership between Gill and Pujara as India set out to chase the target. Gill was dismissed for 91. Rahane hit a quickfire 24 off 22 balls, as India ended the second session on 183/3, meaning they required 145 runs of 37 overs. The post-tea session saw Pant ignite this test match as he in combination with Pujara led India's reply.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/australia-vs-india-shubman-gill-cheteshwar-pujara-and-rishabh-pant-showcase-india-s-batting-riches-1248505 |title=Gill, Pujara, Pant showcase India's batting riches | work= ESPNcricinfo| access-date= 27 February 2021}}</ref> Pujara fell for 56 immediately after new ball was taken. This was followed by Mayank Agarwal failing for the second time in the match. However, Pant led the charge as India reached the final target with three overs left in the day. The win has been regarded as India's greatest overseas triumph and meant Australia lost a Test at the Gabba for the first time [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1988–89|since 1988]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-ind-4th-test-brisbane-stats-india-breach-the-gabba-fortress-1248481 |title=Stats - India breach the Gabba fortress | work= ESPNcricinfo| access-date= 27 February 2021}}</ref>
