===Introduction===
In an interview with the [[BBC]], Rice commented on his similarties to Sid, saying: "Both of us will talk to anyone, and more often than not for a little too long. But I think we do it for different reasons. [Sid] just has to fill the silence. He is smarter than me, and that's always difficult, playing someone more intellectual than you, but he sometimes really struggles to read people so I have to be oblivious to certain things. Most challenging aspect would be his energy. I'm laid back and he's not. Finding it and using that energy well is sometimes tricky, and now having watched some scenes back, I still think it needs more. But we'll get there eventually. I hope."<ref name="BBC">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/34PHGbz6Jxx8W8vBS14drgp/ashley-rice-interview|title=Ashley Rice Interview|access-date=1 January 2020|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref> When asked for his opinion on his character, Rice stated: "Oh, he's so annoying, isn't he? I annoy myself playing him sometimes. And despite being quite bright he can completely miss the point sometimes. But he does have a good heart and only wants to do his best. I had a help from the directors in finding and using Sid's nervous energy, one in particular springs to mind."<ref name="BBC" /> He added: "the hardest part is thinking and speaking as quickly as he does, he doesn't pause for breath. So, if I stutter, pause or drop the ball when I shouldn't, it's back to the top."<ref name="BBC" />

==Storylines==
Sid arrives at The Mill in April 2015 as an F2 doctor having completed two prior placements before working there. Upon his arrival, [[Zara Carmichael]] ([[Elisabeth Dermot Walsh]]) bullies him, and knocks his confidence with patients. After initially allowing Zara to torment him, he later stands up for himself. Sid then begins to date colleague [[Ayesha Lee]] ([[Laura Rollins]]), but Sid ends the relationship when they argue and Ayesha vomits over him. 

After the 2018 Christmas party, Sid goes home with Zara, and the pair have sex. Zara's husband, [[Daniel Granger (Doctors)|Daniel Granger]] ([[Matthew Chambers]]), sees and does not react. However, when they are at The Mill, Daniel lashes out and punches Sid. In 2019, Sid discovers that his parents [[Estelle Vere|Estelle]] ([[Suzette Llewellyn]]) and [[Tye Vere]] ([[Daniel Hill (actor)|Daniel Hill]]) had another child before Sid was born. After reading their medical notes, it is revealed that his brother, [[Laurence Richards]] (Rishard Beckett), has [[Down's syndrome]], and that Estelle and Tye left him at the hospital as a newborn. Sid manages to track him down, where Laurence explains that he is happy with his life. 

When [[Imogen Hollins]] ([[Charlie Clemmow]]) is in Letherbridge, the pair flirt with each other. When Imogen's mother, [[Karen Hollins]] ([[Jan Pearson]]), finds out, she is initially unhappy due to Sid's relationship history. However, when Karen's husband [[Rob Hollins (Doctors)|Rob Hollins]] ([[Chris Walker (actor)|Chris Walker]]) persuades her that Sid is a reliable person, Karen sets them up. When Sid and Imogen have sex, he discovers a lump on her breast. He does an inspection, and refers her to a private clinic. Despite Imogen not having cancer, the pair agree that the spark in the relationship has gone due to the incident.
