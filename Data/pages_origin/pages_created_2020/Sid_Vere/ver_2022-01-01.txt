'''Dr. Sid Vere''' is a fictional character from the [[BBC One|BBC]] soap opera ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', portrayed by [[Ashley Rice]]. Sid made his first appearance on 27 April 2015 as an F2 doctor at the fictional Mill Health Centre. His storylines in the programme have included his relationships with colleagues [[Ayesha Lee]] ([[Laura Rollins]]) and [[Zara Carmichael]] ([[Elisabeth Dermot Walsh]]) and discovering his brother, [[Laurence Richards]] (Rishard Beckett). For his role as Sid, Rice has been nominated for various accolades including Newcomer at the [[21st National Television Awards]] and the [[British Soap Award for Best Actor]] in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

==Characterisation==
In an interview with the [[BBC]], Rice commented on his similarities to Sid, saying: "Both of us will talk to anyone, and more often than not for a little too long. But I think we do it for different reasons. [Sid] just has to fill the silence. He is smarter than me, and that's always difficult, playing someone more intellectual than you, but he sometimes really struggles to read people so I have to be oblivious to certain things. Most challenging aspect would be his energy. I'm laid back and he's not. Finding it and using that energy well is sometimes tricky, and now having watched some scenes back, I still think it needs more. But we'll get there eventually. I hope."<ref name="BBC">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/34PHGbz6Jxx8W8vBS14drgp/ashley-rice-interview|title=Ashley Rice Interview|access-date=1 January 2020|website=[[BBC]]|archive-date=1 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101235231/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/34PHGbz6Jxx8W8vBS14drgp/ashley-rice-interview|url-status=live}}</ref> When asked for his opinion on his character, Rice stated: "Oh, he's so annoying, isn't he? I annoy myself playing him sometimes. And despite being quite bright he can completely miss the point sometimes. But he does have a good heart and only wants to do his best. I had a help from the directors in finding and using Sid's nervous energy, one in particular springs to mind."<ref name="BBC" /> He added: "the hardest part is thinking and speaking as quickly as he does, he doesn't pause for breath. So, if I stutter, pause or drop the ball when I shouldn't, it's back to the top."<ref name="BBC" />
