''Paralives'' is being developed by [[indie game]] designer Alex Massé.<ref name=RPS>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/07/06/interview-the-art-and-inspiration-of-paralives-the-indie-game-set-to-take-on-the-sims/ |title=Interview: the art and inspiration of Paralives, the indie game set to take on The Sims |last=Bell |first=Alice |date=2020-07-06 |website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |access-date=2020-08-10 |archive-date=2020-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814000452/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/07/06/interview-the-art-and-inspiration-of-paralives-the-indie-game-set-to-take-on-the-sims/ |url-status=live }}</ref> After working on several projects such as [[PewDiePie]]'s ''Tuber Simulator'' and a number of demos for Project Tiny, Massé quit his job and began developing ''Paralives'' regularly.<ref name=Informer/> Development of the game started in January 2019 and was officially announced in June 2019.<ref name="paralives2">{{Cite web|title=Development|url=https://www.paralives.com/development|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Paralives|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721045319/https://www.paralives.com/development|url-status=live}}</ref> 

''Paralives'' was initially a solo project by Massé, but as of May 2024, the team has expanded to twelve people, collectively forming Paralives Studio.<ref name=RPS/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Press Kit |url=https://www.paralives.com/press-kit |access-date=2024-05-03 |website=Paralives |language=en-US}}</ref> Massé wants ''Paralives'' to offer a sense of endless customization with "powerful and intuitive tools that allow players to easily create any house with precision".<ref name=Informer/> He was inspired by the road tool in ''[[Cities: Skylines]]'' and developed a similar tool in ''Paralives'' for building houses.<ref name=RPS/> The developers incorporated the technique of procedural animation, which involves automatic reactions based on previously created animations to save developing time. 

The game is being funded through the crowdfunding platform [[Patreon]] and backers are invited to propose suggestions regarding content they would like to see in the full release.<ref name=Informer/> Massé chose to use Patreon after seeing ''[[Ooblets]]''{{'}}s success on the service. As of November 2023, the ''Paralives'' Patreon page contains close to 15,000 supporters and earns over $35,000 per month.<ref name="pcgamer">{{cite web |last=Watts |first=Rachel |date=2020-07-30 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |title=How Paralives is using Patreon to compete with The Sims |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-paralives-is-using-patreon-to-compete-with-the-sims/ |access-date=2020-08-10 |archive-date=2020-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200811043411/https://www.pcgamer.com/how-paralives-is-using-patreon-to-compete-with-the-sims/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Massé plans to release the game in [[Early Access]] on Steam and support the game with free updates and modding, where people can share their designs on the [[Steam Workshop]].<ref name=Informer/>
