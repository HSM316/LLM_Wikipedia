The character creator, titled as "Paramaker",<ref name=RPS/> allows the customization of the appearance with sliders and color wheel as the options. Players are able to make changes to the physique and height, and by using the color wheel, the root and the shade of the hair can be toggled as intended.<ref name="gamesradar">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sims-competitor-paralives-shows-off-new-character-creator/ |title=Sims competitor Paralives shows off new character creator |last=Wald |first=Heather |date=2020-05-20 |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |access-date=2020-08-10 }}</ref><ref name="paralives1">{{Cite web|title=Height Sliders Confirmed as Paralives Team Reveals Character Design {{!}} The Paralives Hub|date=19 May 2020|url=https://paraliveshub.com/height-sliders-confirmed-as-paralives-team-reveals-character-design|access-date=2020-10-13|language=en-GB}}</ref> A similar system is in place for objects and construction, allowing the player to adjust the size, placement and color of walls, floors, windows, doors, and furniture.<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/paralives-a-new-sims-like-game-looks-cool-1843551132|title=''Paralives'', A New Sims-Like Game, Looks Cool|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=2020-05-19|access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref>

== Development==
''Paralives'' was created by independent game developer Alex Massé.<ref name=RPS>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/07/06/interview-the-art-and-inspiration-of-paralives-the-indie-game-set-to-take-on-the-sims/ |title=Interview: the art and inspiration of Paralives, the indie game set to take on The Sims |last=Bell |first=Alice |date=2020-07-06 |website=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |access-date=2020-08-10 }}</ref> After working on several projects such as [[PewDiePie]]'s ''Tuber Simulator'' and a number of demos for Project Tiny, Massé made a decision to quit his job and develop ''Paralives'' regularly.<ref name=Informer/> Development of the game started in January 2019 and the development was officially announced in June 2019.<ref name="paralives2">{{Cite web|title=Development|url=https://www.paralives.com/development|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Paralives|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Initially, ''Paralives'' was a solo project, but Massé hired people to work on the game: Léa Sorribès, Christine Gariépy, and Anna Thibert, forming Paralives Studio.<ref name=RPS/> As of May 2021, the team consists of ten people in total after hiring a music composer.
Massé thought that previous life simulation games did not have a tool that allowed easy and precise creation of any house in-game, which prompted him to design ''Paralives'' to offer a sense of endless customization.<ref name=Informer/> He was inspired by the road tool found in ''[[Cities: Skylines]]'', and tried to make it work in ''Paralives'', thinking it would fit well for placing walls and building houses.<ref name=RPS/> The developers incorporated the technique of procedural animation, which involves automatic reactions based on previously created animations, to avoid the need of animating every situation possible and save some developing time. 

Considering the game is being funded through crowdfunding platform [[Patreon]], the backers are invited to propose suggestions regarding what type of content they would like to see in the full release.<ref name=Informer/> Massé was influenced by ''[[Ooblets]]''{{'}}s success on the service, and decided to join it as well, having admired the support it had just from the concept art and idea alone. He hoped the Patreon page would aid the development enough to hire another artist. As of November 2023, it contains close to 15,000 supporters and earns over $35,000 per month.<ref name="pcgamer">{{cite web |last=Watts |first=Rachel |date=2020-07-30 |website=[[PC Gamer]] |title=How Paralives is using Patreon to compete with The Sims |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-paralives-is-using-patreon-to-compete-with-the-sims/ |access-date=2020-08-10 }}</ref> According to Massé, there is a document with 100 pages called the "Parabook", containing all the ideas collected so far. Massé's plan is to release the game in [[Early Access]] on Steam, then support the game with free updates and modding, where people would share their designs on the [[Steam Workshop]].<ref name=Informer/> 

The team wanted to offer a realistic life simulation, meaning the game will not feature any supernatural characters, such as ghosts or aliens.
