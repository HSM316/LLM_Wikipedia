'''Tourism in the Republic of Artsakh''' is the main and fastest growing branch of the [[Artsakh Republic]] economy. For the purpose of regulating the tourism sphere the Government of the Artsakh Republic adopted the Law on Tourism and Tourism Activities. The development of tourism in the Republic of Artsakh is carried out by the Tourism Department of the NKR Ministry of Economy. The region is currently populated mostly by [[Armenians]] and the primary spoken language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. It is located in the northeast of the Armenian Highland and mainly has a mountainous surface. It is famous for its rich and beautiful nature. The surface of Artsakh is divided by numerous mountain ranges. To the north are the ravines of Mrav, in the north-west the Eastern Sevan Mountains, in the west the Syunik Plateau, in the central part the Artsakh Ridge, from which a number of small mountain ridges are spread to the east. Artsakh is in a seismically active zone. The main policy objectives of the tourism sector are to promote international recognition of the independent state of the Artsakh Republic through tourism development, as well as to accelerate the process of increasing national income by becoming a popular tourist destination, resulting in increased employment in the tourism sector. This will be followed by an increase in the living standards of the population.

In 2014 the number of tourists in NKR decreased by 12% compared to the previous year. However, the overnight stay of foreign tourists has increased, as has the number of visitors from the Republic of Armenia [2]. According to 2015 data, the number of tourists increased by 40% compared to last year, reaching an economic peak.

As of 2015, 16,000 tourists from 86 countries (including the Republic of Armenia) have arrived in Artsakh, spending about $6 million in Artsakh.

April 18 is officially marked as the Day of Tourism and Attractions in the Republic of Artsakh.
