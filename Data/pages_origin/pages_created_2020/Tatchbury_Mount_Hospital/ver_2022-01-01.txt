'''Tatchbury Mount Hospital''' is a health facility to the north of [[Totton and Eling|Totton]], [[Hampshire]], England. It is owned and managed by [[Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust]] and acts as the Trust's headquarters. The site was formerly a large psychiatric hospital with the majority of the buildings on the site dedicated to this purpose, however in recent years changes in the management of these patients has resulted in the uses for the site diversifying. 

==History==
===Iron age hillfort===

===Manor houses===
The area occupied by the hospital today was occupied by two manors in the 19th century. The eastern part of the site, now occupied by Austen House, was the site of Loperwood Manor.<ref name="woodhaven build"/> It was later reused as hospital offices but was vacated due to poor repair in 1973 and was demolished c.1975<ref name="Loperwood Manor demolish"/> The former coach house of this manor built in the mid 19th century survives on the site and is [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II listed]].<ref>{{cite web |title=STABLES OF LOPERWOOD MANOR.

The hillfort area also contained a private house known as Tatchbury Manor which was completed in the early 19th century.<ref name=heritage>{{cite web|url=https://houseandheritage.org/2018/08/29/tatchbury-mount/|title=Tatchbury Mount|publisher=House and Heritage|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Tenants included [[Gooch baronets|Sir Daniel Fulthorpe Gooch, 3rd Baronet]].<ref name=heritage/> As part of the construction, the hillfort and summit was landscaped and planted with trees to form a formal gardens.<ref name="SAM record"/> It remained as a private residence until 1927 when it was put up for sale by the Timson family.<ref name=heritage/> The house remained in use by the hospital until it fell into disrepair around the millennium<ref name="2003 masterplan">{{cite web |title=A Strategy for the Redevelopment of the Tatchbury Mount site and a Planning Application for the Permanent Use of Seven Buildings on the site for Office Use |url=https://publicaccess.newforestnpa.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F9D6FEF4CDB0C1E557BF82F44D81D795/pdf/03_78763-RE-DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY-574503.pdf |publisher=New Forest National Park Authority |access-date=31 January 2021 |pages=2-3 |date=July 2003}}</ref> and was demolished in 2006<ref name=heritage/> having been excluded from the scheduling of the hillfort.<ref name="SAM record"/>
