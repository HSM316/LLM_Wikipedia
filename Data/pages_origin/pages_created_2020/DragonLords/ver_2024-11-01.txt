'''''DragonLords''''', subtitled "Yet Another Fantasy & Sci-Fi Roleplaying Magazine", is a British role-playing game [[fanzine]] from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Self-published originally by [[Marc Gascoigne]], Mike Lewis, and [[Ian Marsh (writer)|Ian Marsh]], ''DragonLords'' produced 22 issues from {{circa}} 1978 to 1985.
 
Originally solely focused on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', the fanzine came to include reviews, articles about [[computer games]], and a regular column about the strategic [[board game]] ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]''.

''DragonLords'' was a "well-regarded fanzine" that helped two of the three editors attain editorial positions with the British manufacturer of miniature wargames, [[Games Workshop]].<ref name=mason>{{citation | first =Mason | last =Paul  | title =A Case Study of the Influence of Fandom: How Role-players Helped Develop Computer Games in Britain  | journal=人間文化: 愛知学院大学人間文化研究所紀要 (Human Culture: Bulletin of the Institute for Human Culture) | pages =7 | publisher =Aichi Gakuin University | date =2017 | location =Nagoya, Japan | url =https://agu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=919&item_no=1&attribute_id=22&file_no=1 | access-date =2022-01-26 }}</ref>

==Publication history==
School friends Gascoigne, Lewis, and Marsh played the newly published [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in the mid-1970s.<ref name=wgj>{{cite magazine | last =Fawcett | first =Neil | title =The Wargames Journal Interview | magazine=Wargames Journal | issue =4 | pages =70–75 | publisher =Rebel Publishing | date =2006}}</ref> Soon afterward, the three friends started writing, editing and self-publishing ''DragonLords''.<ref name=wgj /><ref name=grog /> 

Marsh, Lewis, and Gascoigne continued to publish ''DragonLords'' after they entered university in 1978. Marsh even produced an issue in the midst of final exams, saying later, "The magazine seemed more important."<ref name=wgj /> 

Gascoigne withdrew from the fanzine in 1983, leaving Marsh and Lewis to continue publication.<ref>{{cite magazine | last =Tamlyn | first =Pete | title =British Hobby News | magazine=[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]] | issue =2 | date =May 1983 }}</ref>

Once Marsh graduated from university and joined the editorial staff of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'', he found he had less time to work on the fanzine, and decided to bring it to a close with issue #22 (1985).<ref name=grog>{{cite web | url =https://thegrognardfiles.com/2017/07/25/dragonlords-scrap-book/ | title =DragonLords Scrap Book | date =2017-07-26 | website =The Grognard Files | access-date =2019-12-30}}</ref><ref name="wd2">{{cite magazine|last=Livingstone|first=Ian |author-link=Ian Livingstone |date=April 1985 |title=News|magazine=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|publisher=[[Games Workshop]]|issue=52|pages=39}}</ref>

== Contents ==
A ''DragonLords'' article titled "The Ecology of the Piercer," by Chris Elliot and Richard Edwards, explained the habits of the piercer, a ''D&D'' monster, as if being told in a lecture given by a wizard. The article was picked up in whole and reprinted by industry giant ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in issue #72 (April 1983). The article proved so popular that more than 150 "The Ecology of..." articles appeared in subsequent issues of ''Dragon''.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://dmdavid.com/tag/3-reasons-science-and-ecology-make-a-bad-mix-for-some-monsters/ | title =3 reasons science and ecology make a bad mix for some monsters | last =Hartlage | first =David | date =2013-12-08 | website =DMN David | access-date =2022-01-26}}</ref>

===''Redfox''===
The ''[[Redfox (comics)|Redfox]]'' comic originated in the pages of ''DragonLords'',<ref>{{cite web | url =http://gobacktothepast.com/retro-review-redfox-1/ | title =Retro Review: Redfox #1 | last =Turner | first =Greg | date =2012-08-02 | website =Retro Reviews | access-date =2022-01-26}}</ref> first as a three-panel strip featuring a [[barmaid]] turned warrior that was inked by an artist working under the pseudonym "[[Fox (artist)|Fox]]". The strip was created as readers debated whether the fanzine should show scantily-clad women on its cover. ''Redfox'' proved popular enough that it continued as a regular feature. After ''Dragonlords'' folded, Fox self-published ''Redfox'', with writing from former ''DragonLords'' editor Mike Lewis.<ref>{{cite comic | writer=Fox | story=Editorial | title=Redfox | issue=1 | date=1984 | publisher=self-published | page=2}}</ref> The comic went on to win an [[Eagle Awards|Eagle Award]] for "Favourite New Comic (UK)" in 1987,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/1987/ | title =Previous Winners: 1987 | website =Eagle Awards | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223555/http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/1987/ | access-date =2018-09-22| archive-date =2012-03-14 }}[ ] at the Eagle Awards website, archived at The Wayback Machine.

==Critical reception==
At the [[Games Day]] '81 convention in London, ''DragonLords'' was voted second place as "Best Games Fanzine".<ref name="wd1">{{cite magazine|last=Livingstone|first=Ian |author-link=Ian Livingstone |date=December 1981 |title=Game Day '81|magazine=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|publisher=[[Games Workshop]]|issue=28}}</ref>

''Dungeons & Dragons'' co-creator [[Gary Gygax]] praised ''DragonLords'' in the August 1982 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #63),  writing that "the digest-size magazine is filled with material of a fairly high value, and is surprisingly even, too." Gygax lauded ''DragonLords'' for "its obvious attempt to make meaningful contributions to adventure gaming." He concluded that "''DragonLords'' is a well done amateur effort which seems bent on improving itself and the hobby."<ref name=dragon63>{{cite journal|last=Gygax|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Gygax| date=August 1982 |title=Two UK magazines are jolly good gaming journals|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=63|pages=58}}</ref>

In the inaugural issue of ''[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]]'' (April 1983), Don Turnbull reviewed ''DragonLords'' #14, asking "where would we be without it?" Although he noted the recent departure of Gascoigne, Turnbull thought the issue "looks good, has fine artwork in places and always does well in convention polls."<ref>{{cite magazine | last =Turnbull| first =Don | title =Fanzines | magazine=[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]] | issue =1 | date =April 1983 |page= 44 }}</ref>
