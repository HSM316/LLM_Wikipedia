==Reviews==
In the August 1982 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #63), [[Gary Gygax]] found that "The digest-size magazine is filled with material of a fairly high value, and is surprisingly even, too." Gygax lauded ''DragonLords'' for "its obvious attempt to make meaningful contributions to adventure gaming." He concluded that "''DragonLords'' is a well done amateur effort which seems bent on improving itself and the hobby."<ref name=dragon63>{{cite journal|last=Gygax|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Gygax| date=August 1982 |title=Two UK magazines are jolly good gaming journals|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=63|pages=58}}</ref>
