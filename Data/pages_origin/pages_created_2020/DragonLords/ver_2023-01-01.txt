'''''DragonLords''''', subtitled "Yet Another Fantasy & Sci-Fi Roleplaying Magazine", is a British role-playing game fanzine that was self-published by [[Marc Gascoigne]], Mike Lewis, and [[Ian Marsh (writer)|Ian Marsh]].

==Getting started==
School friends [[Marc Gascoigne]], Mike Lewis and [[Ian Marsh (writer)|Ian Marsh]] played the newly published role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' in the mid-1970s.<ref name=wgj>{{cite magazine | last =Fawcett | first =Neil | title =The Wargames Journal Interview | magazine=Wargames Journal | issue =4 | pages =70–75 | publisher =Rebel Publishing | date =2006}}</ref> The three friends started writing, editing and self-publishing the role-playing game fanzine titled ''DragonLords''.<ref name=wgj /><ref name=grog /> The relatively popular fanzine<ref name=mason /> also included reviews, articles about computer games, and a regular column about ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]''. At the "Games Day '81" convention in London, ''DragonLords'' was voted second place as "Best Games Fanzine".<ref name="wd1">{{cite magazine|last=Livingstone|first=Ian |author-link=Ian Livingstone |date=December 1981 |title=Game Day '81|magazine=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|publisher=[[Games Workshop]]|issue=28}}</ref>

Marsh, Lewis and Gascoigne continued to publish ''DragonLords'' after they entered university in 1978. Marsh even produced an issue in the midst of final exams, saying later, "The magazine seemed more important."<ref name=wgj /> Gascoigne withdrew from the fanzine in 1983, leaving Marsh and Lewis to continue publication.<ref>{{cite magazine | last =Tamlyn | first =Pete | title =British Hobby News | magazine=[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]] | issue =2 | date =May 1983 }}</ref> 

An article titled "The Ecology of the Piercer" by Chris Elliot and Richard Edwards appeared in the pages of ''DragonLords'', explaining the habits of the piercer, a ''D&D'' monster, as if being told in a lecture given by a wizard. The article was picked up in whole and reprinted by industry giant ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in Issue 72. The article proved so popular that more than 150 "The Ecology of..." articles appeared in subsequent issues of ''Dragon''.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://dmdavid.com/tag/3-reasons-science-and-ecology-make-a-bad-mix-for-some-monsters/ | title =3 reasons science and ecology make a bad mix for some monsters | last =Hartlage | first =David | date =2013-12-08 | website =DMN David | access-date =2022-01-26}}</ref>

==''Redfox''==
The ''[[Redfox (comics)|Redfox]]'' comic originated in the pages of ''DragonLords'',<ref>{{cite web | url =http://gobacktothepast.com/retro-review-redfox-1/ | title =Retro Review: Redfox #1 | last =Turner | first =Greg | date =2012-08-02 | website =Retro Reviews | access-date =2022-01-26}}</ref> first as a three-panel strip featuring a [[barmaid]] turned warrior that was inked by an artist working under the pseudonym "Fox". The first strip was created as readers debated whether the fanzine should show scantily-clad women on its cover. ''Redfox'' proved popular enough that it continued as a regular feature. After ''Dragonlords'' folded, Fox self-published ''Redfox'' with writing from former ''DragonLords'' editor Mike Lewis.<ref>{{cite comic | writer=Fox | story=Editorial | title=Redfox | issue=1 | date=1984 | publisher=self-published | page=2}}</ref> The comic went on to win an [[Eagle Awards|Eagle Award]] for "Favourite New Comic (UK)" in 1987,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/1987/ | title =Previous Winners: 1987 | website =Eagle Awards | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223555/http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/1987/ | access-date =2018-09-22| archive-date =2012-03-14 }}[ ] at the Eagle Awards website, archived at The Wayback Machine.

==Demise==
Once Marsh graduated and joined the editorial staff of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'', he found he had less time to work on the fanzine, and decided to bring it to a close with Issue 22.<ref name=grog>{{cite web | url =https://thegrognardfiles.com/2017/07/25/dragonlords-scrap-book/ | title =DragonLords Scrap Book | date =2017-07-26 | website =The Grognard Files | access-date =2019-12-30}}</ref> As ''White Dwarf'' editor [[Ian Livingstone]] noted, "Since joining the ''White Dwarf'' team, Ian Marsh no longer has time to publish his zine Dragonlords. So it's Dragonlords RIP after issue 22."<ref name="wd2">{{cite magazine|last=Livingstone|first=Ian |author-link=Ian Livingstone |date=April 1985 |title=News|magazine=[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]|publisher=[[Games Workshop]]|issue=52|pages=39}}</ref>

==Reviews==
In the August 1982 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #63), [[Gary Gygax]] found that "The digest-size magazine is filled with material of a fairly high value, and is surprisingly even, too." Gygax lauded ''DragonLords'' for "its obvious attempt to make meaningful contributions to adventure gaming." He concluded that "''DragonLords'' is a well done amateur effort which seems bent on improving itself and the hobby."<ref name=dragon63>{{cite journal|last=Gygax|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Gygax| date=August 1982 |title=Two UK magazines are jolly good gaming journals|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=63|pages=58}}</ref>

In the inaugural issue of ''[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]]'', Don Turnbull reviewed Issue 14 of ''DragonLords'' and asked "where would we be without it?" Alhough he noted the recent departure of Marc Gascoigne, Turnbull thought the issue "looks good, has fine artwork in places and always does well in convention polls."<ref>{{cite magazine | last =Turnbull| first =Don | title =Fanzines | magazine=[[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]] | issue =1 | date =April 1983 |page= 44 }}</ref>  

Paul Mason considered ''DragonLords'' a "well-regarded fanzine" that helped two of the three editors attain editorial positions within [[Games Workshop]].<ref name=mason>{{citation | first =Mason | last =Paul  | title =A Case Study of the Influence of Fandom: How Role-players Helped Develop Computer Games in Britain  | journal=人間文化: 愛知学院大学人間文化研究所紀要 (Human Culture: Bulletin of the Institute for Human Culture) | pages =7 | publisher =Aichi Gakuin University | date =2017 | location =Nagoya, Japan | url =https://agu.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_action_common_download&item_id=919&item_no=1&attribute_id=22&file_no=1 | access-date =2022-01-26 }}</ref>
