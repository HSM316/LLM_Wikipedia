'''''Cheviot''''' was launched in Sunderland in 1827. Initially she sailed between London and Quebec. Then in 1831 she became a [[whaler]] and sailed to the British Southern Whale Fishery. She never returned to England from that voyage, instead becoming based in [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]] and remaining there as whaler and merchantman. She was lost in March 1854.

==Statement of significance==

{{quote|The Cheviot is historically significant for being associated with Hobart whalers James Kelly, William Mansfield and Charles Seal, who all owned the Cheviot at some stage in their careers. When Charles Seal died, ownership of the Cheviot and the rest of his whaling and cargo/ passenger ships passed into the hands of his wife Phillis Seal, making her the first woman shipowner, and fleet owner in Australia. The Cheviot is archaeologically significant for representing the remains of an early 19th century Atlantic, South Seas, and colonial Australian whaling vessel, and is one of only a handful of shipwreck sites relating to the whaling industry in Victoria.|Victorian Heritage Database.<ref name=VHD/>}}

==Career==
''Cheviot'' first appeared in the ''Register of Shipping'' (''RS'') with Mawson, master, Laing, owner, and trade Sunderland–London.<ref name=RS1827/>

In 1831 the ownership of ''Cheviot'' changed. The new owners lengthened her, and with a new master, sailed her on a whaling voyage to the waters of the [[Dutch East Indies]] and Pacific.<ref name=RS1832>[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214499?urlappend=%3Bseq=133 ''RS'' (1832), Seq.№C584.]</ref>

''Cheviot'' first appeared in ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' (''LR'') in 1831 with a launch year of 1831,<ref name=LR1831/> and other incorrect or questionable information. This has led several sources, such as Hackman, astray.{{sfnp|Hackman|2001|p=261}}

'''Whaling voyage:''' Captain Thomas Bateman sailed from England on 7 November 1831.<ref name=bswf/> The French whaler ''Aigle'' reported on 23 May 1832 to Cheviot that {{ship||Lady Hamilton|1808 ship|2}} had been lost in Mozambique Channel.

She sailed through the Gilolo Passage (Laut [[Halmahera]] and [[Gebe]] Island) into the Pacific on 30 December 1832. She was reported at various times at Oahu, Hobart, Tahiti, and Honolulu.<ref name=bswf>[https://whalinghistory.org/bv/voyages/ British Southern Whale Fishery Database – Voyages: ''Cheviot''.]</ref> On 3 July 1833 {{ship||Cadmus|1813 ship|2}} passed on to ''Cheviot'' that the whaler {{ship||Borneo|1817 ship|2}} had been lost on the coast of the Seychelles.

'''Later career:''' ''Cheviot'' did not return to England. She continued whaling through to 1837 when Captain James Kelly registered her in Hobart as her owner. Under his ownership she increasingly spent more time in local trade and less in whaling.<ref name=VHD/>

In 1842 Charles Seal and William John Mansfield of Hobart purchased ''Cheviot''. When Seal died in November 1852 his wife Phillis Seal became the owner of ''Cheviot'', and the rest of his fleet. (Another one of the Seal whalers was [[HMS Mutine (1825)|''Aladdin'']].) Mansfield bought out Seal's share in ''Cheviot'' but lost his ownership in 1853 to the mortgagor. He remained her master, however, until she was lost.<ref name=VHD/>

==Fate==
''Cheviot'' was wrecked on 24 March 1854 off [[Wilson's Promontory]] in [[Elliston, South Australia|Waterloo Bay]]. She was on a voyage from Hobart to Melbourne with a cargo of 343 planks, 213 piles, 705 bags lime, 36 trusses hay, and seven boxes. She foundered in a gale while in the Waterloo Bay anchorage.<ref name=VHD/>{{sfnp|Anderson|2004|pp=1–10}}
