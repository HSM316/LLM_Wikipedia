"'''Blue Angel'''" is a song by [[Roy Orbison]], released as a single in August 1960. Released as the follow-up to the international hit "[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]", "Blue Angel" peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number eleven on the UK's ''[[Record Retailer]]'' Top 50.<ref name=Billboard/><ref name="ukrr"/>

==Background and release==
"Blue Angel" followed its predecessor, "Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)", in very much the same style with Orbison once again able to show off his [[falsetto]] and semi-operatic vocals and also followed its theme of lost love.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=1973|title=The Lonely Man of Rock|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Radio-One-Pop/Radio-One-Story-of-Pop-05.pdf|magazine=[[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]]'s Story of Pop|pages=114–115|access-date=13 January 2022}}</ref> However, whilst "Only the Lonely" was a gloomy song of self-pity, "Blue Angel" was, according to musician and writer [[John Kruth]], "a dollop of commercial fluff… [and that] lyrically, it was rather sappy, a trite knock-off about teen love, all too typical of its time. Its power lay in its simple but insidious melody."<ref>{{cite book |author=Kruth |first=John |title=Rhapsody in Black: The Life and Music of Roy Orbison |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2013 |isbn=9781480354937}}</ref>

Co-written with collaborator [[Joe Melson]], Orbison recorded "Blue Angel"  in early August 1960 at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Victor Studio B]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. It was then quickly released as a single at the end of August with the B-side "Today's Teardrops", written by a then-relatively unknown [[Gene Pitney]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Roy Orbison - Blue Angel |url=https://www.45cat.com/record/45425us |access-date=2023-01-15}}</ref> Whilst the single was first released on [[Monument Records]] in the US, its UK release came in October 1960 on parent label [[London Recordings|London Records]] when "Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)" was top of the charts there.<ref>{{Citation |title=Roy Orbison - Blue Angel |url=https://www.45cat.com/record/hlu9207 |access-date=2023-01-15}}</ref>
