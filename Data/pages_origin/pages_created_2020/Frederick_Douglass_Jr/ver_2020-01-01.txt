Frederick Douglas, Jr., (March 3, 1842 - Jul 26, 1892) was the second son of [[Frederick Douglass]] and his wife [[Anna Murray Douglass]]. Born in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]], he was an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], [[Essay|Essayist]], newspaper [[Editor]], and an official recruiter of colored soldiers for the [[Union Army|United States Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early Life==

Frederick Jr., was the third eldest of five children born to the Douglass family, comprising three sons and two daughters. As a youngster while still under his parent’s roof he joined them as active members and conductors of the [[Underground railroad]], receiving fugitives at their [[Rochester, New York]] home; feeding and clothing them, and providing safe, warm shelter as they made their way from bondage to freedom, which for many of these meant escape to [[Canada]]. Years later, his brother [[Charles Remond Douglass|Charles]] would recall: “We have often had to get up at midnight to admit a sleigh-load and start fires to thaw them the [[Fugitive|fugitives]] out. Every member of the family had to lend a hand to this work and it was always cheerfully performed.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019347/new-dawn-freedom|title=‘New Dawn for Freedom’|website=The Current|language=en|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>

==Military Service==

During the [[Names of the American Civil War|War Between the States]], Frederick Jr., joined his father as a recruiter of [[United States Colored Troops]] for the [[Union Army]] and was commissioned a Recruiting [[Sergeant]]. Although he himself was never a combat soldier during the [[Civil War|intrastate]] conflict, as were his two brothers, he was proud to have been a recruiter in behalf of the Union cause, especially in regard to the [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]]<ref name="[[David W. Blight]]">Blight, David W. Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom. Simon and Shuster, 2018. p450</ref>. As such, he worked closely with his renowned father who had been the foremost civilian recruiter for the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], and who had also served as a consultant and advisor to [[President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the enlistment of men of color into the Union Army, in supporting the [[Commander in Chief|Commander in Chief's]] objective of reinforcing the North’s armed forces to put down the rebellion of the break-away [[Confederate States]].<ref name="David W. Blight">Blight, David W. Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom. Simon and Shuster, 2018. p450</ref> Both his older brother [[Lewis Henry Douglass]] and younger brother [[Charles Remond Douglass]] were among the first enlistees in that famed regiment. Charles, in fact, was the very first man of color to enlist from the [[State of New York]].
==Career==
As was true of his world renowned father, as well as his two brothers, Frederick Jr., lived many lives in one. He was both a printer and editor, having learned these skills while working as an apprentice on his father's newspaper [[The North Star]], later known as Frederick Douglass’ Paper.  Tegether with his father and his brother Lewis, he became co-editor to the New Era or New National Era, a journal published specifically for Freedmen post-civil War freed slaves between the years 1870 to 1874. This post abolitionist journal shared with an earlier journal[[The National Era|], also published at Washington D.C. between years 1847 to 1860. It was this paper that had serialized the stories that would become [[Uncle Tom's cabin]], written by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].
Like his older brother Lewis, he was also a trained [[Typesetter]], having completed formal training at [[Denver, Colorado]]. His younger brother Charles would later become the first typesetter employed by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]] at [[Washington D.C]].
==Personal Life==
On August 4, 1869, Frederick, Jr., married Virginia Hewlett in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts]]. Together they had two sons, Frederick Aaron Douglass and Charles Paul Douglass. When his father, Frederick Douglass, Sr., was appointed [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the year 1877, Frederick, Jr., was made a [[Bailiff]] and also attained a clerkship in the office of the [[Recorder of Deeds]] during his father's tenure as first to serve in that role for the [[District of Columbia]]. 
==Death==
Frederick Douglass Jr., died on July 26, 1892, and was interred at [[Graceland Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Graceland Cemetery]] beside his beloved wife Virginia Hewlett who had preceded him in death on December 14, 1889. This later changed when Graceland closed, bodies exhumed and removed to [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the [[Benning Ridge]] section of Washington D.C. 

==Notes==

The following represents correspondence between Frederick Douglass jr., and District of Columbia Register of Deeds, Simon Wolf. It goes on to describe content of the cover letter accompanying his application for a Clerkship within that office. 

''Yesterday Simon Wolf, esq., the newly appointed register of deeds, received the following letter from Frederick Douglass, jr., a brother of Mr. [Charles] Douglass, at the Government office, (and not the “colored printer at the Government office,” as erroneously stated in the Star of yesterday.) The letter will be read with interest at this time:''


Washington, D.C., May 21, 1869.

Simon Wolf, Esq., Register of Deeds:

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to request an appointment as clerk in the office of which you have the distinguished honor to be the head. I belong to that despised class which has not been known in the field of applicants for position under the Government heretofore. I served my country during the war, under the colors of Massachusetts, my own native State, and am the son of a man (Frederick Douglass) who was once held in a bondage protected by the laws of this nation; a nation, the perpetuity of which, with many others of my race, I struggled to maintain. I am by trade a printer, but in consequence of combinations entered into by printers’ unions throughout the country, I am unable to obtain employment at it. I therefore hope that you will give this, my application, the most favorable consideration.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK DOUGLASS, JR.


''The following is the official reply:''


RECORDER’S OFFICE

Washington, D.C., May 21, 1869.

Your application is before me, and has received favorable consideration. I see no reason in the world why you or your race should not have the full countenance in the struggle for progress and education, and I am particularly happy in being the means of encouraging you; for, as a descendant of a race equally maligned and prejudged, I have a feeling of common cause; and who can foresee but what the stone the builders reject may become the head stone of our political and social structure."

Very respectfully,

S. Wolf
