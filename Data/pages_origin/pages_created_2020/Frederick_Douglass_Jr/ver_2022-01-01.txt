'''Frederick Douglass Jr.''' (March 3, 1842 - July 26, 1892) was the second son of [[Frederick Douglass]] and his wife [[Anna Murray Douglass]]. Born in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], he was an [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]], [[essay]]ist, newspaper [[editor]], and an official recruiter of colored soldiers for the [[Union Army|United States Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Frederick Jr. was the third eldest of five children born to the [[Douglass family]], comprising three sons and two daughters. As a youngster while still under his parent’s roof he joined them as active members and conductors of the [[Underground railroad]], receiving fugitives at their [[Rochester, New York]] home; feeding and clothing them, and providing safe, warm shelter as they made their way from bondage to freedom, which for many of these meant escape to [[Canada]]. Years later, his younger brother [[Charles Remond Douglass|Charles]] would recall: “We have often had to get up at midnight to admit a sleigh-load and start fires to thaw the [[fugitive]]s out. Every member of the family had to lend a hand to this work and it was always cheerfully performed.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019347/new-dawn-freedom|title=New Dawn for Freedom|website=The Current|language=en|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref> The first residence for his family was at the house of Nathan and Polly Johnson, who were African-Americans who regularly sheltered people seeking freedom from slavery [[Nathan and Mary (Polly) Johnson properties|at their home]].<ref name="Barnes">{{Cite web |url=https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20180402/3-years-in-new-bedford-changed-frederick-douglass-but-why |title=3 years in New Bedford changed Frederick Douglass, but why? |last=Barnes |first=Jennette |date=April 2, 2018 |website=SouthCoast Today |language=en |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name="NPS - Johnsons" /> They stayed with the Johnsons in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] from 1838 to 1839.<ref name="NPS - Johnsons">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/ma6.htm |title=Aboard the Underground Railroad-- Nathan and Polly Johnson House |website=National Park Service |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref>

==Military service==
During the American Civil War, Frederick Jr. joined his father as a recruiter of [[United States Colored Troops]] for the [[Union Army]] and was commissioned a Recruiting [[Sergeant]], attached to the [[25th United States Colored Infantry Regiment|U.S. 25th Colored Infantry]]. Although he himself was never a combat soldier during the [[American Civil War|intrastate]] conflict, as were his two brothers, he was proud to have been a recruiter in behalf of the Union cause, especially regarding the famous [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]].{{sfn |Blight |2018 |p=450}} As such, he worked closely with his renowned father who had been the foremost civilian recruiter for the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], and who had also served as a consultant and advisor to [[President (government title)|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the enlistment of men of color into the Union Army, in supporting the [[Commander in Chief|Commander in Chief's]] objective of reinforcing the North’s armed forces to put down the rebellion of the break-away [[Confederate States]].{{sfn |Blight |2018 |p=391}} Both his older brother [[Lewis Henry Douglass]] and younger brother [[Charles Remond Douglass]] were among the first enlistees in that famed regiment. Charles, in fact, was the very first man of color to enlist from the [[State of New York]].

==Career==
As was true of his world-renowned father, as well as his two brothers, Frederick Jr., lived many lives in one. He was both a printer and editor, having learned these skills while working as an apprentice on his father's newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', later known as Frederick Douglass’ Paper.  Together with his father and his brother Lewis, he became co-editor of the ''New Era'' or ''[[New National Era]]'', a journal published specifically for [[Freedman|Freedmen]], post-civil War freed slaves between the years 1870 to 1874. This post-abolitionist journal shared much in common purpose with an earlier journal [[The National Era]], also published at Washington, D.C. between the years 1847 to 1860. It was this paper that had serialized the stories that would become ''[[Uncle Tom's cabin]]'', written by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].
Like his older brother Lewis, he was also a trained [[Typesetter]], having completed formal training at [[Denver, Colorado]]. His younger brother Charles would later become the first typesetter employed by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] When his father, Frederick Douglass Sr., was appointed [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the year 1877, Frederick Jr. was made a [[Bailiff]] and later attained a clerkship in the office of the [[Recorder of Deeds]] during his father's tenure in that role for the [[District of Columbia]]. The senior Douglass had been nominated to this office by [[President James Garfield]] in 1881, serving in that office until his resignation following the inauguration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1885.

==Death==
Frederick Douglass Jr. died on July 26, 1892, and was initially interred at [[Graceland Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Graceland Cemetery]], beside his beloved wife Virginia Hewlett who had preceded him in death on December 14, 1889.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 December 1889|title=Mortuary Matters|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/135135955/|url-access=subscription|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Newspapers.com|publisher=Democrat and Chronicle|page=2|language=en}}</ref> This later changed with the closing of  Graceland Cemetery in 1894; the remains were exhumed and removed to [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the [[Benning Ridge]] section of Washington, D.C.

==Notes==
The following represents correspondence between Frederick Douglass jr., and District of Columbia Register of Deeds, [[Simon Wolf]]. It goes on to describe content of the cover letter accompanying his application for a Clerkship within that office.

''Yesterday Simon Wolf, Esq., the newly appointed register of deeds, received the following letter from Frederick Douglass, jr., a brother of Mr. [Charles] Douglass, at the Government office, (and not the “colored printer at the Government office,” as erroneously stated in the Star of yesterday.) The letter will be read with interest at this time:''

{{Quote
|text=Washington, D.C., May 21, 1869.

Simon Wolf, Esq., Register of Deeds:

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to request an appointment as clerk in the office of which you have the distinguished honor to be the head. I belong to that despised class which has not been known in the field of applicants for position under the Government heretofore. I served my country during the war, under the colors of Massachusetts, my own native State, and am the son of a man (Frederick Douglass) who was once held in a bondage protected by the laws of this nation; a nation, the perpetuity of which, with many others of my race, I struggled to maintain. I am by trade a printer, but in consequence of combinations entered into by printers’ unions throughout the country, I am unable to obtain employment at it. I therefore hope that you will give this, my application, the most favorable consideration.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK DOUGLASS, JR.
}}
''The following is the official reply:''

{{Quote
|text=RECORDER’S OFFICE

Washington, D.C., May 21, 1869.

Your application is before me, and has received favorable consideration. I see no reason in the world why you or your race should not have the full countenance in the struggle for progress and education, and I am particularly happy in being the means of encouraging you; for, as a descendant of a race equally maligned and prejudged, I have a feeling of common cause; and who can foresee but what the stone the builders reject may become the head stone of our political and social structure."

Very respectfully,

S. Wolf
