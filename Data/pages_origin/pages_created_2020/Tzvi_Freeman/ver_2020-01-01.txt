== Views ==
Freeman's views on the debate over the [[Who is a Jew?|definition of Jews and Judaism]] goes beyond the conventional theological stance of Orthodoxy, with Freeman stating that "Judaism is not a religion." Freeman calls the notion a "modern invention" and offers a Jewish mystical view of the Jews as a single soul or body formed of the collective of Jewish individuals, where the sin of one individual is in fact the sin of the collective. For Freeman, Judaism cannot be defined as a religion as that would imply a religion of seperate individuals.<ref>Gold, S. J. (2010). The role of the Jewish People on earth.

Freeman views the timing of the [[Bar and bat mitzvah]] rituals within Judaism as both biologically and existentially significant. The rituals, which takes place around the onset of puberty, are, according to Freeman, are also linked to the increase of "internal diologue" and "reflective consciousness" in the young adolescent which Freeman sees are a requirement for the newfound responsiblity of the bar and bat mitzvah initiate.<ref>Freeman, T. (2017). The Blossoming of Human Consciousness in Halakhah and Kabbalah. ''B'Or Ha'Torah'', Vol. ''24'', pp. 189-208.</ref>
