== Views ==
===Definition of Judaism===
Freeman's views on the debate over the [[Who is a Jew?|definition of Jews and Judaism]] goes beyond the conventional theological stance of Orthodoxy, with Freeman stating that "Judaism is not a religion." Freeman calls the notion a "modern invention" and offers a Jewish mystical view of the Jews as a single soul or body formed of the collective of Jewish individuals, where the sin of one individual is in fact the sin of the collective. For Freeman, Judaism cannot be defined as a religion as that would imply a faith and a practice of separate individuals.<ref>Gold, S. J. (2010). The role of the Jewish People on earth. Ivri: The Essence of Hebrew Spirituality.</ref><ref>{{cite web

|title=Because we are all one
|author=Tzvi Freeman
|website=www.chabad.org}}</ref> Similarly, although Freeman is a leading voice in the [[Chabad]] movement, he describes himself as an "unOrthodox rabbi," as he views [[Hasidism]] as a guide to the spiritual life.<ref name=jj19>{{cite web

===Antisemitism===
On the topic of antisemitism, Freeman argues that Orthodox communities must share their cultural wisdom with their non-Jewish neighbors which will enrich society in general and promote mutual respect and understanding for all communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/09/11/stop-picking-on-the-hasidim/|title=Stop Picking on the Chassidim|website=Algemeiner.com}}</ref>

===Bar and bat mitzvah===
Freeman views the timing of the [[bar and bat mitzvah]] rituals within Judaism as both biologically and existentially significant. The rituals, which takes place around the onset of puberty, are, according to Freeman, are also linked to the increase of "internal dialogue" and "reflective consciousness" in the young adolescent which Freeman sees as requirements for the newfound responsibilities associated with the bar and bat mitzvah initiation ritual.<ref>Freeman, T. (2017). The Blossoming of Human Consciousness in Halakhah and Kabbalah. ''B'Or Ha'Torah'', Vol. ''24'', pp. 189-208.</ref>
