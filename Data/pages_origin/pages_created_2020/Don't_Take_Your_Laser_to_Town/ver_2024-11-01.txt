==Reception==
In the April 1989 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #144), [[Jim Bambra]] called this a "fast-moving adventure that fairly rips along", but noted that "at times it moves too fast for its own good, with staging and GM tips suffering slightly in the process." Bambra thought it was "a fun supplement, but it lacks the unique charm which characterized earlier ''Paranoia'' adventures." He concluded, "While not first class, ''Don't Take Your Laser to Town'' will certainly keep your clones amused."<ref name=dragon144>{{cite journal|last=Rolston|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Rolston| date=April 1989 |title=Role-playing reviews |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=144|pages=45}}</ref>

In the 2007 book ''Designers & Dragons: The '80s'', Shannon Applecline commented that this was one of the final ''Paranoia'' adventures to do well commercially, saying, "Though some post-[[Ken Rolston|Rolston]] releases like the pre-crash ''Don't Take Your Laser to Town'' (1988) and the time travel ''Alice through the Mirrorshades'' did well commercially, the uneven humor of the early '90s and the metaplot issues would eventually doom the [''Paranoia''] line."<ref name="designers80s">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons: The '80s|publisher=[[Evil Hat Productions]]|year=2014| isbn=978-1-61317-081-6}}</ref>{{rp|255}}
