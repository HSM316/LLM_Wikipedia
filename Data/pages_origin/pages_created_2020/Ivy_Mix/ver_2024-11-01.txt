When Mix was nineteen, she was visiting [[Antigua Guatemala]]. She visited Café No Sé, where she tasted [[mezcal]] for the first time. She credits Café No Sé as introducing her to bar culture and bartending. At the bar, drinks were served on an [[honor system]], and Mix found herself indebted to the bar. She paid off her tab bartending. She began smuggling mezcal over the border from Mexico into [[Guatemala]].<ref name="Signer"/>

==Career==

In 2008, Mix left Guatemala and moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career in the arts. She worked at [[Gagosian Gallery]]. She despised the job, calling it the worst job she ever had.<ref name="Kamer"/><ref name="Signer"/> She wasn't skilled at crafting cocktails, despite her knowledge of mezcal. She applied for a bartending job at [[Mayahuel]] and was turned down, only to be hired as a cocktail waitress. She gained bartending skills at Mayahuel and also at Fort Defiance. During this time, Mix noticed the majority of her colleagues were men, especially in the budding [[speakeasy]] throwback culture. This inspired her to co-found [[Speed Rack]] with fellow bartender [[Lynnette Marrero]], giving female bartenders a space to be showcased while raising money for [[breast cancer]].<ref name="Signer"/>

Mix began working for [[Julie Reiner]], at Reiner's bars Lani Kai and Clover Club. Mix expressed to Reiner that she wanted to open a bar serving mezcal and Latin food. Reiner decided to invest in the bar and in 2015, Mix opened Leyenda in Brooklyn.<ref name="Signer"/> In 2019, Leyenda was nominated for a [[James Beard Award]] for outstanding bar program.<ref name="Reddicliffe"/>

===Style, cocktails and influences===

Mix's style is heavily influenced by her time in Latin America and the vibrant, colorful cocktails of [[tiki culture]].  One of Mix's signature cocktails is the Tia Mia, which she created when working at Lani Kai.  It is a variation on a [[Mai Tai]] containing mezcal, Jamaican rum, orgeat, lime, and curaçao.<ref name="Rothbaum"/> The Tia Mia is inspired by a woman she knew in Guatemala.<ref name="Kamer"/>

Two of Mix's favorite cocktail-oriented books are ''Flavor Bible'' and ''Flavor Thesaurus''.<ref name="Rothbaum">{{cite web |last1=Rothbaum |first1=Noah |title=Going 10 Rounds with Award-Winning Bartender Ivy Mix |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/going-10-rounds-with-award-winning-bartender-ivy-mix |website=The Daily Beast |accessdate=31 December 2019 |language=en |date=19 October 2017}}</ref> One of her favorite cocktails is the [[Irish Coffee]] at Fort Defiance in [[Red Hook, New York]].
