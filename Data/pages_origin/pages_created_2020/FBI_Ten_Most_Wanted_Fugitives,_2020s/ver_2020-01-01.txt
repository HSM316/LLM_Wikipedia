The '''FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives during the 2020s''' is a list, maintained for an eighth decade, of the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] of the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. At any given time, the FBI is actively searching for 12,000 fugitives.

The FBI in the past has identified individuals by the sequence number in which each individual has appeared on the list. Some individuals have even appeared twice, and often a sequence number was permanently assigned to an individual suspect who was soon caught, captured, or simply removed, before his or her appearance could be published on the publicly released list. In those cases, the public would see only gaps in the number sequence reported by the FBI. For convenient reference, the wanted suspect's sequence number and date of entry on the FBI list appear below, whenever possible.

The following [[fugitive]]s made up the top Ten list to begin the 2020s:
