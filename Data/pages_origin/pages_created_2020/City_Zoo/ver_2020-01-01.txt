The entire album arranges climaxes, and the rhythm is properly controlled. Adding experimental human voice effects in many places makes people appreciate the arrangement and lyrics of the arranger, and the symbol of animals, making the album more complete and interesting. Many music critics have pointed out that although there have been significant improvements in lyric writing, individual songs are still weak, and the album's idea integrity is slightly inferior.<ref name="critics 3">{{cite web|url= https://music.douban.com/review/12124644/|title= 失望，難過|work=豆瓣音樂}}</ref>
