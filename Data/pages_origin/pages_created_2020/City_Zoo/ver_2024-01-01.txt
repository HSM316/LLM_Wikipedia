The album ''City Zoo'' was generally well received after its release. Positive evaluations indicate that each song in the album has distinctive features, and in addition, the arrangement has also been well received.<ref name="critics 1">{{Cite web |last=Zi Han |title=用心聽，不是用嘴聽 |trans-title=Listen with your heart, not with your mouth  |url=https://music.douban.com/review/12125060/#comments |website=豆瓣音樂|access-date= 2023-03-29|archive-date= 2019-12-28|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191228110529/https://music.douban.com/review/12125060/#comments|url-status=live}}</ref> Some commented that this was a new peak of Chinese music,<ref name="critics 2">{{Cite web |title=現在的華語樂壇，這算是良心之作了 |trans-title=In the current Chinese music scene, this is considered a work of conscience |url=https://music.douban.com/review/12125669/ |website=豆瓣音樂 |access-date=2019-12-31 |archive-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228110447/https://music.douban.com/review/12125669/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> pointing out that G.E.M.'s used very spoken but profound music to show her struggling during this period of time and her 12 years of debut. The entire album arranges climaxes, and the rhythm is properly controlled. Adding experimental human voice effects in many places makes people appreciate the arrangement and lyrics of the arranger, and the symbol of animals, making the album more complete and interesting. Many music critics have pointed out that although there have been significant improvements in lyric writing, individual songs are still weak, and the album's idea integrity is slightly inferior.<ref name="critics 3">{{Cite web |title=失望，難過 |trans-title=Disappointed |url=https://music.douban.com/review/12124644/ |website=豆瓣音樂 |access-date=2019-12-31 |archive-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191228110450/https://music.douban.com/review/12124644/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
