''City Zoo'' is an album that fully realizes [[G.E.M.]]'s vision from the concept of the album from song to song creation, music production, visual creativity, and event planning and promotion. The album starts from the human nature she has experienced in the past, turning her observation and care into lyrics. Each song uses metaphorical methods to convey the status of interpersonal relationships or [[social phenomena]] through an animal image.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 26, 2019 |title=G.E.M.鄧紫棋新專輯《摩天動物園》發佈會 看盡人性百態更加堅定追夢 |trans-title=G.E.M.

The second track "Fly Away" is a very melancholy song, and the symbolic animal is [[owl]]. Through this song, [[G.E.M.]] hopes to express her inner struggle and desire to share the mood with others, not to hear from others consolation, the producer used a very complicated rhythm set with [[G.E.M.]] whispering and multi-segmentation, and some echo effects, successfully creating the effect of empty echoes in the forest.<ref name="Daniel Ku">{{Cite web |last=Ku |first=Daniel |date=December 28, 2019 |title=GEM鄧紫棋〈很久以後〉唱出失戀傷痛，「堅強就是能夠面對自己的脆弱」 |trans-title=GEM Deng Ziqi "Long Time Later" sang the sadness of broken love, "Strong means being able to face one's own fragility"  |url=https://www.vogue.com.tw/entertainment/article/gem-music-zoocity |website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]](Taiwan)}}</ref>

The third song "Selfless" symbolizes the animal as a [[chameleon]]. The song describes the state of being too fond of the other party and fascinates itself with the pulling state. When it is completely for the other party that it wants to sacrifice itself, in the end, it will only endure all the pain alone.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hao Jin Huang |date=December 27, 2019 |title=G.E.M.鄧紫棋《透明》挑戰《泡沫》？ 鄧氏苦情歌再添一員！ |trans-title=G.E.M.

The echo of the sound, more reveals the lingering blur and the sly hidden features of the wolf that the music wants to show.<ref name="Daniel Ku" /> The eighth track, "Miss Similar" symbolizes the animal as a [[peacock]], and describes this generation of imitation, giving birth to all kinds of strange ecology and humans.

She also hopes to use songs to encourage all those who stand at the crossroads of life and are confused about the future. Those who are in the middle of the authorities are confused and look up at the vast sky. No matter how hard the front is, it is right to face the challenge. It is not so difficult to draw a "full stop".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ku |first=Daniel |date=November 22, 2019 |title=鄧紫棋新歌《句號》，「對別人寬容就是對自己殘忍」 |trans-title=Deng Ziqi’s new song "Period", "Tolerant to others is to be cruel to yourself"  |url=https://www.vogue.com.tw/entertainment/article/gem%E9%84%A7%E7%B4%AB%E6%A3%8B-%E5%8F%A5%E8%99%9F-mv |website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]}}</ref> The last track of the album, "Still That Girl", which was also added later.

Many music critics have pointed out that although there have been significant improvements in lyric writing, individual songs are still weak, and the album's idea integrity is slightly inferior.<ref name="critics 3">{{Cite web |title=失望，難過 |trans-title=Disappointed  |url=https://music.douban.com/review/12124644/ |website=豆瓣音樂}}</ref>
