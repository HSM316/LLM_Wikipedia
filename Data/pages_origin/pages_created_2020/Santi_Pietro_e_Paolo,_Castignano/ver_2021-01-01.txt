'''Santi Pietro e Paolo''' is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Roman Catholic]] church located at Piazza San Pietro in the center of the town of [[Castignano]], in the [[province of Ascoli Piceno]], region of [[Marche]], Italy. 

== History and description ==
A church at the site is documented since the 11th century, but the present building was completed in the 14th-century. The rectangular brick facade with tall simple pilasters has a rose-window with 12 travertine marble columns as rays. The peaked central facade has terracotta sculptures depicting the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]]. 

The flanking [[bell tower]], visible from afar, is a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture of the early fourteenth century. The church houses a 15th-century fresco depicting the ''Madonna and Child with St Lucia''. The church has two aisles, with trussed roof, and flanked by baroque wooden altars and a wooden choir of six stalls, attributed to the 15th-century artist Apollonius of [[Ripatransone]]. 

The main altarpiece depicts ''Saints Peter and Paul with Castignano in background'' (18th century). The right wall has a 15th-century fresco depicting the [[Last Judgment]], in which an angel reads the books recording the lives of the judged and weighs souls in a balance before [[St Michael]]. At the right of Christ, the blessed are served by the angels, while on the left, the damned are tortured by devils. 

The sacristy has a museum displaying valuable works, such as a gilt-silver and bejeweled ''Reliquary of the Holy Cross'', commissioned in 1488 from [[Pietro Vannini]] by the Conventual Friars. The relics, putatively fragments of wood of the column on which Christ was scourged, were donated by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1288.<ref>[http://www.terredelpiceno.it/monumenti/chiesa-dei-ss-pietro-paolo-castignano/?lang=en Terre del Piceno], tourism website.</ref>
