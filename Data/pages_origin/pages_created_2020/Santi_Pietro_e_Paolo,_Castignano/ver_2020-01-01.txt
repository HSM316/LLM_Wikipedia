'''Santi Pietro e Paolo''' is a [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|gothic]]-style [[Roman Catholic]] church located at Piazza San Pietro in the center of the town of [[Castignano]], in the province of Ascoli Piceno, region of [[Marche]], Italy. 

== History and Description ==
A church at the site is documented since the 11th century; but the present building was completed by the 14th-century. The rectangular brick facade with tall simple pillasters has a rose-window with 12 travertine marble columns as rays. The peaked central facade has terracotta sculptures depicting the redeemer. 

The flanking ''bell tower'', visible from afar, is a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture of the early fourteenth century. The church houses a 15th-century fresco depicting the ''Madonna and Child with St Lucia''. The church has two aisles, with trussed roof, and flanked by baroque wooden altars and a wooden choir of six stalls, attributed to the 15th century artist Apollonius from [[Ripatransone]]. 

The main altarpiece depicts ''Saints Peter and Paul with Castignano in background'' (18th century). The right wall has a fresco depicting a 15th-century ''Final Judgment'': in which an Angel who reads the books of life of the judged and the weighs souls with the balance vefore [[St Michael]]. At the right of Christ, the “blessed” are served by the Angels, while on the left, the damned are tortured by devils. 

The sacristy has a museum displaying valuable works such as a gilt-silver and bejeweled ''Reliquary of the Holy Cross'', commissioned in 1488 from [[Pietro Vannini]] by the Conventual Friars. The relics, putatively fragments of wood of the column on which Christ was scourged, were donated by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1288.<ref>[http://www.terredelpiceno.it/monumenti/chiesa-dei-ss-pietro-paolo-castignano/?lang=en Terre del Piceno], tourism website.</ref>
