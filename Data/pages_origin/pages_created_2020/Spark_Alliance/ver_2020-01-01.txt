In November 2019, [[HSBC]] announced that it had given - in October of that year - a deposit account, "Prime Management Service Ltd.", 30 days to clear its funds out of the bank. The account had been used to raise funds for Spark Alliance, which HSBC said was in violation of its terms of service.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yu |first1=Cannix |title=HSBC to Close Corporate Account Being Used to Support Hong Kong Protesters through Crowdfunding |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038281/hsbc-close-corporate-account-being-used-support-hong-kong |accessdate=January 1, 2020 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> The decision led to HSBC subsequently becoming a target of protesters, with several of its branches being vandalized and an online petition organized calling for the United States to block the bank from doing business in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lo |first1=Alex |title=The Irony of Protesters Urging US Action Against HSBC |url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3043730/irony-protesters-urging-us-action-against-hsbc |accessdate=January 1, 2020 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=December 27, 2019}}</ref>
