The '''Spark Alliance''' (also known as '''Spark Alliance HK''') is an organisation or individual which finances bail payments for persons arrested in connection with the [[2019–2020 Hong Kong protests]]. According to donors and attorneys for the group its leadership is unknown.<ref name="star"/>

In November 2019, [[HSBC]] announced that it had given – in October of that year – a deposit account, "Prime Management Service Ltd.", 30 days to clear its funds out of the bank. The account had been used to raise funds for Spark Alliance, which HSBC said was in violation of its terms of service.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yu |first1=Cannix |title=HSBC to Close Corporate Account Being Used to Support Hong Kong Protesters through Crowdfunding |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038281/hsbc-close-corporate-account-being-used-support-hong-kong |accessdate=1 January 2020 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=19 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101173230/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038281/hsbc-close-corporate-account-being-used-support-hong-kong |archive-date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The decision led to HSBC subsequently becoming a target of protesters, with several of its branches being vandalised and an online petition organised calling for the United States to block the bank from doing business in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lo |first1=Alex |title=The Irony of Protesters Urging US Action Against HSBC |url=https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3043730/irony-protesters-urging-us-action-against-hsbc |accessdate=1 January 2020 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=27 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231185415/https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3043730/irony-protesters-urging-us-action-against-hsbc |archive-date=31 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
