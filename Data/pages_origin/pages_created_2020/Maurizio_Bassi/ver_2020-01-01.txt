==Career==
Not much is documented about Bassi other than he had released two solo singles/eps in both 1974 (Mau Bassi* / Vittorio Inzaina - Perchè Solo Noi / Welcome To Costa Smeralda ‎(7")) and 1981 (Arrivederci / Di Tutto Un Pop). He gained worldwide recognition with his Italian-based project, [[Baltimora]]. He formed it with both Naomi Hackett and [[Jimmy McShane]]. The Derry man apparently impressed Bassi with his good looks, flamboyance and dancing skills and was offered the job - and in the summer of 1985 the group's debut single Tarzan Boy, with its distinctive jungle call and bass-line heavy synths, became a huge international hit. Written by Bassi and Naimy Hackett, the track went top five around the world and, for a short time, Baltimora were international pop stars. Notable singles by the band include: [[Tarzan Boy]], [[Woody Boogie]], [[Living In The Background]] and [[Key Key Kambria]]. The most successful of the singles was [[Tarzan Boy]]. The band split in 1987, however in 1993. Bassi re-recorded and released Tarzan Boy as a remix which saw it used in many forms of media including [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] and [[Beverley Hills Cop Ninja]]. Bassi is said to have been the actual singer of the band but chose McShane to lip sync all the lyrics in the videos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://josefoshea.blogspot.com/2014/03/tarzan-boy-how-emergency-paramedic-from.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/108359-one-hit-wonder-baltimora-2496057533.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
