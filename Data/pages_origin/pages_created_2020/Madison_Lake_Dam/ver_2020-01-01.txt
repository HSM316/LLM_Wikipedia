'''Madison Lake Dam''' is a [[dam]] located on [[Deer Creek]], about {{conv|4|mi}} east of [[London, Ohio|London]] in [[Madison County]], [[Ohio]], at {{coord|39|51|57|N|83|22|33|W|display=inline}}.<ref>{{gnis|1078380}}</ref>

Madison Lake Dam was originally planned out when a piece of land was donated to the state on which to build a lake.  The Ohio Division of Conservation built a dam across Deer Creek, and the lake was filled by 1947.  In 1950, the newly created [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources|ODNR Division of Parks and Recreation]] took over the site, and it has since become part of the [[Madison Lake State Park]].<ref name=ODNR>[[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]].
