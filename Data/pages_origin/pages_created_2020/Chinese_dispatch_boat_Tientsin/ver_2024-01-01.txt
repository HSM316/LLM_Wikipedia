'''''Tientsin''''' ({{zh|t=天津|hp=Tiānjīn|l=[[Tianjin]]}}) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-made [[dispatch boat]] launched in 1863.

==History==
''Tientsin'' was ordered by [[Horatio Nelson Lay]], Inspector General of the [[Qing Dynasty]] [[Imperial Maritime Customs Service|Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as part of an effort to bolster the [[Qing Dynasty]] [[Imperial Chinese Navy|naval force]] in response to the ongoing [[Taiping Rebellion]].{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=7}}{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=16}} Thereafter she became part of the [[Horatio Nelson Lay#Lay-Osborn Flotilla|Lay-Osborn Flotilla]] commanded by [[Sherard Osborn]].{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=10}} She was put under the command of Captain Beville Granville Wyndham Nicolas.{{sfn|Davis}} Upon her arrival in China, the Qing government ordered the ship to be renamed as '''''San Wei''''' ({{zh|t=三衛|hp=Sānwèi}}).{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Chen|2002|p=142}}

Disagreements between the Qing government and Lay over the command and composition of the Lay-Osborn Flotilla led to its disbandment in 1863, and ''Tientsin'' returned to the United Kingdom. She was originally intended for sale, but an embargo on sales, due to the concurrent [[American Civil War]] and fear of the vessel joining the [[Confederate States Navy]], prevented any sales.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p=19}} When the American Civil War ended in 1865, she, along with ''[[Chinese gunboat China|China]]'' and ''[[Chinese gunboat Pekin|Pekin]]'', were sold in an auction to [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] on 30 December 1865 for £20,500.{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Chen|2002|p=142}}

===''Tientsin'' in the Guangdong Fleet===
A ''Tientsin'' with identical characteristics was part of the [[Guangdong Fleet]] c. 1867. Richard Wright speculated that ''Tientsin'' was eventually (or alternatively) acquired by the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service|Imperial Maritime Customs Service]] in Britain, 1868.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=19—20}} She was used as a customs cruiser at [[Guangdong|Canton]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1979|p=398}}
