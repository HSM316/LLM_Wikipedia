The '''Canadian Energy Centre (CEC)''', also known as the '''Canadian Energy Centre Limited (CECL)''', is a Calgary, Alberta-based private corporation launched on December 11, 2019 by the [[United Conservative Party]] government of Alberta, under Premier [[Jason Kenney]].<ref name="CBC_Heydari_20190607">{{Cite web| last = Heydari| first = Anis| title = Jason Kenney touts $30M 'war room' but provides few details| work = CBC News| access-date = October 27, 2019| date = June 7, 2019| url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jason-kenney-war-room-calgary-1.5167205}}</ref> The CEC's mandate is to improve Alberta's oil and gas sector reputation and to refute and rebut critics.<ref name="CP_20191009"/>

==Background==

The creation of a 'war room' capable of challenging "energy industry critics' inaccuracies" was an election promise made by then candidate Jason Kenney as part of his campaign leading up to the April 16 [[2019 Alberta general election]]. In the founding speech of the UCP on May 9, 2018, Kenney announced that he would engage in "national and international advocacy" including a "fully staffed rapid response war room in government to quickly and effectively rebut every lie told by the green left about our world-class energy industry. If companies like HSBC decide to boycott our oil sands, our government will boycott them. It's called a market decision."<ref name="UCP_20180509">{{Cite web| title = United Conservative Party| access-date = December 30, 2019 |date=May 9, 2018 | url = https://www.unitedconservative.ca/Article?name=AGM_Speech&id=e94b2b7a-dcf2-4092-b828-193c2e48c784}}</ref> Premier Kenney, whose [[United Conservative Party]] (UCP), won a majority of seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta Legislature]] announced the creation of Calgary-based $30 million "Energy War Room" in June 7, 2019 to "fight misinformation related to oil and gas".<ref name="CBC_Heydari_20190607"/>

On May 6, 2019 Nick Koolsbergen, who was the UCP's Alberta campaign manager for the winning election, announced the establishment of the Wellington Advocacy government relations firm with Harper & Associates' Rachel Curran. Both Koolsbergen and Curran had worked in the PMO of former Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What on earth is Stephen Harper up to?|first=Jason |last=Markusoff |date=July 12, 2018 | access-date = December 30, 2019|work=Macleans |url=https://www.macleans.ca/economy/what-on-earth-is-stephen-harper-up-to/}}</ref> According to a May 17, 2019 CBC article, the [[Postmedia Network|Postmedia]]contracted the Wellington Advocacy to "lobby" the UCP on "how it could be involved with" the new 'energy war room'.<ref name="CBC_Bellefontaine_20190517">{{Cite news| first = Michelle |last=Bellefontaine |work=CBC News| title = Postmedia hires former Kenney chief of staff to lobby on 'energy war room' | access-date = December 30, 2019 |date=May 17, 2019| url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/postmedia-hires-lobbyist-alberta-government-war-room-1.5140631 }}</ref>

In July 2019, Kenney announced the establishment of a one-year $2.5 million "Public inquiry into anti-Alberta energy campaigns" to investigate potential anti-Alberta energy campaigns.<ref name="GOV_AB_PI_FAQ">{{Cite web| title = FAQ |series= Public inquiry into anti-Alberta energy campaigns| access-date = September 12, 2019 | url = https://albertainquiry.ca/faq}}</ref><ref name="GOV_AB_PI">{{Cite web| title = Public inquiry into anti-Alberta energy campaigns |series=Anti-Energy campaigns| access-date = September 12, 2019| url = https://albertainquiry.ca/}}</ref> Kenney cited the work of "Vivian Krause", who has spent ten years examining foreign funding of Canadian environmental non-profit organizations (ENGOs) and who claimed that Alberta's interests were being "challenged by well-funded foreign actors who have been waging a decade-long campaign to land lock Alberta's oil."<ref name="UCP_press_release">{{Cite press release| title = Standing Up for Alberta, Fighting the Foreign-Funded Special Interests| work = [[United Conservative Party]] (UCP)| access-date = September 12, 2019| url = https://www.albertastrongandfree.ca/fighting-the-foreign-funded-special-interests/}}</ref> The public inquiry, which was officially established in July 2019 with a "mandate to investigate foreign-funded efforts", is led by the former board chair of the Calgary Economic Development—a forensic accountant—Steve Allan.<ref name="edmontonjournal_Clancy_20190909">{{Cite news| date = September 9, 2019| first = Clare |last=Clancy | title = Public inquiry into international campaigns related to energy launches website |newspaper= Edmonton Journal| access-date = September 12, 2019| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/public-inquiry-into-international-campaigns-related-to-energy-launches-website}}</ref> The inquiry will include interviews, research, and potentially, public hearings.<ref name="edmontonjournal_Clancy_20190909"/>

The Centre (CEC) was officially launched on December 11 by Premier Kenney at a press conference at the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] (SAIT).<ref name="CP_medicinehatnews_20191219a">{{Cite news| title = Logo a no go: Alberta energy war room to pull image belonging to U.S. company |first=Dean |last=Bennett| work =The Canadian Press via Medicine Hat News| access-date = December 21, 2019 |date=December 19, 2019| url = https://medicinehatnews.com/news/national-news/2019/12/19/logo-a-no-go-alberta-energy-war-room-to-pull-image-belonging-to-us-company/}}</ref>

==Mandate and description==
Its mandate is to "highlight achievements in Alberta's oil and gas sector" and to "refute what it deems to be misinformation about the industry."<ref name="CP_medicinehatnews_20191219a"/> Kenney said the centre will "counter misinformation" "coming from some environmental groups and others seeking to landlock Alberta's oil and gas".<ref name="CP_medicinehatnews_20191219a"/>

At the December 11 launch, Olsen described the Centre as a place to tell the story of the oil and gas industry in Alberta, which includes rebutting its critics respectfully.<ref name="medicinehatnews_20191211_Olsen">{{Cite news| title = Alberta premier says energy war room will be respectful as it takes on critics| work = Medicine Hat News| access-date = December 21, 2019 |date=December 11, 2019| url = https://medicinehatnews.com/news/national-news/2019/12/11/alberta-premier-says-energy-war-room-will-be-respectful-as-it-takes-on-critics/attachment/alberta-premier-says-energy-war-room-will-be-respectful-as-it-takes-on-critics/}}</ref><ref name="CP_medicinehatnews_20191219a"/>

===Funding===
The Canadian Energy Centre is funded by the Alberta provincial government with a budget of $30 million dollars. Post Media's ''Financial Post'' describes the CEC as an "Alberta government corporation partly funded by industry."<ref name="financialpost_Milke_20191219"/>

The Canadian Energy Centre Limited is a private corporation, which means that it is not subject to Alberta's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP Act).<ref name="CBC_Bellefontaine_20191010">{{Cite news| last = Bellefontaine| first = Michelle| title = Incorporation of Alberta's energy war room means much of its operations remain secret |work=CBC News| access-date = November 1, 2019| date = October 10, 2019| url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/canadian-energy-centre-freedom-of-information-rules-exemption-1.5317360}}</ref> Premier Kenney's press secretary Christine Myatt said that keeping CECL's internal operations secret is a "tactical and/or strategic advantage to the very foreign-funded special interests the CEC is looking to counter."<ref name="CBC_Bellefontaine_20191010"/>

In a December 18 rebuttal to the December 14 ''Medicine Hat News'' critical opinion piece, that said that the CEC was not "subject to freedom-of-information searches" and that the Centre "could be used to stifle legitimate dissent and commentary on the oil and gas industry", Olson, who is a former ''Calgary Herald'' journalist, said that "oversight" of the CEC is "rigorous" and that the centre is subject to the Fiscal Planning and Transparency Act, the Whistle Blowers Act and audits by Alberta's auditor general.<ref name="medicinehatnews_Olsen_20191218">{{Cite news| title = Guest Column: Canadian Energy Centre seeks to bring measured tone| work = Medicine Hat News| access-date = December 21, 2019 |date=December 18, 2019| url = https://medicinehatnews.com/commentary/opinions/2019/12/18/guest-column-canadian-energy-centre-seeks-to-bring-measured-tone/}}</ref> Olsen added that "campaigns to shut down new pipeline projects and damage the reputation of our oil and gas industry have received tens of millions of dollars from U.S. environmental foundations." This has resulted in the "landlocking of Alberta energy" which had resulted in the loss of jobs, "tens of billions of dollars" in capital, less money for public services, as well as "lower value for their shareholders that include many of the country’s biggest pension plans and investment funds."<ref name="medicinehatnews_Olsen_20191218"/>

In his CEC post, Grady Semmens responded to the December 27, 2019 opinion piece published in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' by [[Bill McKibben]], an American author and environmentalist, who called on Canada to go beyond cutting emissions to "stop digging up oil and gas and selling it around the world."<ref name="theglobeandmail_McKibbon_20191227">{{Cite news| last = McKibbon| first = Bill| title = In the 2020s, our climate-change bill will come due| work = The Globe and Mail| access-date = December 30, 2019 |date=December 27, 2019 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-in-the-2020s-our-climate-change-bill-will-come-due/}}</ref><ref name="CEC_Semmens_20191229">{{Cite web| title = A Matter of Fact| work = Canadian Energy Centre|first=Grady |last=Semmens| access-date = December 30, 2019 |date=December 29, 2019| url = https://www.canadianenergycentre.ca/a-matter-of-fact-2/}}</ref> Semmens said that Canada was only "responsible for less than 1.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions."
