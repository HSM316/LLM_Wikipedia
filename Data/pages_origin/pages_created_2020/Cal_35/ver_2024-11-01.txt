The '''Cal 35''' is an American [[sailboat]] that was designed by [[C. William Lapworth]] as a [[Cruising (maritime)|cruiser]] and first built in 1979.<ref name="Data">{{cite web|url = https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/cal-35-1979|title = Cal 35 (1979) sailboat |access-date = 31 December 2019|last= McArthur| first = Bruce |work = sailboatdata.com|year = 2019|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20191231170958/https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/cal-35-1979|archivedate =31 December 2019|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =https://sailboatdata.com/designer/lapworth-c-william|title = C.

The Cal 35 is sometimes confused with the earlier [[Cal 35 Cruise]] series of sailboats.<ref name="Data"/>

==Production==
The design was built by [[Cal Yachts]] in the [[United States]], but it is now out of production.<ref name="Data"/><ref name="Sherwood"/><ref>{{cite web|url =https://sailboatdata.com/builder/jensen-marinecal-boats|title = Jensen Marine/Cal Boats|access-date = 31 December 2019|last= McArthur| first = Bruce |work = sailboatdata.com|year = 2019|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190523191823/https://sailboatdata.com/builder/jensen-marinecal-boats|archivedate =23 May 2019|url-status= live}}</ref>

==Design==
The Cal 35 is a recreational [[keelboat]], built predominantly of [[fiberglass]] sandwich construction, with wood trim. It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig with [[aluminium]] spars, a [[raked stem]], a [[reverse transom]], an internally mounted spade-type [[rudder]] controlled by a [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed fin [[keel]]. It displaces {{convert|13000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|5200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of ballast.<ref name="Data"/><ref name="Sherwood"/>

The boat has a draft of {{convert|5.00|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard keel and {{convert|6.00|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the optional deep draft keel.<ref name="Data"/>

The boat is fitted with a Universal [[diesel engine]] of {{convert|32|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds {{convert|33|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|90|u.s.gal}}.<ref name="Data"/>

Ventilation consists of four opening ports in the main cabin, plus two in the bow cabin. There is a [[dorade vent]] over the [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. There are also four fixed ports in the main cabin, plus fixed, flush-mounted deadlights over the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] and the forward berths.<ref name="Sherwood"/>

The [[mainsail]] is [[Sheet (sailing)|sheeted]] to a [[mainsheet traveler]] on the cabin roof. The [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] is sheeted to tracks and is controlled with two-speed winches. There are two [[halyard]] winches. The mainsail [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] has a [[topping lift]] and two internal reefs, an internal [[outhaul]] and a [[boom vang]] with a 4:1 mechanical advantage.<ref name="Sherwood"/>

The design has a [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet|PHRF]] racing average handicap of 136.<ref name="Sherwood"/>
