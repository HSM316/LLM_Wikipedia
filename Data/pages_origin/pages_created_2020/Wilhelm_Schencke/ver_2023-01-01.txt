==Biography==
Schencke was born at  Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. 
He was the son of the architect Friedrich Wilhelm Schencke (1832–1896) and Marie Edvardine Bøhm (1848–?).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Saphinaz-Amal Naguib |editor1-last=Hjelde |editor1-first=Sigurd |title=Man, Meaning, and Mystery: 100 Years of History of Religions in Norway; The Heritage of W.

Schencke received a theology degree in 1894 at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]] but he chose to not become a priest.<ref name="Ruud">{{cite book |author1=Inger Marie Ruud |author2=Sigurd Hjelde |editor1-last=Ruud |editor1-first=Inger Marie |editor2-last=Hjelde |editor2-first=Sigurd |title=Enhet i mangfold?: 100 år med religionshistorie i Norge |date=1998 |publisher=Tano |location=Oslo |pages=285–288 |chapter=100 år med religionshistorie i Norge}}</ref> Theological dogmatism did not appeal to him, but he had a strong interest in [[Old Testament]] studies. After graduating, he studied religious history, Egyptology, and Semitic languages in Germany.<ref name="Ruud"/>

In 1896, Schencke applied for a professorship in Old Testament theology, but he felt obliged to withdraw his application because another applicant was already determined to obtain the position.<ref name="Ruud"/> In 1901, he was offered a stipend for doctoral study in "religious studies" by [[William Brede Kristensen]]. Schencke later changed the position of the title to "history of religion."<ref name="Ruud"/> On March 24, 1904, he defended his dissertation ''Amon-Re. En studie over forholdet mellem enhed og mangfoldighed under udviklingen af det ægyptiske gudsbegreb'' ([[Amun|Amon-Re]]: A Study of the Relationship between Unity and Diversity during the Development of the Egyptian Concept of God).

At the University of Kristiania, Schencke lectured on topics including [[Judaism]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]], the [[Quran]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], [[Luqman]]'s fables, primitive religion, ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'' (a Gnostic text), and the [[Parsis]] in Europe. In addition, he taught [[Arabic grammar]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Aramaic]].<ref name="Ruud"/> Most of his lectures had a small number of students, but lectures on more popular topics could have as many as 250 listeners.

In 1913, Schencke openly declared his opposition to the Faculty of Theology when he wrote an article for the newspaper ''[[Tidens Tegn]]'' entitled "Det teologiske fakultet bør sløifes" (The Faculty of Theology Should Be Abolished).<ref name="Halden">{{cite journal |last1=Halden |first1=Sissel |title=Professor Schenke [sic] og Teologene |journal=Chaos: Dansk-norsk Tidsskrift for Religionshistoriske Studier |date=1999 |volume=32 |pages=79, 85 |publisher=Institut for religionshistorie |location=Copenhagen}}</ref>

On July 1, 1914, Schencke was named Norway's first professor of religious history.<ref name="Ruud"/> The professorship was assigned to the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the university. One of the reasons for this was that Schencke had many opponents at the Faculty of Theology because of his pronounced agnosticism. Schencke fell seriously ill in 1919 and suffered from long periods of illnesses in the following years.<ref name="Ruud"/> He retired as a professor on August 1, 1939. The only fellowship recipient that studied under him was [[Albert Brock-Utne]],<ref name="Junginger"/> who lectured on religious studies after Schencke's departure in 1939. [[Georg Johan Sverdrup]] assumed Schencke's professorship after the Second World War.<ref name="Hjelde"/><ref name="Halden"/><ref name="Junginger">{{cite book |author1=Horst Junginger |editor1-last=Junginger |editor1-first=Horst |title=The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism |url=https://archive.org/details/studyreligionund00jung_249 |url-access=limited |date=2008 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |page=[https://archive.org/details/studyreligionund00jung_249/page/n89 71] |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

As a professor emeritus, Schencke lectured on the Quran and Egyptian texts. Schencke prepared the first translation of the Quran into Norwegian (over 30 years before Einar Berg's translation, published in 1980).<ref name="Tittel">{{cite news |title=Tittel: Koranen.
