==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=December 2023}}
The story revolves around a group of high-spirited friends who help, support, and enjoy one another's company as they overcome hardships in their lives.

Four friends, Saad, Shahzain, Shariq and Shehryar call themselves the SSG (Special 'S' Gang because all their names start with the letter 'S'). They all study at Lawrence College in Murree. Saad's family consists of his father Brigadier (later Major General) Faraz Inam who serves in the army, his mother, and sister Rahmeen who is an aspiring artist. Shahzain belongs to a rich village family and is the closest to his grandfather, Malik Allahyar. Shariq's family consists of his sister, Ghazala and his widowed mother. Shehryar's father is a bandmaster. They often bunk hostel together at night and got caught by their hostel warden Firdous Baig once.

On the other hand, there are Dua and Rani. Rani is a vivacious girl, who comes from a rich village family. After three years, she is yet to pass her Intermediate exams, which she ultimately doesn't. Dua comes from Rawalpindi and is seen visiting her cousins, Aisha and Raheel in Murree. Raheel is obnoxious and is over-protective of Dua, which she immensely dislikes and tries to avoid him.

Despite receiving warnings from the headmaster of the college, the SSG still bunk college and this time, they accidentally run into Dua and her cousins. Saad immediately recognizes Dua, while Shariq and Shehryar run away from the scene. Saad tells Shahzain that he had seen Dua twice before and has a crush on her but he didn't have the courage to tell her about his feelings. Shahzain encourages Saad to go after her and get to know her name since he didn't. They follow her and eventually get to know her name.

The next day, they meet Dua again after Shariq spots her with her cousins and tells the other three, who immediately rush to her. As Shahzain and Shehryar begin to introduce themselves to Dua and tell her about Saad, Raheel pushes Saad, thinking he was harassing Dua and a physical fight follows. The police arrive and take Saad and Raheel into custody, while Shahzain and Shehryar flee, and are later joined by Shariq.

Dua's parents file a complaint against Saad, in the name of harassment. This causes a rift between the SSG. Shariq refuses to be involved in their tactics anymore. Saad slaps Shahzain, because he made a fuss in front of Dua. In the end, Saad, Shahzain and Shehryar are rusticated from the hostel. Since Shariq wasn't directly involved in the incident, no action is taken against him.

The four friends now go on to lead their separate lives. Shahzain doesn't show up for his exams and slowly transforms into an angry young man. Saad is confused between choosing Army or Medical as his profession but ultimately joins army after finding Dua submitting her application at the same medical college. Later they meet at a park where Dua softens up when she overhears him scolding his pet Zorro for chasing her.

Shahzain and Shehryar then visit Saad, wanting to reconcile but Saad humiliates the two and asks them to leave. Saad later departs for PMA (Pakistan Military Academy). Upon arriving at PMA, Saad meets Gulzar Hussain and develops a good friendship with him.

On the other hand, Shahzain decides to marry Dua as a revenge on Saad. 
However Dua's parents reject his proposal. Shehryar confronts Shahzain and stops him from marrying Dua, and makes him realize his mistakes. Then Shahzain, Saad, Shariq, Shehryar meet to sort out all misunderstandings. But learning that Shahzain went to Dua's house, Saad confronts him. Shahzain feels humiliated again. His marriage is fixed with Rani. He only invites Shariq and Shehryar to his wedding but when he overhears the two talking about Saad, it angers him. Shariq and Shehryar leave realizing that Shahzain only viewed them as commodities and not friends.

In their next meeting Saad and Dua are confronted by Raheel (Dua's cousin). Dua walks off angrily and goes home. Raheel proposes to Dua for marriage but she refuses and tells her father to trust her that Saad is just a friend. She then tells Saad she won't contact him until they both establish their careers. Raheel's parents then invite Dua's parents and insist on their marriage but Dua's father refuses. On the way home, Dua's parents meet with an accident. Dua's father passes away and her mother becomes disabled. Her cousin blackmails her into marrying him as he finds out she is adopted. Dua agrees but then exposes him in front of his parents. Dua and her mother shift to Abbottabad to live near her medical college. Saad is shown to pass out of PMA with a sword of honour. Later he finds out about Dua's father.

Shahzain is shown to be contesting in the by-elections. Shariq's [[YouTube]] channel has been so well established that he is offered a job as a news anchor at a well-established channel. He accepts the job after declining at first and selects Ramsha (a former news reporter who became friends with him) as producer of his show.

Shahzain wins his elections and becomes an MNA. Shariq achieves success as a news anchor. After passing out from PMA, Saad starts his army duties and visits Dua. He helps Dua in setting up her new home. They grow closer to each other and eventually meet each other's parents. Saad starts planning his wedding and bumps into Shahzain while completing a wedding-related task. They confront each other and eventually reconcile.

Meanwhile, Shehryar is appointed as an Assistant Commissioner and works with Shariq to help free one of their college friends who has been wrongly imprisoned due to a mafia gang. Shariq and Shehryar manage to successfully free him. All the four friends get together for Saad's wedding and are seen teasing Saad. On the night of the wedding, it is revealed that Dua has been appointed as an army doctor and walks down the aisle in her uniform leaving Saad in awe.

Later, Shahzain is attacked by his presumed rivals. Saad, on the other hand, is appointed in LOC Kashmir. Dua informs him that she is pregnant. Shahzain wins the elections but Shehreyar is suspicious. He confronts Shahzain on learning that he staged Choudhary Vakar(Rani's brother) for his attempted murder to win the elections. Shariq and Ramsha are going to marry each other. Shariq advises Shehryar to go to Masooma and apologize to her for his behavior. Shahzain apologizes to Rani, his grandfather and Shehryar. Rani tells him that she is pregnant.

Due to high alert on LOC all four boys stand up for their country. Shahzain went on a live show of India. Shariq covers media and tells all of Pakistan about the problems at LOC. Shehryar tells people to go away from LOC. Saad is given an operation to retrieve an injured soldier from the battleground. He is eventually shot in process but manages to complete his mission. He is then taken to the hospital where he recovers. At the end all friends visit their College and advise the students on how to serve the country through various fields of opportunities.

===Critical reception===
Reviewing of initial episodes for ''[[Youline Magazine]]'', the reviewer praised the chemistry of the stars and execution of the serial stating, "Each character’s individual personality comes across as fully developed from the first episode. Their hilarious first scene lets their chemistry shine through, and propels the audience into the world of the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG), one of the most otherwise secretive sections of the Army".

Sheeba Khan of ''[[Express Tribune]]'' praised the performances of male protagonists stating, "OKB is brilliant and has excellent comedic timing…add to that his expressions while speaking and you will can’t find one fault in his acting. Ahmed Ali, Ahad Raza Mir, and Wahaj Ali are equally great. What’s even better is their chemistry. When you watch them on screen, it doesn’t seem like they are acting. They are all very natural and their personalities really gel.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2068720/ehd-e-wafa-newest-drama-block|title=Ehd-e-Wafa: The newest drama on the block|publisher=[[Express Tribune]]|access-date=March 17, 2021|date=September 30, 2019|first=Sheeba|last=Khan|archive-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211017204039/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2068720/ehd-e-wafa-newest-drama-block|url-status=live}}</ref>

While reviewing for ''[[Daily Times Pakistan|Daily Times]]'', Muhammad Ali praised the writing of the serial, especially the characters' development and their journey and said it "A Treat for Youngsters".

While reviewing finale of the serial, Buraq Shabbir wrote for ''[[The News International|The News]]'', "''Ehd e Wafa'' stood out for tackling an unusual genre, with male protagonists, their struggle and friendship being the highlight of the drama. Besides, the women in their lives, essayed by [[Hajra Yamin]], [[Alizeh Shah]], Zara Noor Abbas and [[Momina Iqbal]], played small yet substantial roles that had impact on their male counterparts. Despite a males-centric plot, it was refreshing to see most of these women having a professional life and contributing to society, unlike most other Pakistani dramas."
