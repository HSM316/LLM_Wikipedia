'''''Tanaorhamphus''''' is a [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus of [[acanthocephala]]ns (thorny-headed or spiny-headed [[Parasitism|parasitic]] worms) containing a single species, '''''Tanaorhamphus longirostris''''', that infests animals.

==Taxonomy==
The species was described by Van Cleave in 1913 but under the ''Neorhynchus'' genus.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Cleave|first=H. J.|journal=Zoologischer Anzeiger|year=1913|title=4.

==Description==

''T. longirostris'' consists of a proboscis covered in hooks, a proboscis receptacle, and a long trunk.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

==Distribution==
The distribution of ''T. longirostris'' is determined by that of its hosts.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

The life cycle of an acanthocephalan consists of three stages beginning when an infective acanthor (development of an egg) is released from the intestines of the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|definitive host]] and then ingested by an arthropod, the [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|intermediate host]]. Although the intermediate hosts of ''Tanaorhamphus'' are ???. When the acanthor [[molt]]s, the second stage called the acanthella begins. This stage involves penetrating the wall of the [[mesenteron]] or the intestine of the intermediate host and growing. The final stage is the infective cystacanth which is the [[larva]]l or juvenile state of an Acanthocephalan, differing from the adult only in size and stage of sexual development. The cystacanths within the intermediate hosts are consumed by the definitive host, usually attaching to the walls of the intestines, and as adults they reproduce sexually in the intestines. The acanthor are passed in the [[feces]] of the definitive host and the cycle repeats. There may be [[Host_(biology)#Types_of_hosts|paratenic hosts]] (hosts where parasites infest but do not undergo larval development or sexual reproduction) for ''Tanaorhamphus''.<ref>{{cite book
