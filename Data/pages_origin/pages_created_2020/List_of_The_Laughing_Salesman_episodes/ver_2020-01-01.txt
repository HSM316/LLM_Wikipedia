The first animated series was produced by [[Shin-Ei Animation]] and commenced screening on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] on 17 October 1989 and extended for three seasons with a total of 112 episodes which included 9 specials. The series was directed by [[Yoshitomo Yonetani]] with scripts by Yasuo Tanami and music by [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kōhei Tanaka]].

The series began with a short 4 minute prologue and each episode is 10 minutes in length.

The names of the characters in the summaries are written in the [[Surname#Order_of_names|Japanese order]] with "surname" or "upper name" ({{Nihongo||上の名前|ue-no-namae}}) then "first name" because the order is significant to obtain the alternate meaning or reference when both names are read aloud.
