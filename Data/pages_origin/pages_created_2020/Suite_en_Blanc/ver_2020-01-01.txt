{{italic title}}
'''''Suite en Blanc''''', later retitled '''''Noir et Blanc''''', is a [[ballet]] choreographed by [[Serge Lifar]] to music from [[Édouard Lalo]]'s suite ''[[List of compositions by Édouard Lalo|Namouna]]''. The first performance, by the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], took place on 19 June 1943 in Zurich. The original costumes were all white, whence the title ("Suite in White"), but in subsequent productions the male dancers wore black and the title was changed to reflect this ("Black and White").<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Dance'', p.431</ref><ref>[https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/how-suite-it-is Australian Ballet: Suite en Blanc]</ref><!--add duel-->
