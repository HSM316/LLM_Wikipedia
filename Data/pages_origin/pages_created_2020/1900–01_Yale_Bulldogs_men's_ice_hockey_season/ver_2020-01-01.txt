The '''1900–01 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season''' was the 6th season of play for the program. 

==Season==
For the third consecutive season, Yale was declared Intercollegiate Hockey League champions. Harvard, who finished the season undefeated, played only three games, allowing the Elis to retain their title despite suffering two losses in intercollegiate play.

The team did not have a coach, however, W.J. Hoysradt served as team manager.
