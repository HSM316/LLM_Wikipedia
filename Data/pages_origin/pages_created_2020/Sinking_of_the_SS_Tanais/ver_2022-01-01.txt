'''SS ''Tanais''''' ({{lang-el|Τάναϊς}}), mistakenly referred to as '''Danae''' or '''Danais''' (Δανάη / Δαναΐς), was a British-built, Greek-owned cargo ship that [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation forces in Greece]] requisitioned in [[World War II|WWII]]. In 1944 a [[Royal Navy]] submarine sank her off [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]], killing several hundred [[Deportation|deported]] Cretan Jews, Cretan Christian civilians and Italian [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s aboard. Sources differ as to the number killed; estimates vary between 425 and 1,000.<ref name=Spector>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust |first=Shmuel |last=Spector |year=2001 |volume=I: A–J |publisher=Yad Vashem; New York University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA282 |isbn=0814793762 |page=282}}</ref>

==The ship==
John Blumer and Co Ltd of [[Sunderland]], [[England]] built the ship as '''''Holywood''''' for William France, Fenwick and Company of London. She was launched on 14 December 1906 and completed in January 1907.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sunderlandships.com/view.php?year_built=&builder=&ref=101855&vessel=HOLYWOOD |title=Holywood |work=Sunderland Built Ships |publisher=North East Maritime Forum |accessdate=12 November 2020}}</ref> She was a [[Cargo ship|cargo]] [[steamship]], and France, Fenwick operated her in the [[tramp trade]].

A Greek shipowner, Stefanos Synodinos, bought her in 1935, renamed her ''Tanais''<ref>{{cite book |url= https://plimsoll.southampton.gov.uk/shipdata/pdfs/36/36b0822.pdf |year=1936 |title=Lloyd's Register |chapter=Steamers & Motorships |volume=II |place=London |publisher=Lloyd's Register |via=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=11 November 2020}}</ref> after the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Tanais]] in the [[Don (river)|Don]] delta and registered her in [[Port of Piraeus|Piraeus]].

On 26 May 1941 during the [[Battle of Crete]] the [[Luftwaffe]] sank ''Tanais'' in [[Souda Bay]]. She was raised, repaired and taken over by {{ill|Mittelmeer-Reederei|de}} (MMR), a company controlled by the [[Government of Nazi Germany|German government]] that operated merchant ships in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre of the war]]. MMR used her to carry cargo and people between the [[Aegean Islands]] and Greek mainland.<ref name=HMA>{{cite web |url= https://www.historisches-marinearchiv.de/projekte/verluste_griechenland/ausgabe.php?where_value=466 |title=Tanais |work=Griechische Schiffsverluste |publisher=Das Historische Marinearchiv |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wlb-stuttgart.de/seekrieg/km/mittelmeer/italien/mmr.htm |title=Deutsche Mittelmeer-Reederei 1943–1944, Schiffe über 1000 BRT |work=Mittelmeer-Reederei |publisher=Württembergische Landesbibliothek |date=21 February 2016 |language=de}}</ref>

On late 8 or early 9 June 1944 ''Tanais'', escorted by the [[Submarine chaser|submarine hunter]] ''UJ 2142'' and [[guard ship]]s ''GK 05'' and ''GK 06'', sailed from [[Heraklion]] bound for [[Port of Piraeus|Piraeus]].<ref name=Helgason>{{cite web |url= https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3595.html |last=Helgason |first=Guðmundur |title=HMS Vivid (P 77) |work=Uboat.net}}</ref> In her [[Hold (compartment)|holds]] were three groups of prisoners: about 265 Jews deported from [[Chania]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wlb-stuttgart.de/seekrieg/44-06.htm |title=1944 Juni |work=Chronik des Seekrieges 1939–1945 |publisher=Württembergische Landesbibliothek |date=15 March 2019 |language=de}}</ref> who had been rounded up a few days before, up to 400 Cretan [[gentile]]s linked with the [[Cretan resistance]], and between 100 and 300 pro-[[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who had been arrested after the [[Armistice of Cassibile]].<ref name=Spector/> Sources differ as to the numbers of Cretan and Italian prisoners.
