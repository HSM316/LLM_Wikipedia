{{short description|Greek-owned cargo ship}}
'''SS ''Tanais''''' ({{lang-el|Τάναϊς}}), mistakenly referred to as '''Danae''' / '''Danais''' (Δανάη / Δαναΐς), was a Greek-owned cargo ship that was requisitioned by the [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation forces]] in Greece during [[World War II|WWII]].
On 9 June 1944, she was torpedoed by a [[Royal Navy]] submarine and sunk off the port of [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]], killing several hundreds of [[Deportation|deported]] Cretan Jews, Cretan Christian civilians and Italian [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s who were aboard. The number of casualties varies depending on source; it is estimated that between 500 and 1000 perished.<ref name="JEncyclopedia">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J |first=Shmuel|last=Spector|year=2001|volume=I|publisher=Yad Vashem; NYU Press|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA282|isbn=0814793762| page=282}}</ref>

==The vessel==
Tanais was a 244 ft, {{GRT|1,545|disp=adj}} cargo steamer built in 1907 by [[J. Blumer & Company|J. Blumer & Co]] at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[England]]. Initially named '''''Holywood''''', she was purchased in 1935 by Greek shipowner Stefanos Synodinos and renamed '''''[[Tanais]]''''' after an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city in the [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]] delta.

During the [[Battle of Crete]], on 26 May 1941, Tanais was sunk by the [[Luftwaffe]] in [[Souda Bay]]. After being repaired, she was commissioned by the Germans to carry cargo and people from the mainland and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean islands]].

==The sinking==
On late 8 or early 9 June 1944, Tanais sailed with a crew of 12 from [[Heraklion]] bound for [[Port of Piraeus|Piraeus]], escorted by three smaller vessels. Detained in the [[Hold (compartment)|holds]] of Tanais were about 265 deported Jews from [[Chania]] who have been rounded up a few days before. There were also several hundreds of Christian Cretan civilians having links with the [[Cretan resistance|resistance]] along with pro-[[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] Italian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who had been arrested after the [[Armistice of Cassibile]].<ref name="JEncyclopedia"></ref> The exact numbers of Cretan and Italian prisoners vary from source to source. Presumably, the prisoners were being transported to [[Nazi concentration camps]].

In the morning hours of 9 June, 14 mi. northwest of [[Dia (island)|Dia]] islet (exact position 35°40'N, 25°11'E), she was spotted by the British submarine [[HMS Vivid (P77)|HMS Vivid]]. The submarine fired four torpedoes two of which hit Tanais that sunk in a very short time.<ref>[https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?243647 'SS Tanais (Vivid)'', Wrecksite, 24 December 2018]</ref><ref name="Kriegsmarine">{{cite book |title=The Last Year of the Kriegsmarine: May 1944 - May 1945|first=V.E.|last=Tarrant|year=1994|publisher=Naval Institute Press|url=|isbn=1557505101|page=117}}</ref>
The exact number of victims is unknown, nevertheless it is believed that all prisoners aboard Tanais perished.

Whether the British submarine was aware of the human cargo onboard Tanais has been the subject of debate and is still unclear today.
