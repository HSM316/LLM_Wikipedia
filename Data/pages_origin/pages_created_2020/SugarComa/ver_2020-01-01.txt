'''Sugarcoma''' (commonly stylised as '''SugarComa''') were a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[alternative metal]] band from London, who were active between 1999 and 2004. They were founded by vocalist and lyricist Jessica Mayers, bassist Heidi Fisk, drummer James Cuthbert and guitarist Claire Simson. SugarComa released one studio album, Becoming Something Else, in August 2002. They reunited for a one-off reunion show in October 2013.

==History==
===Early career===
In March 1999 the band formed when vocalist Jess Mayers joined forces with guitarist Claire Simson, who had previously played in a band called Little Green Pants. Simson's childhood friend James Cuthbert joined as a drummer, while Heidi McEwen (later Fisk) became the bass player. The four members were all teenage pupils at [[St Edward's Church of England Academy]] and they recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] using the school's facilities.<ref name="lfm">{{cite web |title=Biography |url=https://www.last.fm/music/SugarComa/+wiki |publisher=[[Last.fm]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="am">{{cite web |last1=Torreano |first1=Bradley |title=Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sugarcoma-mn0000581509/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> 

The band was named after a [[Hole (band)|Hole]] song.<ref>{{cite news |title=Single Review Blisters EP |url=http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=1 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Music Week]] |date=12 August 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030902185717/http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=1 |archivedate=2 September 2003}}</ref><ref group="note">An early incarnation of the ''Boys on the Radio'' track from ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' had been titled ''Sugar Coma''.

Love said: "It denotes the end of a cycle. Something deadly." She added, ominously: "If executives like it, you know it's bad."</ref> They played their first [[Gig (music)|gig]] at The Walthamstow Standard, supporting a [[Metallica]] tribute act.<ref name="lfm" />

===Velocity Recordings===
The band started sending their demo out and, as they did so in [[alphabetical order]], the first [[record label]] to show interest was the first to receive the tape, Abuse Records.<ref name=dis /> [[Music executive]] Sid Siddle had started a music [[fanzine]] called Abuse and then a record label with the same name. He later established a business relationship with [[Tony Defries]]' [[Talent manager|management company]] MainMan and changed the name of his label to Velocity Recordings. Defries had engaged Siddle's services to help find him a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[All-female band|girl band]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Eden Music PR/Velocity Recordings News |url=http://www.mi2n.com/print.php3?id=139518 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Music Industry News Network |date=3 July 2011}}</ref>

After attending the band's performance at The Walthamstow Standard,<ref name="lfm" /> Siddle agreed to fund and market their first [[Single (music)|single]].<ref name="tbt" /> With [[Iestyn Polson]] as [[Record producer|producer]], the band recorded an [[Extended play|EP]] called "Blisters" which was released on Velocity Recordings in August 2000.<ref name="lfm" />

"Blisters" was named Single of the Week in both ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[Kerrang!]]''<ref>{{cite news |title=The Session: Soundtracks |url=https://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/music/the-session-soundtracks-4239742 |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[Reading Post]] |date=16 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mickey |first1=Metal |title=Sugarcoma twice as nice as Spice! |url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/6626253.sugarcoma-twice-nice-spice/ |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[Oxford Mail]] |date=16 November 2000}}</ref> ''Melody Maker'''s guest reviewer [[Lauren Laverne]] was effusive in her praise: "This is fantastic.

As the band members were [[Minor (law)|minors]] they were unable to sign a formal [[recording contract]] without [[parental consent]]. Their parents called in lawyers who advised against signing the Velocity Recordings/MainMan contract, aspects of which fell below the industry standard.<ref name="tbt">{{cite news |last1=Ives |first1=Martin |title=#TBT – What ever happened to SugarComa?? |url=http://www.schpunk.co.uk/tbt-what-ever-happened-to-sugarcoma/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Waffle Mag |date=9 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524104909/http://www.schpunk.co.uk/tbt-what-ever-happened-to-sugarcoma/ |archivedate=24 May 2015}}</ref>

===Music for Nations===

A degree of [[marketing buzz]] surrounded the band as they continued to play small venues. They recorded a [[BBC Radio 1]] Evening Session and were played on the radio by [[John Peel]] and [[Steve Lamacq]].<ref name="tbt" /> [[Samantha Fox]] attended one gig,<ref name="tbt" /> while ''[[Metal Hammer]]'''s review of a November 2000 performance at the Pack Horse in Manchester described the scene: "This tiny pub rammed to the rafters with more [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men than you can shake a suitably large stick at... must be time for SugarComa then! After fighting their way through the veritable sea of industry types to get to the stage, the diminutive London-based foursome let rip with their awesome brand of [[post-grunge]] [[nu metal]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Live Review Manchester Pack Horse (MH In The City) |url=http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=12 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=1 November 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030905043304/http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=12 |archivedate=5 September 2003}}</ref> 

In December 2000 the band were announced as the [[Opening act|support act]] for [[My Ruin]] on their 2001 UK [[concert tour]]. They impressed My Ruin's volatile singer [[Tairrie B]] and moved up the billing when original main support act [[Snake River Conspiracy]] pulled out.<ref>{{cite news |last1=of S-B-S |first1=Fedja |title=My Ruin - Interview with Tairrie B and Mick Murphy |url=http://sbs666.tripod.com/myruinint2nov.htm |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Strength Beyond Strength |date=2 November 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=My Ruin: Interview at the London Highbury Garage W/ Tairrie & Mick- December 7th 2000 Supported by SugarComa |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band2/myruin/other.html |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=My Ruin |date=7 December 2000}}</ref> In early 2001 they secured their biggest gig so far, supporting [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] at the [[London Astoria]] alongside [[earthtone9]]. They then played a few dates with [[Guano Apes]] before returning to the [[Recording studio|studio]] to work on writing their debut album.<ref name="lfm" />

In spring 2001 they signed with the [[Music for Nations]] label and set to work on another EP, "What Goes Around", with [[Colin Richardson]], an experienced heavy metal producer. The rest of 2001 was predominantly taken up with writing and rehearsing new material for the forthcoming album. This was punctuated by a week-long holiday to [[Majorca]], which inspired subsequent album tracks "Shots", "Last Orders" and "Lost Morning".<ref name="lfm" />

In April 2002 the band [[Headliner (performances)|headlined]] a UK tour for the first time, supported by Music for Nations label mates [[InMe]].<ref name="tour02">{{cite news |title=SugarComa Headlining UK Tour Announced |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-headlining-uk-tour-announced/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=28 February 2002}}</ref> They documented their progress in a Tour Diary feature written for ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Simson |first1=Claire |title=Sugarcoma Tour Diary (Part 3) |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/sugarcoma-tour-diary-part-3/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=26 April 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404020643/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/sugarcoma-tour-diary-part-3/ |archivedate=4 April 2013}}</ref>

Although the band enjoyed supporting the established metal bands they admired, they sometimes faced hostility from audiences whose fierce loyalty was to the headline acts. In April 2002 Cuthbert said: "[[One Minute Silence]] wasn't so bad, but with bands like [[Fear Factory]] and [[Machine Head]] who have had the same fans for years they just don't give you a chance."<ref name="desmag">{{cite news |last1=McCann |first1=Alex |title=Sugarcoma |url=http://www.designermagazine.org/SugarcomaINT2.html |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Designer Magazine |date=April 2002}}</ref>

The band were unhappy when label executives interfered with their creative process, rejecting some songs outright and seeking to impose a more "[[Pop music|commercial]]" sound on others.<ref name="rs" /> The band also expressed irritation at the label's [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] efforts on their behalf, which included being sent to appear on [[BBC]] children's television programme "[[The Saturday Show (2001 TV series)|The Saturday Show]]".<ref name="rs" /> Fisk lamented: "We felt a bit uncool as the musicians we looked up to and aspired to be like were not the types to be found on Saturday morning TV."<ref name="tbt" />

  |align = right}}

To tie in with their April 2002 UK tour, the band released a [[A-side and B-side#double A-side|double A-side]] "[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]/Windings".<ref name="tour02" /> The [[Britney Spears]] [[cover version]] was conceived as a joke during early rehearsal sessions and had been successfully deployed as an [[encore]] when the band lacked enough material of their own.<ref name="tbt" /> Although by the time of its release Simson admitted to some ambivalence: "We just wanted to get it out of the way because we knew we would have to release it at some point."<ref name="desmag" />

The "(You Drive Me) Crazy" cover was not universally derided – The ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' called it a "top rock version"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Donohue |first1=Simon |title=Sugarcoma, P Diddy and Primal Scream |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/sugarcoma-p-diddy-and-primal-scream-1166137 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date=17 February 2007}}</ref> – but it [[Selling out#Musical integrity|cost the band credibility]] within the [[heavy metal subculture]] and alienated their core audience.

No. I just like the fact they're ripping apart her music. They get a five, just for going there."<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa (You Drive Me) Crazy/Windings |url=http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=15 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Kerrang!]] |date=27 March 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030905043618/http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=15 |archivedate=5 September 2003}}</ref>

The release dates of the first album "Becoming Something Else" and accompanying single "Zero Star" were delayed several times, due to what was reported as "unforeseen problems with the album's artwork". In the meantime, another headline tour was scheduled for June 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa Push Back Album Release Date, Announce Upcoming Tour |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-push-back-album-release-date-announce-upcoming-tour/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=17 May 2002}}</ref> The album had been completed in January 2002<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa Finalize Track Listing For Debut Album |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-finalize-track-listing-for-debut-album/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=22 January 2002}}</ref> but was not released until 5 August 2002 in Europe and 27 August 2002 in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa's Single Gets Delayed (Again) |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-s-single-gets-delayed-again/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=10 July 2002}}</ref>

In May 2003 it was reported that the band had recorded a batch of demos for their second album, which was three quarters complete and provisionally scheduled for release on Music for Nations in early 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa Finish Recording Pre-Production Demos |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-finish-recording-pre-production-demos/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=24 May 2003}}</ref> By March 2004 they had recorded some more demos but had been released from Music for Nations (which folded that year due to changes at its parent company Sony Music)<ref>{{cite news |title=Music For Nations closes its doors |url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=606&print_page=yes&new_resolution= |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Metal Storm |date=12 June 2004}}</ref> and were looking for another record deal.<ref>{{cite news |title=SugarComa Record New Demo, Seek New Label Home |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sugarcoma-record-new-demo-seek-new-label-home/ |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=4 March 2004}}</ref>

Fisk reported that the band "fizzled out" during 2004 because they all wanted more secure employment, but that they had never formally split up.<ref name="tbt" />

===Later activities===

In July 2013 a band statement carried by ''[[Rock Sound]]'' announced one-off reunion concert at [[The Garage, London]] in October 2013.<ref name="rs" /> Hearts Under Fire were later named as the support act. The statement explained that the band regretted the manner of their sudden departure from their record company. They wanted to play a final gig to gain [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] and go out on their own terms.<ref name="rs" />

Although the band had declined to sign with Velocity Recordings in 2000, they were bemused when the label continued to release their [[juvenilia]] without their knowledge or consent. They disavowed "Never Born" (2002) and "Life Before Colin" (2011) as "unsanctioned bunches of old demos which purport to be official albums".<ref name="rs">{{cite news |title=SugarComa to return for one-off live show in October! |url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/sugarcoma-to-return-for-one-off-london-show-in-october? |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[Rock Sound]] |date=13 July 2013}}</ref> Fisk said both recordings comprise of the same tracks, namely: "incomplete demos with car alarm noises dubbed over them".<ref name="tbt" />

In April 2015 Mayers was running a [[Human resource management|human resources]] department, Simson was a digital project manager working in [[mobile app development]] and Fisk was a [[Railroad engineer|train driver]] on the [[London Underground]]. Cuthbert had lost touch with the rest of the band.<ref name="tbt" /> As he was unable to participate in the reunion he was replaced on drums by a friend of the band, Iain "Slomo" Scott.<ref name="rs" />

==Musical style and influences==

Media coverage of SugarComa tended to categorise them within the [[nu metal]] subgenre.<ref>{{cite web |title=SugarComa |url=https://www.spirit-of-metal.com/en/band/Sugarcoma |publisher=[[Spirit of Metal]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Their artist page at Velocity Recordings carried a short biography branding them: "A feisty nu-metal foursome from London".<ref name="vr">{{cite web |title=SugarComa |url=http://www.velocityrecordings.com/band.php?bid=11 |publisher=Velocity Recordings |accessdate=1 January 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929151144/http://www.velocityrecordings.com/band.php?bid=11 |archivedate=29 September 2011}}</ref> They were also frequently bracketed alongside [[Kittie]], a contemporary Canadian female-fronted metal band. The band disliked both the nu metal label and being likened to Kittie.<ref name=dis />

A November 2000 article in ''[[Total Guitar]]'' noted the band's rejection of Kittie comparisons and instead declared [[Sepultura]] and [[Babes in Toyland]] to be primary influences. The article also carried quotes from Simson, which affirmed the band's preference for the label "[[alternative metal]]" over "nu metal".<ref>{{cite news |title=Claire Simson Interview |url=http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=14 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |publisher=[[Total Guitar]] |date=1 November 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030728132345/http://www.sugarcomaonline.com/media/press_details.asp?colID=14 |archivedate=28 July 2003}}</ref> 

Explicitly refuting their nu metal credentials in a January 2001 interview with ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', Fisk and Cuthbert argued that they used [[drop D tuning]] only sparingly, lacked a [[Turntablism|DJ]] and had no connection to American godfather of nu metal, [[Fred Durst]].<ref name=dis>{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Andy |title=Sweet Dreams Are Made of These |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/364-sweet-dreams-are-made-of-these |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]] |date=16 January 2001}}</ref> Cuthbert added: "We get loads of [[riot grrrl]] types at our gigs even though we're not really that kind of music [either]".<ref name=dis /> 

In a review of an early gig at [[The Water Rats]], ''[[NME]]'' magazine likened Mayers to [[Saffron (singer)|Saffron]] from [[Republica]] and praised her as a: "truly mercurial frontwoman".<ref>{{cite news |title=London King's Cross Water Rats |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews-nme-3055-342082 |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[NME]] |date=12 September 2005}}</ref> Mayers typically combined [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] with a more melodic vocal style. She was also the bands' lyricist and tended to base her words on her preoccupations as a [[Adolescence|teenage girl]].<ref name="desmag" /> Stressing the band's authenticity, Mayers told ''Drowned in Sound'': "When I sing my words I mean and feel them. Our songs are not fake angry shit!"<ref name=dis />

Despite their objections, the band's long term legacy was to be situated within the [[long tail]] of nu metal.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connick |first1=Tom |title=20 years of nu-metal: the rise, fall and revival of rock’s most maligned offshoot |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/09/20-years-nu-metal-rap-rock-korn-kerrang |accessdate=30 December 2019 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 May 2017 |quote=On the upside, though, it made the most mild-mannered teenager into a feminist powerhouse! That was a much-needed element of the time, creating short-lived bands like Sugarcoma and [[Defenestration (band)|Defenestration]].}}</ref>
