The '''2022 FIA World Rally Championship''' will be the fiftieth season of the [[World Rally Championship]], an [[auto racing]] competition recognised by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) as the highest class of international [[rallying]]. Teams and crews are due to compete for the [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' champions|World Rally Championships for Drivers]], [[Co-driver]]s and [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' champions|Manufacturers]]. Crews are free to compete in cars complying with [[World Rally Car|Rally1]] and [[Group R|Rally2]] regulations;{{efn|Rally1 cars were previously known as [[World Rally Car]]s and Rally2 cars were known as [[R5 (rallying)|R5]] before changes to the sporting regulations were introduced in [[2020 World Rally Championship|2020]].<ref name="pyramid"/>}} however, only manufacturers competing with Rally1 cars [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] under regulations introduced in [[World Rally Car#2017|2017]] are eligible to score points in the Manufacturers' championship.

A significant change to the regulations is planned to be introduced in 2022 as the sport adopts the use of [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrains]] for the first time.<ref name="hybrids">{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/147699/wrc-cars-will-get-hybrid-boost-on-stages-from-2022|title=WRC cars will get a boost from hybrid power on stages from 2022|first=David|last=Evans|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=21 December 2019|accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>

==Changes==
===Technical regulations===
The championship is due to introduce a new set of technical regulations known as "Rally1". The Rally1 regulations will place a greater emphasis on [[One-Design#Motorsport|standardised parts]] than in previous years to make the sport more accessible.<ref name="pyramid">{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/146456/fia-steps-up-plan-to-simplify-wrc-career-ladder|title=FIA steps up plan to simplify WRC into five-tier career ladder|first=David|last=Evans|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=8 October 2019|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/148682/neuville-doesnt-see-point-of-s%2A%2A%2A-2022-wrc-rules|title=Neuville doesn't see point of "s***" 2022 proposed WRC rules|first=Nick|last=Garton|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=16 March 2020|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>

The sport will introduce [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrains]] for the first time.<ref name="hybrids"/> All cars competing under [[World Rally Car]] regulations will be required to be fitted with a hybrid system. This will take the form of an e-motor that produces {{convert|100|kW|bhp|1|abbr=on}} to 1.6&nbsp;L [[turbocharged]] [[inline-4]] engine and must be used to power the car when travelling around service parks and through built-up areas when driving between [[Special stage (rallying)|stages]]. Drivers will be free to use the e-motor to offer additional power when competing in a stage, with the FIA dictating how much power can be used and how long a driver can deploy it for.<ref name="hybrids"/> The hybrid system and the software governing its use will be standardised for three years as a way of keeping the costs of competing down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/engineering/feature/9834/digging-into-the-cramble-for-hybrid|title=Digging into the 'scramble for hybrid|first1=James|last1=Newbold|first2=David|last2=Evans|first3=Matt|last3=James|first4=David|last4=Malsher|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=26 January 2020|accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref> The system will be provided by Compact Dynamics, a subsidiary of [[Formula E]] team [[Abt Sportsline|Audi Sport ABT]] supplier [[Schaeffler Group|Schaeffler]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/148858/wrc-announces-exclusive-22-hybrid-systems-supplier|title=WRC announces exclusive 2022 hybrid systems supplier|first=James|last=Newbold|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=31 March 2020|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>

The championship will also introduce a standardised safety structure in a bid to improve safety standards. This will coincide with the [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] requirements being re-written to allow teams to build prototype chassis based on production cars rather than having to adapt a chassis to fit a roadgoing model.<ref name="hybrids"/>
