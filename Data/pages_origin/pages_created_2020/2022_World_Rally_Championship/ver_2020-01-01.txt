==Changes==
===Technical regulations===
The sport will introduce [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrains]] for the first time.<ref name="hybrids"/> All cars competing under [[World Rally Car]] regulations will be required to be fitted with a hybrid system. This will take the form of an e-motor that produces {{convert|100|kW|bhp|1|abbr=on}} and must be used to power the car when travelling around service parks and through built-up areas when driving between [[Special stage (rallying)|stages]]. Drivers will be free to use the e-motor to offer additional power when competing in a stage, with the FIA dictating how much power can be used and how long a driver can deploy it for.<ref name="hybrids"/>

The championship will also introduce a [[One-Design#Motorsport|standardised]] safety structure in a bid to improve safety standards. This will coincide with the [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] requirements being re-written to allow teams to build prototype chassis based on production cars rather than having to adapt a chassis to fit a roadgoing model.<ref name="hybrids"/>
