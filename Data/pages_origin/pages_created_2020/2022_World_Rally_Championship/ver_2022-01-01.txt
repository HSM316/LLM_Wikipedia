Crews are free to compete in cars complying with [[Groups Rally|Groups Rally1 to Rally5]] regulations; however, only manufacturers competing with [[Group Rally1|Rally1]] cars [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] under radically new regulations are eligible to score points in the manufacturers' championship.

The series is supported by the [[2022 World Rally Championship-2|World Rally Championship-2]] and [[2022 World Rally Championship-3|World Rally Championship-3]] classes at every round of the championship with the junior category at selected events.

[[Sébastien Ogier]] and [[Julien Ingrassia]] are the reigning drivers' and co-drivers' champions, having secured their eighth championship titles at the [[2021 Rally Monza]].

==Regulation changes==
===Technical regulations===
{{main|Group Rally1}}
The championship is due to introduce a new set of technical regulations known as "Rally1" to replace the [[World Rally Car]]. The Rally1 regulations will place a greater emphasis on [[One-Design#Motorsport|standardised parts]] than in previous years to make the sport more accessible.<ref name="pyramid">{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/146456/fia-steps-up-plan-to-simplify-wrc-career-ladder|title=FIA steps up plan to simplify WRC into five-tier career ladder|first=David|last=Evans|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=8 October 2019|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/148682/neuville-doesnt-see-point-of-s%2A%2A%2A-2022-wrc-rules|title=Neuville doesn't see point of "s***" 2022 proposed WRC rules|first=Nick|last=Garton|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=16 March 2020|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>

Rally1 will also introduce [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid drivetrains]] to the sport for the first time.<ref name="hybrids">{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/147699/wrc-cars-will-get-hybrid-boost-on-stages-from-2022|title=WRC cars will get a boost from hybrid power on stages from 2022|first=David|last=Evans|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=21 December 2019|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> This will take the form of an e-motor that produces {{convert|100|kW|hp|1|abbr=on}} fitted to current 1.6&nbsp;L [[turbocharged]] [[inline-4]] engine and must be used to power the car when travelling around service parks and through built-up areas when driving between [[Special stage (rallying)|stages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wrc.com/en/news/season-2020/wrc/existing-engines-to-stay-in-wrc-hybrid-switch/|title=Existing engines to stay in WRC Hybrid switch|work=wrc.com|publisher=[[WRC Promoter GmbH]]|date=31 March 2021|access-date=9 April 2021}}</ref> Drivers will be free to use the e-motor to offer additional power when competing in a stage, with the FIA dictating how much power can be used and how long a driver can deploy it for.<ref name="hybrids"/> The hybrid system and the software governing its use will be standardised for three years as a way of keeping the costs of competing down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/engineering/feature/9834/digging-into-the-cramble-for-hybrid|title=Digging into the 'scramble for hybrid|first1=James|last1=Newbold|first2=David|last2=Evans|first3=Matt|last3=James|first4=David|last4=Malsher|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=26 January 2020|access-date=26 January 2020}}</ref> The system will be provided by Compact Dynamics, a subsidiary of [[Formula E]] team [[Abt Sportsline|Audi Sport ABT]] supplier [[Schaeffler Group|Schaeffler]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/148858/wrc-announces-exclusive-22-hybrid-systems-supplier|title=WRC announces exclusive 2022 hybrid systems supplier|first=James|last=Newbold|work=[[Autosport|autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=31 March 2020|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>

The championship will also introduce a standardised safety structure in a bid to improve safety standards. This will coincide with the [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] requirements being re-written to allow teams to enter a scaled chassis based on production cars rather than having to adapt a chassis to fit a roadgoing model.<ref name="hybrids"/>

===Sporting regulations===
The eligibility requirements for crews entering events will be simplified and streamlined into a system called the "[[Rally Pyramid|FIA Rally Pyramid]]".<ref name="pyramid"/> The top tier of the sport is known as "Rally1". The second tier, "Rally2", will be for manufacturer teams and professional independent teams in the [[2022 World Rally Championship-2|World Rally Championship-2]]. This will be followed by "Rally3" for [[Privateer (motorsport)|privately entered]] and "gentlemen driver" crews competing in the [[2022 World Rally Championship-3|World Rally Championship-3]]. "Rally4" and "Rally5" entries will not contest their own dedicated championship, but will be permitted to enter WRC rallies.

Specific liaison sections in which Rally1 competitors must drive in full electric mode will be introduced into the championship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wrc.com/en/news/2021/wrc/electric-only-zones-compulsory-in-hybrid-era/|title=Electric-only zones compulsory in hybrid era|work=wrc.com|publisher=[[WRC Promoter GmbH]]|date=27 October 2021|access-date=28 October 2021}}</ref>
