'''Olimpia Savio''' (22 July 1815 – 2 November 1889) was an [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] salon-holder and writer. She was considered one of the most influential women in Turin and was later recognised internationally as a patriotic mother who lost her children to an Italian nationalist cause.

==Biography==
Savio was born Olimpia Rossi in [[Turin]] to the [[Liguria]]n nobleman Giovan Battista Rossi and his wife the [[Province of Biella|Biellese]] Joséphine Ferrero. Her father was the director of the Royal College of the Provinces of Turin and her mother was considered among the smartest women of her time. She was educated by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart and was a debutant in 1830, at a festival for Princess [[Maria Cristina of Savoy]].<ref name="enciclopedia delle donne 2012"/>

She married the lawyer Andrea Savio with whom she had four children, Alfredo, Emilio, Federico and Adele. She was Baroness di Bernstiel. Savio hosted salons in Turin during the 19th century and wrote her memoirs leaving a portrait of her visitors and guests. The period was a turbulent time in the region and Savio left a detailed description of major events. She worked with newspapers and magazines including the "Gazzetta Piemontese", "Le Scintille", "Rivista Contemporanea" and "La Donna e la Famiglia". Savio attended the inauguration of the Turin-Genoa railway in 1854 and the inauguration of the Frejus Tunnel of 1871. Savio wrote poetry and was considered a nationalist and patriotic poet.<ref name="Chapman 2015 p. 256"/><ref name="Cardoza Fragnito 2002 p. 63"/><ref name="enciclopedia delle donne 2012"/>

Her son, Alfredo, was killed during the siege of [[Ancona]] in 1860. In 1861 at the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]] her son Emilio was killed. Savio became the personification of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] of the Italian crown and cause. [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] wrote a poem, ''Mother and Poet'', in honour and memory of her loss. Savio died in [[Turin]] and was buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Turin.<ref name="Carlyle Sorensen Kinser 2013 p. 317">{{cite book | last1=Carlyle | first1=T. | last2=Sorensen | first2=D.R. | last3=Kinser | first3=B.E. | title=On Heroes, Hero Worship, and the Heroic in History | publisher=Yale University Press | series=Rethinking the Western Tradition | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-300-14862-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XO1AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT317 | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=317}}</ref><ref name="Chapman 2015 p. 256">{{cite book | last=Chapman | first=A. | title=Networking the Nation: British and American Women's Poetry and Italy, 1840-1870 | publisher=OUP Oxford | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-19-103545-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b74DCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA256 | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=256}}</ref><ref name="enciclopedia delle donne 2012">{{cite web | title=Olimpia Savio | website=enciclopedia delle donne | date=2012-10-10 | url=http://www.enciclopediadelledonne.it/biografie/olimpia-savio/ | access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref><ref name="Browning Billington Davis 2014 p. 554">{{cite book | last1=Browning | first1=E.B. | last2=Billington | first2=J. | last3=Davis | first3=P. | title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning: 21st-Century Oxford Authors | publisher=OUP Oxford | series=21st Century Oxford Authors | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-19-960288-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZGtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA554 | language=no | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=554}}</ref><ref name="Cardoza Fragnito 2002 p. 63">{{cite book | last1=Cardoza | first1=A.L. | last2=Fragnito | first2=G. | title=Aristocrats in Bourgeois Italy: The Piedmontese Nobility, 1861-1930 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Studies in Italian History and Culture | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-521-52229-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7KqQrL47pkC&pg=PA63 | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=63}}</ref><ref name="Patriarca Riall 2012 p. 132">{{cite book | last1=Patriarca | first1=S. | last2=Riall | first2=L. | title=The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-Century Italy | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-230-24800-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5NoA_2uAKkC&pg=PA132 | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=132}}</ref><ref name="Browning Stone Taylor 2009 p. 355">{{cite book | last1=Browning | first1=E.B. | last2=Stone | first2=M. | last3=Taylor | first3=B. | title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning: Selected Poems | publisher=Broadview Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-4604-0089-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVy7AAAAQBAJ&pg=PT355 | language=no | access-date=2020-01-01 | page=355}}</ref>
