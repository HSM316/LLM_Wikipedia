{{distinguish|2nd Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)}}
The '''2nd Army''' of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] was a Partisan army that operated in [[Yugoslavia]] during the last months of the Second World War. 

The Army was created on 1 January 1945, when Chief Commander Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] converted the guerilla [[National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia]] in a more regular ''Yugoslav Army''.

== History ==
As commander was named General lieutenant [[Koča Popović]], as Political Commissioner Blažo Lompar, and as Chief of staff, Ljubo Vučković.<br> 
The Army was formed from the units of the Southern Operational Group of Divisions : the [[14th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|14th Corps]] (23rd Serbian, 25th Serbian and 45th Serbian divisions) and the 17th Eastern Bosnian and 28th Slavonian divisions. <ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/army/2/ Vojska.net]</ref>

Until April 1945, it operated in Northern Bosnia, between the 1st Army (north of the Sava) and the 4th Army (in Lika). In the final offensive for the liberation of Yugoslavia, it liberated a large part of Central and Western Bosnia and part of Croatia. It participated in the liberation of Zagreb on May 8 and part of Slovenia, where at the end of the war it captured a considerable number of enemy units, including the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]] and [[373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division]].
