}}The '''Hurtsboro “race riot”''' was an exchange of gunfire near [[Hurtsboro, Alabama]] in the final days of 1920 that was described in newspapers across the country as a deadly shoot-out between whites and Blacks. In the end, a riot was avoided, no one was killed and the suspect was released without charges.

==Background==
{{Main|Red Summer}}
In 1920, America had just gone through what is now known as the [[Red Summer|Red Summer of 1919]], an outbreak of attacks on Black communities by whites in more than three dozen cities and counties. In [[Arkansas]], as many as several hundred Blacks and five whites had been killed in the [[Elaine race riot]]. The [[Chicago race riot of 1919|Chicago race riot]] and [[Washington race riot of 1919|Washington D.C. race riot]], which resulted in 38 and 39 deaths, respectively, were recent memories.{{sfn|The New York Times|1919|p=}}

In this climate, when a white farmer, Joe Bagley, called the local sheriff on the night of Dec. 29, 1920, to report that his wife had been assaulted by a Black man, and that he had been knocked unconscious, the sheriff was quick to form a posse and respond.{{sfn|''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', December 31,|1920|p=1}} 

==Two arrested==
At about 2 a.m. on Dec. 30, [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]] Deputy Sheriff W.E. Dozier approached a house about 4 miles (6.4 km) from [[Pittsview, Alabama]]. The suspect, L.C. Hill, was inside, along with his brother, Cleveland Hill. Dozier brought with him a warrant sworn out by Joe Bagley and posse of about eight men, including Bagley, his brother Walter and George Hart.<ref name="Tuscaloosa News">{{cite news |title=Negroes at Pittsview, Ala., Fire on Posse, Sheriff is Injured |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-tuscaloosa-news-negroes-at-pittsview/135178088/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=The Tuscaloosa News, Tuscaloosa, Alabama |date=December 30, 1920}}</ref><ref name="Advertiser">{{cite news |title=Russell County's Shooting Reports Were Sensational / Four White Men Wounded in Rush Upon Negro House |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-montgomery-advertiser-russell-county/135231940/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=The Montgomery Advertiser |date=December 31, 1920 |location=Montgomery, Alabama |page=1}}</ref><ref name="Post Herald">{{cite news |title=Citizens' Posse Capture Negroes, Fugitives Wanted for Criminal Assault, Wound Deputy Sheriff and Three Others |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/birmingham-post-herald-citizens-posse-c/135232078/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=Birmingham Post-Herald, Birmingham, Alabama |date=December 31, 1920 |page=9}}</ref>

The plan was that Dozier would go to the door while the rest stationed themselves around the house. When Dozier called out, telling L.C. Hill to come outside, Hill replied his wife was sick and he could not go anywhere until morning. “‘I’ll have to ask you to come along now,’ Dozier is said to have answered, whereupon Hill struck a light and began dressing, remarking that ‘white folks . . . ain’t treating the ole n- - - - right.’”<ref name="Advertiser" />

At this point the posse began firing, unleashing as many as 100 bullets.<ref name="Advertiser" /> L.C. Hill was shot in the foot, and Dozier, Hart, and Joe and Walter Bagley were wounded, none seriously. Hill was captured without resistance, and officers went back later to the house and arrested Cleveland Hill.<ref name="Post Herald" /> Both Hill brothers were taken to the Seale, Ala., jail.<ref name="Russell Register">{{cite news |title=Considerable Excitement, All Sorts of Wild Rumors Afloat, NOBODY KILLED, Five White Men Slightly Wounded, Two Negroes Jailed. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/russell-register-russell-register-dec/135177926/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=Russell Register, Seale, Alabama |date=December 31, 1920 |page=3}}</ref>

==Press coverage==
A different version of events, however, soon circulated. Newspaper reports said, variously, that six white men had been killed, eight Black men were barricaded in a house, and that the posse could not get within range.<ref name="Post Herald" /> A headline in ''The Topeka State Journal'' read, "New Race War Is On."{{sfn|''The Topeka State Journal'', December 30,|1920|p=1}} Versions of the race riot story were picked up by newspapers in Delaware, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Montana and Florida.<ref>{{cite news |title=Race Riot Reported From Alabama Town |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-morning-news-race-riot-reported/136100219/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Morning News Wilmington, Delaware |date=December 31, 1920 |page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Several Wounded in Georgia Race Riot |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-herald-and-mail-several-wounded-in-g/136100362/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Herald and Mail Columbia, Tennessee |date=December 31, 1920 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Race Riot in Alabama Town |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-evening-news-race-riot-in-alabama-to/136100518/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Evening News Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |date=December 30, 1920 |page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Capture Negroes After Battle in Alabama Village |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-greensboro-record-capture-negroes-af/136100836/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Greensboro Record Greensboro, North Carolina |date=December 30, 1920 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Surround Blacks in House After Race War |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-labor-bulletin-surround-blacks-in-ho/136100917/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Labor Bulletin Butte, Montana |date=December 30, 1920 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Negroes Aid One of Race Who Attacks a Woman; Fire on Posse |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-tampa-tribune-negroes-aid-one-of-rac/136101135/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |publisher=The Tampa Tribune Tampa, Florida |date=December 31, 1920 |page=1}}</ref>

In response, between 100 and 150 men assembled in Hurtsboro. “Sheriff Ragland’s posse of 150 men is conducting the search in high powered automobiles and are heavily armed with shotguns and rifles,” wrote ''The Tuscaloosa News.''<ref name="Tuscaloosa News" /> When Sheriff Tom Moore of Columbus, Ga., heard about a race riot in Hurtsboro, he sent a supply of [[Winchester Model 1897|riot guns]].<ref name="Advertiser" /> “Citizens of the entire district are aroused to a pitch of feeling not equalled in many years and many persons expressed the opinion that the officers would never be able to bring the negroes here in safety,” the ''Tuscaloosa News'' story added, in a reference to the possibility of a lynching.<ref name="Tuscaloosa News" />

Within days, newspapers were printing clarifications. “These conflicting reports greatly exaggerated the affair but the community of Pittsview was entirely calm and peaceful before noon despite fresh stories painting vivid pictures of the ‘desperate’ gun battle,” wrote ''The Montgomery Advertiser.''<ref name="Tuscaloosa News" /> <ref name="Advertiser" />

''The Russell Register'' tried to make amends with a story headlined, “Considerable Excitement, All Sorts of Wild Rumors Afloat, NOBODY KILLED.”<ref name="Russell Register" /> In Union Springs, Ala., the local paper wrote, “The disturbance at Pittsview, Russell County, last week, proved for a while to be a very much exaggerated affair, in that reports went over the country to the effect that a regular race war as on, and several white people had been killed.”<ref>{{cite news |date=January 6, 1921 |title=Disturbance at Pittsview |page=1 |publisher=Union Springs Herald, Union Springs, Alabama |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/union-springs-herald-disturbance-at-pitt/135180280/ |access-date=November 29, 2023}}</ref>

The men gathered in Hurtsboro were sent home by the sheriff. Two days later, the sheriff’s office issued a statement: “Wildly exaggerated reports were responsible for the entire affair.”<ref>{{cite news |title=Reports of Race Riot at Hurtsboro, Alabama, Exaggerated |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-anniston-star-reports-of-race-riot-a/135177973/ |access-date=November 29, 2023  |publisher=The Anniston Star, Anniston, Alabama |date=January 1, 1921 |page=4}}</ref>

==Hill brothers exonerated==

In April 1921, the Montgomery County grand jury declined to indict L.C. Hill, and he was released from the Montgomery county jail without charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hill is Returned to Georgia for Trial, Release Brother on Assault Charge and Take Alleged Murderer to Georgia |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-montgomery-advertiser-hill-is-return/135180687/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=The Montgomery Advertiser, Montgomery, Alabama |date=April 5, 1921 |page=10}}</ref> Cleveland Hill was also exonerated in the Pittsview incident, but he was not released: instead he was remanded to Georgia on a charge of murder. In May 1921, he was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of a Black man named Jack Knight.<ref>{{cite news |title=Negro is Indicted on Murder Charge |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/ledger-enquirer-cleveland-hill-indicted/135823214/ |access-date=November 29, 2023 |publisher=Ledger-Enquirer, Columbus, Georgia |date=May 21, 1921 |page=8}}</ref>
