'''Fordham University Cemetery''' is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cemetery on the campus of [[Fordham University]] in [[the Bronx]]. Established in 1847, it was moved to its current location in 1890. The last burial occurred in 1909. The cemetery holds 138 graves, 124 of which contain the remains of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. The remainder were others associated with Fordham University or the Jesuit order.

== History ==
A cemetery was established on the eastern part of the campus of St. John's College (later Fordham University), with the first burial in the cemetery occurring on July 11, 1847. This part of the campus was seized in 1889 by the City of New York under the [[New Parks Act]] to create the [[New York Botanical Garden]]. The three [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] buried there were removed to a vault in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery (Bronx)|Saint Raymond's Cemetery]].<ref name="universityhistory" /> In 1890, a new cemetery was established within the campus [[vineyard]],<ref name=cemeteryproject>{{Cite web|url=https://nycemetery.wordpress.com/2016/04/04/jesuit-cemetery-fordham-university/|title=Jesuit Cemetery, Fordham University|last=French|first=Mary|date=April 4, 2016|website=New York City Cemetery Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007123527/https://nycemetery.wordpress.com/2016/04/04/jesuit-cemetery-fordham-university/|archive-date=October 7, 2019|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> next to the College church (later [[Fordham University Church]]). Seventy-five remains were transferred there, 61 of them Jesuits, nine students, three [[Seminary|seminarians]], and two workmen.

St. John's College officially became Fordham University in 1907.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/25693/our_story|title=Our Story|website=Fordham University|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110130155/https://www.fordham.edu/info/25693/our_story|archive-date=January 10, 2017|access-date=January 2, 2019}}</ref> In the early 1950s, the gate to the cemetery was moved from the southern side to the northern, and a brick wall was built to enclose the southern side. In 1959, the remains of 38 Jesuits were relocated within the cemetery to allow for the construction of Faber Hall to the southeast.<ref name="universityhistory" /> Eventually, the original [[marble]] gravestones had deteriorated, and the cemetery had become an eyesore. Some students erroneously believed that the cemetery was a "phantom cemetery" that contained no graves.<ref name="cemeteryproject" /> In 1999, the gravestones were replaced with low-profile [[granite]] markers.<ref name="universityhistory" />

In 2000, a commemorative plaque was erected at the cemetery. It reads:<ref name="universityhistory" />
