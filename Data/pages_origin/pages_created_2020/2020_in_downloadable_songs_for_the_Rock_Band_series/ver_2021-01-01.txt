<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: PLEASE READ PRIOR TO ADDING SONGS
If adding a band or song title starting with "the" please use span tags as below so that things sort correctly

This also applies to bands with "accent" marks in their names.

If adding a track that is a single, please use span tags as below so that singles sort separately from packs.

==List of songs released in 2020==
<!-- All information in this table is pulled from HMX's own sources at http://www.rockband.com/songs Please consult this page prior to making changes to the table. -->
The following table lists the available songs for the ''Rock Band'' series released in 2020. All songs available in packs are also available as individual song downloads on the same date, unless otherwise noted. Dates listed are the initial release of songs on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.

Starting from October 6, 2015, all music added to the downloadable content catalog is exclusive to ''Rock Band 4''. In addition, due to changes in the charting format and gameplay of ''Rock Band 4'', the released songs no longer support keyboard or Pro guitar and bass (future downloadable content will continue to support vocal harmonies and Pro drum charts), and most songs no longer display "family friendly" or "supervision recommended" ratings. Downloadable content from previous ''Rock Band'' titles (excepting ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'') is forward-compatible in ''Rock Band 4'' within the same system family (Xbox 360 downloads are usable in the Xbox One version and PlayStation 3 downloads are usable in the PlayStation 4 version) at no additional cost.<ref name="rock band 4">{{cite web| url=http://harmonixmusic.parature.com/link/portal/16080/16097/Article/521/Will-legacy-Rock-Band-DLC-will-be-available-for-re-download-at-launch| title=Will legacy Rock Band DLC will be available for re-download at launch?| publisher=Harmonix| date=October 6, 2015| accessdate=October 9, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010105821/http://harmonixmusic.parature.com/link/portal/16080/16097/Article/521/Will-legacy-Rock-Band-DLC-will-be-available-for-re-download-at-launch| archive-date=October 10, 2015| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

<!--
EDITORS NOTES:

1. When adding an artist or pack name to the table, please be sure to use sort template to allow for "The"-less sorting.
(ex: {{sort|Band Name|The Band Name}})

2. This table reflects the information as presented by HMX. Since there are discrepancies in some situations between versions of RB, the final verdict (per talk consensus) is to use the table located at http://www.rockband.com/music/songs, since it is independently verifiable to ANYBODY regardless of if they have the games or not.

3. The year of release for each song (not to be confused with its Rock Band release) is primarily based on the release year on the official Rock Band website.  The year of release for tracks on compilation albums reflect the original release date of the track, as opposed to the release date of said compilation album.  The release dates for live recordings and Rock Band Re-Records reflect the date in which said recordings were made.

 All information in this table is pulled from HMX's own sources at https://web.archive.org/web/20081204063018/http://www.rockband.com/music/songs/ Please consult this page prior to making changes to the table. -->
