This article is about the American '''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart held during the 2020s'''.

The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs of the United States. Published by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, the data are compiled by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] based collectively on each single's weekly [[CD single|physical]] and [[music download|digital]] sales, [[airplay]], and, since 2012, [[streaming media|streaming]].

A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public every Tuesday in ''Billboard'' magazine and on its website. Each chart is dated with the "week-ending" date of the Saturday four days later.

[[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]" began the 2020s in the number-one position on the Hot 100, and made her the first artist to rank at number one on charts from four different decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8547157/mariah-carey-number-one-hot-100-four-decades-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you|title=Mariah Carey Becomes First Artist at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 in Four Decades, Thanks to 'All I Want for Christmas'|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=December 30, 2019|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 30, 2019}}{{subscription}}</ref> The song was in its third week at number one on January 4, 2020, reaching the top for the first time on December 21, 2019. The following week, on January 11, 2020, [[Post Malone]]'s "[[Circles (Post Malone song)|Circles]]" returned to the number-one spot, another carry-over from the 2010s; it originally reached number one on November 30, 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8547374/post-malone-circles-hot-100-number-one-third-week|work=Billboard|title=Post Malone 'Circles' Back to No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100, Maroon 5 & Roddy Ricch Reach Top Three|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=2020-01-06|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

==Statistics==

===Artists by total number-one singles===
<!-- Note to editors:  In the event that two or more artists are tied for a given number of number-one singles, the artist who chronologically reached the count first should be listed above the others; those who reach that count at a later date should not be listed above the other artists with the same count. -->

<!-- Another note, concerning "All I Want for Christmas Is You":  As this initially hit #1 on December 21, 2019, outside of the 2020s, it is not counted toward Mariah Carey's tally of #1s in this decade - it has been counted toward her #1s in the 2010s. -->

The following artists achieved at least one number-one single during the 2020s. A number of artists had number-one singles on their own as well as part of a collaboration. An asterisk (*) denotes that an artist is currently at number one.
