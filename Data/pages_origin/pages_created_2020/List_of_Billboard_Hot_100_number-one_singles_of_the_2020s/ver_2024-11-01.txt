The [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs of the United States. Published by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, the data are compiled by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] based collectively on each single's weekly [[CD single|physical]] and [[music download|digital]] sales, [[airplay]], and, since 2012, [[streaming media|streaming]].

A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public every Tuesday in ''Billboard'' magazine and on its website. Each chart is dated with the "week-ending" date of the Saturday four days later.

[[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]" began the 2020s in the number-one position on the Hot 100, and made her the first artist to rank at number one on charts from four different decades.<ref name="Mariah XMAS 2019">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/mariah-carey-number-one-hot-100-four-decades-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you/|title=Mariah Carey Becomes First Artist at No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 in Four Decades, Thanks to 'All I Want for Christmas'|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=December 30, 2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=December 30, 2019}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The song was in its third week at number one on January 4, 2020, reaching the top for the first time on December 21, 2019.

<!-- Another note, concerning "All I Want for Christmas Is You":  As this initially hit #1 on December 21, 2019, outside of the 2020s, it is not counted toward Mariah Carey's tally of #1s in this decade - it has been counted toward her #1s in the 2010s. -->
