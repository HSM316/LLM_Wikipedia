It displaces {{convert|15000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|5000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of ballast.<ref name="Data"/>

The boat has a draft of {{convert|4.67|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard keel fitted.<ref name="Data"/>

The boat is fitted with a British [[Perkins Engines]] 4-107 [[diesel engine]] of {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for docking and maneuvering. The engine is located under the [[companionway]] steps.<ref name="Data"/>

The design has a raised saloon top, with the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] on the port side at the foot of the companionway steps. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located forward, just aft of the bow "V"-berth and also on the port side. A dinette table is fitted in the main cabin.
