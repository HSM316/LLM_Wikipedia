'''Enrique Ika a Tuʻu Hati''' (died after 1900) was elected ''‘[[ariki]]'' ([[Kings of Easter Island|king]]) of [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island) in 1900 and led a failed rebellion. He was one of the last Rapa Nui to claim the traditional kingship in the early 20th-century. However, he is generally not remembered as the last king instead his predecessor [[Riro Kāinga]] is generally regarded as the last king, although neither held much power.{{#tag:ref|[[Kerekorio Manu Rangi]], the last undisputed ''‘ariki mau'',  died during an outbreak of [[tuberculosis]] in 1867.{{sfn|Fischer|2005|pages=91–92, 99, 101, 147}} Although [[Riro Kāinga]] and his predecessor [[Atamu Tekena]] held the title of king, their power and legitimacy in comparison with their predecessors are doubted. Historian [[Alfred Métraux]] wrote, "Although the islanders of to-day speak of the late kings, Atamu Te Kena and Riroroko, as if they were really kings, informants make it clear that they had very little in common with the ariki of olden days. Their power was of an indefinite, dubious nature, and they seem to have enjoyed none of the prerogatives of former ariki. Perhaps their only claim to the title lay in their descent-line; both belonged to the Miru group. Possibly if native civilization had continued, they might have been true kings. Personal pretension, supported by Chilean officers who needed a responsible intermediary to deal with the population, might have contributed toward the restoration of power to this fictitious and ephemeral royalty."<ref>{{harvnb|Métraux|1937|page=42}}</ref>|group=note}}

==Biography==
The penultimate King [[Atamu Tekena]] of Easter Island ceded the island to [[Chile]] (represented by Captain [[Policarpo Toro]]) on 9 September 1888. However, the treaty of annexation was never ratified by Chile and Toro's colony failed. The Chilean government abandoned the settlement in 1892 due to political troubles on the mainland, which was embroiled in [[Chilean Civil War of 1891|civil war]], and this prompted the Rapa Nui to reassert their independence.{{sfn|Gonschor|2008|pages=66–70}} 

After the 1892 death of Atamu Tekena, [[Riro Kāinga|Siméon Riro Kāinga]] and Enrique Ika were candidates for the throne. They both were of the Miru clan which the traditional rulers belonged to. Although both were of royal descent, Ika was more closely related to [[Kerekorio Manu Rangi]], the last undisputed ''‘ariki mau'', who  died during an outbreak of [[tuberculosis]] in 1867.{{sfn|Fischer|2005|pages=91–92, 99, 101, 147}} However, Kāinga's cousin [[Angata|Maria Angata Veri Tahi 'a Pengo Hare Kohou]], a Catholic [[catechist]] and prophet, organized many of the island's women in his support. Riro was allegedly elected primarily because of his good looks and Angata's influence.{{sfn|McCall|1997|pages=115–116}}{{sfn|Fischer|2005|page=147}} Ika was appointed as his prime minister.{{sfn|Pakarati|2015a|pages=10, 14}}{{sfn|Pakarati|2015b|pages=3–14}}

The Rapa Nui unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim indigenous sovereignty in the absence of direct Chilean control from 1892 to 1896. However, Chile reasserted its claim, and the island was later leased to Enrique Merlet and his ranching company. They restricted the islanders' access to most of their land except a walled-off settlement at [[Hanga Roa]], which they were not allowed to leave without permission. The young king attempted to protest the company's abuse but died under suspicious circumstances at [[Valparaíso]].{{sfn|Gonschor|2008|pages=66–70}}{{sfn|Fischer|2005|pages=152–154}}

Riro Kāinga has been generally referred to as the last king of Easter Island. However, two other candidates for the kingship existed after him including Ika and [[Moisés Tuʻu Hereveri]]. When the news of Riro's death arrived in Easter Island, Prime Minister Ika was considered the natural successor. He was proclaimed king on 8 January 1900. He led an unsuccessful resistance against the ranching company led by Horacio Cooper, the representative of Merlet.{{sfn|Pakarati|2015a|pages=13–15}}{{sfn|Pakarati|2015b|pages=3–14}}<ref name="Simonetti2011.11.12">{{cite news|last=Simonetti|first=Marcelo|title=El último Rey de la Isla de Pascua|date=12 November 2011|work=Enlace Mapuche Internacional|url=http://www.mapuche-nation.org/espanol/html/articulos/art-163.htm|accessdate=26 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915091217/http://www.mapuche-nation.org/espanol/html/articulos/art-163.htm|archive-date=15 September 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Chilean shepherd Manuel A. Vega, who had married King Riro's widow Véronique Mahute, led a revolt in 1901. Ika's successor Hereveri led another unsuccessful indigenous rebellion from 1901 to 1902. A decade later, Angata led another unsuccessful rebellion against the ranching company in 1914. Each revolts were crushed when the Chilean navy arrested the ringleaders of the revolt and exiled them to mainland Chile.{{sfn|Pakarati|2015b|pages=3–14}}<ref>{{harvn|Fischer|2005|pages=166–172}}; {{harvn|Van Tilburg|2003|pages=148–163}}; {{harvn|Delsing|2004|pages=26–28}}</ref>

The kingship remained vacant for a century after Ika and Hereveri. In 2011, Riro Kāinga's grandson, [[Valentino Riroroko Tuki]], declared himself king of Rapa Nui.<ref name="Simonetti2011.11.16">{{cite news|last=Simonetti|first=Marcelo|title=Los dominios del rey|date=16 October 2011|magazine=La Tercera|location=Santiago|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/los-dominios-del-rey/|accessdate=26 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111122822/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/los-dominios-del-rey/|archive-date=11 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Nelsen|first=Aaron|title=A Quest for Independence: Who Will Rule Easter Island's Stone Heads?|date=30 March 2012|magazine=Time|location=New York City|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2110365,00.html|accessdate=26 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165728/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2110365,00.html|archive-date=27 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
