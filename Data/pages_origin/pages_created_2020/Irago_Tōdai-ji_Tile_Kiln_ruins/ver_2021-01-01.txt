The {{nihongo|'''Irago Tōdai-ji Tile Kiln ruins '''|伊良湖東大寺瓦窯跡|Irago Tōdaiji gayō iseki}}  is an [[archaeological site]] containing the remnants of a number of [[Anagama kiln]]s, from which the [[roof tile]]s for the [[Kamakura period]] reconstruction of the temple of [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara (city)|Nara]] were made. The site is located in what is now part of the city of [[Tahara, Aichi|Tahara]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] in the [[Tōkai region]] of [[Japan]]. It was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/138737 |title=伊良湖東大寺瓦窯跡|trans-title=Irago Todaiji kawara-kama ato|language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Overview==
In 1180 AD, during the [[Genpei War]] of the late [[Heian period]], the great temple of Tōdai-ji was burned down by [[Taira clan|Heike]] forces. The temple was rebuilt by the [[Kamakura shogunate]] in 1195 AD. During the construction of an irrigation dam at the tip of [[Atsumi Peninsula]]  in 1966, the remnants of a kiln were discovered. This lent evidence to local legend that the tiles for the temple of Tōdai-ji had been produced from clay in this area. Further investigation of shards found at the site, as well as earlier finds from the [[Edo period]] in this neighborhood, revealed a number of ink markings and inscriptions which were identical to markings on existing tiles preserved at Tōdai-ji. A more detailed archaeological excavation revealed that the site consisted of three ''[[noborigama]]''-style kilns and one flat kiln.
The kilns were from 11.5 to 12.3 meters in length, and had a maximum width of 2.5 meters.

Excavated items are now displayed at the Folklore Museum of Tahara City.
