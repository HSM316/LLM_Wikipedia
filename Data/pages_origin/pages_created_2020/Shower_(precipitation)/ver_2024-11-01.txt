A '''shower''' is a mode of [[precipitation]] characterized by an abrupt start and end and by rapid variations in intensity. Often strong and short-lived, it comes from [[Atmospheric convection|convective cloud]]s, like [[Cumulus congestus cloud|cumulus congestus]]. A shower will produce [[rain]] if the temperature is above the freezing point in the cloud, or [[snow]] / [[ice pellets]] / [[snow pellets]] / [[hail]] if the temperature is below it at some point.<ref name=AMS>{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Shower |title=Shower |work=AMS Glossary|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref> In a meteorological observation, such as the [[METAR]], they are noted '''SH''' giving respectively '''SHRA''', '''SHSN''', '''SHPL''', '''SHGS''' and '''SHGR'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteocentre.com/doc/metar.html |title=METAR Study Guide|author=[[Meteorological Service of Canada]] |website=meteocentre.com |access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=[[Meteorological Service of Canada]]|title=MANOBS|url=http://ec.gc.ca/manobs/73BC3152-E142-4AEE-AC7D-CF30DAFF9F70/MANOBS_7E_A18_F_Jan2013.pdf|publisher=[[Environment and Climate Change Canada]]|year=2013|pages=148|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313042248/http://ec.gc.ca/manobs/73BC3152-E142-4AEE-AC7D-CF30DAFF9F70/MANOBS_7E_A18_F_Jan2013.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-13}}</ref>

==Formation==
{{Main|Precipitation}}
[[File:LCL-NCA.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|Vertical motion of the air parcel with a given [[mixing ratio]] resulting into a convective cloud formation.]]
Convection occurs when the Earth's surface, especially within a conditionally unstable or moist [[atmosphere]], becomes heated more than its surroundings and in turn leading to significant evaporation. The raised [[air parcel]] in a colder environment at altitude will cool but according to the adiabatic thermal gradient forming clouds, and later precipitation  above the [[lifted condensation level]] (LCL). Depending on the [[convective available potential energy]] (CAPE), the clouds will be [[Cumulus humilis cloud|cumulus humilis]], [[Cumulus mediocris cloud|cumulus mediocris]] and then [[Cumulus congestus cloud|cumulus congestus]], the latter giving short-lived precipitation of rain, snow or ice pellets changing in intensity, i.e. showers.<ref name=AMS/>

The life cycle of these clouds is fast because the updraft which forms them is most often cut off by the descent of precipitation. In addition, these clouds flow with atmospheric circulation and spend little time above a point on the ground. This explains the variations in intensity and the short duration of the showers. The type of precipitation will depend on the temperature structure in the cloud and below it:
*In winter, when the temperature in the cloud is below freezing (0&nbsp;Â°C), snowflakes will be generated:
**They will melt and give raindrops if the temperature rises above it in a deep layer between the cloud and the ground. If the layer is not deep enough, it can produce snow pellets showers.<ref>{{cite web|work=AMS Glossary| url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Snow_pellets |title=Snow pellets |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>
**Or remain as snow showers, or flurry, if the temperature remains below freezing.<ref>{{cite web|work=AMS Glossary| url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Snow_shower |title=Snow shower |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>
*On the other hand, raindrops might form in a strong updraft in a convective cloud, even at temperature below freezing in the cloud ([[Supercooling]]) and freeze later, giving ice pellet showers.<ref>{{cite web|work=AMS Glossary| url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Ice_pellets |title=Ice Pellets |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>
*Finally, droplets can form and fall in an above freezing layer in other seasons, giving rain showers.

===Extreme===
[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|right|A violent electrical storm results from convective [[cumulonimbus]] above the LCL.]]
If the convection is more intense, it leads to the formation of [[cumulonimbus cloud]]s which have a very large [[Cloud height|vertical extension]]. This permits the displacement of electric charges from the bottom to the top that will create lightning and thunder. The showers associated with this kind of clouds are therefore called ''thundershowers'' or ''[[thunderstorm]]s''. [[Hail]] and other violent phenomena are associated with this type of convection.

==Showery systems==
Showers come from individual clouds as well as from groups of these. In mid-latitude regions, showers are often associated with [[cold front]]s, often found along and behind it. However they can be embedded into a continuous rain episode when there is presence of band of [[conditional symmetric instability]] in an otherwise stable air mass. They can also be part of large convection zones called [[mesoscale convective system]] such as a [[squall line]].
