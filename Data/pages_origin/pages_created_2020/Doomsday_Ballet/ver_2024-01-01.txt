==Album details==
Guitarist and main songwriter Alex Cameron said, "We probably had 100 songs written, then we'd done 50 multi-track demos ourselves, and from them we chose about 25, and from those, Burke and Jack Ladder chose the final 12, so we were really confident in the songs."<ref name=stack>{{cite web| work= Stack | title=Bad//Dreems' Alex Cameron gives the skinny on Doomsday Ballet | url=https://stack.com.au/music/music-interview/bad-dreems-alex-cameron-gives-the-skinny-on-doomsday-ballet/}}</ref> The band members all had day jobs in Victoria and South Australia, so writing and demoing was done in "immersive" weekends.<ref name=volume />

Marwe said the new album was an attempt to "step away" from the pub-rock labels for their previous albums. "Pub rock has a certain stigma to it but if you listen to the maturity of the songs of [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]] or [[The Angels (Australian band)|the Angels]], yeah, there is that pub mentality to it but it’s all quite sophisticated. People can call it whatever they want."<ref>{{cite web| work= [[The West Australian]] | title=Woke blokes Bad//Dreems kick goals with Doomsday Ballet|author=Simon Collins | url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/music/woke-blokes-baddreems-kick-goals-with-doomsday-ballet-ng-b881349916z}}</ref> Elsewhere, Wilson said, "Our motto in the studio with Burke and Ladder was 'Less Pub, More Art' and we really tried to adhere to that".<ref name=volume>{{cite web| work= Volume Media | title=[Interview] Bad // Dreems Explain Their New Sound on Doomsday Ballet, and How A Conversation with Peter Garrett was Tainted by Hot Bagging|author=Brooke Tunbridge | url=https://volumemedia.com.au/interview-bad-dreems/}}</ref>

The song "Gallows" was mostly written by Marwe. Cameron said, "I think it’s about his new fatherhood, and a number of things around that. It’s a very Lou Reed-influenced track. We’ve always loved the track "Coney Island Baby" by [[Lou Reed]], and the way that he uses saxophone and backing vocals. We’ve always wanted to include more horns and other instruments, and we finally got to sneak them in on that track – only because we didn’t end up getting around to recording it in the main session, so we kind of recorded it ourselves."<ref name=stack />

==Reception==
[[Bernard Zuel]] said, "you can hear the disdain, if not outright anger. And yeah, their views are sometimes objectionable and blunt, with no attempt to defend them in the song. Because that's not the point. As [[Randy Newman]] has spent five decades explaining, its a story, it's a type."<ref>{{cite web| work= bernardzuel.net | title=

''X-press Mag'' noted, "it may not be everyone's cup of tea with its hard style, raw lyrics and intimidating pace (at times) but there is a lot to be appreciated when listened to in full" and a "rich range of diversity".<ref>{{cite web| work= X-press Mag | title=Bad//Dreems Doomsday Ballet gets 8/10|author=Jackson Mead | url=http://xpressmag.com.au/bad-dreems-doomsday-ballet-gets-8-10/}}</ref> [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] agreed, "Their propulsive rants are now counterpointed by evocative textures, their fury has an existential undertow, and their mid-tempo ballads reveal a bittersweet beauty."<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald | title=A strange, sonic place: the evolution of Bad Dreems|author=Craig Mathieson | url=https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/a-strange-sonic-place-the-evolution-of-bad-dreems-20191011-p52zvk.html}}</ref> Rock Sins said, "The slowing of pace in the album’s middle section allows the stark, [[Philip Larkin|Larkinesque]] realism of the lyrics to shine".<ref>{{cite web| work= Rock Sins | title=Bad//Dreems – Doomsday Ballet|author=Sam Savigny | url=https://www.rocksins.com/2019/10/bad-dreems-doomsday-ballet-37667/}}</ref>
