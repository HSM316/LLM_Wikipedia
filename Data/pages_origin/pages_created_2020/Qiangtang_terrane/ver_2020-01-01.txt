The '''Qiantang terrane''' is one of three main west-east-trending [[terrane]]s of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

During the Triassic, a southward-directed subduction along its northern margin resulted in the [[Jin-Shajing suture]], the limit between it and the [[Songpan-Ganzi terrane]].  During the Jurassic, the [[Lhasa terrane]] merged with its southern margin along the [[Bangong suture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wang|Wyman|Xu|Wan|2008|loc=Geologic setting, p. 475}}</ref>  This suture, the closure of part of the [[Tethys Ocean]], transformed the Qiantang terrane into a large-scale [[anticline]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Xu|Ding|Zhang|Cai|2013|loc=Geologic setting, pp. 32–33}}</ref>

The Qiantang terrane is now located at {{Circa}} {{Convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, but the timing of this [[Orogeny|uplift]] remains debated, with estimates ranging from the Pliocene-Pleistocene (3–5&nbsp;{{Abbr|Mya|million years ago}}) to the Eocene (35&nbsp;Mya) when the plateau was first [[Denudation|denudated]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Xu|Ding|Zhang|Cai|2013|loc=Introduction, pp. 31–32}}</ref>
