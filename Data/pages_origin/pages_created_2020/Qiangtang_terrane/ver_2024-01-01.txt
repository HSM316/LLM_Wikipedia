The '''Qiantang terrane''' is one of three main west-east-trending [[terrane]]s of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

During the Triassic, a southward-directed subduction along its northern margin resulted in the [[Jin-Shajing suture]], the limit between it and the [[Songpan-Ganzi terrane]].  During the [[Late Jurassic]] and [[Early Cretaceous]], the [[Lhasa terrane]] merged with its southern margin along the [[Bangong suture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wang|Wyman|Xu|Wan|2008|loc=Geologic setting, p. 475}}</ref> This suture, the closure of part of the [[Tethys Ocean]], transformed the Qiantang terrane into a large-scale [[anticline]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Xu|Ding|Zhang|Cai|2013|loc=Geologic setting, pp. 32–33}}</ref> The merging of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes resulted in the uplift of a palaeoplateau known as the Qiangtang Plateau,<ref name="Zhang2020">{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Chenyu |last2=Wu |first2=Lei |last3=Chen |first3=Wuke |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongshu |last5=Xiao |first5=Ancheng |last6=Zhang |first6=Junyong |last7=Chen |first7=Siyuan |last8=Chen |first8=Hanlin |date=1 November 2020 |title=Early Cretaceous foreland-like Northeastern Qaidam Basin, Tibetan Plateau and its tectonic implications: Insights from sedimentary investigations, detrital zircon U–Pb analyses and seismic profiling |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018220303576 |journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]] |volume=557 |page=109912 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109912 |bibcode=2020PPP...557j9912Z |s2cid=225171627 |access-date=7 December 2022}}</ref> which rapidly thinned later in the [[Cretaceous]].<ref name="Sun2020">{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Miao |last2=Tang |first2=Ju-Xing |last3=Chen |first3=Wei |last4=Ma |first4=Xu-Dong |last5=Qu |first5=Xiao-Ming |last6=Song |first6=Yang |last7=Li |first7=Xin-Yuan |last8=Ding |first8=Ji-Shun |date=March 2020 |title=Process of lithospheric delamination beneath the Lhasa–Qiangtang collision orogen: Constraints from the geochronology and geochemistry of Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the Lhasa terrane, central Tibet |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024493719303780 |journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]] |volume=356-357 |page=105219 |doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2019.105219 |s2cid=210619771 |access-date=7 December 2022}}</ref>

The Qiantang terrane is now located at {{Circa}} {{Convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, but the timing of this [[Orogeny|uplift]] remains debated, with estimates ranging from the Pliocene-Pleistocene (3–5&nbsp;{{Abbr|Mya|million years ago}}) to the Eocene (35&nbsp;Mya) when the plateau was first [[Denudation|denudated]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Xu|Ding|Zhang|Cai|2013|loc=Introduction, pp. 31–32}}</ref>
