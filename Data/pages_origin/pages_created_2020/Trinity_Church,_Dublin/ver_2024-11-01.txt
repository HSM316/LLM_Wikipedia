==History==
Trinity Church was designed by [[Frederick Darley (architect)|Frederick Darley]] who designed many buildings in Trinity College Dublin, and the church would have accommodated up to 1,800 people. The first rector was the future Bishop of Cork, Rev. [[John Gregg (bishop of Cork)|John Gregg]] from 1839 until his elevation in 1862 to Bishop.<ref>''Gardiner Street Employment Exchange: The Historical Background and Development'' by Ciaran Clancy, Dublin Historical Record, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Spring, 1990), pp. 47-51, Published by: Old Dublin Society</ref> Mr. Vance, a wealthy Dublin businessman, funded it, on condition that Rev. Gregg could raise the other half of the money required to build it, which he did. It was a ''Proprietary Church'', independently funded by wealthy laypeople, and the term "Episcopal" was used to distinguish it from other movements in the reformed faith at the time - the church was evangelical, verging on Calvinist.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
