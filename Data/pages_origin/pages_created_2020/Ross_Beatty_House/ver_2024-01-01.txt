The '''Ross Beatty House''' is a historic house at 1499 Sheridan Road in [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]]. Built in 1893, the house is the first of two homes built for steel magnate Ross J. Beatty in Highland Park. The house was primarily designed in the [[Queen Anne architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] style, but it also incorporates elements of [[Classical Revival architecture]]. The house's Queen Anne influence is mainly present in its massing and complex roof structure with multiple [[dormer]]s. Its Classical Revival influence can be seen in its decorative elements, including many [[pediment]]ed windows and [[sidelights]] flanking the entrance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Susan S. |last2=Cook |first2=Nancy W. |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Highland Park Multiple Resource Area |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64000175.pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=January 1, 2020 |date=September 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Freund |first1=Edith |title=Highland Park Multiple Resource Inventory Sheet: Ross Beatty House |url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201327.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101181420/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201327.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-01-01 |publisher=[[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]] |access-date=January 1, 2020 |date=September 1981}}</ref>
