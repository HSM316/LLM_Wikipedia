{{distinguish|3rd Army (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)}}
The '''3rd Army''' of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] was a Partisan army that operated in [[Yugoslavia]] during the last months of the Second World War. 

The Army was created on 1 January 1945, when Chief Commander Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] converted the guerilla [[National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia]] in a more regular ''Yugoslav Army''.

== History ==
As commander was named General lieutenant [[Kosta Nađ]], as Political Commissioner Branko Petričević, and as Chief of staff,  Vukašin Subotić.<br> 
The Army was formed from the units of the General Staff Vojvodina and the [[12th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans)|12th Corps]] ([[16th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|16th]], [[36th Division (Yugoslav Partisans)|36th]] and 51st Vojvodina divisions). Later the 12th Slavonian, 17th Eastern Bosnian, 32nd Zagorje, 33rd Croatian and 40th Slavonian divisions were added. <ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/army/3/ Vojska.net]</ref>

Until April 1945, the 3rd Army held positions on the [[Syrmian Front]] from Drava to Vukovar and fought on the [[Virovitica]] bridgehead, on the left bank of the Drava River, in the vicinity of [[Požega, Croatia|Slavonski Požega]], near [[Daruvar]] and on other places.<br> 
In the final offensive for the liberation of Yugoslavia in April-May 1945, it liberated a large part of Slavonia, Croatia, [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and Slovenia. 
By the end of the war, it was operating in the northeastern part of Slovenia ([[Ptuj]], [[Maribor]]). Its units, together with forces from the [[4th Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|4th Army]], surrounded a 30,000 strong mixed Axis column containing Germans, Ustashi, Home Guard and Montenegrin Chetniks, and forced it to capitulate after fierce fighting in the [[Battle of Poljana]] on May 14-15, a week after the armistice.
