'''Haicheng County''' was a historic county in [[South China]], dating to the [[Ming Dynasty]]. During the late Ming Dynasty, Haicheng was one of China's most important ports, earning the moniker "Little [[Suzhou]]-[[Hangzhou]]" ({{lang|zh|小蘇杭}}), a reference to the historically prominent trading centers of Hangzhou and Suzhou.

==History==

Haicheng was elevated to county status on 17 January 1567 during the Ming Dynasty, and was the site of [[Yuegang]] (Moon Harbor), a major seaport handling the majority of maritime trade with [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=The Troubled Empire|last=Brook|first=Timothy|date=2010-06-30|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04602-3|language=en}}</ref> Haicheng County was merged with Longxi County in 1960 to form the modern-day [[Longhai City]] in [[Fujian Province]]. For most of its history, the administrative center of the county was in [[Shima (historical town)|Shima]] ({{lang|zh|石碼}}).
