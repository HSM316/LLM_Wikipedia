'''Back to Black''' was a band formed in [[Minneapolis]] around 1970. They changed their name to The Family, a name later adopted by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for [[The Family (band)|The Family]]. They were the house band at The Way community center, and performed at the [[Phyllis Wheatley Community Center]] (both now demolished). Prince considered them a lifelong influence. Their bassist, [[Sonny T.|Sonny Thompson]], worked with Prince in the [[New Power Generation]] from 1991 to 1996.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=University Of Minnesota Press|date=October 10, 2017|author=Swensson, Andrea|title=Got to Be Something Here: The Rise of the Minneapolis Sound|isbn=9780816632336|chapter=The Family}}</ref>
