{{as of|2016}} the competition proceeded thus: artists in the categories of Pop, Rock, and Country entered their application online by creating an artist page and paid an application fee.  Fans then voted for their favorites via the website, eventually selecting the top10 for each of category. Those 30 artists or groups were flown to Los Angeles where they then performed and competed in front of a panel of judges. The top winner in each category then received a recording contract through Rock Star University Records and was flown back to the West Coast to record a 10-track studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scenester.tv/the-all-new-la-music-awards-2016/|title=The All New LA Music Awards Launches November 2016; The Event Is Reimagined For the 25th Anniversary Show|work=scenestertv.com|date=25 August 2015}}</ref> Funding for the award is largely provided by those participating in it, with various retainer and marketing fees in 2014 adding up to over $20,000 per participant for those who go on to the final round.

However, the LA Music Awards website, does not show anything past 2014. Also the acclaimed winners of the 2016 award are not shown at the Avalon Theater but at the Hard Rock Cafe on Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1992 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said of the show that it "has a lack of feeling for the city's musical character and diversity".<ref name=LA>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-21-ca-2438-story.html|title=POP REVIEW : L.A.
