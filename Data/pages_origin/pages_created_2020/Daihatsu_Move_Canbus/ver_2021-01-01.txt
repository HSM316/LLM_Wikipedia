== Etymology ==
The "Canbus" name is a combination of the words "can", describing the car's ability, and "bus", describing the car's bus-like shape and inspiration from [[Volkswagen Type 2]], also known as the "Bus".<ref>{{cite web | date = 16 September 2016 | url = https://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/16/daihatsus-move-canbus-worlds-cutest-car/ | title = Daihatsu's Move Canbus could very well be the world's cutest car | work = AutoBlog.com | accessdate = 1 January 2020}}</ref>

== Design ==
The Move Canbus borrows its overall design from the '''Hinata''' [[concept car]]. The Hinata was first showcased at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#2015|2015 Tokyo Motor Show]] alongside the Noriori [[food truck]] and Tempo [[wheelchair accessible van]] concepts.<ref>{{cite web | date = 6 October 2015 | url = https://www.carscoops.com/2015/10/daihatsu-hinata-tempo-noriori-concepts/ | title = Daihatsu Hinata, Tempo & Noriori Concepts Heading To Tokyo Show | work = CarScoops.com | accessdate = 1 January 2020}}</ref> It has a distinctive retro styling with a two-tone color combination, taking inspiration from the Volkswagen Type 2.
