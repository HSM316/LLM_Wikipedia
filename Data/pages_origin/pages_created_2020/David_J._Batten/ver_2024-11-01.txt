His specific contributions include work on the [[Normapolles]] group of pollen in the [[Late Cretaceous]] and [[Early Tertiary]], Mesozoic and Tertiary [[megaspores]] from around the world, [[palynofacies]] analysis to interpret past environments, and the palynology of the [[Wealden Group]] ([[Early Cretaceous]], [[Valanginian]]–[[Barremian]]) of southern [[England]].<ref name="AASP-article" />

==Early life==
He was born on 26 April 1943 in [[Watford]] and grew up in [[Croydon]], South London. When he was a teenager he and his family moved to Canada, where he attended a boarding school near Toronto.<ref name="pal-obit" />
