==History==
[[File:Shirley Isolation Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|Shirley Isolation Hospital]]
The facility has its origins in two houses on West Quay in Southampton which were acquired to create an isolation hospital in 1874. These premises were replaced by a purpose-built facility on Mousehole Lane (now Oakley Road) in Shirley in 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5272613/?page=1|title=Hospital construction: new isolation hospital for Southampton|publisher= Institute of Healthcare Management|date=1900|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> This facility developed to become the Southampton Chest Hospital and joined the [[National Health Service]] as the Southampton Western Hospital in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=3165&page=18|title=Southampton Western Hospital, Southampton|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> After the Southampton Western Hospital closed in the mid-1980s, a new facility for elderly people was created on the site in January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1996/may/07/hospital-and-dental-services-southampton|title=Hospital and Dental Services (Southampton)|date=7 May 1996|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> This facility evolved to become the Western Community Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/17628129.reopening-of-beaulieu-ward-at-western-community-hospital-in-southamptonnbspdelayed/|title=Reopening of Beaulieu ward at Western Community Hospital in Southampton delayed|date=9 May 2019|publisher=Daily Echo|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>
