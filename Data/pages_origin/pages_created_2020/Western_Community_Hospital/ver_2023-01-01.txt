The '''Western Community Hospital''' is a health facility in William Macleod Way in the [[Shirley, Southampton|Shirley]] / [[Millbrook, Southampton|Millbrook]] area of [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], England. It is managed by the [[Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust]].

==History==
[[File:Shirley Isolation Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|Shirley Isolation Hospital]]
The facility has its origins in two houses on West Quay in Southampton which were acquired to create an isolation hospital in 1874. Southampton Corporation acquired the passenger ship, [[City of Adelaide (1864)|''City of Adelaide'']], and moored it just off Millbrook Point to provide further isolation facilities in 1893.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/18/clipper-ship-city-of-adelaide-australia|title=Clipper ship City of Adelaide finds berth in Australia|work=The Guardian|date=18 March 2012|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> At a meeting of the [[Local Board of Health]] later that year, concern was expressed about the ship being anchored off the point where children played on the beach.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hampshire Advertiser|date=18 February 1893|title=The Infectious Hospital Ship}}</ref>

These makeshift premises were replaced by a purpose-built facility on Mousehole Lane (now Oakley Road) in Shirley which opened as the Shirley Isolation Hospital in 1900.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hospital construction: new isolation hospital for Southampton|journal = The Hospital|volume = 28|issue = 727|pages = 374–375|publisher= Institute of Healthcare Management|date=1900|pmc = 5272613|pmid = 29839576}}</ref> This facility joined the [[National Health Service]] as the Southampton Chest Hospital and, after the need to treat patients with respiratory problems receded, the facility evolved during the 1960s to become the Southampton Western Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=3165&page=18|title=Southampton Western Hospital, Southampton|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhMQ4HgZ1QIC&dq=%22Southampton+Western+Hospital%22&pg=PA580|title=Southampton Health District|publisher=New Scientist|page=580|date=26 February 1981|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>

After the Southampton Western Hospital closed in 1985, a new facility for elderly people was created on the site in January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1996/may/07/hospital-and-dental-services-southampton|title=Hospital and Dental Services (Southampton)|date=7 May 1996|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> This facility evolved to become the Western Community Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/17628129.reopening-of-beaulieu-ward-at-western-community-hospital-in-southamptonnbspdelayed/|title=Reopening of Beaulieu ward at Western Community Hospital in Southampton delayed|date=9 May 2019|publisher=Daily Echo|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Additionally, a primary health centre was procured under a [[Private Finance Initiative]] contract: this building, which was built by Geoffrey Osborne Ltd at a cost £16 million immediately to the south west of the community hospital, opened as the Adelaide Health Centre (named after the old isolation ship) in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10963824.controversial-adelaide-health-centre-in-southampton-cost-16m-to-build/|title=Controversial Adelaide Health Centre in Southampton cost £16m to build|date=26 January 2014|publisher=Daily Echo|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshirelift.co.uk/1st-project|title=Adelaide Health Centre in Southampton|publisher=Hampshire LIFT|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>
