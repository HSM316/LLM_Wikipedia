The '''Helanshan montane conifer forests''' [[ecoregion]] (WWF ID:PA0508) covers an isolated, forested mountain range surrounded by desert and semi-arid basins.  As such, it has been called a "mountain island in the sky", and supports endemic species of plants and animals.<ref name="wwf">{{cite web|title=Helanshan montane conifer forests|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0508|publisher=World Wildlife Federation (WWF)|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="ecomap">{{cite web|title=Map of Ecoregions 2017|url=https://ecoregions2017.appspot.com/|publisher=Resolve, using WWF data|language=en|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref>  The region supports the endangered [[Helan Shan pika]].

== Location and description ==
{{main|Helan Mountains}}
The Helan Mountains ecoregions lies to the east of the [[Gobi_Desert#Alashan_Plateau_semi-desert|Alashan Plateau semi-desert]] ecoregion, and to the west of the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos plateau steppe]] ecoregion.  It is thus surrounded by arid basins.  The mountain range is 180 km long, and reaches a peak altitude of 3,556 meters. The lower valleys between ridges are less forested.

== Climate ==
The climate of the ecoregion is ''[[Semi-arid_climate#Cold_semi-arid_climates|cold semi-arid]]'' ([[Köppen climate classification]] [[Semi-arid_climate#Cold_semi-arid_climates|(BSk)]]).  This climate is generally characterized as a 'steppe' climate, with precipitation greater than a true desert, and also a colder temperature.<ref name="kop">{{cite web|author=Kottek, M., J.

== Flora and fauna ==
Within the ecoregion, tree cover depends on the altitude zone.  The lower slopes of the mountains are semi-arid, supporting short Siberian elm ([[Ulmus pumila]]) trees near intermittent streams.  The valleys also support stands of Chinese red pine ([[Pinus tabuliformis]]).  Higher on the hillsides are drought-adapted shrubs of rose, elm, [[Caragana|caranga]], [[Ostryopsis|ostryopsis]] (a type of birch tree), and juniper.  At the highest elevations, tree cover is mostly dragon spruce ([[Picea asperata]], birch and poplar.)<ref name="wwf"/>
