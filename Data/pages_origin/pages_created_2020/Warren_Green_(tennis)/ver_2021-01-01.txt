==Biography==
Originally from [[Durban]], Green competed on the professional tennis circuit in the 1980s. His uncle, through second wife Marjorie, was England and Fulham footballer [[Johnny Haynes]], who helped Green get set up with accommodation when he moved to London to begin his tennis career.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=James |title=Johnny Haynes: Portrait of a Football Genius |date=3 August 2017 |publisher=Pitch Publishing |isbn=1785313479}}</ref>

During his career he twice featured in the singles qualifying draw at Wimbledon and as a doubles player reached the third round of the [[1987 Wimbledon Championships]], with [[Pieter Aldrich]].

Green, who later immigrated to Australia, married British tennis player Lisa Gould. Their son [[Chris Green (cricketer)|Chris]] was born while the couple lived in Durban and he now plays cricket for New South Wales.<ref>{{cite news |title=State Push on For All-rounder Chris Green |url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/the-hills/former-knox-grammar-and-northern-district-allrounder-chris-green-chosen-for-sydney-thunder-for-t20-big-bash-league/news-story/e9582d4d11ef0ede1cfa656c18d47a7c |work=[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 December 2014}}</ref>
