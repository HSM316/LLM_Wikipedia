==Early life==
Hammack started playing music at age 13 which helped her to feel different in her hometown where she never felt like she belonged anywhere.<ref name="theboot">{{cite web |last1=Liptak |first1=Carena |title=Who Is Caylee Hammack? 5 Things You Need to Know |url=https://theboot.com/who-is-caylee-hammack/ |website=The Boot |accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref> While not getting much of a music education or vocal lessons, she self-taught by listening and singing songs on the country radio.<ref name="allaccessinterview">{{cite web |title=10 Questions with ...

She wrote her first song, "Addictive", about the pain pills she had to take after the surgery.<ref name="billboard19">{{cite web |last1=Reuter |first1=Annie |title=Emerging Country Artist Spotlight: Caylee Hammack |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8503871/caylee-hammack-rising-country-artist-spotlight |website=Billboard |accessdate=2 May 2020}}</ref>

While her brother played [[Southern rock]] and her sister [[Britney Spears]] songs, she discovered the country genre for herself and counts [[Dixie Chicks]] and the [[SHeDAISY]] as her early inspirations.<ref name="toc-intro">{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Cillea |title=Who Is Caylee Hammack?

Her first ticket to Nashville was her full music scholarship to [[Belmont University]] at age 18, which she ended up declining because her boyfriend persuaded her to stay in Ellaville with him. After the two broke up, she started to follow her interest in music again, and a call from [[Luke Bryan]] gave her the final motivation to move to Nashville.<ref name="billboard-luke-bryan">{{cite web |title=Caylee Hammack, Cindy Mabe & More Featured as Speakers at 2019 CMA EDU Executive Summit |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8523979/caylee-hammack-cindy-mabe-2019-cma-edu-executive-summit |website=Billboard |accessdate=3 May 2020 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> She moved at the end of 2013 with about $1000 of savings, a high school diploma, her clothes in trash bags, and playing [[Kacey Musgraves]] debut album for the seven-hour drive.<ref name="rollingstoneinterview">{{cite web |title=Country Singer-Songwriter Caylee Hammack on Her Love of David Bowie, Finding Strength as an Artist |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/caylee-hammack-country-singer-morning-sessions-868494/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2 May 2020}}</ref> She soon found herself sleeping in her car after spending the money she came with.

Hammack wrote "Small Town Hypocrite" while still being a staff writer, together with Jared Scott, about the breakup with her boyfriend who cheated on her, which eventually brought her to Nashville.

She was scheduled to open for [[Reba McEntire]] and Luke Bryan in 2020 but the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] pandemic cut her Europe tour short.
