On that date, Yeule premiered the video and released the single for their new song "Sulky Baby" and announced that they had signed to the [[Ninja Tune]] label. They told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "The creative trajectory is shapeshifting, and Ninja Tune was the most versatile with their views on artistic direction as most of my creative pitches often tend to be fringe in conceptual aspects. I admire the team's work ethic and tastes, and they've also worked with other creatives I know and love to this day, it feels nice to be with them!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/news/yeule-shares-new-single-sulky-baby-and-announces-new-deal-with-ninja-tune-29093/|title=Yeule shares new single 'Sulky Baby' and announces new deal with Ninja Tune|website=Rolling Stone (UK)|date=10 May 2023|access-date=10 May 2023}}</ref> "Sulky Baby" was included on their third album, ''[[softscars]]'', which was released on September 22, 2023 to critical acclaim.

Their work combines the rebellious tones of [[emo]] nostalgia with [[avant-pop]] [[Experimental pop|cyber experimentation]]. Some of their favorite albums are My Chemical Romance's ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]'', Avril Lavigne's ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' and ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]''; and Smashing Pumpkins' ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'' and ''[[Siamese Dream]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zhang |first1=Cat |title=Logging Off and Rocking Out With yeule, Pop's Internet Explorer |url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/logging-off-and-rocking-out-with-yeule-pops-internet-explorer/ |website=Pitchfork |date=11 September 2023 |access-date=10 November 2023 |quote=Logging Off and Rocking Out With yeule, Pop’s Internet Explorer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jamieson |first1=Sarah |title=UNDER THE SKIN: YEULE |url=https://diymag.com/interview/yeule-album-softscars-september-2023 |website=DIY |date=25 September 2023 |access-date=10 November 2023 |quote=We have so many references from the '90s and '00s, like Radiohead, My Chemical Romance… Honestly, Gerard Way changed my fucking life," they enthuse giddily. "I was nine years old when I found 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' and did not understand what that was all about until later on, but the emotional lyricism and the musical aspect of it punched me when I was a kid.  "Then we were listening to a lot of Avril Lavigne, the stuff that we grew up on with our iPods. Like, 'Oh we should totally do some Pixies shit, or Smashing Pumpkins!' We were listening to all this music that's very sentimental to us, because we're '90s kids.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Raza-Sheik |first1=Zoya |title=Entering yeule's rockstar cyber dimension |url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/amplify/entering-yeules-rockstar-cyber-dimension/ |website=Gay Times |date=6 October 2023 |access-date=10 November 2023 |quote=To capture this, the singer trawled through their old listening habits: Avril Lavigne, Smashing Pumpkins, and Hole. "I was listening to so much of what I enjoyed when I was a teenager because it made me feel that age again – that's why I fucking vibed with you! I'm a big fan of Gerard Way. He is so pivotal to my life," they say animatedly. "I don't think I don't think anyone realises how much I love My Chemical Romance or Avril Lavigne. C'mon, 'Sulky Baby' literally sounds like 'Complicated'.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Farrel |first1=Margaret |title=Album Of The Week: yeule softscars |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2236537/album-of-the-week-yeule-softscars/reviews/album-of-the-week/ |website=Stereogum |date=19 September 2023 |access-date=10 November 2023 |quote=On softscars, they're combining their human experience with their cyber identity, drawing from childhood influences like Avril Lavigne, My Chemical Romance, and the Smashing Pumpkins.}}</ref>
