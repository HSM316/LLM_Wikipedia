'''Madison Lake State Park''' is a public recreation area located four miles southeast of [[London, Ohio|London]] in the Darby Plains region of [[Madison County, Ohio]], in the United States.<ref name=odnr/> The [[state park]] includes the {{convert|106|acre}} [[Madison Lake (Ohio)|Madison Lake]], for which it was named, and an additional {{convert|76|acre}} of land surrounding the lake.

The lake was formed in 1947 when a [[Madison Lake Dam|dam]] was built on Deer Creek in Madison County, Ohio. The site was handed over to the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]] (ODNR) in 1950.  The small community of [[Madison Lake, Ohio]], also named after the reservoir, lies on the western shores of the lake.<ref name=Cross>Cross, Tom, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ky5CAAAQBAJ Fishing Ohio: An Angler's Guide To Over 200 Fishing Spots In The Buckeye State]'', Rowman & Littlefield, May 1, 2008, Pgs. 55-56.</ref>

ODNR maintains a boat ramp, a {{convert|300|ft}} sand beach area, changing booths and restrooms, picnic areas, shelter houses, as well as a {{convert|1|mi}} hiking trial all along the southern end of the lakeshore. The north end of the lake is reserved for [[Anseriformes|migratory game bird]] hunting.<ref>''[https://boa247.com/madison-lake-state-park Madison Lake State Park]'', BreathawayOutdoorsAmerica.com, Accessed: January 01, 2020.</ref> The lake itself is also a very popular fishing location, with a variety of species found in the lake. Although the park headquarters are located at [[Deer Creek State Park (Ohio)|Deer Creek State Park]], a small office is maintained on site.<ref name=Cross/>
