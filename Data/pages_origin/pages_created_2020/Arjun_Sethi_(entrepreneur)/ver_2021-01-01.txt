=== Angel investments ===
Sethi began [[angel investor|angel investing]] at Lolapps. He is now considered one of the top angel investors in [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name="midas">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/truebridge/2020/04/14/the-2020-midas-brink-list-meet-venture-capitals-up-and-comers/#73145ae77526 The 2020 Midas Brink List: Meet Venture Capital's Up-And-Comers]</ref> His angel investments include [[Opendoor]], [[Gusto (company)|Gusto]] and [[Long-Term Stock Exchange]].<ref name="midas" /> 

=== MessageMe and Yahoo ===
Later in 2012, Sethi became co-founder and CEO of [[mobile messaging]] app [[MessageMe]]. MessageMe reached 5 million users within 75 days of launch.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Santos |first1=Alexis |title=MessageMe chat app amasses 5 million users in 75 days across Android and iOS |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-22-messageme-reaches-5-million-users-in-75-days.html |work=Engadget |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> The company raised close to $12 million across two rounds of funding led by [[Greylock Partners]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lunden |first1=Ingrid |title=MessageMe Raises a $10M Series A Led by Greylock As It Gears Up for Money and Premium Services in Its Rich Messaging App |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/16/messageme-raises-a-10m-series-a-led-by-greylock-as-it-gears-up-for-money-and-premium-services-in-its-rich-messaging-app/ |work=TechCrunch |date=16 May 2013}}</ref>

MessageMe's rapid growth led to Facebook [[MessageMe#Controversy|revoking its access]] to the [[Facebook Platform]]’s “Find Friends” functionality for competitive reasons.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cutler |first1=Kim-Mai |title=Facebook Brings Down the Hammer Again: Cuts Off MessageMe's Access to Its Social Graph |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/facebook-messageme/ |work=TechCrunch |date=16 March 2013}}</ref> Leaked internal Facebook emails expressed concern about resulting negative publicity for Facebook, particularly given Sethi’s relationship with Social Capital and previous position at Lolapps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook sealed exhibits in Six4Three v. Facebook |url=https://dataviz.nbcnews.com/projects/20191104-facebook-leaked-documents/assets/facebook-sealed-exhibits.pdf#page=1029}}</ref>

In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched [[Yahoo! Livetext]], an audio-free video messaging app. It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016.<ref name="wsj-scp"></ref>

=== Social Capital ===
In early 2016, Sethi left Yahoo to join Social Capital as an investing partner focused on consumer startups.<ref name="wsj-scp"></ref>

At Social Capital, Sethi backed the firm's investments in and served on the [[board of directors]] of [[EShares|Carta]], [[Relativity Space]], Cover, and CryptoMove.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-16/another-social-capital-partner-departs-venture-capital-firm|title=Another Social Capital Partner Departs Venture Capital Firm}}</ref>
