== Career ==
=== Lolapps ===
In 2008, Sethi took the role as CEO of [[Lolapps]], which developed [[Social-network_game|social games]] on the [[Facebook platform]]. Lolapps developed [[Ravenwood Fair]] which had 10 million monthly active users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/22/lolapps-launches-a-novel-expansion-for-ravenwood-fair-facebook-game/|title=LOLapps launches a novel expansion for Ravenwood Fair Facebook game|date=February 22, 2011}}</ref> At its peak, Lolapps had 150 million monthly active users across its portfolio of games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/10/19/creator-of-the-fierce-doom-and-quake-games-tries-his-hand-at-a-cute-facebook-game/|title=Creator of the fierce Doom and Quake games tries his hand at a cute Facebook app|date=October 20, 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, 6waves Lolapps laid off most of its development team and Sethi left to join venture capital firm [[Social Capital (venture capital)|Social Capital]] as an [[entrepreneur in residence]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cutler |first=Kim-Mai |date=2012-05-08 |title=Former Lolapps CEO Arjun Sethi Lands At Former Facebook VP's Chamath Palihapitiya's Fund As An EIR |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/08/former-lolapps-ceo-arjun-sethi-lands-at-former-facebook-vps-chamath-palihapitiyas-fund-as-an-eir/ |access-date=2023-09-27 |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US}}</ref>

6waves Lolapps subsequently rebranded itself as 6waves, dropping Lolapps from its name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/6waves-drops-lolapps-name-entirely-announces-publishing-deals-with-32-social-developers/|title=6waves drops "Lolapps" name entirely, announces publishing deals with 32 social developers|website=www.adweek.com|date=28 March 2012 }}</ref> In January 2022, [[Stillfront Group]] acquired 6waves for $201M.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-selling-stake-in-6waves-to-stillfront-for-usd93m|title=Stillfront acquires 6Waves for $201m|website=www.gamesindustry.biz|date=21 January 2022 }}</ref>

=== Angel investments ===
Sethi began [[angel investor|angel investing]] at Lolapps. He is considered one of the top angel investors in [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name="midas">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/truebridge/2020/04/14/the-2020-midas-brink-list-meet-venture-capitals-up-and-comers/#73145ae77526 The 2020 Midas Brink List: Meet Venture Capital's Up-And-Comers]</ref> His angel investments include [[Opendoor]], [[Gusto (company)|Gusto]] and [[Long-Term Stock Exchange]].<ref name="midas" />

=== MessageMe and Yahoo ===
In 2012, Sethi became co-founder and CEO of [[mobile messaging]] app [[MessageMe]]. MessageMe reached five million users within 75 days of launch.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Santos |first1=Alexis |title=MessageMe chat app amasses 5 million users in 75 days across Android and iOS |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-22-messageme-reaches-5-million-users-in-75-days.html |work=Engadget |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> The company raised close to $12 million across two rounds of funding led by [[Greylock Partners]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lunden |first1=Ingrid |title=MessageMe Raises a $10M Series A Led by Greylock As It Gears Up for Money and Premium Services in Its Rich Messaging App |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/16/messageme-raises-a-10m-series-a-led-by-greylock-as-it-gears-up-for-money-and-premium-services-in-its-rich-messaging-app/ |work=TechCrunch |date=16 May 2013}}</ref>

MessageMe's rapid growth led to Facebook [[MessageMe#Controversy|revoking its access]] to the [[Facebook Platform]]’s “Find Friends” functionality for competitive reasons.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cutler |first1=Kim-Mai |title=Facebook Brings Down the Hammer Again: Cuts Off MessageMe's Access to Its Social Graph |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/facebook-messageme/ |work=TechCrunch |date=16 March 2013}}</ref> Leaked internal Facebook emails expressed concern about resulting negative publicity for Facebook, particularly given Sethi’s relationship with Social Capital and previous position at Lolapps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook sealed exhibits in Six4Three v.

In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched [[Yahoo! Livetext]], an audio-free video messaging app. It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016.<ref name="wsj-scp"></ref>

=== Social Capital ===
In early 2016, Sethi left Yahoo to join [[Social Capital (venture capital)|Social Capital]] as an investing partner focused on consumer startups.<ref name="wsj-scp"></ref>
