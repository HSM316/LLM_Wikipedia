== Reception ==
When TVB first announced the drama will air in February 2020 which is considered an unpopular time slot, it was expected the drama will receive lower viewership. However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Hong Kong went into a strict lockdown in February 2020, which gave viewership ratings a large boost, making the series the most watched drama since 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=《法證先鋒IV》破紀錄　成為近七年最高收視劇集|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82%E5%A8%9B%E6%A8%82/457572/%E6%94%B6%E8%A6%96%E6%BB%AF%E5%BE%8C%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%B3%95%E8%AD%89%E5%85%88%E9%8B%92iv-%E7%A0%B4%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84-%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E8%BF%91%E4%B8%83%E5%B9%B4%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E6%94%B6%E8%A6%96%E5%8A%87%E9%9B%86}}</ref> However, the drama was criticized by audiences for its predictable and average plot compared to its predecessors, especially in the latter half of the series.<ref>{{Cite web|title="Forensic Heroes 4" Ends on High Ratings Despite Lack of Novelty – JayneStars.com|url=https://www.jaynestars.com/news/forensic-heroes-4-ends-on-high-ratings-despite-lack-of-novelty/|access-date=2021-08-31|language=en-US}}</ref>
