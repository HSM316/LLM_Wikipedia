'''Ratpert''' was the abbot of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]] for about eight months in 782. He mentioned in the oldest list of abbots between Abbots [[John II (bishop of Constance)|John]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau|Waldo]]. Since John died on 9 February 782 and the earliest surviving act of Ratpert's successor, Waldo, dates to 8 November 782, the abbacy of Ratpert must have lasted from February to November at the most. In the ''Casus sancti Galli'' of his namesake, the monk [[Ratpert of Saint Gall|Ratpert]], he is not mentioned save in a marginal note added later. In the 11th century, [[Hermann of Reichenau]] placed his abbacy in 781. The Calvinist writer [[Melchior Goldast]] recorded his anniversary as commemorated on April 29.<ref name=Duft>Johannes Duft, [http://www.wilnet.ch/default.aspx?Command=PrdtDetail&prdtName=d2c3605c-d623-4766-8513-9a1c5600ff8f Abt Ratpert (782)], ''Die Abtei St.Gallen'' (St. Gallen, 1986).</ref>
