The '''Celtic currency of Britain''' were the various items and coins used as currencies between approximately 200BC and 60AD. The earliest currency consisted of various forms of iron bars. Coins were first imported in large numbers in around 150BC and domestic minting began around 100BC. Coin production was largely ended by the [[Roman conquest of Britain]]. First by the Claudian invasion of 43AD and later by the [[Defeat of Boudica]] in AD 60 or 61. Cast coins may have been produced few a more more years around Hengistbury Head. Exact dating of coins often changes in the light of new research.<ref name=Curteis23>{{cite thesis |last=Curteis |first=Mark Edward |date=2001 |title=The Iron Age coinages of the south midlands, with particular reference to distribution and deposition |type=Ph.D.|chapter=5.Iron Age coinages of the south midlands|page=23 |publisher=Durham University |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1231/2/1231_v2.pdf |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref>

Coin use is usually divided into a core area which covers the [[home counties]] as well as parts of Oxfordshire Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire.<ref name=Curteis20 /> This was surrounded by a periphery of coin using groups some of which, the [[Corieltauvi]], [[Durotriges]], [[Dobunni]] and [[Iceni]], appear to have minted their own coinage.<ref name=Curteis20 /> The coins in the core area are generally attributed to the [[Atrebates]] and [[Cantii]] in the areas south of the Thames and the [[Trinovantes]] and [[Catuvellauni]] to the north.<ref name=Curteis20>{{cite thesis |last=Curteis |first=Mark Edward |date=2001 |title=The Iron Age coinages of the south midlands, with particular reference to distribution and deposition |type=Ph.D.|chapter=4.The study area|page=20 |publisher=Durham University |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1231/2/1231_v2.pdf |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref>

==Iron bar  and other non coinage currency==
[[File:Iron_bar_currency.JPG|thumb|right|Sword type Iron bar currency]]
The first currency in Britain appears to have been iron [[currency bar]]s first appearing around 200BC.<ref name=Cunliffe499 /> Currency bars have been found in four forms known as sword-shaped, spit shaped, plough-shaped and bay-leaf-shaped.<ref name=Cunliffe499 /> It has been suggested that these shapes were used to show the origin of the bars.<ref name=Cunliffe499 /> The bars generally weigh between 0.5 and 0.3kg<ref name=Cunliffe499>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |date= 2005|title=Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest |edition=4th| |publisher=Routledge  |page=495 |isbn=9780415562928}}</ref> Spit shaped bars are the most commonly found representing half of all finds.<ref name=Henderson280 /> Sword shaped bars make up another 40 percent.<ref name=Henderson280>{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Julian  |date=2000 |title=The Science and Archaeology of Materials: An Investigation of Inorganic Materials  |publisher=Routledge |page=280-282 |isbn=0415199344}} </ref>

What appears to be iron bar currency was mentioned in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]].<ref name=Einzig /> There are variances in the surviving texts meaning that it is possible the original text was referring to iron ring money.<ref name=Einzig /> However iron bar currency is considered more likely in the light of archaeological discoveries. <ref name=Einzig>{{cite book |last=Einzig |first=Paul |date=2014  |title=Primitive Money: In its Ethnological, Historical and Economic Aspects|publisher=Elsevier |pages=234-238 |isbn=1483157156 }}</ref>

Historically it has been claimed that gold rings were used as currency but improved dating has rendered this claim unlikely.<ref name=Arsdellring>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanarsdellcelticcoinageofbritain.com/history/earliest_use_of_money_1.html |title=Earliest use of money |last1=Van Arsdell |first1=R.

==Coins==
===Names===
The original names of British Celtic coins are unknown.<ref name=Beanmeth17>{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=Methodology |pages=17-18|publisher=University of Nottingham. |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>
Modern researchers have given coins whether inscribed on uniscribed various names. Gold coins are described as [[stater]]s or [[quarter stater]]s with the name deriving from greek coins.<ref name=denominations /><ref name=Beanmeth17 /> Gold staters generally weighed between 6.5 and 4.5 grams.<ref name=Beanmeth17 /> Quarter staters as their name suggests had about a quarter of the weight of gold staters.<ref name=Beanmeth17 /> A few gold coins without clear weight relationships to staters are sometimes called gold fractions.<ref name=Beanmeth17 />

Silver coins are described as starters, units, half units and minims.<ref name=denominations /> Units generally weighed between 1.4 and 0.8 grams with half units about half the weight of units.<ref name=Beanmeth17 /> Minims covers the various silver coins weighing less than 0.4 grams.<ref name=Beanmeth17 />

Copper alloy coins are described as staters, quarter staters and units with cast staters and potins being considered separately.<ref name=denominations>{{cite web |url=https://finds.org.uk/ironagecoins/denominations |title=Iron Age denominations |website=Portable Antiquities Scheme |publisher=British museum |access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref>

More specific names for individual coin types generally consist of catalog numbers although in some cases simple descriptions are used.<ref name=Creighton /> Over the decades various catalogs have been compiled with Van Arsdell's 1989 catalog being the most popular.<ref name=Creighton /> Overlap between catalogs does however mean that a coin can have as many as 7 different names.<ref name=Creighton>{{cite book |last=Creighton |first=john |date=2000 |title=Coins and Power in Late Iron Age Britain |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=222-225 |isbn=9780521114516 }}</ref>

===Methods of Manufacture===
[[File:Stater and die.JPG|thumb|right|From top to bottom; a die for striking a Gallo-Belgic A Stater, a blank of the type that would be stuck and a Gallo-Belgic A Stater]]
Most British Celtic coins were stuck although a few were cast.<ref name=jersey10 />

The exact details of the method by which stuck coins were struck remains unclear.<ref name=jersey10 /> It is thought most likely that struck coins were made by a four step process.<ref name=jersey10 /> Firstly a fairly exact amount (accuracies of a few milligrams or better have been recorded) of metal would be weighed out in the form of powder or nugget.<ref name=jersey10 /> The metal would then be placed in a clay mould and heated to form a blank.<ref name=jersey10 /> Examples of these moulds have been found in archaeological excavations.<ref name=jersey10 /> The blank would then be flattened before finally being placed between two [[Coining_(mint)#Ancient_coin_dies|dies]] and struck.<ref name=jersey10 /> The lower die would be concave in order to hold the blank in place while the upper die would be be convex.<ref name=jersey10 /> The dies were frequently larger than the blanks being struck resulting in only part of the design appearing on the coin.<ref name=jersey10 /> [[Experimental archeology]] suggests that a lower die could be expected to last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable.<ref name=Beanmeth28 /> Upper dies seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported.<ref name=Beanmeth28 /> Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers could get as many s 47,000 stikes out of an individual die.<ref name=Beanmeth28>{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=Methodology |pages=28-29|publisher=University of Nottingham. |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>

It is possible that in some cases that instead of moulds being used the metal would be melted and poured onto a flat surface.<ref name=jersey10 />

A number of coins from the period consisting of a base metal core and a precious metal coating have been found.<ref name=jersey10 /> These would have been made by coating the base metal with thin layer of precious metal then striking the blank.<ref name=jersey10 /> While these coins for the most part appear to have been straightforward forgeries some appear to have been struck using the same dies as non forgeries making their status less clear.<ref name=jersey10 />

In the case of cast coins a series of clay moulds joined by [[Casting (metalworking)#The gating system|runners]] were used.<ref name=jersey10 /> The patterns on the coins were produced by pressing a pattern into the clay or in simpler cases scratching lines in it.<ref name=jersey10 /> Molten metal would then be poured into the moulds.<ref name=jersey10 /> Once the metal had cooled the moulds would be broken to access the coins.<ref name=jersey10>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=10-14 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref>

===Imported coins===

The the earliest coins to appear in the British archaeological record are third or forth century BC Carthaginian bronzes although it seems unlikely that they were used as currency.<ref name=jersey15 /> It is possible that these coins entered Celtic society as payment to mercenaries by [[Carthage]] and [[Syracuse]].<ref name=Reden61>{{cite book |last=Reden |first=Sitta von|date=18 Nov 2010 |title=Money in Classical Antiquity  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=61 |isbn=9780521453370}}</ref> Other coins from the end of the third century start of the second century BC have been found but there is no evidence for their use as currency and the situation is complicated by contamination by modern losses.<ref name=jersey15>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=15 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> Post antiquity a direct trade route for Greek coins into Britain has existed since the creation of the [[Levant Company]] in the late 16th century.<ref name=Penhallurick2>{{cite book |last=Penhallurick |first=R.D |date=2010 |title=Ancient and Early Medieval Coins from Cornwall & Scilly |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/83/8814102.pdf |publisher= Royal Numismatic Society |pages=2-3 |isbn=0 901405 49 3}}</ref>

Around 150BC [[Gallo-Belgic Stater]]s started being imported into Britain.<ref name=jersey159 /> These coins followed designs ultimately derived from the [[Stater]]s issued by [[Philip II of Macedon]] and were made from gold.<ref name=jersey159 />  Philip's staters featured on the obverse the head of [[Apollo]] wearing a wreath.<ref name=jersey6 /> On the reverse they carried an image of a [[Biga (chariot)|Biga chariot]] being pulled by two horses and carrying a figure wielding a whip.<ref name=jersey6>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=6 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> Six series of Gallo-Belgic Staters issues are known as A through to F with subtypes such as AA and AB (in this case defined by the direction in which the bust faces).<ref name=jersey159 /><ref name=Beanmeth36>{{cite thesis |last=Bean|first=Simon C|date=1994 |title=The coinage of Atrebates and Regni |type=Ph.D. |chapter=Gallo-Belgic gold coinage |page=36|publisher=University of Nottingham. |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11944/1/262143.pdf |access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>  Of these it is C through to F that would have the most impact on later British coin designs.<ref name=jersey159 /> The minting of these coins came to an end with the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest of Gaul]].<ref name=jersey159>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=15-19 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> It is possible that at least some of these coins were produced in Britain instead of being imported.<ref name=Curteis24>{{cite thesis |last=Curteis |first=Mark Edward |date=2001 |title=The Iron Age coinages of the south midlands, with particular reference to distribution and deposition |type=Ph.D.|chapter=5.Iron Age coinages of the south midlands|pages=24-26 |publisher=Durham University |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1231/2/1231_v2.pdf |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref> A die for striking Gallo Belgic A coins has been found in [[Bredgar]], [[Kent]] but it isn't clear if it was used for official strikes or forgeries.<ref name=leins>{{cite web |url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/11/the-die-that-struck-britains-first-coins/ |title=The die that struck Britain’s first coins? |last1=Leins |first1=Ian |last2=Morris |first2=Emma |date=11 April 2014 |website=British Museum blog |publisher= British Museum |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref>

Along with the Gallo-Belgic Stater series other coins from the content have been found in Britian.<ref name=Penhallurick4 /> [[Ambiani]] coins have been found along the south coast of the [[West Country]] possibly arriving there as the result of trade across the [[English channel]].<ref name=Penhallurick4>{{cite book |last=Penhallurick |first=R.D |date=2010 |title=Ancient and Early Medieval Coins from Cornwall & Scilly |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/83/8814102.pdf |publisher= Royal Numismatic Society |page=4 |isbn=0 901405 49 3}}</ref>

===Potins===

[[Kentish cast bronzes]] (historically refereed to as Thurrock potins) appear to have been the first coins made in Britain dating from the end of the second century BC.<ref name=jersey20 /> They appear to have circulated mainly in Kent and were based on coins issued by [[Massalia]] (now Marseille in modern France).<ref name=jersey20>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=20 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref><ref name=Cunliffe133>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |date= 2005|title=Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest |edition=4th| |publisher=Routledge  |page=133 |isbn=9780415562928}}</ref> Various other potins were issued with production ending around 50BC.<ref name=jersey21>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=21 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> These coins were [[Cast coinage|cast]] rather than [[Hammered coinage|struck]].<ref name=jersey14>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=14 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> Although potins were around at the same time as the first british gold coins they aren't found together which suggests they served a different role in society.<ref name=Curteis27>{{cite thesis |last=Curteis |first=Mark Edward |date=2001 |title=The Iron Age coinages of the south midlands, with particular reference to distribution and deposition |type=Ph.D.|chapter=5.Iron Age coinages of the south midlands|page=27 |publisher=Durham University |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1231/2/1231_v2.pdf |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref> Potins continued to circulate for some time after the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and they have been found in burials dating to the late roman period.<ref name=Atkinson>{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=Mark |last2=Preston |first2=Stephen J. |date=2015 |title=Heybridge: A late Iron Age and Roman settlement.

===Uninscribed Staters===
[[File:British A stater with scale.png|thumb|right|British A stater scale in cm]]
The first known British stater was based on the Gallo-Belgic C Stater and appears to have been made by melting down said staters and re-striking them.<ref name=Curteis28 /> It is referred as the British A stater or the Westerham and Ingoldisthorpe stater and they were probably made shortly after 100BC.<ref name=Curteis28 /> The coin is often credited to the [[Atrebates]] kingdom but this is uncertain.<ref name=Curteis28>{{cite thesis |last=Curteis |first=Mark Edward |date=2001 |title=The Iron Age coinages of the south midlands, with particular reference to distribution and deposition |type=Ph.D.|chapter=5.Iron Age coinages of the south midlands|page=28 |publisher=Durham University |url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1231/2/1231_v2.pdf |access-date=2015-10-27}}</ref>

A number of Addedomarus's coins featured a palm branch and which also appeared on the stater of his apparent successor [[Dubnovellaunus]].<ref name=jersey34 /> As with his predecessor Dubnovellaunus produced silver and bronze coins although in fairly small amounts.<ref name=jersey34 />

Tasciovanus apparent son [[Cunobelin]] managed to gain control of the entire region.<ref name=jersey36 /> His staters again featured the palm branch among other things.<ref name=jersey36 /> His bronze and silver coins developed over time from Celtic influenced designs to ones influenced by a very wide range of Mediterranean coinage.<ref name=jersey36 /> Cunobelin's coins may have been the last issued in the area prior to the roman invasion in 43AD.<ref name=jersey36 /> A few coins have been attributed with little certainty to his sons.<ref name=jersey36>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=36-38 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref>

====Periphery to the north of the core area====

The first inscribed coinage in this area appear to have been struck by the [[Corieltauvi]] around 1AD and were closely based on the proceeding British K stater.<ref name=jersey45 /> The coins were inscribed with the letters VEP and and it has been suggested that this and other inscriptions refer to the names of leaders.<ref name=jersey45 /> These were followed by coins inscribed either AVN AST or AVN COST.<ref name=jersey45 /> After these issues the chronology becomes unclear and it is possible that at times there were multiple coin issuing authorities.<ref name=jersey45 /> The standard denominations appear to have been staters, silver units and silver half units although some of the rarer inscriptions haven't been found in all denominations.<ref name=jersey45>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=45-52 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> 

The other main tribal group in this region were the [[Iceni]] who started producing inscribed coins around 20AD.<ref name=VanArsdelliceni>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanarsdellcelticcoinageofbritain.com/history/last_uninscribed_coinages_2.html |title=Last uninscribed coinages Coinage in the North Thames Region 54 B.C. – 20 A.D |last1=Van Arsdell |first1=Robert |date=2013 |website=Celtic Coins of Britian |publisher= |access-date=30 November 2015 }}</ref> Their coins were fairly creative while sticking to firmly celtic themes up until their final issues.<ref name=jersey45 /> Its not clear who or what most of the inscriptions on the coins refer to although it has been suggested that ECEN is a version of Iceni.<ref name=jersey45 /> This would though run against general Celtic coin inscription practices.<ref name=jersey45 /> The last coins stuck by the Iceni appear to have been those of [[Prasutagus]].<ref name=jersey45 /> Unlike their predecessors these coins show heavy roman influence in their design.<ref name=jersey45 /> The defeat of the Iceni and the end of [[Boudicca]]'s revolt in 60 or 61AD brought an end to Iceni coin production.<ref name=jersey45 />

====Periphery to the west of the core area====

Two tribes in this area issued coins the [[Dobunni]] and [[Durotriges]].<ref name=jersey39 /> Their coin designs tended to be fairly conservative and show little roman influence.<ref name=jersey39>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |pages=39-44 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> 

The first inscribed Dobunni coins were those inscribed (and presumably issued by) BODVOC and CORIO.<ref name=jersey39 /> The exact chronology is unclear but CORIO appears to have started issuing coins around 30BC. <ref name=Cunliffe124>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |date= 2006 |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest |edition=3rd| |publisher=Routledge  |pages=124-127 |isbn=1134938039 }}</ref><ref name=jersey39 />It is possible that [[Bodvoc]] and [[Corio]] were ruling different parts of the Dobunni territory at around the same time.<ref name=jersey39 /> The Dobunni during this period appear to have mostly issued in silver with only irregular minting of gold coinage.<ref name=Cunliffe141 /> Bodvoc and Corio appear to have been followed by [[Comux]] and [[Catti]].<ref name=jersey39 /> Again the chronology is unclear and it is possible that they were ruling different parts of the Dobunni territory.<ref name=jersey39 /> Of the four (Bodvoc, Corio, Comux and Catti) only Bodvoc appears to have issued inscribed silver coins with the others possibly being to connected to various uniscribed silver coins that appear to have been issued in the area.<ref name=jersey39 /> Comux and Catti appear to have been followed by [[Anted]] and [[Eisv]] probably in that order.<ref name=jersey39 /> Unlike their predecessors they did issue inscribed silver units.<ref name=jersey39 />A branched emblem appears on the obverse of a number of the Dobunni's gold staters.<ref name=sellwood /> The symbol's significance and origins are unclear although corn, ferns and a derivative of the wreath on the British Q stater have all been suggested.<ref name=sellwood />

The Durotriges issued a series of rapidly debased coins through this period probably starting around 50BC with a largely silver (80%) stater (british B) with a fairly small percentage of gold.<ref name=Cunliffe124 /><ref name=jersey39 /><ref name=papworth55 /> It has been suggested that the tribe simply lacked access to gold at this point.<ref name=Cunliffe124/> Due to a lack of coins being found in a secure archoligical context there is some uncertainty over assigning some of the earlier coins to the Durotriges so it is possible true Durotrigian coinage didn't start until a few years later.<ref name=papworth55>{{cite book |last=Papworth |first=Martin |date=2011 |title=The Search for the Durotriges Dorset and the West Country in the Late Iron Age|publisher=The History Press |pages=55-99 |isbn=978075245736}}</ref> Regadless of the starting point the level of silver used in Durotrigian coins rapidly declined until by 30BC their coins were being stuck in bronze.<ref name=Cunliffe124/> Somewhere between 10AD and 40AD the Durotriges appear to have issued a silver unit inscribed with CRAB.<ref>https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/179362</ref> The final Durotrigian coins were cast bronzes that have largely been found around [[Hengistbury Head]].<ref name=papworth55 /><ref name=jersey43>{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=43 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}</ref> These have been found alongside roman coins and it certainly seems possible that they were minted after the roman conquest although the reason for this minting and why it would be allowed is unclear.<ref name=papworth55 /> Minting came to an end by 100AD.<ref name=papworth55 />

===Scotland and Wales===
No coins were minted in Wales or Scotland during this period.<ref name=guest /><ref name=Hunter /> Only 35 Celtic coins have been found in Wales with nearly 50% being those produced by the [[Dobunni]].<ref name=guest>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/share/research/projectreports/romancoins/ironage/index.html |title=Iron Age Coins |last1=Guest |first1=Peter |date= |website=Cardiff School of History, Archaeology and Religion |publisher=Cardiff University |access-date=13 November 2015 |quote=}}</ref>
