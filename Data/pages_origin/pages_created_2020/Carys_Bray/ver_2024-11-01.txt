Bray is wincingly honest and emotions are portrayed with an assurance that comes from understanding: Claire is hoarding 10 pounds a week from the housekeeping money without knowing why; her desire to weep in gratitude as cars pull over during the ambulance ride to the hospital with Issy, wanting not to tell her unconscious daughter stories as she sits in the intensive care unit but memorise every detail of her; Zippy's conviction that her sister's body is completely devoid of "Issy-ness" upon seeing it in the mortuary – all these ring true and make for arresting reading.}}</ref>
