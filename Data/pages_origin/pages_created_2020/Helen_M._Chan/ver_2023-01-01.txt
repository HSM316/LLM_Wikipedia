'''Helen M. Chan''' is the New Jersey Zinc Professor at [[Lehigh University]]. Her work considers the development of ceramic-metal [[Nanocomposite|nanocomposites]]. She is on the board of directors of the [[American Ceramic Society]].

== Early life and education ==
Chan was born in London and grew up in [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPSlCgAAQBAJ&q=Helen+Chan+governor%27s+prize+imperial&pg=PA57|title=Successful Women Ceramic and Glass Scientists and Engineers: 100 Inspirational Profiles|last=Madsen|first=Lynnette|date=2016-02-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-73360-8|language=en}}</ref> Her parents emigrated from [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=":0" /> She attended an open day at [[Imperial College London]] where she saw a demonstration involving [[liquid oxygen]] and became interested in materials science. She studied [[materials science]] at [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=":0" /> She received an academic scholarship and was awarded the Governor's Prize for outstanding academic performance in 1979. She was made a doctoral student at [[Imperial College London]] and in 1982 employed by the [[Department of Materials, Imperial College London|Department of Materials]] a postdoctoral researcher.<ref name=":0" /> Whilst a PhD student Chan attended a scientific conference in Denmark, where a bus driver remarked "teaching a woman science, one might as well teach a telegraph pole".<ref name=":0" /> Chan has described London as her favourite city.<ref name=":0" /> 

== Research and career ==
Chan joined the faculty at [[Lehigh University]] in 1986. Soon after she was appointed to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], where she worked in the Mechanical Properties Group of the Ceramics Division.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lehigh.edu/news/chan-named-department-chair-materials-science-and-engineering|title=Chan named department chair of materials science and engineering|website=Lehigh University|language=en|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/helen-m-chan|title=Helen M.

Chan's research considers the structure and material properties of [[Nanocomposite|nanocomposites]]. She uses reactive processing to create unique ceramic structures, which include cellular and nanopatterned materials. She has investigated how dopants and interfacial chemistry affect diffusion limited processes in ceramics.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://eng.umd.edu/event/3317/mse-seminar---professor-helen-m-chan-lehigh-university|title=MSE Seminar - Professor Helen M.
