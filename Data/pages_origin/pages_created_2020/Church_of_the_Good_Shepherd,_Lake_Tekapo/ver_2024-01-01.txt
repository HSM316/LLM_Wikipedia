The '''Church of the Good Shepherd''' on the shores of [[Lake Tekapo]] on the [[South Island]] of New Zealand is a small [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church used by various denominations. Built in 1935 as a memorial church to commemorate early settlers, it is one of the most photographed items in the country. It has a Category I heritage registration by [[Heritage New Zealand]].<ref name="NZHPT 311">{{NZHPT|311||2 December 2019}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:NZL-lake-tekapo-kirche-innen.jpg|thumb|left|View from within the church]]
Walter Ernest Detheridge Davies<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fenn |first1=Edward Liveing |title=Rev Walter Ernest Detheridge Davies [1499] |url=http://www.thekingscandlesticks.com/webs/pedigrees/1499.html |publisher=The Kings Candlesticks – Family Trees |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> became the vicar of [[Fairlie, New Zealand|Fairlie]] in February 1933. The Fairlie [[Curate|cure]] extended up to [[Mount Cook Village]] and Davies realised that the [[Mackenzie Basin]] needed its own church; he first suggested this to parishioners in September 1933. Davies also suggested that a large window should be incorporated so that there would be a view from within the church of the lake, based on the 1930 design of [[St James Church, Franz Josef|St James Church]] at [[Franz Josef, New Zealand|Franz Josef]] on the West Coast. The idea was taken up by various local [[wiktionary:runholder|runholder]]s who thought that it would be an appropriate way of acknowledging and commemorating their pioneering ancestors.<ref name="Doug Drake article">{{cite news |last1=Drake |first1=Doug |title=The flock that built a church |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/9987597/The-flock-that-built-a-church |accessdate=1 January 2020 |work=[[The Timaru Herald]] |date=29 April 2014}}</ref> The land for the building was given by the owners of Braemar Station, which is (mostly) located on the eastern shore of Lake Tekapo. A generous amount of land belongs to the church so that the building will continue to be sited on its own. [[Esther Hope]], a local artist from Grampians Station, provided sketch designs for the proposed church. The Christchurch architect Richard Strachan De Renzy Harman (1896–1953) based his 1933/1934 design on Hope's drawings.<ref name="NZHPT 311" />

==Construction==
[[File:Bell tower (8626016349).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The bell commemorates Audrey Barker (died 1935) and her grandfather [[Edward Sealy]]]]
The foundation stone for the church was laid by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], on 16 January 1935, in the presence of the [[Anglican Diocese of Christchurch|bishop of Christchurch]], [[Campbell West-Watson]], and vicar Davies.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title=Foundation stone |medium=photo |language=en |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Church_of_the_Good_Shepherd_261.JPG |access-date=31 December 2019  |format=jpg}}</ref> The building committee had decided that the church should blend into the environment. The grounds surrounding the church were deliberately left with their native vegetation. The church was clad in local stone and lichen was left on the stone to give it a natural look. The structure itself was made from concrete, with the stones as cladding. Fred Trott won the construction tender, but the work was carried out by Les Loomes and Doug Rodman; the latter was engaged to Trott's daughter. The stonework was done by Christchurch stonemason Jack Miller. A Christchurch firm installed the hardwood shingles.<ref name="Doug Drake article" /> Audrey Barker had died in February 1935 aged 21, and the Barker and Sealy families donated the bell for the church, commemorating both Audrey Barker and her grandfather, [[Edward Sealy]], who had explored many of the glaciers in the area during the 1860s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sealy, Edward Percy |url=http://canterburyphotography.blogspot.com/2009/06/sealey.html |publisher=Early New Zealand photographers and their successors |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> The bell was cast in Christchurch by W.

Even before the church was finished, ''[[The Press]]'' in Christchurch commented:

{{Pull quote|The whole effect of the little church is striking and has won the admiration of all who have seen it.|author=''The Press'' staff writer|source=26 July 1935 article<ref>{{cite news |title=Church at Lake Tekapo |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19350726.2.24 |accessdate=1 January 2020 |work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXXI |issue=21535 |date=26 July 1935 |page=8}}</ref>}}

==History==
Rodman, one of the two builders, was the first person to get married at the church. On 14 December 1935, he married Peggy Trott.<ref>{{cite news |title=Weddings |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19351216.2.10.7 |accessdate=2 January 2020 |work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXXI |issue=21657 |date=16 December 1935 |page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Untitled |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19351216.2.10.6.1 |accessdate=2 January 2020 |work=[[The Press]] |volume=LXXI |issue=21657 |date=16 December 1935 |page=3}}</ref>

The Australian oak shingles did not last in the harsh climate of the Mackenzie Basin and in 1957, the roof was covered with slate shingles instead.<ref name="NZHPT 311" />

On 5 September 1985, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now [[Heritage New Zealand]]) as a Category I structure, with register number 311.<ref name="NZHPT 311" /> The Church of the Good Shepherd is one of the most photographed items in New Zealand; photography within the building is no longer permitted as it interfered with worship.<ref name="NZHPT 311" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Downes |first1=Siobhan |title=The 'most photographed' places in New Zealand |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/destinations/nz/82565662/the-most-photographed-places-in-new-zealand |accessdate=2 January 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=1 August 2016}}</ref>

In late 2017, a fence was installed around the church grounds after "damage to the environment around the church, verbal abuse of staff, and tourists interrupting the church services".

As of 2018, the local vicar estimates that 600,000 people visit the church per year.<ref name=RNZ />
