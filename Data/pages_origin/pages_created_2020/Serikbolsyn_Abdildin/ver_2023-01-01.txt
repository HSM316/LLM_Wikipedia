'''Serikbolsyn Abdildauly Abdildin''' ({{lang-kk|Серікболсын Әбділдаұлы Әбділдин}}, ''Serikbolsyn Ábdildauly Ábdildın''; 25 November 1937 – 31 December 2019) was a Kazakh economist, politician, First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan|Communist Party]] from 1996 to 2010, member of the [[Mazhilis]] from 1999 to 2004 and a candidate in the [[1999 Kazakh presidential election|1999 presidential election]]. He is often described as "patriarch" for the formation of [[parliamentarism]] and the first-drafted [[Constitution of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Constitution]] in early years of independence. While proclaiming himself as a [[Communism|Communist]], Abdildin was vivid supporter for [[democracy]] and has called for reforms for a [[multi-party system]] with a [[rule of law]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-11-12|title=Серикболсын АБДИЛЬДИН, председатель Компартии Казахстана: Мы защищаем закон, а не буржуев|url=https://time.kz/news/archive/2008/11/12/7691|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-02|website=Время|language=ru}}</ref>

Äbdildin began his career as an [[agriculturist]] until becoming involved in politics from serving in Soviet state bodies in Kazakhstan to eventually becoming the head of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR]] where he was involved in the drafting of the new post-independent Constitution. After the dissolution of the legislature, he joined the opposition amidst President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]'s increase of executive powers by leading the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and has worked in various organisations and movements aiming at reforming Kazakhstan's political system into democratic form of governance until retiring from politics in 2010.

He continued in engaging towards scientific and teaching activities until passing away in late 2019 at the age 82.

==Early life and career==
Serikbolsyn Äbdildin was born in 1937 in the village of [[Qyzylkesek]] in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. His father, Äbilda Älimjanov, died in combat during [[World War II]] in 1943 when Abdildin was only six years old.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Айсаров|first=Данияр|date=2020-01-01|title="Оппозиционер, которого невозможно купить".

After graduating, he initially worked for three years in a farm in the [[Semipalatinsk Oblast, Kazakhstan|Semipalatinsk Oblast]]. From 1963, Abdildin attended the graduate school at the Veterinary Institute in [[Alma-Ata]] and between 1966 and 1967, he was employed there as a research assistant. He then worked in various positions at the State Planning Commission of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]].

== Political career ==
In 1982, he was appointed the First Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Kazakh SSR and in December 1985, he became the first deputy chairman of the State Agricultural Committee of the Kazakh SSR. Äbdildin held this position until July 1987, before becoming a permanent representative of the Kazakh Soviet Republic at the Council of Ministers of the [[Soviet Union]]. From April 1990, he was deputy chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR]] and then from 16 October 1991, as a Chairman of the Supreme Soviet which later became the [[Supreme Council of Kazakhstan]] in January 1993.

After Kazakhstan gained its independence, the associated loss of power of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the abolition of the 12th Convocation of the Supreme Council by President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], Äbdildin went into opposition in 1994. He was described as "tough" towards authorities but refused to confront despite having big support in fear of "causing instability".<ref name=":0" /> That same year, he became the chairman of the Republic Coordinating Council of Public Associations. In April 1996, Äbdildin became the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan|Communist Party]].

Äbdildin announced his bid for presidency on 11 October 1998.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=CANDIDATES EMERGE FOR EARLY JANUARY 1999 ELECTIONS.|url=https://jamestown.org/program/candidates-emerge-for-early-january-1999-elections/|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Jamestown|language=en-US}}</ref> He criticized President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] over his [[Free market|free-market]] policies to which he blamed for economic crisis in the country and proposed for Kazakhstan to instead implement a [[Mixed economy|mixed-economic system]]. Äbdildin also advocated for more spending in [[health care]] and [[education]]. In regards to fair election, he proposed for each candidate to have a representative in the [[Central Election Commission (Kazakhstan)|election commission]]. However, his ideas were ignored by authorities.<ref name=":1" /> Äbdildin took 2nd place in the race and won around 12% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kusainov|first=Aldar|date=2002-03-19|title=Refworld {{!}} Opposition in Kazakhstan press campaign to dilute president's authority|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/46c58f27c.html|access-date=2020-11-13|website=Refworld|publisher=EurasiaNet|language=en}}</ref> He condemned the results, claiming to garner "as many votes as Nazarbayev did."<ref name=":0" />

=== Member of the Mazhilis (1999–2004) ===
Äbdildin was elected as one of the three Communist Party MPs in the [[Mazhilis]] after the [[1999 Kazakh legislative election]]. From there, he was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Security.<ref>[https://rus.azattyq.org/a/serikbolsyn_abdildin_book_about_nazarbaev/1886424.html Серикболсын Абдильдин выпустил книгу о мифах и реалиях президента Назарбаева]</ref> That same year, he became the co-chair of the Forum of Democratic Forces of Kazakhstan.

From 2002 to 2003, he was member of the Political Council of the [[Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan]] (QDT). In April 2004, the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] (QKP) became split after the internal disputes with the faction led by [[Vladislav Kosarev]] who went on to establish the [[Communist People's Party of Kazakhstan]] (QKHP). The QKHP members blamed Äbdildin of splitting the party and accused him of working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] by attempting to start a [[colour revolution]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2004-04-27|title=Есть такая партия! {{!}} Номад {{!}} 27.04.2004|url=https://nomad.su/?a=3-200404270010|access-date=2020-11-14|website=nomad.su|language=ru}}</ref> The move was seen to be made by Nazarbayev's regime in order to weaken Äbdildin's party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Isaacs|first=Rico|title=Party System Formation in Kazakhstan Between Formal and Informal Politics|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2011|isbn=9781136791086|pages=84}}</ref> That same year, Äbdildin became a member of the Coordination Council of the Democratic Forces of Kazakhstan.

=== Post-Parliamentarian career ===
On 2 November 2004, Äbdildin became a member of the National Commission on Democracy and Civil Society, created as an advisory body under the [[President of Kazakhstan]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-01|title=Ушел из жизни Серикболсын Абдильдин|url=https://almaty.tv/news/politika/1221-ushel-iz-dgizni-serikbolsyn-abdildin|access-date=2020-11-14|website=almaty.tv|language=ru}}</ref> On 20 March 2005, a [[Political alliance|political bloc]] [[For a Just Kazakhstan]] (EQU) was founded where Äbdildin spoke at the session.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2005-03-25|title=За справедливый Казахстан начинает и… скорее всего… {{!}} Номад {{!}} 25.03.2005|url=https://nomad.su/?a=3-200503250131|access-date=2020-11-14|website=nomad.su|language=ru}}</ref> From there, he was a member of the Presidium of the Council of EQU.<ref name=":0" />

On 20 March 2006, after the dissolution of the National Commission on Democracy and Civil Society, a State Commission was established to develop and concertize the program of democratic reforms in the Republic of Kazakhstan, of which Abdildin became a member of.

On 17 April 2010, a plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] was held, where Äbdildin resigned from the post as the First Secretary, saying that "everything has a limit and you can't always hold on to one position or chair."<ref name=":0" />

== Later life and death ==
After retiring from politics in 2010, Äbdildin continued in criticizing [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-10-23|title=Серикболсын АБДИЛЬДИН: "НАЗАРБАЕВ загнал страну в кризис"|url=https://zagranburo.org/%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BD-%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%B7%D0%B0/|access-date=2020-11-14|language=ru}}</ref>

In response to the ban of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] in September 2015, he believed that the move was made by authorities to prevent its interference in the country's elections and not because of the party's ideology.<ref>{{Cite web|last=МАМАШУЛЫ|first=Асылхан|date=2015-09-15|title=Оппозиционная Компартия хватается за соломинку|url=https://rus.azattyq.org/a/kompartia-kazakhstana-sud-zakrytie/27254967.html|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Радио Азаттык|language=ru}}</ref> In his last interview in June 2019, Äbdildin said that Nazarbayev should've resigned from presidency long ago and that his successor [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]] offers nothing in change of the country's leadership but is "more trustable" than his predecessor. He also suggested for a return to a 1993 Kazakh Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-20|title=Серикболсын Абдильдин: необходимо вернуть Конституцию 1993-его года|url=http://www.exclusive.kz/expertiza/obshhestvo/116215/|access-date=2020-11-14|website=exclusive.kz|language=ru}}</ref> He made his last public appearance at the [[Kurultai]] on 7 September 2019, saying the country should "get rid of Nazarbayev" to which he received applause from the audience.<ref>{{Cite web|last=K-News|date=2019-09-09|title="Избавиться от Назарбаева" и остановить проекты с Китаем.
