{{Short description|Romanesque-style Roman Catholic parish church}}
'''San Giovanni Evangelista''' is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-style [[Roman Catholic]] parish church located in the small town of [[Vacone]], in the [[province of Rieti]], region of [[Lazio]], Italy. 

== History ==
The church was built alongside the castle guarding the town. A church at the site was built in the 12th century, and underwent a number of refurbishments including a major one in 1539. The apse retains the semicircular architecture typical of Romanesque churches. The facade was decorated with baroque tiles. In a niche near the door is a faint fresco of the ''Virgin and Child'' form the 13th-century. The interior has five altars. The Main altarpiece is a [[triptych]] attributed to [[Antoniazzo Romano]], depicting the saints John the Evangelist flanked by the Apostle Paul and Proto-martyr St Stephen.

One of the altarpieces depicts the ''Madonna of the Rosary with Child offering the Crown of the [[Rosary]] and Saints Dominic and Catherine''. The painting is surrounded by the 15 [[Mysteries of the Rosary]]. The design of the painting is attributed to [[Girolamo Troppa]].
