'''Grove Colliery''' was a [[colliery]] in [[North Lanes, Staffordshire|North Lanes]], [[Staffordshire]]. Located between the villages of [[Pelsall]] and [[Norton Canes]]. It opened in 1852 as Wyrley Grove Colliery. It was served by barges on the Cannock Extension Canal until the arrival of a mineral line from [[Norton Junction, Staffordshire|Norton Junction]]. In 1930, a mining explosion occurred which killed 14 miners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nortoncaneshistory.co.uk/collieries/|title=Images courtesy Norton Canes History Members|last=|first=|date=28 April 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The colliery was closed in 1952 and all traces were swept away by 1964. Today, an industrial estate stands on the site of the former trackbed and the canal is popular with residential barges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i0.wp.com/brownhillsbob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/gr6-1.jpg?ssl=1|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
