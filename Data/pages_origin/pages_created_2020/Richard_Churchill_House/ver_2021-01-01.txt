The '''Richard Churchill House''' is a historic house at 1214 Green Bay Road in [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]]. The house was built in 1908 for the Churchill family, which used the last name Kirschberger at the time but later changed it due to anti-German sentiment during [[World War I]]. Architect [[Alfred S. Alschuler]], who was also known for his work on skyscrapers and industrial buildings in [[Chicago]], designed the house. The house has an [[English country house]] design, a popular choice for early twentieth-century suburbanites building on large plots. The two-story house has a [[stucco]] exterior, an entrance flanked by columns and latticework, and a [[Palladian window]] above the entrance.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Susan S. |last2=Cook |first2=Nancy W. |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Highland Park Multiple Resource Area |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/64000175.pdf |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=January 1, 2020 |date=September 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Benjamin |first1=Susan |title=Highland Park Multiple Resource Inventory Sheet: Richard Churchill House |url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201318.pdf |publisher=[[Illinois Historic Preservation Division]] |accessdate=January 1, 2020 |date=September 1981}}</ref>
