==Critical reception==

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] writes that ''Wild Child'' "never transcends its time, except for the most hardcore soft-rock collectors."<ref Name=AM/>

Charles Donovan of ''Pop Matters'' wrote of ''Wild Child'' in his tribute article to Valerie Carter that, "Her name appeared in the songwriting credits of roughly half the tracks. To some, it's the poor relation, with its disco-pop compromises, its studio wizards ([[James Newton Howard]]), its ultra-slick session players and commercial sheen. I've always liked it."<ref name=PM>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/valerie-carter-voice-of-angel-2628049329.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1 |title=The Voice of an Angel: A Tribute to Valerie Carter |last=Donovan |first=Charles |date=11 February 2019 |website=popmatters.com |publisher=Pop Matters |access-date=31 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

Joe Marchese of ''The Second Disc'' writes of ''Wild Child'', "The versatile singer-songwriter had a hand in five of its nine songs compared to just three on the previous LP, making ''Wild Child'' arguably a more personal album despite the sleek production.  The lyrics to the ironically upbeat opening track, "Crazy," may have cut too close to the bone for an artist who battled her share of personal demons over the years: "I'm always gonna be this way/Reckless and crazy/That's probably true…"  An authenticity, not to mention confidence, surges though the album."<ref name=TSD>{{cite web |url=https://theseconddisc.com/2019/07/24/da-doo-rendezvous-cherry-red-collects-valerie-carters-columbia-albums/ |title=Da Doo Rendezvous: Cherry Red Collects Valerie Carter's Columbia Albums |last=Marchese |first=Joe |date=4 July 2019 |website=theseconddisc.com2 |publisher=The Second Disc |access-date=31 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>

''[[Smash Hits]]'' called it, "An accomplished American album of gentle, shuffling songs done [[Fleetwood Mac]] style. It's all a bit to effortless to be actually wild, but this album has a wistful, haunting beauty."<ref>{{cite magazine| magazine= Smash Hits | title=Albums|author=Red Starr|issue=9|date=5 April 1979}}</ref>
