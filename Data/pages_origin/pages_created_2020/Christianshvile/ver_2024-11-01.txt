'''Christianshvile''' is a late 19th-century villa located at [[Sortedam Dossering]] 55 in the [[Østerbro]] district of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The main building, a stable and a [[carriage house]] were listed on the [[Listed buildings in Østerbro|Danish registry of protected buildings and places]] in 1980.

==History==
The 11th Bleaching Pond Lot (later Blegdamsvej 82 and now Sortedams Dossering 55 and Ryesgade 48) of the [[Blegdamsvej|24 bleaching pond lots]] that lined the west side of Sortedam Lake was in around 1770 home to a ship sails factory owned by [[sailmaker]] Christian Brenøe (born c. 1734). Brenøe took over the deliveries of ship sails to the Royal Danish Dockyard at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]] when the ship sails factory at [[Vodroffsvej|Wodroffsgaard]] ran into difficulties in the late 1780s. Brenøe was in 1805 succeeded by his son Peter Christian Brenøe (1770-1832) who was unable to continue his father's success. The factory was in 1914 sold to Adolph Christian Fibiger for 14,000 [[Danish rigsdaler]] and converted into a bleaching plant.<ref name="Kulturstyrelsen">{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=3102514|title=Sag: Sortedam Dossering 55|language=Danish|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen]|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>

Master baker  William Rubow acquired the property from Fibiger's widow in circa 1862 but sold it again to bookkeeper H. C. Hildebrandt. In 1964, Hildebrandt sold the property to former "French baker" Christian Nielsen. A couple of buildings from 1841 or earlier was at this point located on the land. Christian Nielsen wanted to use the property for the construction of a new starch factory. He was also planning to extract "ingredients for [[gluten|gluten bread]]" which were considered beneficial for people suffering from diabetes. In 1863, he charged [[Thorvald Sørensen]] (1849-1905), building inspector in Copenhagen's 2md district, with the design of a new factory building, a stable for six horses and a [[carriage house]]. Christian Nielsen had also charged Thorvald Sørensen with the design of a villa for his own use. He designed a two-storey villa with a tower-lke central projection with a puramidical roof and a five-sided appendix. The design shows inspiration from [[Johan Daniel Herholdt]]. The other buildings were constructed in 1865 but the villa was not realized. When Christian Nielsen finally got his villa in 1869 , it was built to a new design by Georg W. Møller. The house was given the name "Christianshvile” ("Christian's Rest").<ref name="hovedstadshistorie">{{cite web|url=http://www.hovedstadshistorie.dk/oesterbro/sortedam-dossering-oesterbro/|title=Sortedam Dossering (Østerbro)|language=Danish|website=hovedstadshistorie.dk]|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Georg Møller (1840–97) was a student of G. F Hetsch and worked as executing architect for J. D. Herholdt. He enrolled at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1855 but does not seem to have graduated. He collaborated with [[Wilhelm Dahlerup]] at the construction of [[Hotel d' Angleterre]] as well as [[Statens Museum for Kunst]].
