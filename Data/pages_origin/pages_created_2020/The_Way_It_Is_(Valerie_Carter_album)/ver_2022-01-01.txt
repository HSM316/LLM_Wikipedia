==Critical reception==

Rob Caldwell of [[AllMusic]] gives the album 3 out of 5 stars and writes, "Following the pattern of her debut, it featured a fine selection of songs and a fine array of guest performers."<ref Name=AM/>

Charles Donovan of ''Pop Matters'' had this to say of the album, "''Wild Child'' marked the end of Carter's time with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. Busy with backing vocals and some songwriting here and there in the 1980s, she wouldn't re-emerge as a solo artist until 1996, when she cut ''The Way It Is'' for the [[Japan]]ese [[Pony Canyon]] label. It was a tremendous return."<ref name=PM>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/valerie-carter-voice-of-angel-2628049329.html?rebelltitem=5#rebelltitem5 |title=The Voice of an Angel: A Tribute to Valerie Carter |last=Donovan |first=Charles |date=11 February 2019 |website=popmatters.com |publisher=Pop Matters |access-date=14 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>
