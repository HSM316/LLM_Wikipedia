The '''WWE Year-End Awards''' is a concept used by [[WWE]], where awards, similar to the [[Academy Awards|Academy]] and [[Grammy Award]]s, are given to [[professional wrestler]]s at the end of the year who have performed on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. Introduced in 2018, there have been two editions of the concept. In the first edition, the winners were voted by fans, while for the second, WWE picked the winner themselves. Previously, wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown had been rewarded [[Slammy Award]]s between 1986 and 2015.<ref name=variety>{{cite web |last=Graser|first=Marc|url=https://variety.com/2008/biz/awards/wwe-brings-back-slammys-1117996995/ |title=WWE brings back Slammys|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=December 8, 2008 |date=December 7, 2008}}</ref>
