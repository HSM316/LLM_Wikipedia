'''The Barge Inn''' is an independent [[public house]] and restaurant in [[Grimsby]], [[North East Lincolnshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], England. Housed within a refitted former grain barge, it has been moored in the town centre Riverhead quay since 1982.

==History==
The Barge was crane lifted into Grimsby's Riverhead quay from the adjacent Alexandra Dock in 1982. A former grain barge, it was converted into a public house and has since remained permanently moored in this position.<ref>[https://whatpub.com/pubs/LNE/GRM6/barge-grimsby Barge, Grimsby] - ''whatpub.com''. 6 January 2019.

In 2017, the establishment was threatened with removal to accommodate North East Lincolnshire Council plans to build a cinema complex in Grimsby town centre. A petition to save the Barge attracted almost 8,500 signatures, and it was subsequently announced that it would be remaining in its current position.<ref>[https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/barge-saved-after-8500-sign-442290 The Barge is saved after 8,500 sign petition] - ''GrimsbyLive''. 17 September 2017.
