Upon its creation, EPA inherited 84 sites spread across 26 states, of which 42 sites were laboratories.  The EPA consolidated these laboratories into 22 sites, with major research centers in Cincinnati, [[Research Triangle Park]], [[Las Vegas]], and [[Corvallis, Oregon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/why-are-our-regional-offices-and-labs-located-where-they-are-historical-perspective-siting|title=Why Are Our Regional Offices and Labs Located Where They Are?
