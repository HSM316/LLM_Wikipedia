The Environmental Research Center traces its lineage to environmental health activities of the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]] (PHS) in Cincinnati since the late 19th century.  A [[Marine Hospital Service|U.S. Marine Hospital]] was established in Cincinnati in 1882 in the former Kilgour Mansion, built around 1815 by [[David Kilgour (industrialist)|David Kilgour]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ern1MvGtMrgC&pg=PA295|title=A Profile of the United States Public Health Service, 1798–1948|last=Furman|first=Bess|publisher=U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=295–298|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHh0CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT59|title=Cincinnati's Hyde Park: A Queen City Gem|last=Rogers|first=Gregory Parker|date=2010-09-24|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=|isbn=978-1-61423-166-0|location=|pages=59–61|language=en}}</ref>  The hospital closed in 1905,<ref name=":4" /> but the 1912 [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] (PHS) law ({{USPL|62|288}}) led to the building being reopened as a Field Investigation Station for water pollution research.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Jerry R.|last2=Symons|first2=James M.|last3=Sorg|first3=Thomas J.|date=2013-05-28|title=The History of Environmental Research in Cincinnati, Ohio: From the U.S. Public Health Service to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/9780784412947.004|journal=World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2013|language=en|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|volume=|pages=33–37|doi=10.1061/9780784412947.004|isbn=978-0-7844-1294-7|via=}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=91022SRK.TXT|title=Andrew W.
