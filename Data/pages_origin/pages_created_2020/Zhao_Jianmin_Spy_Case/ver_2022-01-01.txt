== Brief history ==
[[File:Tan Furen.jpg|thumb|[[Tan Furen]], the [[lieutenant general]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]] who was in charge of the purge.]]
In March 1967, [[Zhao Jianmin]], then provincial secretary of the Communist Party in Yunnan, suggested to [[Kang Sheng]] in person that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) should resolve the issues of Cultural Revolution in a democratic manner, but receiving no immediate response from the latter.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> However, Kang Sheng made a secret report on Zhao to [[Mao Zedong]] afterwards, claiming that Zhao was against the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee of CCP]], against Chairman Mao and against the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{cite news|last=|first=|date=|title="文革"中康生仅凭相面定案：整死一万云南群众|language=zh|newspaper=[[People's Daily]]|url=http://history.people.com.cn/GB/205396/16269357.html|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231031000/http://history.people.com.cn/GB/205396/16269357.html|archive-date=2020-06-23}}</ref> 

In August 1967, Mao Zedong as well as the Central Committee of CCP approved that the national and local media may publicly criticize "[[capitalist roaders]]" among the top provincial officials in China. A total of 55 high-ranking officials were criticized, including Zhao Jianmin.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" />

In 1968, Zhao Jianmin was labelled by Kang Sheng and his allies as "a spy of [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)" as well as "traitor", and was regarded as one of the "local proxies" of [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd President of China]] who was persecuted to death in 1969 as a "traitor" and "capitalist roader".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":8" /> Zhao was then imprisoned for 8 years.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> 

At the same time, a massive search and purge of members of the fabricated "Zhao Jianmin KMT Spy Agency in Yunnan" was carried out, resulting in the arrest and persecution of more than 1.38 million civilians and officials.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /> [[Tan Furen]], a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[People's Liberation Army]], was appointed by Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of CCP to take charge of the purge.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":1" />

On December 17, 1970, Tan Furen and his wife were assassinated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Solinger|first=Dorothy J.|date=1982|title=Politics in Yunnan Province in the Decade of Disorder: Elite Factional Strategies and Central-Local Relations, 1967-1980|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/653682|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=92|issue=92|pages=628–662|doi=10.1017/S0305741000000989|jstor=653682|issn=0305-7410}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Zhou|first=Ziren|date=|title=谭甫仁017凶案|url=http://www.yhcqw.com/30/1333.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122143456/http://www.yhcqw.com/30/1333.html|archive-date=2020-11-22|access-date=2020-07-05|website=[[Yanhuang Chunqiu]]}}</ref>

After the Cultural Revolution, Zhao Jianmin was officially rehabilitated during the "[[Boluan Fanzheng]]" period and subsequently became a vice director of the [[Third Ministry of Machine Building]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2009-11-14|title=1968纪事：赵建民云南特务案|url=http://phtv.ifeng.com/program/tfzg/200911/1114_2950_1435398.shtml|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30|website=[[Phoenix Television]]|language=zh}}</ref>
