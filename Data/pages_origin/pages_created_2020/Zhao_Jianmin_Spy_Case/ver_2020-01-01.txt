In March, 1967, [[Zhao Jianmin]], then the provincial communist party secretary of Yunnan, suggested to [[Kang Sheng]] in person that the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) should resolve the issues in Cultural Revolution in a democratic manner, receiving no immediate response from the latter.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> However, Kang Sheng snitched on Zhao to [[Mao Zedong]] afterwards, claiming that Zhao was against the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee of CPC]], against Chairman Mao, and against the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://history.people.com.cn/GB/205396/16269357.html |script-title=zh:"文革"中康生仅凭相面定案：整死一万云南群众|author=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=[[People's Daily]] |language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2019-12-30}}</ref> In August 1967, Mao Zedong as well as the Central Committee of CPC approved that the national and local media may publicly criticize the "[[capitalist roaders]]" among the provincial leaders in China.
