This is a list of [[mass shootings in the United States]] that have occurred in 2020. Mass shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.<ref name=":1"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/04/the-squishy-definition-of-mass-shooting-complicates-media-coverage/|title=The squishy definition of 'mass shooting' complicates media coverage|last=Borchers|first=Callum|date=October 4, 2017|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=August 26, 2018|quote=...'mass shooting' is a term without a universally-accepted definition.}}</ref>
