This is a '''list of shootings in the United States that have occurred in 2020'''. Shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence.

There were 614 mass shootings in 2020 that fit the inclusion criteria of this article, resulting in 446 deaths and 2,515 injuries, for a total of 2,961 victims. Compared to [[List of mass shootings in the United States in 2019|the previous year]], there were 180 more incidents.
