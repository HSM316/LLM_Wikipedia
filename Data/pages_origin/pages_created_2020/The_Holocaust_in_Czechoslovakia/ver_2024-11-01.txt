During World War II, Czechoslovakia was divided into four different regions, each administered by a different authority: [[Sudetenland]] (Germany), [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], the [[Slovak State]], and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and southern Slovakia (Hungary). 

As a result, the Holocaust unfolded differently in each of these areas:
*[[The Holocaust in the Sudetenland]]
*[[The Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia]]
*[[The Holocaust in Slovakia]]
*[[The Holocaust in Hungary]]
