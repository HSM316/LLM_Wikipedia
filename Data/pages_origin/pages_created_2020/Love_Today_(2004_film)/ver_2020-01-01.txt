== Release ==
The film released to mixed reviews. Idlebrain gave the film two point five out of five stars and wrote how the film feels lengthy. Additionally, the reviewer praised the techinal aspects of the film, the performances of Uday Kiran and the supporting cast especially Devadarshini stating how she "would be suitable for ''akka'' [sister] & ''vadina'' [sister-in-law] roles in Telugu films".<ref name="Idlebrain"/> ''Sify'' wrote that "Director Aprudhan has a very thin storyline as the film moves at a snail pace. Unfortunately ''Love Today'' has nothing new to offer and ultimately lacks any style or soul".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sify.com/movies/love-today-review--pclvzXadbhcdd.html|title=Review : (2004)|website=www.sify.com}}</ref> ''Full Hyderabad'' wrote that "When the crux of the movie is about dealing with misunderstandings, they should've at least tried to show some remotely sensible reason for all the squabbles. With such an effort from the makers' side, the outcome is only ordinary".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movies.fullhyderabad.com/love-today/telugu/love-today-movie-reviews-1016-2.html|title=Love Today review: Love Today (Telugu) Movie Review - fullhyd.com}}</ref>
