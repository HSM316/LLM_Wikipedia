'''Freud Corner''' is the name used for the place within [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in North London, where the [[funerary urn]]s of [[Sigmund Freud]] and many other members of the [[Freud family]] are deposited.

==History==
When writing his will in 1919, Sigmund Freud stated that he wanted to be [[cremation|cremated]] as it was a cheaper and easier process than conventional burial.<ref>This will was last amended on 28 July 1938, soon after his arrival in London. See [[Paul Roazen]]: "Freud's last will", in: ''Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis'', 18(3), 1990, 383每385.</ref> Freud died at 3 am<ref name="michaelturner"/> on 23 September 1939. Three days later, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His son [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst Freud]] had organised the [[funeral]] arrangements, and [[Harrods|Harrods of Knightsbridge]] acted as [[funeral director]]s.<ref name="michaelturner">Michael Turner: {{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/museums/publications/catalogues/freud-catalogue.pdf |title=Nostalgia & Dionysus: The mystery of Sigmund Freud's final resting place", in: ''Sigmund Freud's Collection: An Archaeology of the Mind'', p. 43-45 |access-date=2014-02-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222133332/http://sydney.edu.au/museums/publications/catalogues/freud-catalogue.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After the funeral, Freud's ashes were  deposited in an [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[bell krater]] from the [[4th century BC]] which came from his large collection of over 2000 antiquities<ref name="michaelturner"/> (see below). The ancient bell krater, now serving as a funerary urn, was later placed atop a black marble plinth, designed by Ernst Freud<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j9HFNKIU44wC&pg=PA205 List of the works of architect Ernst Freud]</ref> and erected in the crematorium's ''Ernest George Columbarium''.

On New Year's Day 2014, Golders Green Crematorium staff discovered that burglars had apparently broken into the Ernest George Columbarium overnight and smashed the ancient bell krater containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes in the attempt to steal the vessel. The severely damaged urn was afterwards temporarily moved to a secure location.<ref>Maev Kennedy: ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/urn-sigmund-freud-ashes-smashed-theft-attempt Urn containing Sigmund Freud's ashes smashed during theft attempt]'', The Guardian (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-25746246 Sigmund Freud's ashes targeted in Golders Green Crematorium raid], BBC Online (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.</ref> Today the restored urn is protected by a case of special glass and guarded. Visits to Freud Corner can only be made in the company of a member of Golders Green Crematorium's staff and after reporting to reception.

==Description==
Freud Corner occupies a window niche, built in red brick, inside the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium. In the centre of this niche stands a black marble plinth, with the funerary urn of [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund]] and [[Martha Freud]] on top. Their names, dates of birth and death are inscribed on the plinth in gold lettering. The vessel containing their ashes is a sealed<ref name="michaelturner"/> [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]  [[bell krater]], likely made in [[Apulia]],<ref name="michaelturner"/> painted with [[Dionysus|Dionysian scenes]].<ref name="janineburke"/> One of these images depicts Dionysus with a [[maenad]]. It is not known why, when, and by whom the decision was made to place Freud's ashes in this vessel; there is no mention of such an intention in any of Freud's correspondence, in his last will, or in any subsequent family correspondence.<ref name="michaelturner"/> Freud had received this 2,300-year-old item from [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] for his 75th birthday on 6 May 1931. Freud loved the piece, writing to Marie Bonaparte about it: "...it is a pity one cannot take it into one's grave."<ref>Bryony Davies: ''[https://www.freud.org.uk/2019/05/06/how-did-freud-celebrate-his-birthday/ How did Freud celebrate his birthday?]'', [[Freud Museum|Freud Museum London]] (6 May 2019), access date 2019-12-29.</ref> He used to  keep the bell krater on display in his study at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19, Vienna]], until his forced move to the United Kingdom in June 1938.

The white stone shelf to the left of the black marble plinth with the ancient Greek bell krater holds nine urns, {{as of|2021|lc=on}}. While most of these are brick-sized brownish metal containers inscribed with the name, date of birth and date of death of the deceased, both the cremated remains of Colin Peter Freud and of Margaret Freud are kept in wooden caskets. The ashes of Dr. Lajos L谷vy and his wife Kat芍 are in the same vessel. The following rest here:

The white stone shelf to the right of the black marble plinth currently holds four urns. The ashes of Tini Maresch are in a brick-sized brownish metal container like those already mentioned. So are those of Mathilde Hollitscher (''n谷e'' Freud) and her husband Robert, which are in the same vessel. The ashes of Anton Walter Freud and his wife Annette share a large wooden casket, while the cremated remains of Henny Freud are kept in a stone urn made of [[granite]]. The following rest here:
