'''"Freud Corner"''' is the name used for the place within [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in North London, where the [[funerary urn]]s of [[Sigmund Freud]] and many other members of the [[Freud family]] are deposited.

==History==
When writing his last will in 1919, Sigmund Freud stated that he wanted to be [[cremation|cremated]] as it was a cheaper and easier process than conventional burial. Three days after Freud's death on 23 September 1939, his body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.  His son [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst Freud]] had organised the [[funeral]] arrangements, and [[Harrods|Harrods of Knightsbridge]] acted as [[funeral director]]s.<ref name="sydney">{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/museums/publications/catalogues/freud-catalogue.pdf |title=Sigmund Freud's Collection: An Archaeology of the Mind |accessdate=2014-02-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222133332/http://sydney.edu.au/museums/publications/catalogues/freud-catalogue.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After the funeral, Freud's ashes were  deposited in an [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[krater]] from around 300 BC which came from his collection of antiquities (see below). This urn was later placed atop a black marble plinth, designed by [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst Freud]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j9HFNKIU44wC&pg=PA205 List of the works of architect Ernst Freud]</ref> and erected in the crematorium's ''East Columbarium''. 

After [[Martha Freud]]'s death in 1951, her ashes were also placed in the krater.<ref>Burke, Janine ''The Sphinx at the Table: Sigmund Freud's Art Collection and the Development of Psychoanalysis'', New York: Walker and Co. 2006, p. 340.</ref> In the decades since, many more members of the Freud family have been  cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, with their ashes stored next to the black marble plinth with Sigmund and Martha's urn. These later urns are today placed on three-tiered white stone shelves erected on both sides of that plinth. 

On New Year's Day 2014, Golders Green Crematorium staff discovered that burglars had apparently broken into the columbarium overnight and smashed the [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[krater]] containing Sigmund and Martha Freud's ashes in the attempt to steal the vessel. The severely damaged urn was afterwards temporarily moved to a secure location.<ref>Maev Kennedy: ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/urn-sigmund-freud-ashes-smashed-theft-attempt Urn containing Sigmund Freud's ashes smashed during theft attempt]'', The Guardian (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-25746246 Sigmund Freud's ashes targeted in Golders Green Crematorium raid], BBC Online (15 January 2014), access date 2019-12-29.</ref> Today the restored urn is protected by a case of special glass and guarded. Visits to Freud Corner can only be made in the company of a member of Golders Green Crematorium's staff and after reporting to reception.

==Description==
Freud Corner occupies a window niche inside the crematorium's East Columbarium. This building was designed by [[Ernest George]] and Alfred Yeates in [[Romanesque Revival]] style, completed in 1912<ref name="architecturecom"> [https://www.architecture.com/image-library/RIBApix/image-information/poster/golders-green-crematorium-london-the-east-columbarium/posterid/RIBA102395.html www.architecture.com - Golders Green Crematorium, London: the East Columbarium (RIBA102395)] </ref> and later named ''Ernest George Columbarium'' after its architect. 

In the centre of the said window niche stands a black marble plinth, with the funerary urn of [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund]] and [[Martha Freud]] on top. Their names, dates of birth and death are inscribed on the plinth in gold lettering. The vessel containing their ashes is a sealed<ref name="sydney"/> [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[krater]] painted with [[Dionysus|Dionysian scenes]]. Freud had received this 2,300-year-old item as a gift from [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] during his lifetime and kept it in his study in Vienna for many years.<ref>Burke, Janine ''The Sphinx at the Table: Sigmund Freud's Art Collection and the Development of Psychoanalysis'', New York: Walker and Co. 2006, p. 340.</ref>

The white stone shelf to the left of the black marble plinth contains nine urns with the ashes of:
