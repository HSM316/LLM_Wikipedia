A conservative, Imkamp is a staunch opponent of the [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article2924483/Maischberger-Haemischer-Praelat-piesackt-Pfarrerin.html|title=Late Night: Maischberger – Hämischer Prälat piesackt Pfarrerin|first=Maike|last=Jansen|date=December 24, 2008|via=www.welt.de}}</ref> He also criticized German president [[Christian Wulff]] for his welcome speech to Pope Benedict XVI, which referenced the president's divorce. Imkamp protested affirming divorced Catholics and reiterated that divorce is a reason to be barred from receiving the [[Eucharist]]. Imkamp has accused the [[Catholic Church in Germany]] of not being loyal to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], stating that the church would become a "pathogen with high infection potential" if it did not submit to the Vatican.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/papst-besuch-vatikan-berater-kritisiert-wulff-rede_aid_670231.html|title=Papst-Besuch|first=FOCUS|last=Online|website=FOCUS Online}}</ref> He also accused church dignitaries of "clerical correctness", which he called a "piglet affair with political correctness".<ref name= queer>{{Cite web|url=https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=25552|title=Flüchtlinge: Wallfahrtsdirektor kritisiert Einsatz für "verprügelte Schwule"|website=queer.de}}</ref>

In an interview with German newspaper ''Mittelschwäbische Nachrichten'', Imkamp criticized leaders of the Catholic Church in Germany for campaigning for the human rights of non-Christians and LGBTQ people in the political discussions about refugees. He accused [[Heiner Koch]], the Archbishop of Berlin, of providing more protection for homosexual people than Christian refugees and blamed the focus on LGBTQ people on political lobbying.<ref name= queer/>

In 2014 during a discussion with leaders of the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]], Imkamp warned against a "socalist persecution of Christianity" and referred to politicians of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] as "socialists from Germany".<ref name= queer/>
