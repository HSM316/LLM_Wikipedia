The painting is of the tallest point in the [[Yorkshire Wolds]], which is the highest point of [[Bishop Wilton Wold]] and given its name due to the proximity to the village of [[Garrowby]], near [[York]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Is the East Riding England's most underrated destination? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/david-hockney-exhibition-east-yorkshire-wolds-englands-most-underrated-destination/ |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>
