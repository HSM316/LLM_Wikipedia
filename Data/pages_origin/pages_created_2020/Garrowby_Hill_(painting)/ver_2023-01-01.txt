==Painting==
The painting was completed in 1998. Hockney had spent a number of years living in [[Los Angeles]] before moving back to his native [[Yorkshire]] in the late 1990s. Following the move back to [[England]], Hockney completed several landscape paintings of [[Yorkshire]] scenery, one of which was ''Garrowby Hill''.<ref name=standard>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Jessie |title=David Hockney at Tate Britain: Five Hockney paintings to bring you joy |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/david-hockney-at-tate-britain-five-hockney-paintings-to-bring-you-joy-a3460641.html |publisher=[[Evening Standard]] |date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>

The painting is of the tallest point in the [[Yorkshire Wolds]], which is the highest point of [[Bishop Wilton Wold]] and given its name due to the proximity to the village of [[Garrowby]], near [[York]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Is the East Riding England's most underrated destination? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/yorkshire/articles/david-hockney-exhibition-east-yorkshire-wolds-englands-most-underrated-destination/ |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>
