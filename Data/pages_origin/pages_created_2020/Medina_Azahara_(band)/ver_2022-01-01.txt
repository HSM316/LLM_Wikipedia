'''Medina Azahara''' is a hard rock band formed in [[Córdoba, Spain]] in 1979.

==History==
The group was founded by Manuel Martínez (vocals), Miguel Galán (guitar), José Antonio Molina (drums), Manuel Molina (bass), and Pablo Rabadán (keyboards).<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/1266979-Medina-Azahara Bio-discography on Discogs]</ref>

In their early years they were part of the [[Andalusian rock]] scene from the 80s, influenced by acts like [[Deep Purple]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Triana (band)|Triana]], and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], among others.<ref>[http://www.medinaazahara.es/biografia/ Biography on the official website (Spanish)]</ref>
Later on their style shifted toward a melodic [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound with neoclassical undertones.

The line-up has changed several times through the years, though the band is still recording and touring through Spain, with frontman Manuel Martínez standing as the only original member.

In 2018, three former members, Miguel Galán, José Antonio Molina, and Randy López, formed a tribute group called ExMedinas with other musicians, performing songs from the early period of the band.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/exmedinas/</ref>
