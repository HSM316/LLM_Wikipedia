==Career==
He debuted in rugby union playing for [[Saint-Girons Sporting Club]], his hometown club, participating at the notable victory against [[Stade Français Paris|Stade Français]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |title=André Rives, ancien international à XIII est décédé |url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2017/03/14/2535650-andre-rives-ancien-international-a-xiii-est-decede.html |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=ladepeche.fr |language=fr}}</ref>
In 1947, he switched codes to rugby league, joining [[Albi XIII|Albi]]. A fullback, he rivalised with [[Puig Aubert]], known as "Pipette". With Albi, Rives was two times French Champion against [[AS Carcassonne|Carcassonne]], which would make him join the  [[France national rugby league team|France national team]]  for the  [[1957 Rugby League World Cup]]. He had 14 international caps. During his career, Rives played two clubs, initially for [[Albi XIII|Albi]] and later, for [[Saint-Gaudens Bears|Saint-Gaudens]], which he would join in the early 1960s.<ref name=Mouret2011>{{Cite book |last=Mouret |first=Aimé |title=Le Who's who du rugby à XII |publisher=Éditions de l'Ixcea |year=December 2011 |isbn=978-2-84918-118-8 |edition=Éditions de l'Ixcea |location=Toulouse}}</ref>{{rp|pages=224-225}} 
With the former, he won two French champion titles, with the latter, he won a French championship final. His club performances brought him into the [[France national rugby league team|France national team]] between 1957 and 1959, notably taking part at the [[1957 Rugby League World Cup]] and succeeding his position to Puig Aubert.

It was considered that although he was of "short stature", he was of a "rare talent" and was considered as "Pipette's rightful successor"<ref name=Mouret2011 />{{rp|pages=224-225}}
