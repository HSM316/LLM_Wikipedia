'''Stephenson Avenue''' refers to two separate sections of road in the western suburbs of [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]].

The first section is a {{convert|600|m|adj=on}} section of [[dual carriageway]] linking [[Scarborough Beach Road]] to Pearson Street/Jon Sanders Drive in [[Osborne Park, Western Australia|Osborne Park]]. The second, longer section is a {{convert|1.5|km|adj=on}} two-lane road in [[Mount Claremont, Western Australia|Mount Claremont]] used to link central Perth to the [[West Coast Highway, Perth|West Coast Highway]] via [[Hay Street, Perth|Hay Street]], Underwood Avenue and Rochdale Road.

The two sections of road are to date the only evidence of the originally proposed '''Stephenson Highway''', a controversial highway that was proposed to connect [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]] to [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bassett |first1=Jon |title=Proposed Stephenson Avenue tunnel a trip back to the future |url=https://www.communitynews.com.au/western-suburbs-weekly/news/proposed-stephenson-avenue-tunnel-a-trip-back-to-the-future/ |website=Community News |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>

The two roads are named after [[Gordon Stephenson]], an influential person in the development and expansion of Perth through the [[Metropolitan Region Scheme]] during the 20th Century.
