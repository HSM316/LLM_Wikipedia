'''Stephenson Avenue''' refers to two separate sections of road in the western suburbs of [[Perth]], Western Australia.

The first section is a {{convert|1.2|km|adj=on}} section of [[dual carriageway]] linking Flax Way to Pearson Street/Jon Sanders Drive in [[Osborne Park, Western Australia|Osborne Park]] via [[Scarborough Beach Road]]. The second, longer section is a {{convert|1.5|km|adj=on}} two-lane road in [[Mount Claremont, Western Australia|Mount Claremont]] used to link central Perth to [[West Coast Highway, Perth|West Coast Highway]] via [[Hay Street, Perth|Hay Street]], Underwood Avenue and Rochdale Road.

The two sections of road are to date the only evidence of the originally proposed '''Stephenson Highway''', a controversial highway that was proposed to connect [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]] to [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bassett |first1=Jon |title=Proposed Stephenson Avenue tunnel a trip back to the future |url=https://www.communitynews.com.au/western-suburbs-weekly/news/proposed-stephenson-avenue-tunnel-a-trip-back-to-the-future/ |website=Community News |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> Evidence of previous attempts to extend the section north of Flax Way to the Mitchell Freeway can be seen on Landgate aerial photos from 1985, however only the section south to Jon Sanders Drive has been completed to date.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perth Metropolitan Area 19/06/1985 |url=https://map-viewer-plus.app.landgate.wa.gov.au/index.html |website=Landgate Map Viewer Plus|accessdate=7 November 2021}}</ref>

The two roads are named after [[Gordon Stephenson]], an influential person in the development and expansion of Perth through the [[Metropolitan Region Scheme]] during the 20th century.

==History==
An [[arterial road]]{{#tag:ref|Stephenson refers to these as "Important Regional Roads", which he defines as "the principal feeders and connectors to the Major Regional Highways...

In 1962, the Mount Claremont section from Rochdale Road (then West Coast Highway) to Underwood Avenue was completed to provide access to [[Perry Lakes Stadium]] and other facilities constructed for the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]].<ref name="ozroads">{{cite web |last1=Laybutt |first1=Sam |title=WA State Route 65 |url=https://www.ozroads.com.au/WA/routenumbering/state/65/sr65.htm |website=Ozroads |access-date=26 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319215813/http://ozroads.com.au/WA/routenumbering/state/65/sr65.htm |archive-date=19 March 2020 |date=23 December 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, as part of the [[Northern Suburbs Transit System]] project, [[Stirling railway station, Perth|Stirling railway station]] was constructed in the median strip of the Mitchell Freeway immediately south of Cedric Street, ultimately opening in 1993. The station's location had presented some interesting design challenges for the future extension of Stephenson Highway over the Mitchell Freeway as the road reserve for the future highway initially ran directly over the station at the southern end of its platforms. During the design of the station and its approach roads, the engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup & Partners]] was tasked with investigating and designing road layouts to accommodate for both future and current needs.<ref name=OverArupNov90>{{cite book|title=Stirling Transfer Station: Traffic Engineering and Network Capacity Analysis for Urban Rail Development Office|publisher=Ove Arup & Partners|date=November 1990|location=[[West Perth, Western Australia|West Perth]]}} Sect. 3.1, retrieved at [[J S Battye Library]], [[Perth]]</ref> Due to the nature of the future Stephenson Highway, a number of road layout options were considered including:<ref name=OverArupNov90/>
*Original designs first proposed for the freeway by the [[Main Roads Western Australia|Main Roads Department]], consisting of a [[diamond interchange]] between [[Scarborough Beach Road]] and Stephenson Highway, with links to the existing Oswald Street and [[Osborne Park, Western Australia|Osborne Park]].
*As per the above option, but without the Osborne Park link.
*As per the above option, but without the link of Oswald Street between Scarborough Beach Road and Cedric Street (an option recommended by station designers Hames Sharley architects).
*A design only known as the Forbes and Fitzhardinge planning scheme, of which no information or design drawings exist within the engineers' report.

All of the above designs involved significantly complex road layouts which amongst others included partial [[cloverleaf interchange]]s, and the construction of new bridges connecting the future highway to Cedric Street.<ref name=OverArupNov90/>

In 1994, the Osborne Park section from Scarborough Beach Road to Jon Sanders Drive was completed as the '''Stirling Link Road'''.<ref name="MediaClaims1995">{{cite web |last1=Charlton |first1=Eric |title=Media claims about new four-lane highway wrong |url=https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Court/1995/12/Media-claims-about-new-four-lane-highway-wrong.aspx |website=Media Statements |access-date=25 September 2022 |date=27 December 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ED4 Stirling Link Road, Scarborough Beach Road, Liege Street Right Turn Movements |url=https://archives.stirling.wa.gov.au/minutes/ts/1999/March/TS19990323-03.htm |website=Stirling Council and Committee Minutes 1992-2004 |access-date=25 September 2022 |date=11 March 1999}}</ref> While it was designed with providing the connection between the [[Mitchell Freeway]] and a potential future Stephenson Highway in mind, its primary purpose was to act as a feeder from the Mitchell Freeway to Innaloo.<ref name="MediaClaims1995"/>

In October 2011, the Metropolitan Region Scheme was amended to rezone the Stephenson Highway road reserve north of Jon Sanders Drive to the Mitchell Freeway to "City Centre".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Stirling City Alliance |title=Stirling City Centre Alliance Project Information Summary |url=https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2021-05/PRJ-Stirling_project_summary.pdf |website=Western Australian Government |access-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706010732/https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2021-05/PRJ-Stirling_project_summary.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2022 |page=6 |date=May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was desired by the [[City of Stirling]] on the basis that the reserve prevented it from developing into a true city centre.<ref name="CoS_Precint_Report">{{cite web |author1=City of Stirling |title=Herdsman-Glendalough Precinct Report on Submissions |url=https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/4010862a7d2b18c5a1032c4a482581b80008608c/$file/862.pdf |website=Parliament of Western Australia |access-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925154737/https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/4010862a7d2b18c5a1032c4a482581b80008608c/$file/862.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2022 |pages=326-327 |date=October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> While an extension of Stephenson Avenue to the Mitchell Freeway would continue, it would be as a "low key road" with on-street parking, while Stephenson Highway's intended freight functions would be adopted by an extended Hutton Street.<ref name="CoS_Precint_Report"/>

==Extension project==
Currently underway as of October 2022 is the extension of Stephenson Avenue northwards from Scarborough Beach Road, to connect to Cedric Street and the [[Mitchell Freeway]].<ref name="June 2021 Project Update">{{cite web |title=Stephenson Avenue Extension Project – Project Update June 2021 |url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/globalassets/projects-initiatives/projects/metro/stephenson-ave/stephenson-avenue-project-update-june-2021.pdf |website=Main Roads Western Australia |access-date=10 June 2021}}</ref><ref name="mainroads-page">{{cite web |title=Stephenson Avenue Extension |url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/projects-initiatives/all-projects/metropolitan/Stephenson-Avenue-Extension/ |website=Main Roads Western Australia |publisher=Main Roads Western Australia |access-date=30 October 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

The first phase of construction was by the [[City of Stirling]], and extended the road approximately {{convert|500|m|-2}} to an intersection with the new road of Howe Street. It is two lanes in each direction, with on street parking. This is unlike the previously existing section of Stephenson Avenue to the south, which is a controlled access road. There is also an intersection with Oswald Street, which was extended to the east of its previous intersection with Ellen Stirling Boulevard. Both intersections have traffic lights. This phase began construction in August 2020 and aimed to be completed by September 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ground-breaking milestone on Stephenson Avenue Extension |url=https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/McGowan/2020/08/Joint-media-statement-Ground-breaking-milestone-on-Stephenson-Avenue-Extension.aspx |website=Media Statements |access-date=23 July 2022 |date=20 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="June 2021 Project Update" /> It opened for traffic on 11 February 2022.<ref name="mainroads-page" />

The second phase of construction is by [[Main Roads Western Australia]], and extends the road further, over the Mitchell Freeway to connect to Cedric Street. Stephenson Avenue will have a [[diamond interchange]] with the freeway, intended to supersede the current diamond interchange with Cedric Street, which will be demolished. A new access road will be provided from Stephenson Avenue to the [[Stirling railway station, Perth|Stirling railway station]] carpark. As part of the same project, the Stirling station bus interchange will have a new bridge added to it, increasing the number of bus stands from 9 to 30.<ref name="June 2021 Project Update" /> This phase began construction in March 2022 and aims to be completed by late 2023.<ref name="mainroads-page" />
