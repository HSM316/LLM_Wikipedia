In November 2019 Gui threatened Sweden during an interview with broadcaster [[PEN International|Swedish PEN]] saying that “We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we got shotguns.” over the decision to award [[Gui Minhai]] with the [[Kurt Tucholsky|Tucholsky Prize]]. All eight major Swedish political parties have condemned the Ambassador's threats. On December 4 after the prize had been awarded, Ambassador Gui said that one could not both harm China's interests and benefit economically from China. When asked to clarify his remarks he said that China would impose trade restrictions on Sweden, these remarks were backed up by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Olsson |first1=Jojje |title=China Tries to Put Sweden on Ice |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/china-tries-to-put-sweden-on-ice/ |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johan Ahlander, and Cate Cadell |first1=Simon Johnson |title=China, Sweden escalate war of words over support for detained bookseller |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sweden/china-sweden-escalate-war-of-words-over-support-for-detained-bookseller-idUSKBN1XP197 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sweden honors detained political writer Gui Minhai despite Chinese threats |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/16/asia-pacific/sweden-honors-detained-political-writer-gui-minhai-despite-chinese-threats/#.XgwMs7aZPwc |website=www.japantimes.co.jp |publisher=Japan Times |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> The embassy has systematically worked to influence the reporting on China by Swedish journalists.<ref>{{cite web |title=China’s large-scale media push: Attempts to influence Swedish media |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/china-s-large-scale-media-push-attempts-to-influence-swedish-media |website=www.svt.se |publisher=SVT |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>
