From 1994 to 1997 he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the Russian Federation. From 1997 to 2003 he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of European-Central Asian Affairs. From 2003 to 2009 he again worked in the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. From 2009 to 2017 he returned to the Department of European-Central Asian Affairs.<ref name="Biography" />

==Ambassadorship==
Gui was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of Sweden in 2017.<ref name="Biography" >{{cite web |title=Biography of Ambassador GUI Congyou |url=http://www.chinaembassy.se/eng/sgxx/dslj/t1093569.htm |website=www.chinaembassy.se |publisher=Chinese Foreign Ministry |accessdate=1 January 2020 |archive-date=17 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117154023/http://www.chinaembassy.se/eng/sgxx/dslj/t1093569.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2019 Gui threatened Sweden during an interview with broadcaster [[PEN International|Swedish PEN]] saying that “We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we got shotguns” over the decision to award [[Gui Minhai]] with the [[Kurt Tucholsky|Tucholsky Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=China Tries to Put Sweden on Ice |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/china-tries-to-put-sweden-on-ice/ |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=thediplomat.com |language=en-US |archive-date=2019-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231050646/https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/china-tries-to-put-sweden-on-ice/ |url-status=live }}</ref> All eight major Swedish political parties have condemned the Ambassador's threats. On December 4 after the prize had been awarded, Ambassador Gui said that one could not both harm China's interests and benefit economically from China. When asked to clarify his remarks he said that China would impose trade restrictions on Sweden, these remarks were backed up by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Olsson |first1=Jojje |title=China Tries to Put Sweden on Ice |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/china-tries-to-put-sweden-on-ice/ |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=31 December 2019 |archive-date=31 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231050646/https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/china-tries-to-put-sweden-on-ice/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johan Ahlander, and Cate Cadell |first1=Simon Johnson |title=China, Sweden escalate war of words over support for detained bookseller |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sweden/china-sweden-escalate-war-of-words-over-support-for-detained-bookseller-idUSKBN1XP197 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=1 January 2020 |archive-date=1 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101032652/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sweden/china-sweden-escalate-war-of-words-over-support-for-detained-bookseller-idUSKBN1XP197 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sweden honors detained political writer Gui Minhai despite Chinese threats |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/16/asia-pacific/sweden-honors-detained-political-writer-gui-minhai-despite-chinese-threats/#.XgwMs7aZPwc |website=www.japantimes.co.jp |publisher=Japan Times |accessdate=1 January 2020 |archive-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116085802/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/16/asia-pacific/sweden-honors-detained-political-writer-gui-minhai-despite-chinese-threats/#.XgwMs7aZPwc |url-status=dead }}</ref> The embassy has systematically worked to influence the reporting on China by Swedish journalists.<ref>{{cite news |title=China's large-scale media push: Attempts to influence Swedish media |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/china-s-large-scale-media-push-attempts-to-influence-swedish-media |newspaper=SVT Nyheter |date=19 January 2020 |publisher=SVT |accessdate=19 January 2020 |first1=Knut Kainz |last1=Rognerud |first2=Karin |last2=Moberg |first3=Jon |last3=Åhlén |archive-date=19 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200119162224/https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/china-s-large-scale-media-push-attempts-to-influence-swedish-media |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2021 it was revealed that the Chinese embassy threatened a journalist working for the newspaper ''[[Expressen]]''. Several political parties publicly expressed that they believe the ambassador should be declared [[persona non grata]] and deported. The reason given was that the Chinese embassy, during his time as ambassador, consistently ignores the [[Basic Laws of Sweden|Swedish constitution]] by threatening and attempting to influence journalists to not be critical of China.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|title=V backar utvisningskrav efter ambassadens hot mot reporter - Nyheter (Ekot)|url=https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/v-backar-utvisningskrav-efter-ambassadens-hot-mot-reporter|access-date=2021-04-10|newspaper=Sveriges Radio|date=10 April 2021|language=sv|archive-date=2021-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620061359/https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/v-backar-utvisningskrav-efter-ambassadens-hot-mot-reporter|url-status=live}}</ref>

Within Gui's first two years of the ambassadorship, Sweden's Foreign Ministry summoned him over forty times to protest Gui's remarks.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zhao |first=Suisheng |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1331741429 |title=The dragon roars back : transformational leaders and dynamics of Chinese foreign policy |date=2023 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-1-5036-3088-8 |location=Stanford, California |pages=87 |oclc=1331741429 |access-date=2023-01-06 |archive-date=2023-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230306101710/https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1331741429 |url-status=live }}</ref>
