The '''Danish Royal Enclaves''' were the territory of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] which was located within the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]], most of these areas were, like the rest of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], ceded to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Most of these areas were returned after the [[1920 Schleswig plebiscites]].
