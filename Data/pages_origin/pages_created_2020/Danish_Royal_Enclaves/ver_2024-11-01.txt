The '''Danish Royal Enclaves''' were the territory of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] which was located within the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]], most of these areas were, like the rest of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], ceded to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Most of these areas were returned after the [[1920 Schleswig plebiscites]]. Before the war of 1864, the Danish monarchy consisted of the Kingdom of Denmark and the duchies of [[Schleswig]], [[Holstein]] and [[Lauenborg]]. Schleswig was a Danish fiefdom, while Holstein and Lauenborg were Holy Roman fiefdoms. All four areas belonged to the absolute monarch; but the government in [[Copenhagen]] was divided into the Danish Chancellery, which was responsible for the kingdom and finances, and the [[Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery]], which was responsible for the duchies and foreign policy. The Kingdom and Duchies each had their own legislation and the official language was [[Danish language|Danish]] in the Kingdom and [[German language|German]] in the Duchies.
