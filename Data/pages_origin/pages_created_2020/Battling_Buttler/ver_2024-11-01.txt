'''''Battling Buttler''''' is a musical in three acts with music by [[Philip Braham]] and a book and lyrics by Stanley Brightman, [[Austin Melford]] and [[Douglas Furber]], which opened in London in 1922. It was then greatly revised by Walter L. Rosemont (music) and [[Ballard MacDonald]] (book and lyrics) and produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1923 after tryouts in Detroit and Chicago.

The farcical story concerns a man who pretends to be a championship boxer whom he resembles, until the two men are confused with one another, with humorous results.

==Synopsis (American version)==
Alfred Buttler, who leads a quiet life in a small town in New Hampshire, somewhat resembles a welterweight boxing champion by the same name. He tells his trusting wife that he is the boxing champion, although he knows nothing about boxing. This gives Alfred the opportunity to leave home for weeks at a time to attend "training". Instead, he goes to have fun in the city with his old friends. In the second act, his wife (and the chorus) follow him, and the real Battling Buttler, who likes the joke, insists that the fake Buttler take his place in the boxing ring. When Alfred's wife runs into the boxer's wife, the two women assume that they are married to the same man, and farcical complications ensue.
