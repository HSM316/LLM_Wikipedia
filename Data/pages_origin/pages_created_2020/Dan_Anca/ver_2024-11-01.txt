|quote="No, he was not a talent like [[Zoltán Ivansuc]], but when will another Ivansuc be born? He was not proud like [[Viorel Mateianu|Mateieanu]]; but how many live on pride? He wasn't a star like [[Emil Petru|Petru Emil]], but how many stars don't become ephemeris? He was not a hope; but how many high hopes were not true illusions? He was a modest, hardworking, disciplined footballer, who gave shine to the "peaks", "sacreds" carried on the arms of enthusiasm."
