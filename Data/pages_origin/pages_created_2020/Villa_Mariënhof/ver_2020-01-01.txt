'''Villa Mariënhof''' is a historic [[mansion]] with a garden located along the Bredaseweg in the Dutch city [[Tilburg]]. It was built between 1916 and 1918 as the residence of the family of a factory owner, and it was designed by [[Johan Wilhelm Hanrath]]. In 1986, it was inherited by [[Staatsbosbeheer]], who first used Villa Mariënhof as an office and later rented it. The house itself, its [[teahouse]], and the garden are ''[[rijksmonument]]en''.<ref name="rijks1">{{Cite web |url = https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/521023 |title = Villa Mariënhof |access-date = 28 December 2019 |publisher = [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed]] |work = [[Rijksmonument]]enregister |language = Dutch }}</ref>

== History ==
Villa Mariënhof was constructed between 1916 and 1918 according to a design by architect [[Johan Wilhelm Hanrath]]. The client was Jos Janssen, who was the owner of the [[dyeing]] factory "De Regenboog" along the Bredaseweg. It was built on the north side of the Bredaseweg, where [[ribbon development]] of large detached houses with gardens started to take a hold in the 1930s.<ref name="rijks1"/><ref name="rijks4">{{Cite web |url = https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/521025 |title = Monumentnummer: 521025 Mariënhof // Bredaseweg 387 5037 LD te Tilburg |access-date = 29 December 2019 |publisher = Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed |work = Rijksmonumentenregister |language = Dutch |date = 15 October 2019 }}</ref> The building was renovated after a building permit was granted in 1939. The [[veranda]] was turned into a [[sunroom]], and a [[terrace (building)|terrace]] was added adjacent to it in the front. In 1951, a concrete one-car garage was built on the eastern side of the lot.<ref name="archief"/>

The government organization [[Staatsbosbeheer]] inherited the property from Charles Janssen, Jos' son, in 1986 with the request to conserve the mansion for at least 25 years.<ref name="bd">{{Cite news |url = https://www.bd.nl/tilburg-e-o/een-villa-met-on-tilburgse-allure-maar-waar-blijft-toch-die-koper~ae325d4e0/ |title = Een villa met on-Tilburgse allure, maar waar blijft toch die koper? |access-date = 29 December 2019 |newspaper = [[Brabants Dagblad]] |language = Dutch |date = 11 May 2019 |last = Ackermans |first = Ben }}</ref><ref name="elsevier">{{Cite news |url = https://www.elsevierweekblad.nl/economie/article/2015/09/te-koop-een-enorm-vrijstaand-monument-in-tilburg-2691362W/ |title = Te koop: een enorm vrijstaand monument in Tilburg |access-date = 29 December 2019 |language = Dutch |date = 3 October 2015 |newspaper = [[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] }}</ref> It subsequently served as a regional headquarters for that organization, and it was renovated in the late 1980s, adding among other things a [[fire escape]].<ref name="quote"/><ref name="archief"/> Starting in 1997, Staatsbosbeheer rented Villa Mariënhof as a residential unit.<ref name="quote">{{Cite news |url = https://www.quotenet.nl/vastgoed/qasteel/a183928/deal-van-het-jaar-monumentale-villa-in-tilburg-voor-nog-geen-1-miljoen-foto-s-183928/ |title = Deal van het jaar: monumentale villa in Tilburg voor nog geen €1 miljoen (foto's) |newspaper = [[Quote (magazine)|Quote]] |language = Dutch |last = Wonderen |first = Stijn van |date = 31 August 2016 |access-date = 28 December 2019 }}</ref> The mansion, its garden, and its teahouse became three separate ''[[rijksmonument]]en'' in 2002. According to the [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed]], the building has cultural-historical importance as it serves as an example of the construction of estates along the [[Arterial road|arteries]] entering industrial towns. Furthermore, it has important value within the oeuvre of architects Hanrath and Springer, and its interior and exterior are in a good condition.<ref name="rijks1"/> The roof of Villa Mariënhof was replaced in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.bd.nl/tilburg/tilburgse-villa-marienhof-even-gestript~a67a59aa/ |title = Tilburgse villa Mariënhof even gestript |access-date = 29 December 2019 |newspaper = Brabants Dagblad |language = Dutch |date = 14 November 2012 |last = Spanjers |first = Kim }}</ref>

Staatsbosbeheer tried to sell the mansion in 2015 for an asking price of around €950,000, preferably for residential usage. That price did not include the lot on which the mansion stands, as Staatsbosbeheer planned to lease this to a seller (''erfpacht'').<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.bd.nl/tilburg/monumentale-villa-marienhof-in-tilburg-te-koop~ad4bfb45/ |title = Monumentale villa Mariënhof in Tilburg te koop |access-date = 29 December 2019 |newspaper = Brabants Dagblad |language = Dutch |date = 11 June 2015 |last = Ackermans |first = Ben }}</ref> This last condition was later dropped, and the asking price was raised to €1.85 million before it was lowered again to €1.6 million in 2019.<ref name="bd"/> Because the estate agent did not manage to sell the property, Staatsbosbeheer dropped the preference for residential usage later that year, although the zoning plans still required an alteration to allow for extensions or other uses.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.bd.nl/tilburg-e-o/villa-marienhof-wat-mogen-kopers-nu-wel-en-niet-met-gewild-tilburgs-rijksmonument~a48fdcd4/ |title = Villa Mariënhof: wat mogen kopers nu wel en niet met gewild Tilburgs rijksmonument |access-date = 29 December 2019 |newspaper = Brabants Dagblad |language = Dutch |date = 21 November 2019 |last = Jongerius |first = Stephan }}</ref>

== Architecture ==
=== Main building ===
The mansion was designed by [[Johan Wilhelm Hanrath]], a Dutch architect from [[Hilversum]] in the [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|traditionalist]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]] styles.<ref name="quote" /> It has two above-ground floors, a basement, and an [[attic]] below its [[hip roof]].<ref name="rijks2"/> The roof is covered with red [[roof tiles]], and features two masoned chimneys.<ref name="archief"/> The mansion has [[Flemish bond]] brickwork.<ref name="rijks2"/>

The front facade is symmetric and consists of three [[bay (architecture)|bays]]. The central [[porch]] is topped by a rounded [[arch]], and it includes a front door made out of [[oak]]. The door is flanked by two [[leaded windows]] depicting scenes from the textile industry. A leaded window above the door shows [[Noah's Ark]], the dates "1890 - 2 december - 1940" and the signature of stained glass artist [[Pieter Wiegersma]]. The porch also features a [[foundation stone]] out of [[sandstone]] with the inscription "Memorial stone laid by Joseph and Charles Janssen, January 1917".<ref group=note>Original Dutch text: "Gedenksteen is gelegd door Joseph en Charles Janssen, Januari 1917"</ref> On both sides, there are [[cant (architecture)|canted]] [[bay window]]s, that go from the ground to the roof. Most windows in the front facade are [[cross-window]]s and some have [[window shutter|shutters]]. The roof features three [[dormer]]s.<ref name="rijks2"/>

The east side facade has a sunroom, that used to be a veranda. It is supported by [[buttress]]es and features rounded windows. A [[balcony]] with a masoned [[balustrade]] is located on top of it. Another entrance with a two-step stairs is situated next to the sunroom under a wooden [[canopy (building)|canopy]]. The west facade is symmetric, and has a terrace with two balustrades. The backside has a door in the middle, that can be reached using two steps. There is a wooden balcony above that door. The back facade has three dormers just like the front facade.<ref name="rijks2">{{Cite web |url = https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/521024 |title = Monumentnummer: 521024 Mariënhof // Bredaseweg 387 5037 LD te Tilburg |access-date = 28 December 2019 |publisher = Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed |work = Rijksmonumentenregister |language = Dutch |date = 15 October 2019 }}</ref>

A [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] with a floor and [[panelling]] made out of green marble is located behind the front door. The central hall on the ground floor connects to most rooms including the living room and a [[drawing room]] with [[teak]] panelling. The ground floor toilet and its passage are decorated with green glazed tiles. Another passage has a backdoor and the entrance to the kitchen, that is fitted with an [[intercom]] to deliver messages to the other rooms. The kitchen and [[scullery]] have floors with a chessboard pattern and panelling of white glazed tiles with images. Similar tiling can be found around one of the fireplaces as well. The central hall also contains the three-part staircase, that is made out of [[Scots pine]] wood and leads to the first floor. This floor and the one above it contain the bedrooms and the bathrooms.<ref name="rijks2"/>

=== Garden and teahouse ===
The forested garden with a size of {{Convert|18,000|sqm|abbr=on}} was designed by landscape architect [[Leonard Springer]], who was also responsible for the Leijpark in Tilburg.<ref name="bd"/><ref name="elsevier"/> The [[English landscape garden]] was constructed in 1917 and used to have a size of around {{Convert|25,000|sqm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="elsevier"/><ref name="rijks4"/> It has two [[driveway]]s – both with white wooden gates supported by masoned [[pillar]]s at the road. A lawn is situated in between the two curved driveways.<ref name="rijks4"/> Another lawn is located directly behind the house and is surrounded by [[weeping beech]]es, [[silver linden]]s, and [[oak trees]]. A winding path surrounded by [[shrub]]s goes through the garden.<ref name="elsevier"/> When Villa Mariënhof was just completed, it offered vistas of farmlands in the south and forests in the west.<ref name="rijks4"/>

About 15% of the garden was sold around the year 1970 for the development of a new residential area. Because of this, the [[kitchen garden]], the [[orchard]], and the gardener's residence disappeared. The layout of the paths was also adjusted. [[Bald cypress]]es, [[larch]]es, and [[Douglas fir]]s were planted at the former location of the kitchen garden and orchard. The tennis court was removed in 1980, and trees were placed there as well.<ref name="rijks4"/>

The garden also contains a [[teahouse]] situated close to the road. It was designed by Hanrath as well, and the building permit was granted in 1917.<ref name="archief"/><ref name="rijks3"/> The [[octagonal]] structure has [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] siding and a [[thatched]] [[hip roof]].<ref name="archief">{{Cite web |url = https://www.tilburg.nl/inwoners/verhuizen-verbouwen/archief-bouwen-en-milieu/ |website = [[Tilburg]] |access-date = 29 December 2019 |title = Archief bouwen en milieu |language = Dutch |url-access = limited }}</ref><ref name="rijks3"/> The front has a veranda with red tiles, a wooden balustrade, and four columns.
