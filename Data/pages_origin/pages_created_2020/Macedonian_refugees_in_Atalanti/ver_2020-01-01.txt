'''The Macedonian refugees in Atalanti''' are a compact population from the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] region, located in the [[Phthiotis]] town of [[Atalanti]] after the establishment of the independent [[Kingdom of Greece]].

On November 5, 1826, the port of Atalanti arrived there, the Thessalomacedonians (Θεσσαλομακεδόνες), led by [[Angelis Gatsos]] (Angel Gatzo) and [[Anastasios Karatasos]], organized by the [[Philhellene]] through [[Ioannis Kolettis]]. In 1829, 545 Macedonian families or 2,436 people were accommodated in [[Skopelos]]. <ref>{{cite book |title= Η Οπουντία Λοκρίδα και η Αταλάντη – Μνήμες και μαρτυρίες.

A royal decree of March 20, 1835, affirmed that 370 Macedonian refugees were granted the right to settle in Atalanti, freeing up 3.5 acres of state land for cultivation and food. Subsequently, other Macedonian refugees settled in Atalanti, and all of them were granted state-owned timber for the construction of houses.

By royal decree of April 25, old style, or May 7, 1837, Macedonians were granted the right of self-government - in this case, against the existing local Greek community. This provoked protest by the mayor and as a result the formation of two parallel self-governing communities, with no analogue in the territory of the Kingdom of Greece. Immediately after the royal decree, philanthropist [[Konstantinos Bellios]] donated 2000 books to the local ''Macedonian library''. The parallel settlement of the Greek Atalanti is called by the local Greeks the ''Turkish neighborhood'' (Τουρκομαχαλάς), officially named [[Pella]] or ''Nea Pella''.
