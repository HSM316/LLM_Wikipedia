The '''Macedonian refugees in Atalanti''' ({{langx|el|Μακεδόνες πρόσφυγες στην Αταλάντη}}) were a compact population from the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] region, settled in the town of [[Atalanti]] after the failed revolution in Macedonia during the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the independent [[Kingdom of Greece]].

On November 5, 1826, at the port of Atalanti, arrived the "Thessalomacedonians" (Θεσσαλομακεδόνες) refugees, led by [[Angelis Gatsos]] and [[Anastasios Karatasos]], organized with the aid of [[Ioannis Kolettis]]. In 1829, 545 Macedonian families or 2,436 people were accommodated in [[Skopelos]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Η Οπουντία Λοκρίδα και η Αταλάντη – Μνήμες και μαρτυρίες.

Between February and March 1831, 150 captains with their men fled from [[Thessaloniki]] to southern parts of Greece and the government of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] received and accommodated them in Atalanti.<ref>{{cite book |title= Λοκρίδα – Ιστορία & Πολιτισμός |last=Δακορώνια |first=Φανουρία, Δημήτρης Κωτούλας, Ευαγγελία Μπαλτά, Βασιλική Συθιακάκη, Γιώργος Τόλιας |authorlink= |year= 2002 |publisher=Κτήμα Χατζημιχάλη |location= |isbn= 960-85886-5-0 |pages= 187 |url= |accessdate= |lang= el }}</ref>

A royal decree of March 20, 1835, affirmed that 370 Macedonian refugees were granted the right to settle in Atalanti, freeing up {{convert|3+1/2|acre|ha|order=flip|round=0.5}} of state land for cultivation and food. Subsequently, other Macedonian refugees settled in Atalanti, and all of them were granted state-owned timber for the construction of houses.

By royal decree of April 25, old style, or May 7, 1837, Macedonians were granted the right of self-government - in this case, against the existing local Greek community. This provoked protest by the mayor and as a result the formation of two parallel self-governing communities, with no analogue in the territory of the Kingdom of Greece. Immediately after the royal decree, philanthropist [[Konstantinos Bellios]] donated 2000 books to the local ''Macedonian library''.

The district in Atalanti for the Macedonian Greeks was the former "Turkish neighborhood" (Τουρκομαχαλάς), officially renamed to [[Pella]] or "Nea Pella" (New Pella) or "Nea Pelli" ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] form of Pella). In 1859 [[Simon Sinas]] was declared also honorable citizen of Nea Pella.
