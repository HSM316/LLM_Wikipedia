==History==

=== The first century: 1899-1999 ===
Alliance Bible Seminary was established in 1899 in [[Wuzhou]], [[Guangxi|Guangxi Province]], China. It was founded by Dr Robert Hall Glover, a medical missionary appointed to China in 1894 by C&MA, together with Robert A. Jaffray, Alvin Field, and Walter H. Oldfield.<ref name=":0" /> In 1902, the Seminary established the Alliance Women's College, the first institute of its kind in the Guangxi province. In 1937, these two institutions were merged, and in 1938 renamed as Alliance Bible Institute.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.abs.edu/about-abs/%E5%BB%BA%E9%81%93%E7%B0%A1%E5%8F%B2/|title=About ABS|website=Alliance Bible Seminary}}</ref>

Following the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949,<ref name=":2" /> Alliance Bible College relocated to Cheung Chau, Hong Kong, where it resumed operations in 1950. The College was renamed as Alliance Bible Seminary in 1955, since in Hong Kong the term "College" is customarily used to refer to secondary schools. In 1958 Alliance Bible Seminary issued its first ever Bachelor's degree.<ref>"[https://www.abs.edu/about-abs/%E5%BB%BA%E9%81%93%E7%B0%A1%E5%8F%B2/ About ABS]". ''Alliance Bible Seminary''.</ref>

In 1975 the Christian and Missionary Alliance Mission elected to transfer governorship of Alliance Bible Seminary to local Chinese Christians, under the auspices of the [https://cmacuhk.org.hk/ Christian and Missionary Alliance Church Union of Hong Kong]. Under this new leadership structure, Dr Philip Teng assumed the responsibility of president of the Seminary, a position that he held for five years, before the inauguration of the second president, Dr James Cheung, in 1980.<ref name=":2" />

During the following decade the ABS significantly increased its graduate provision. In 1983 the Seminary began to offer a Master's degree in [[Christian Ministry]], in 1986 it introduced the Master of [[Biblical Studies]] and the Master of [[Christian mission|Missions]] and [[Evangelism]] programs, and in 1989 the Master of Divinity program was launched. This growth in graduate provision led to the establishment of the Alliance Bible Seminary Graduate School in 1991.<ref name=":2" /> 

The founding of the Graduate School led to an increase in academic theological and cultural engagement within the Seminary, beginning with the establishment of the Christianity and Chinese Culture Research Centre in the same year, and the inaugural publication of a Biblical studies journal, ''[https://www.abs.edu/en/departments/abs-publications/%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF/ Jian Dao: A Journal of Bible and Theology],'' in 1994. In 1996, ABS established the Pastoral Institute, and with it a second journal, ''The Pastoral Journal''.<ref name=":2" /> 

The Seminary continued to expand its graduate program, with the launching of the [[Doctor of Ministry]] degree in 1995, the [[Master of Theology]] program in 1996, and the Master of Christian Studies (part-time) in 1997.<ref name=":2" />

=== The 'New Era': 2000-2019 ===
The 'New Era', which began after the celebration of Alliance Bible Seminary's Centennial Anniversary, was marked with the completion and the Centennial Complex in 2000, and the dedication of the Au Shue Hung Memorial Chapel in 2001.<ref name=":2" /> 

This expansion continued with the purchase of the City Campus site at [[Wan Chai]] in 2005, its opening in the following year. Also established in 2005 was the Department of Pastoral and Professional Continuing Education, and the Lay Leadership Training Department. 2005 also saw the inauguration of a new president, Dr Leung Ka-Lun.<ref name=":2" />

In 2008 the Seminary further extended its campus with the opening of both Siu Yee Hall and Timothy Hall. The graduate program also underwent further expansion, with the addition of the Master of Ministry and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] programs. In 2010 the Seminary established the School of Pastoral and Professional Continuing Education (SPPCE), before adding a further campus site in [[Kowloon]], Hong Kong, the Alliance Bible Seminary Kowloon Centre.<ref name=":2" />
