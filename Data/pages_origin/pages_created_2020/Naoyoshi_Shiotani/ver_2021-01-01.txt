==Biography==
As a child, Shiotani was a fan of animation and enjoyed drawing. His favorite works were [[Studio Ghibli]] film, like [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Delivery Service]]''. He was also a fan of [[Production I.G.]] through their franchises ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Patlabor]]''. He was also a fan of live-action films including Blade Runner, ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Gattaca]]'', ''[[The Fifth Element|Fifth Element]]'', ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', ''[[Brazil (1944 film)|Brazil]]'' and the ''[[Millennium Trilogy - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]''.<ref name="title"/>

Upon joining Production I.G., Shiotani became interested in combining traditional animation with cgi animation for his works, most notably ''[[Oblivion Island]]''. Shiotani's first directed work was the film ''[[Tokyo Marble Chocolate]]'' which he made for a young a demographic by giving it the theme of a family. He then directed the 2012-2013 television series ''[[Psycho-Pass]]'' which became one of his highlights of his career.<ref name="title">{{cite web|url=https://www.otakunews.com/Article/2463/an-interview-with-psycho-pass-director-naoyoshi-shiotani|title=An interview with Psycho-Pass Director Naoyoshi Shiotani|publisher=Otaku News|accessdate=January 1, 2019}}</ref>

''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Patlabor]]''; the company hired Katsuyuki Motohiro{{mdash}}who became the series' chief director{{mdash}}and veteran I.G. animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise direction.<ref name="psychopassreviewinter">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-season-one/blu-ray-complete-collection-premium-edition|title=Psycho-Pass Season One Blu-Ray - Complete Collection Premium Edition|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014|publisher=Anime News Network|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429202849/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-season-one/blu-ray-complete-collection-premium-edition|archivedate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Before work on ''Psycho-Pass'' started, Shiotani was busy working on the film ''[[Blood-C: The Last Dark]]''. As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality. After episode 16, which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series, the team found themselves "out of stamina". The next two episodes were made by an outside team, which is reflected in several problems with the animation.<ref name="jentonline">{{cite web |url=http://j-entonline.com/interviews-and-articles/media-qa-psycho-pass/|title=Media Q&A with Executive Director Katsuyuki Motohiro, Director Naoyoshi Shiotani and Producer Joji Wada (of "PSYCHO-PASS") by Dennis A. Amith and Michelle Tymon (J!-ENT Interviews and Articles)|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013|publisher=J!-Entoline|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627135814/http://j-entonline.com/interviews-and-articles/media-qa-psycho-pass/|archivedate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes are more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, "it's more about the show's inflexibility" because the staff have to maintain consistency. During the final episodes of the first series, Shiotani conceived the idea of a ''Psycho-Pass'' film. Urobuchi and  Motohiro said the film would have to contain a scenario independent of Japan's Sibyl System society. Shiotani wanted to create the film in collaboration with the staff who had worked on season one of the series, and with character designer Naoyuki Onda and art director Shuichi Kusamori, who also worked on the series. Urobuchi believed the ideal sequel would be a film rather than a television series but wanted to stay true to the roots of the original series.<ref name="AnimeNewsNetwork">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-09-26/psycho-pass-film-slated-for-january-9-with-gen-urobuchi-makoto-fukami/.79243 |title=Psycho-Pass Film Slated for January 9 With Gen Urobuchi, Makoto Fukami |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520032113/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-09-26/psycho-pass-film-slated-for-january-9-with-gen-urobuchi-makoto-fukami/.79243 |archive-date=May 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
