'''Komotini railway station''' ({{lang-el|Σιδηροδρομικός Σταθμός Κομοτηνής|Sidirodromikós stathmós Komotinís}}) is a railway station that servers the city of [[Komotini]], in [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope]] in [[East Macedonia and Thrace]], Greece. The station is located 3&nbsp;km southeast of the city centre but within city limits. The station (as of 2019) is staffed, but only at peak times, but has waiting rooms and a bus stop in the forecourt.

==History==
The station opened in 1900 on what was the Société du Chemin de Fer Ottoman Jonction Salonique-Constantinople '''JSC''', build to connect [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Alexandroupoli]]. During this period, [[Northern Greece]] and the [[Balkans|southern Balkans]] were still under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].<ref name="avgi.gr">{{cite web|url=http://www.avgi.gr/koinonia/435312_treno-den-sfyrizei-pia|title=Eastern Macedonia - Thrace / The train doesn't whistle anymore... – GTP|website=www.avgi.gr|date=5 January 2023 }}</ref> Komotini was annexed by [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] on 18 October 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]]. From 1920, under the Greek administration, significant improvements were made, and the train crossed the land of Thrace and Eastern Macedonia, transporting passengers and goods safely and at low fares.<ref name="avgi.gr"/>

On 17 October 1925, The Greek government purchased the Greek sections of the former Salonica Monastir railway<ref>Le Journal des finances, 15 janvier 1926 (in French)</ref> and the railway became part of the [[Hellenic State Railways]], with the remaining section north of [[Florina]] seeded to [[kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1970 [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|OSE]] became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971, the station and most of the Greek rail infrastructure were transferred to the ''[[Hellenic Railways Organisation|Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.]]'', a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. On 9 September 2007, the station reopened. Since 2007, the station is served by the [[Proastiakos Thessaloniki]] services to [[New Railway Station]]. In 2009, with the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek debt crisis]] unfolding [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|OSE]]'s Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cut back, routes closed, and stations left abandoned as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis were cut back from six to just two trains a day, reducing the reliability of services and passenger numbers. In 2016 upgrade<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greeka.com/greece-travel/trains/|title=Trains in Greece: Rail connection &#124; Greeka}}</ref> work on the line resulted in no stopping services between [[Drama, Greece|Drama]] and [[Xanthi]].<ref name="dramini.gr">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dramini.gr/erga-tou-ose-vgazoun-ektos-litourgias-ti-grammi-dramas-xanthis-gia-9-oloklirous-mines/|title = Ευνοϊκή διάταξη Νόμου για τους οφειλέτες των Δήμων-Αιτήσεις έως 31 Οκτωβρίου &#124; dramini|date = 20 September 2016}}</ref> There is old abandoned boxcar shunted onto one of the sidetracks, very close to the station buildings.

In July 2022, the station began being served by [[Hellenic Train]], the rebranded TranOSE<ref>https://www.ekathimerini.com/economy/1188080/trainose-renamed-hellenic-train-eyes-expansion/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2022}}</ref>

In January 2019, services between Komotini and Alexandroupolis were suspended after a local river burst its banks in the area near the village of Venna, and a rail replacement bus service was commenced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/236428/komotini-alexandroupolis-train-service-disrupted-after-river-flood/|title=Komotini-Alexandroupolis train service disrupted after river flood &#124; eKathimerini.com|website=www.ekathimerini.com}}</ref>

Between July 2005 and February 2011, the ''[[Friendship Express]]'', (an international [[InterCity]] train jointly operated by the [[Turkish State Railways]] (TCDD) and [[TrainOSE]] linking [[Istanbul]]'s [[Sirkeci Terminal]], Turkey and [[Thessaloniki new railway station|Thessaloniki]], Greece) made scheduled stops at Komotini.
