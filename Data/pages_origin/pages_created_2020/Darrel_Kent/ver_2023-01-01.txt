'''Darrel Brock Kent'''<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', March 15, 1982, pg 42, "Birth and Death Notices"</ref> (born October 1942) is a former [[Ottawa City Council]]lor. He served on council from 1980 to 1982 and from 1985 to 1991. He ran for mayor of Ottawa in 1982 and for Chair of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton in 1991.

==Early career==
Kent was involved in politics as a student at [[Carleton University]], where he was a member of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] Student Federation.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 3, 1964, pg 17, "Leader squeaks through in secret student vote"</ref>

Before entering politics, he was an elementary school history teacher at [[Alta Vista Public School]]. Kent first ran for city council [[1978 Ottawa municipal election|in 1978]] in [[Alta Vista Ward]], but lost to incumbent alderman [[Don Kay (politician)|Don Kay]]. Kent had been a supporter of Kay's in the previous election, but became disillusioned citing an inattentiveness to projects in the ward and taking an "irresponsible stand" on the Quebec-Ontario construction border war.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', July 28, 1978, pg 4, "Former aide to battle Kay"</ref> He ran on a platform on providing services to the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and turning the CN railway into a rapid transit route.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 6, 1978, pg 69, "Aldermanic races"</ref> At the time of the election, he was living on Southvale Cres.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', October 24, 1978, pg 5, "List of nominations"</ref> Kent ended up placing third with 21% of the vote, well behind Kay who won with 49% of the vote.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 15, 1978, pg 6, "Keeping it straight, how candidates fared"</ref>

==First term==
Kent tried again to unseat Kay in the [[1980 Ottawa municipal election|1980 municipal election]] in the newly created [[Canterbury Ward]]. During the campaign, Kent cited traffic problems, a buffer around [[Sheffield Glen]], improved day care services and making the [[National Capital Commission|NCC]] green space into an all-age recreation area, and for the NCC to clean up a swampy area behind Eastway Gardens.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 3, 1980, pg 67, "Kent promises new style if elected to city hall"</ref>

During the campaign, Kent was the target of election sign vandalism (which resulted in Kay being charged with public mischief) and "hate literature", where pamphlets were handed out with headlines re-arranged in "obscene, sexual ways" and which said that Kent should be murdered and is a sexual deviate.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 10, 1980, pg 5, "Kent promises new style if elected to city hall"</ref> Kent would go on to defeat Kay, winning 57% of the vote to Kay's 43%.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 11, 1980, pg 49, "Kent's strong campaign beats 18-year veteran Kay"</ref>

Following his election, Kent was appointed to the city's policy and priorities committee.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', December 4, 1980, pg 4, "Kent promises new style if elected to city hall"</ref> In his first term on council (which also gave him a seat on the [[Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality|Ottawa-Carleton]] Regional Council), Kent supported the re-election of [[Andrew S. Haydon]] for [[Regional Chair of Ottawa-Carleton|regional chair]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', December 11, 1980, pg 3, "Haydon easily wins second term as regional boss"</ref> Kent was a member of the so-called "gang of nine" on city council, a group of conservative-leaning aldermen who would often vote as a majority bloc to curb social spending, against the wishes of the city's left leaning mayor, [[Marion Dewar]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 16, 1981, pg 55, "City hall tyros keep tight rein on purse strings"</ref>

==Mayoral run==
On February 26, 1982, Kent announced that he would be challenging Dewar for mayor of the city in the [[1982 Ottawa municipal election|1982 mayoral election]]. He had been a vocal critic of Dewar, and played a role in cutting the city's budget for 1982.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 27, 1982, pg 1, "Rookie Kent to challenge Dewar for mayor"</ref> The main issue of the campaign would be over Dewar's support of an $8.4 million arts centre at the [[Ottawa Teacher's College]], which Kent opposed.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', October 6, 1982, pg 73, "Teachers' College focus of election"</ref> Kent would go on to lose to Dewar, winning 44% of the vote to her 52%. The election was also a rebuke of the "conservative tide" that swept into power in the 1980 election as the new council was more left leaning.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 9, 1982, pg 1, "Dewar romps over Kent"</ref>

Following his defeat, Kent returned to teaching, moving to [[Manor Park Public School]]. During this period, he and some other individuals thought of forming a municipal political party to oppose the "influence of the [[New Democratic Party]]" in municipal politics.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 10, 1983, pg 21, "Kent toys with idea of political party"</ref> Kent also got involved in federal politics, and was elected as a [[Joe Clark]] delegate for the riding of [[Ottawa—Vanier]] for the [[1983 Progressive Conservative leadership election]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', April 21, 1983, pg 36, "Vanier PCs elect 7 Clark delegates"</ref> He also ran for the nomination for the Tories in [[Ottawa—Carleton]] to run in the [[1984 Canadian federal election]],<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 29, 1983, pg 15, "Hopefuls eye local ridings"</ref> but lost to [[Barry Turner (politician)|Barry Turner]] on June 26, 1984, 630 votes to 441 on a second ballot.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', June 27, 1984, pg 29, "Duel of the Turners possible matchup in Ottawa-Carleton"</ref>

==Second term==
After losing his mayoral race, Kent moved to Florida Avenue in neighbouring [[Alta Vista Ward]]. [[1985 Ottawa municipal election|In 1985]], he entered the race to run for alderman for the ward, which was an open seat, as incumbent [[Greg MacDougall]] was retiring.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', October 5, 1985, pg A9, "Alta Vista waste plant opposed"</ref> At the time, he was teaching history and geography at [[Fielding Drive Public School]]. Kent ran on a platform to make sure green space in the city was preserved, to monitor the "spiralling" costs for the city's rapid bus [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]], to see an easement of property taxes, and to attract 'clean industry' to the city.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 5, 1985, pg E5, "Candidates share opposition to planned incinerator"</ref> On election day, Kent defeated Dylan McGuinty (brother of future Ontario Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]]) in a close race, winning with 37% of the vote to McGuinty's 34%.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 13, 1985, pg B2, "A ward-by-ward breakdown of the election results across Ottawa"</ref> Overall, the 1985 election saw a comparatively right-ward shift for the city council, with the election of [[Jim Durrell]] as mayor, a past supporter of Kent's.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 16, 1985, pg B6, "Durrell's new council not a swing to right, but the middle"</ref> After his election, Kent was appointed to the city's executive committee.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', December 12, 1985, pg C1, "New Regional Council faces 'tough decisions'"</ref> While on council - and despite their friendship, Kent led a defeated motion to condemn Durrell for his "unilateral decision" to fight against plans to build a new regional headquarters.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 6, 1986, pg B1, "Council rejects motion condemning Durrell"</ref>

While there was some speculation that Kent would run against Durrell for mayor in the [[1988 Ottawa municipal election|1988 mayoral election]], he opted against it, choosing to run for re-election as alderman.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 13, 1988, pg D3, "Durrell goes for second term"</ref> Kent would be acclaimed in his re-election bid, with no candidates running against him. Despite running on a platform of more green spaces in 1985, during the '88 campaign, Kent was optimistic to the building of the "Alta Vista Parkway", a proposal to build a parkway on NCC land to alleviate congestion in the ward (but was never built) <ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 7, 1988, pg D4, "Acclaimed Kent plans to push Alta Vista Parkway work"</ref>

At the beginning of the 1988–1991 term, Kent was seen as "shifting to the middle" on council, in a perceived move to run for mayor in 1991.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', May 27, 1989, pg B4, "Ottawa City Council: A six-month report card"</ref> In 1989, Kent led a 'crusade' denouncing Quebec's [[Bill 178]] French-only law, calling it a "violation of human rights" and suggested the city end its language advisory committee.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 7, 1989, pg B4, "Kent plans second run at Quebec's language law"</ref>

While serving on council, Kent ran in the [[1990 Ontario general election]] in [[Ottawa South (provincial electoral district)|Ottawa South]] for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]]. He announced he would run after meeting PC leader [[Mike Harris]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 4, 1990, pg A1, "Ald. Kent to seek Tory nomination in Ottawa South"</ref> Kent was acclaimed as the candidate on August 11.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 12, 1990, pg E8, "Kent contests Ottawa South for PCs"</ref> Kent ran on local issues, in addition to the party's pledge to freeze tax-hikes.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 4, 1990, pg B3, "Trio of top candidates bless riding"</ref> Future councillor [[Peter Hume (politician)|Peter Hume]] served as his campaign manager. Liberal candidate [[Dalton McGuinty]] easily won the seat, with Kent finishing third. While it was seen as a winnable riding for the Tories, it was suggested that many would-be Tories voted Liberal to stop the NDP.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 7, 1990, pg B3, "McGuinty easy winner"</ref>

==Run for regional chair==
Instead of running for mayor, Kent opted to run for Regional Chair in the [[1991 Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality elections|1991 Regional elections]], the first time there would be a direct election for chair. He decided against running for mayor, as he supported the candidacy of [[Jacquelin Holzman]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', January 11, 1991, pg C1, "Kent wants to head region - and bury it"</ref> Kent ran on a platform of "no more than zero to three per cent" increase in taxes and for the "choking off capital projects".<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', October 16, 1991, pg B8, "Kent pledges to hold line on taxes"</ref> He also supported eliminating the regional government altogether by 1994.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 14, 1991, pg A1, "The candidates for regional chair"</ref> Kent also supported instituting light rail under Downtown Ottawa instead of buses, an idea which received a "chilly reception" by [[OC Transpo]] commissioners.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 5, 1990, pg B6, "Light rail proposal received chilly reception"</ref> (Ottawa would eventually get a light rail tunnel in 2019.) On election day, Kent would finish in third in a close three-way race, with 28% of the vote, losing to [[Peter D. Clark (politician)|Peter D. Clark]].

==Post politics==
Following his loss, Kent became a consultant.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', March 3, 1992, pg D2, "The unmaking of a politician"</ref> He endorsed Peter Clark for Regional Chair in the [[1994 Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality elections|1994 Regional elections]].<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', November 12, 1994, pg A10 (ad for Peter Clark)</ref>

==Personal life==
Kent is the son of Lieutenant Colonel G. Leighton Kent and Elizabeth LeVernois.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 2, 1977, pg 44, "Birth and Death Notices"</ref>

Kent married Alia Khan in 1972.<ref>''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', October 17, 1972, pg 56, "Weddings"</ref>
