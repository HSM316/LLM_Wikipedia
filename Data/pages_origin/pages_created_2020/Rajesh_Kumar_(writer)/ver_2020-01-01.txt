==Pseudonym==
To avoid being confused with two pre-existing Tamil authors named "KR Rajagopal", he created a pseudonym based on the names of his sister and his sister-in-law: '''Rajesh'''wari and Anantha'''kumar'''.<!-- Note that this is the order from the original source; I am reasonably inferring that this means "Rajeshwari" was his sister--><ref name="Dinamani Not Out"/>
