'''James Clark''' (1 May 1825 – 5 June 1890) was an English [[Market garden|market gardener]] and [[Horticulture|horticulturlist]] in [[Christchurch, Dorset]] who specialised in raising new varieties of potato. His most noted success was Magnum Bonum, which is widely regarded as 'the first real disease-resisting potato ever originated and offered to the world' (The Times).<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=After a Hundred Years |date=31 March 1906 |page_number=9 |issue=37982 |column=6  }}</ref> 

==Life==
James Clark was born in [[Tuckton]] near [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch, Hampshire]] (now Dorset) on 1 May 1825. His father Thomas was a farm labourer. Clark had only a poor education and at the age of nine was sent to work on a farm in the neighbouring hamlet of [[Iford, Dorset|Iford]]. When he was aged twelve his family moved closer to Christchurch and his father became an under gardener at nearby Sandhills, the seaside estate of [[George Henry Rose |Sir George Henry Rose]], the Member of Parliament for Christchurch. Clark also became a gardener, working for the town’s wealthier residents.<ref name="JHCG484"> {{cite journal  |title=The Magnum Bonum Potato and Its Raiser |url= https://archive.org/details/journalofhorticu3118hogg/page/484 |journal= The Journal of Horticulture and Cottage Gardener |volume= |issue= |pages=pp. 484-486 | date=25 November 1880 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>

It was during this period that a fungus unwittingly transported to Europe from America devastated the potato crop in Ireland, causing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] of 1845-1850. In the wake of this tragedy potato breeders sought to find a reliable alternative to the disgraced [[Irish Lumper|Lumpers]] and Cups that had been the mainstay of the Irish planting.

In 1855 Clark became the gardener at a local boarding-school. It was there that he first developed an interest in growing potatoes and became fascinated by the varieties produced by a single root. However, the onset of a life-long heart complaint compelled him to quit this job and take on less arduous gardening work.<ref name="JHCG484"/>

In 1869 Clark moved his family to Cranemoor, a hamlet a few miles east of Christchurch, where his wife became the caretaker at the small Congregational chapel. In return they were granted a cottage and three-quarters of an acre of land rent free. Despite his continuing poor health, Clark began growing Early Rose potatoes. After lifting the first crop he discovered a few seed balls and from these he raised forty-two roots of seedling. He observed that these were all different from the parent plant.<ref name="JHCG484"/> The male pollen-parent was uncertain, but Clark suspected that it was Paterson’s Victoria because a quantity of that variety had been growing in nearby allotments.<ref> {{cite journal |title=James Clarke, of Christchurch |url= https://archive.org/details/gardenerschronic38lond/page/223 |journal=The Gardeners’ Chronicle |volume= Vol.8 (Third Series)|issue=July to December |pages=p. 223 |date=23 August 1890 |access-date= }}</ref>
 
In the following two seasons Clark saw that one of his new seedlings had survived when other local potato plants had been devastated by blight. He realised that this new variety held great promise, so he nurtured them and in the spring of 1874 he sent some of his seedlings to the noted horticulturalist [[Shirley Hibberd]] for him to test at his trial-ground in [[Hornsey]]. Hibberd’s tests confirmed the robust good qualities of the new variety and he recommended it to seed merchants [[Suttons Seeds|Messrs Sutton & Son]] of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], who purchased Clark’s entire stock and released it to the public as Sutton’s Magnum Bonum in 1876.<ref name="JHCG484"/> Hibberd promoted the Magnum Bonum by stating 'I believe that it will prove the most generally useful variety ever put into commerce'.<ref> {{cite journal |title=The Finest Potato at Present Known |url= https://archive.org/details/gardenerschronic51876lond/page/160 |journal=The Gardeners’ Chronicle |volume= Vol.5 (New Series)|issue=January to June |pages=p. 160 |date=29 January 1876 |access-date= }}</ref>

Magnum Bonum indeed proved to be a commercial success and soon became the best-selling variety grown in Great Britain. Its ability to survive hard frosts recommended it to Scottish growers in particular. It was a white, kidney-shaped late maincrop with a floury texture and a blandly sweet flavour that grew vigorously, withstood disease, and gave good yields. Its popularity peaked in about 1890, after which it degenerated and became susceptible to blight. Nevertheless, it was used to breed numerous other disease-resistant varieties.<ref name="TSOTP31">{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Alan |date=1995 |title=The Story of the Potato Through Illustrated Varieties |url= |location= |publisher=Alan Wilson |page=31-34 |isbn=0-9520973-1-1 |author-link=}}</ref>

Clark subsequently produced a number of other varieties released by Sutton & Son. These included Maincrop/Langworthy (1876), Reading Hero (1881), Sutton’s Seedling (1886), Abundance (1886), Best of All (1887), Satisfaction (1887), Masterpiece (1887), White Kidney (1888), Early Market (1888), Matchless (1889), Nonesuch (1889), Perfection (1892), Triumph (1892), Supreme (1893), Epicure (1897), No Plus Ultra (1897), Reliance (1897), Ninetyfold (1897), Ideal (1898), Inevitable (1898), Centenary (1900), and Favourite (1902).<ref name="Salaman2014">{{cite book|author=Redcliffe N.

Epicure proved an outstanding variety and is still grown today.<ref name="TSOTP31"/>

James Clark died at his Christchurch home on 5 June 1890 aged 65 years.<ref>{{cite journal  |date=26 June 1890 |title=Mr James Clark |url= https://archive.org/details/journalofhorticu3201hogg/page/524|journal= The Journal of Horticulture and Cottage Gardener |volume= |issue= |pages=pp. 524-525 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>
