==Club career==

==International career==
Andrei Sepci played four games at international level for [[Romania national football team|Romania]], making his debut on 4 June 1933 under coach [[Constantin Rădulescu (footballer, born 1896)|Constantin Rădulescu]] in a 7–0 victory with [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] at the [[1933 Balkan Cup]].<ref name=gazeta/><ref name=EU>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=19001|title=Andrei Sepci|publisher=European Football|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=EU2>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_tournament.php?id=BlC-3|title=1933 Balkan Cup|publisher=European Football|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=5737|title=Romania 7-0 Bulgaria|publisher=European Football|access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref> In the following two games, which were at the same competition he kept another two clean sheets in two victories against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], helping his side win the tournament, politician [[Alexandru Vaida-Voievod]] giving him a [[Decorative box|snuff box]] made of silver as a token of appreciation for not conceding any goals.<ref name=gazeta/><ref name=4ever/> The tournament was known in Romania as the ''Balacaniada lui 13–0'' ({{langx|en|The Balkans of 13–0}}) and Sepci considered it his playing career's biggest accomplishment:"The best memory of my life as a goalkeeper? The Balkans of 1933. The golden dream of every goalkeeper: not to concede a goal. And this in three consecutive games: with Bulgaria (7–0), with Greece (1–0) and with Yugoslavia (5–0). I will never forget that day when the [[Bucharest]] students accompanied me to the [[Bucharest North railway station|North Station]], while hundreds of enthusiastic people were waiting for me in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], with ovations and flowers. I asked myself then: "Why are they celebrating me?" And I found out the answer later: because every time a hero must be found. For me, however, in the Balkans of 1933, all the players in the team were heroes (...) Many more years will pass, maybe my grandsons will grow up to be men in all the power of the word, but I will still continue to tell them and their children about the unforgettable Balkans of 1933, with its memorable record: 13 goals scored, zero conceded".<ref name=4ever/><ref name=gazeta/><ref name=EU2/>

At the [[1934–35 Balkan Cup]] which was hosted by Greece, Romania had to face Yugoslavia in the last game of the tournament which if won could have earned them the trophy, but its goalkeeper [[Anghel Crețeanu]] got injured, so coach [[Alexandru Săvulescu (footballer)|Alexandru Săvulescu]] asked for Sepci and [[Vilmos Zombori]] to come for the game.<ref name=gazeta/> Sepci went on a plane that was piloted by [[Gheorghe Bănciulescu]], but did not get to the game because the plane had to return because of engine problems.<ref name=gazeta/> When the plane was in the air and had those problems, Sepci wanted to jump off it with a parachute, Bănciulescu telling the press:"The real hero of the Balkans from [[Athens]] is Sepci, who, despite the cold, voluntarily and bravely undertook this flight, just to help his team. Before takeoff, I also installed his parachute and instructed him when and how to jump from the plane, if we were in danger. We were at an altitude of 1,000 meters when the engine began to cough and I had to make some complicated maneuvers to look for a favorable place to return to the ground. Suddenly, I look back and see that Sepci, parachute in hand, was ready to jump into the void. At the last moment I managed to pull him back, because on his face you could read the unmoved determination, sister to death. This moment saved the player's life as the parachute was so tangled on him that it would never have opened and Sepci would have crashed to his death on the ground".<ref name=gazeta/> Eventually Zombori played in the game with the Yugoslavs which ended with a 4–0 loss.<ref name=gazeta/> Sepci made his final appearance for the national team when coach [[Constantin Rădulescu (footballer, born 1896)|Constantin Rădulescu]] sent him on the field at half-time in order to replace Crețeanu in a 2–2 with Greece at the [[1935 Balkan Cup]].<ref name=EU/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=5846|title=Greece 2-2 Romania|publisher=European Football|access-date=2 April 2024}}</ref>

===Managing style===
[[Remus Câmpeanu]], who was coached by Sepci at Știința Cluj described him:"He was a coach who talked a lot, individually, with us. Before the matches, he would spent half an hour or an hour talking with each one of us. He talked about our qualities, but also about our flaws, something he never did in full, face to face with others around. Under his hand, players have grown precisely because of this patience. In the games you could see that the team was playing a certain way. He knew how to ask the players what they could do."<ref name=4ever/>
