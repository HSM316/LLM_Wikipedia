'''Eyebrow Peak''' is a prominent {{Convert|3362|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=off|adj=on}} glaciated mountain summit located in the [[Purcell Mountains]] in southeast [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is the ninth-highest peak in the Purcells.<ref name="pb">{{cite peakbagger|3080|Eyebrow Peak, British Columbia|accessdate=2019-12-30}}</ref> It is situated {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[The Bugaboos]], {{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Invermere]], {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mount Monica]], and {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Duncan Lake (British Columbia)|Duncan Lake]]. Its nearest higher peak is Commander Mountain, {{convert|11.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast.<ref name="pb"/> The [[first ascent]] of the mountain was made in 1914 by Edward Warren Harnden, D. Brown, L. Nettleton, and E. Parson via the west slopes.<ref name=bivouac/> The name Eyebrow Peak came about by [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler]] in 1910 when viewing two broad rock scars near the summit, and their arrangement in connection with the surrounding snow created the appearance of enormous eyebrows.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|11373|Eyebrow Peak}}</ref> However, using the same sightings as Wheeler, Professor Peter Robinson showed that Wheeler actually saw [[Mount Farnham]].<ref name=bivouac/> Poor weather conditions led to Wheeler's error, and the ''Eyebrow'' moniker was then moved to its present location. The mountain's name was officially adopted June 9, 1960, by the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]].<ref name=cgndb/>
