The '''S6''' is a railway service of the [[St. Gallen S-Bahn]] that provides hourly service between {{rws|Rapperswil}} and {{rws|Schwanden}}, in the cantons of [[canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[canton of Glarus|Glarus]]. A limited number of trains continue from Schwanden to {{rws|Linthal}}. [[Südostbahn]], a private company primarily owned by the federal government and the canton of St. Gallen, operates the service.

== Operations ==
The S6 operates hourly between {{rws|Rapperswil}} and {{rws|Schwanden}}, using the [[Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke railway|Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke]] and [[Ziegelbrücke–Linthal railway|Ziegelbrücke–Linthal line]]s. Between Rapperswil and {{rws|Uznach}} the S6 combines with the ''[[Voralpen-Express]]'' for half-hourly service. South of Uznach, the S6 and [[S4 (St. Gallen S-Bahn)|S4]] combine for half-hourly service to {{rws|Ziegelbrücke}}.<ref name="fpf735">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2021/735.pdf | title = Rapperswil - Ziegelbrücke | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=12 October 2020 | accessdate = 26 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref> Between Ziegelbrücke and Schwanden, the S6 and the [[S25 (ZVV)|S25]] of the [[Zürich S-Bahn]] combine for half-hourly service. Most S6 trains terminate in Schwanden, but a few continue to Linthal, the southern terminus of the S25.<ref name="fpf736">{{cite web | url = https://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2021/736.pdf | title = Ziegelbrücke - Linthal | publisher = Bundesamt für Verkehr | date=25 November 2020 | accessdate = 26 September 2021 | lang=de}}</ref>

== History ==
The December 2013 timetable change applied the S6 designation to an existing hourly service between Rapperswil and Linthal. That service, and the new service, were operated by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB). Supplementing the S6 was the ''[[Glarner Sprinter]]'', a long-distance train that originated at [[Zürich Hauptbahnhof]] and operated every two hours, terminating in Schwanden. The S6 designation had been used for a service between {{rws|St. Gallen}} and {{rws|St. Gallen Haggen}}, operated by [[THURBO]].

In July 2014, the ''Glarner Sprinter'' was designated the S25 of the [[Zürich S-Bahn]], made hourly, and extended to Linthal. The S6, in turn, was cut back to Schwanden.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gl.ch/public/upload/assets/3025/140612_GLA_PM_S25_Quickies.pdf | title=Stündlich direkt zum Glarner Sommer-Quickie | lang=de | date=12 June 2014 | accessdate=26 September 2021 | publisher=Canton of Glarus}}</ref> SBB transferred the operation of the S6 to [[Südostbahn]] with the December 2020 timetable change.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Haralamb |first=Damian |date=2 December 2020 |title=Südostbahn erweitert ab Fahrplanwechsel Marktgebiet |language=de |work={{ill|Nau (newspaper)|de|Nau (Nachrichtenportal)|lt=Nau}}|url=https://www.nau.ch/ort/rapperswil-jona/sudostbahn-erweitert-ab-fahrplanwechsel-marktgebiet-65829442 |access-date=2021-09-26}}</ref>
