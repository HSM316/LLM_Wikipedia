One of her first well seen art pieces were photographs that she had made together with the South African artist, Jean Meeran (''Capa Morada'', 2003). In these photos, Marcelle disappeared into the landscape, dressed in a cape with matching colors so that herself and the city elided (''Capa Morada'', 2003). In one of her installation pieces, ''Education by Stone,'' she pushed numerous rods of chalk, a traditional teaching material, into the school-turned-gallery. This was seen at the [[Museum of Modern Art|MOMA]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinthia Marcelle|url=https://bordercrossingsmag.com/article/cinthia-marcelle|access-date=2020-03-04|website=bordercrossingsmag.com|language=en}}</ref>
