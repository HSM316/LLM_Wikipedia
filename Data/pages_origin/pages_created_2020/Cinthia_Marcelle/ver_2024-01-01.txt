== Art ==
Marcelle's art is mainly characterized by the synthesis and concision of language in her work. She takes inspiration from things she sees in her everyday life such as typical objects, places and their interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gorrell |first=Michael Gorrell |date=2011 |title=E-books on EBSCOhost: Combining NetLibrary E-books with the EBSCOhost Platform |journal=Information Standards Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=31 |doi=10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07 |issn=1041-0031}}</ref>

One of her first well seen art pieces were photographs that she had made with the South African artist, Jean Meeran (''Capa Morada'', 2003). In these photos, Marcelle disappeared into the landscape, dressed in a cape with matching colors so that she and the city elided. In one of her installation pieces, ''Education by Stone'', she pushed numerous rods of chalk, a traditional teaching material, into the school-turned-gallery. This was seen at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cinthia Marcelle |url=https://bordercrossingsmag.com/article/cinthia-marcelle |access-date=4 March 2020 |website=Border Crossings |date=December 2018}}</ref>
