==History==
Stanislas Bonn (1833-1888) was a furniture merchant who quickly adapted to the industrialized methods of production during the mid-nineteenth century, and opened a furniture store in Luxembourg in 1855. Originally, his business was located in the suburbs, but he soon relocated to larger, more centrally located premises on the Philippsgasse (also called the Rue Philippe II). The furniture business expanded to eventually occupy the entire building and was eventually named "Bonn Frères" (Brothers), which was retained as the official name until 1994. 

Ownership passed eventually to Mirtyl Bonn (1869-1956). Mirtyl's daughter Gabrielle married Paul Lazard in 1928, and the building passed to the estate of the Lazard family.<ref>Stammbam vun der Famill Bonn op [http://www.geni.com/people/Stanislas-Bonn/6000000025758805932 www.geni.com]</ref>. The Nazis seized the building during [[World War II]], but the Lazard family reclaimed possession of the business and building afterwards.

==Building== 
The building has 7 storeys and, as it turns out, is the largest furniture store in Luxembourg. It was first renovated in 1967 and then again from 1990-94 to plans of the architectural firm "Architecture et Environnement" together with the architects Gilbert Huybrechts and Jean Herr. In the latter renovation the original structure was integrated with the houses neighboring it to both the left and right; a section called Carré Bonn housing offices was created on the upper floors, while the lower 3 levels are reserved for the furniture and decor business showroom.<ref name=ons>Dani Schumacher: [http://www.onsstad.lu/uploads/media/ons_stad_103-2013_55.pdf "Mobilier Bonn: Das erste Möbelhaus in Luxemburg."] ons stad Nr 103, 2/2013, S.55.</ref>
