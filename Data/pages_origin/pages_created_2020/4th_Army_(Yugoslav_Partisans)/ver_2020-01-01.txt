The '''4th Army''' of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] was a Partisan army that operated in [[Yugoslavia]] during the last months of the Second World War. 

The Army was created on 1 March 1945, when Chief Commander Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] converted the underground [[National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia]] in the more regular '''Yugoslav Army'''.
