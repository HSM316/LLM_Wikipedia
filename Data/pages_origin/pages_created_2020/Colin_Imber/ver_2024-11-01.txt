'''Colin Imber''' is a lecturer in [[Turkish studies]] at [[Manchester University]], UK. 

He completed his [[Oriental studies]] at [[Cambridge University]], where he defended his doctorate on "The Ottoman Fleet in the Age of Sultan Suleiman I (1520-1566)". His research interest is focused on the [[history of the Ottoman Empire]] until the 17th century and on [[Islamic law]], in particular on the system of [[Ottoman law]], until the 17th century.

He is considered as "perhaps the leading, and...certainly the most productive, of the painfully few Ottoman historians currently working in British universities."<ref>{{cite web |last=Heywood |first=Colin |date=November 2004 |year= |orig-date= |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300–1650: The Structure of Power &#124; Reviews in History |url=https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/431 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240527060854/https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/431/ |archive-date=2024-05-27}}</ref>
