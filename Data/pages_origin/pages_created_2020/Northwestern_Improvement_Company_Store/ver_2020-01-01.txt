==History==

The store was built for the Northwestern Improvement Company, a subsidiary of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]], which operated coal mines on its holdings on the Roslyn–Cle Elum Ridge.<ref name="shideler" /> Of Northwestern Improvement's three [[company store]]s—[[Cle Elum]], [[Ronald, Washington|Ronald]], and Roslyn—the Roslyn store was the biggest and busiest.<ref name="caveness" /> The store provided food, clothing, hardware, and services for the miners and townspeople. One section of the store provided [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] services.<ref name="zach" /> A woman who grew up during the days of the mining company reminisced about the store: "It was the forerunner of today's malls all under one roof. It had a grocery store, men and women's clothes, a shoe department, yard goods and furniture."<ref name="hill" /> Purchases made at the company store were deducted from the miners' paychecks.<ref name="yakima" />

==Current use==

After Northwestern Improvement shut down its mining operation, the building was privately owned.<ref name="pulse" /> In the 1990s, the Northwestern Improvement Company Store building was the set for KBHR, the radio station of fictional [[Cicely, Alaska]], in the TV series ''Northern Exposure''.<ref name="yakima" /> In 2008, the building was used as a furniture store.<ref name="exposure" /> The Roslyn Downtown Association purchased the building from a developer in 2011<ref name="pittman" /> with some funds contributed by the state, and has used the building for its offices, a visitors' center, public events, as well as commercial businesses.<ref name="justin" /> The association's renovation plans included safety and accessibility improvements.<ref name="reno" />  

Various businesses have operated out of the building over the years.<ref name="zach" /> In 2017, Heritage Distilling Company, a  majority women-owned, family-operated craft distillery in Gig Harbor, opened a tasting room in the old company store building.<ref name="erickson" /><ref name="rda" />
