'''St Cuthbert's Church, Darlington''' is a parish church in the [[Church of England]] Diocese of Durham in [[Darlington]], [[County Durham]].

==History==
The church dates from the early 12th century. The church became collegiate when Richard Whitton was appointed by the [[Bishop of Durham]] [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Rt Revd Robert Neville]] as the first Dean of Darlington in 1439. To support the dean, there were four prebendaries, Cockerton, Newton, Blakwell and Darlington. The college survived until 1550 when it was dissolved.

Following a lightning strike on the spire on 17 July 1750,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Newcastle July 28 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000085/17500721/014/0002 |newspaper=Newcastle Courant |location=England |date=21 July 1750 |access-date=31 December 2019 |via=British Newspaper Archive }}</ref> the crossing tower was rebuilt in 1752. 

A major restoration took place in 1864-65 by the architects [[George Gilbert Scott]] of London and [[James Pigott Pritchett junior|James Pigott Pritchett]] of Darlington. The estimated costs of the works were £1,590 ({{Inflation|UK|1590|1863|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and [[William Vane, 3rd Duke of Cleveland]] gave £500 ({{Inflation|UK|500|1863|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} towards the restoration.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Untitled article |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000315/18640206/005/0002 |newspaper=Bury Times |location=England |date=6 February 1864 |access-date=30 December 2019 |via=British Newspaper Archive }}</ref>  The work involved removal of the galleries and ceilings, the opening out of the gable windows in the nave and transepts, the rearranging of the pews, and the replacing of several stalls which had been destroyed. The main work was the restoration of the chancel where the piscina and armoury were restored, the sedilia restored to their original depth, the floor laid with encaustic tiles and eleven stained glass windows inserted. A font was presented by R.H. Allan, of grey polished marble. A lectern by Messrs King and Collie of Durham was presented by Miss Topham. The organ was restored and the bells in the tower were recast. The church was reopened for worship on 14 December 1865.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Restoration of St Cuthbert’s Church, Darlington |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000242/18651215/018/0003 |newspaper=Newcastle Journal |location=England |date=15 December 1865 |access-date=30 December 2019 |via=British Newspaper Archive }}</ref>
