'''Roknābād''' is the name of a district on the north side of [[Shiraz]], watered by a man-made stream of the same name. It was celebrated in a well-known ode of the 14th-century poet [[Hafez]], in these lines:<ref>Hafez, Ghazal 3.</ref>

:{{lang|fa-Latn|bedeh, sāqī, mey-ē bāqī * ke dar jennat naxāhī yāft}}
:{{lang|fa-Latn|kenār-ē āb-e Roknābād * o golgašt-ē Mosallā-rā}}

:"Give, wine-pourer, the rest of the wine, since in heaven you will not find
:the banks of the water of Roknabad and the rose-walk of Mosalla."

In another of his ghazals Hafez says:<ref>Hafez, Ghazal 33; cf. Ghazal 101.</ref>
:{{lang|fa-Latn|nasīm-e xāk Mosallā vo āb-e Roknābād}}
:{{lang|fa-Latn|qarīb-rā vatan-e xīš mībarad az yād}}

:"The breeze of the soil of Mosalla and the water of Roknabad
:robs the stranger of the memory of his own country"

Another Shirazi poet, [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], in the 13th century, also mentioned the stream in these words:<ref>Saadi, Ghazal no. 154.</ref>

:{{lang|fa-Latn|dast 'az dāman-am nemīdārad}}
:{{lang|fa-Latn|xāk-e Šīrāz o āb-e Roknābād}}

:"They never let go of my skirt –
:the soil of Shiraz and the water of Roknabad"

The traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited Shiraz in 1327, wrote in the account of his travels completed in 1355:<ref>Quoted by [[Gertrude Bell]] (1897), Poems from the Divan of Hafiz.</ref> 

:"Shiraz lies in a plain; gardens surround it on every side; and five rivers flow through it, amongst them one called Ruknabad, a stream of which the water is excellent to drink, very cold in summer and warm in winter. ... One of the mausoleums outside the town contains the tomb of Sheikh [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], the first poet of his time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May God have mercy on Shiraz!"
