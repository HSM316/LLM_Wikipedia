'''''Castanopsis acuminatissima''''' is an evergreen tree native to [[Indonesia]], where it is known as '''sarangan'''. It is mostly found in undisturbed forests of [[West Java]] around [[Mount Gede]] and [[Mount Halimun]], with a density of ca. 12 trees/[[hectare]]. It also occurs in national parks, nature reserves and at high altitude forests in other areas of Java. It is almost extinct from lowland areas in [[Sumatra]], due to the clearance of the land for palm oil plantations.<ref name=iucn/>
