'''''Castanopsis acuminatissima''''' is an evergreen tree native to Indonesia, where it is known as '''sarangan'''. It is mostly found in undisturbed forests of [[West Java]] around [[Mount Gede]] and [[Mount Halimun]], with a density of ca. 12 trees/[[hectare]]. It also occurs in national parks, nature reserves and at high altitude forests in other areas of Java. It is almost extinct from lowland areas in [[Sumatra]], due to the clearance of the land for palm oil plantations.<ref name=iucn/> 

The fruits are decorated with branched spines. Each fruit cup contains one to four edible nuts that are oval or flattened and have a size of up to {{convert|abbr=on|2.5|cm}}. The fruit stalk is up to {{convert|abbr=on|1.5|cm}} long. Flowering occurs most of the year, but usually from March to April. The fruit ripens from February to November, usually May to July.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Phengklai, Chamlong |title=A synoptic account of the Fagaceae of Thailand |journal=Thai Forest Bulletin |year=2006| volume =34|pages= 53-175}}</ref>
