==Distribution and habitat==
''Castanopsis argentea'' grows in lowland forests and lower montane forests on Java and Sumatra, from 150 to 1,400 meters elevation. It is mostly found in undisturbed forests of [[West Java]] around [[Mount Gede]] and [[Mount Halimun]], with a density of ca. 12 trees/[[hectare]]. It also occurs in national parks, nature reserves and in high elevation forests in other areas of Java. It is almost extinct from lowland areas in [[Sumatra]], due to the clearance of the land for [[palm oil]] plantations.<ref name=iucn/>
