'''Fusion Specialties''' is an American company and manufacturer of [[mannequins]].

Founded in [[Huntington Beach, California]] in 1986 by Jim Talaric and Jim Barber,<ref name=dbj20060209/> the company pioneered new methods of manufacture using [[polymer]]s (a urethane [[elastomer]]) rather than fiberglass, as well as the 2010s trend to begin having lines of fuller-figured and more natural body sizes.  Talaric is considered a "trendsetter in manufacturing and durability" of mannequins,<ref name=colosun20191230/> who followed in the footsteps of [[Adel Rootstein]], an earlier pioneer in mannequin manufacturing.  Judy Townsend, a collector and broker of antique mannequins, has called Talaric "the Henry Ford" of mannequin manufacturing; while "Rootstein is the Rolls Royce".<ref name=colosun20191230/>

The company won their first big retail client, [[The Limited]], in 1990.<ref name=dbj20060209/>
The company moved from California to [[Colorado]] in 1991, at a time that it employed 35 people.<ref name=colosun20191230>{{cite news |url=https://coloradosun.com/2019/12/30/mannequin-sculptors-fusion-specialties-colorado/ |title= Sculptors at a Lafayette mannequin factory are shaping more realistic body types for stores worldwide |work=Colorado Sun |author=Carol McKinley |date=December 30, 2019 |access-date=December 30, 2019 |quote=''Talaric started a mannequin revolution. He figured out a way to make them cheaper, faster and better by replacing the old models, which were made with fragile fiberglass, with a stronger plastic material called urethane elastomer, a polymer that could be injected into a mold in seconds and spun by a giant machine at room temperature. The old fiberglass method required hand-application and had to be heated and chilled throughout the process. '' }}</ref>  
By 2006, the company was producing more than 50,000 mannequins per year, with 110 employees, and their clients included [[Victoria's Secret]], [[Banana Republic]], [[REI]], [[Chico's (clothing retailer)|Chico's]], [[The Gap, Inc.|The Gap]], and [[Old Navy]].  Retail industry DDI Magazine said that, "If they're not the largest [in the industry], they're certainly one of the largest."<ref name=dbj20060209>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2006/02/13/story3.html |title=Making a mark with mannequins |work=Denver Business Journal |author=Bob Mook |date=February 9, 2006 |access-date=December 30, 2019 }}</ref>

In 2007, the company was acquired by [[private equity]] firm Blue Sage Capital of Austin, Texas.<ref name=colosun20191230/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.statesman.com/article/20121214/BUSINESS/312149676 |title=Austin private equity firm Blue Sage raises new $150&nbsp;million fund |work=Austin Statesman |author=Lori Hawkins |date=December 14, 2012 |access-date=December 30, 2019 }}</ref>

{{asof|2019}}, the company makes a variety of custom-designed mannequins to fit the particular [[clothing industry|clothing]] [[product line]]s of designers and stores, a practice that has substantially reduced costs for large [[department store]]s, as well as played a role in the [[Creative destruction|industry changes]] that no longer require the specialty [[mannequin dresser]] job.  It employs several [[fine art|fine-art trained]] artists as sculptors to make the many custom models they produce for various clothing product retailers.  The company is currently owned by "Noa Brands Global, a holding company headquartered in [[Barcelona]], Spain." The company manufactures in China, Mexico and [[Lafayette, Colorado]].<ref name=colosun20191230/>
