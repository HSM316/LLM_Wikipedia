{{short description|Bulgarian historian}}
'''Hristo Gandev''' (Христо Гандев; December 25, 1907, [[Veliko Tarnovo]] - July 27, 1987, [[Sofia]]) was a Bulgarian professor and historian.

Gandev was a lecturer at [[Sofia University]]. From 1946 to 1961 he was head of the Department of New General History. Between 1948 and 1951 he was Dean of the Faculty of History and Philology. In 1958 he was appointed director of the Ethnographic Institute with a Museum at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.<ref>[http://calendar.dir.bg/inner.php?d=27&month=7&year=2017&cid=21&sid=67&eid=37959 30 години от смъртта на проф.

He is well known in [[Bulgarian historiography]] for removing the lower boundary of the [[Bulgarian Renaissance]] from [[1762]] or from the writing of [[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya]] - until the beginning of the 18th century with the end of the [[Köprülü era]]. This thesis is generally accepted in [[Bulgarian historiography]] and is known as the [[Bulgarian National Awakening]]. In this way Gandev, who was also historian of the [[Ottoman Empire]], introduced a new [[conceptualism]] in [[Bulgarian history]], namely continuity and communion with the [[history of the Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, including earlier ones during the [[Komnenos]] era.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/3682146/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%84._%D0%B4-%D1%80_%D0%A5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE_%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2_-_%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D1%8A%D1%82_%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE Проф. д-р Христо Гандев - житейски път и научно наследство]</ref>
