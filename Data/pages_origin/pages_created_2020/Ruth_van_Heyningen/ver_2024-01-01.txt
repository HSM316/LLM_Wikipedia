== Biography ==
Ruth Eleanor Treverton was born in 1917 in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], Wales.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/van-heyningen-ruth-1917|title=Van Heyningen, Ruth (1917–) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Her parents were Alan Treverton-Jones, a ship-owner, and Mildred (nee Garrod Thomas). Her father died when she was aged six. She attended [[Cheltenham Ladies' College|Cheltenham Ladies’ College]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1940, she graduated with a degree in biochemistry from [[Newnham College, Cambridge]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/article/in-memoriam-ruth-van-heyningen|title=In Memoriam: Ruth van Heyningen {{!}} St Cross College|website=www.stx.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> She married William "Kits" van Heyningen (who was doing a PhD in the same department) that year.<ref name=":0" /> They had two children, Simon and Joanna.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Van Heyningen began doctoral studies under the mentorship of biochemists [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robin Hill]] and [[Malcolm Dixon (biochemist)|Malcolm Dixon]].<ref name=":0" /> However, due to the classified nature of her work (it was on the effect of poison gases on metabolically important enzymes, and this was during [[World War II]]), she was unable to publish her research and complete her degree.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Spector|first=Abraham|date=1976|title=On presentation of the Proctor Medal of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology to Ruth van Heyningen|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology|volume=15|issue=9|pages=683–684|pmid=786014}}</ref> She and her family moved to London, where she took a job at the [[Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine|Lister Institute]], researching blood group antigens.<ref name=":0" />

In 1947, the family moved to Oxford.<ref name=":0" /> Shortly thereafter, van Heyningen began working on a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in the anatomy department, under the supervision of [[Joseph Weiner]]. Her doctoral thesis, completed in 1951, was on the composition of sweat.<ref name=":0" />

In 1951, she joined the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology at the [[University of Oxford]], and conducted research in collaboration with laboratory director [[Antoinette Pirie]].<ref name=":0" /> She earned a master's degree in 1952.<ref name=":2" /> She then served as a research assistant (1952-1969) and as a senior research officer (1969-1977).<ref name=":3" /> In the laboratory, her research focused on the biochemistry of the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]], in particular the biochemical pathways involved in the formation of cataracts.<ref name=":0" /> Pirie and van Heyningen co-authored ''Biochemistry of the Eye'', published in 1956.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3w8ygAACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Antoinette+Pirie%22|title=Biochemistry of the eye|last1=Pirie|first1=Antoinette|last2=van Heyningen|first2=Ruth|date=1956|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}</ref>

Van Heyningen is credited with discovering novel pathways (such as the [[Polyol pathway|sorbitol pathway]]) involved in cataract formation, as well as pioneering novel techniques to identify relevant compounds and their interactions.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> For example, by examining the lenses of diabetic and non-diabetic patients (collected post-surgery or post-portem), she demonstrated that monosaccharide sugars accumulate in the lenses of diabetic patients, generating [[sugar alcohol]]s that are harmful to the lens.<ref name=":0" /> She also conducted research on the role of [[tryptophan]] metabolism in the development of cataracts.<ref name=":1" /> In 1973, van Heyningen was awarded a [[Doctor of Science|DSc]] from Oxford.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> In 1976, the [[Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology]] presented her with its Proctor Medal, citing her "important contributions to our understanding of the lens and cataract".<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Van Heyningen was a founding fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford|St. Cross College]] at the University of Oxford.<ref name=":1" /> She remained active in her field of research even after her official retirement in the late 1960s, publishing 20 further articles until 1998. She died in 2019, two days before her 102nd birthday.<ref name=":0" />
