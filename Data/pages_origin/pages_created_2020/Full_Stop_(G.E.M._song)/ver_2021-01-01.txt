==Background and composition==
G.E.M. reviewed the 12-year career with the song "Full Stop". She once learned a blank piece of paper. Some things that can't be conceded and tolerant to others are cruel to herself. She also hopes to use songs to encourage all those who stand at the crossroads of life and are confused about the future. Those who are in the middle of the authorities are confused and look up at the vast sky. No matter how hard the front is, it is right to face the challenge. It is not so difficult to draw a "full stop". The representative animal of this song is hummingbird.
