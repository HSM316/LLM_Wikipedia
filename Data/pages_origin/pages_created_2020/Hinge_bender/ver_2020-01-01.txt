A '''hinge bender''', also called '''hinge tweaker''', '''hinge adjuster''' or '''knuckle bender''', is a [[hand tool]] for adjusting [[Hinge|hinges]], for instance on doors and windows in building or on cars. A hinge bender can be used to straighten a door that is tilted sideways relative to the door frame, which tends to happen gradually with most doors over a long time period. According to the Norwegian Standard NS 3424, it is expected that a house door needs adjustment every is every 2 to 8 years. Tilted doors can be especially noticeable during the winter time, since doors then tend to expand due to changes in humidity of the air.

The hinge bender is used by placing it onto the hinge and twisting the tool in the direction that one wishes to adjust the door panel. It is important to turn the bender in the right direction. The tool is placed onto the hinge from the top while the door is closed. By rotating the hinge bender towards the door, the opening between the hinge stile and casing is decreased. If the tool instead is rotated away from the door, the opening between the hinge stile and casing will be increased.

Pulling with too much force can break the hinge or strip the screw heads of the hinge. Hinge benders can either have adjustable or fixed openings in order to fit different types of hinges. Some common diameters for fixed-opening hinge benders are 14&nbsp;mm and 17&nbsp;mm (0.55 or 0.67 inches)
