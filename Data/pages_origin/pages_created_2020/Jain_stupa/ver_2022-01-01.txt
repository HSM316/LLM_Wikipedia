The '''Jain stupa''' was a type of [[stupa]] erected by the [[Jains]] for devotional purposes. A Jain stupa dated to the 1st century BCE-1st century CE was excavated at [[Mathura]] in the 19th century, in the [[Kankali Tila]] mound.<ref name="TJS">{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924012251140#page/n0/mode/2up |title=The Jain stûpa and other antiquities of Mathurâ|last =Smith| first=Vincent Arthur |year=1901 |publisher= KFrank Luker, Superintendent, Government Press, North-Western Provinces and Oudh |location=Allahabad}}</ref>

Jain legends state that the earliest Jain stupa was built in the 8th century BCE, before the time of the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]] [[Parsvanatha]].<ref>"According to one legend, the earliest Jain stupa (a funerary or reliquary mound, usually grandly ornamented and enclosed by a railing with an elaborate gateway) was built before the time of the Jina Parsvanatha in the eighth century B.C." in {{cite book |title=Arts of Asia |date=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4brAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}</ref>

There is a possibly that the Jains adopted stupa worships from the Buddhists, but that is an unsettled point.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sethia |first1=Tara |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jaininsm |date=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4 |page=200 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC&pg=PA200 |language=en}}</ref> However the Jain stupa has a peculiar cylindrical three-tier structure, which is quite reminiscent of the [[Samavasarana]], by which it was apparently ultimately replaced as an object of worship.<ref name="UPS16"/> The name for stupa as used in Jain inscriptions is the standard word ''"thupe"''.<ref name="UPS16"/>

==Mathura Jain stupas==
A Jain stupa dated to the 1st century BCE-1st century CE was excavated at [[Mathura]] in the 19th century, in the [[Kankali Tila]] mound.<ref name="TJS">{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924012251140#page/n0/mode/2up |title=The Jain stûpa and other antiquities of Mathurâ|last =Smith| first=Vincent Arthur |year=1901 |publisher= KFrank Luker, Superintendent, Government Press, North-Western Provinces and Oudh |location=Allahabad}}</ref> Numerous associated religious works of art were also discovered during the excavations.<ref name="TJS"/> Many of these are votive tablets, called ''[[ayagapata]]s''.<ref name="Smith">The Jain stûpa and other antiquities of Mathurâ by Smith, Vincent Arthur [https://archive.org/details/cu31924012251140 Plate XIV]</ref> They are numerous, and some of the earliest ones have been dated to circa 50-20 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quintanilla |first1=Sonya Rhie |title=History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE |date=2007 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004155374 |page=403, Fig. 146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&pg=PA403 |language=en}}</ref>

==Ayagapatas==
{{see also|Art of Mathura}}
The Jain devotional reliefs called [[Ayagapata]]s, particularly that dedicated by Vasu, shows a probable design of the Jain stupa.<ref name="UPS16"/> The stupa drum is set on a high platform, and accessed by a flight of stairs and an ornate [[torana]] gate, quite similar in style to the toranas of [[Sanchi]].<ref name="UPS16"/> Niches with images can be seen in front of the platform.<ref name="UPS16"/> The drum of the stupa is elongated and cylindrical, and formed of three superposed tiers separated by railings and decorated bands.<ref name="UPS16"/> The stupa starts to round off only above these three tiers.<ref name="UPS16"/> The platform may have been squared, with [[Persepolis|Persepolitan]]-type columns in each corner, similar to those seen in the Vasu Ayagapata.<ref name="UPS16"/> On the Vasu ayagapata, one of the Persepolitan pillars is surmounted by a [[Dharmachakra]] wheel, and the other pillar was probably surmounted by an animal, as seen in other similar ayagapatas.<ref name="UPS16"/>

The Sivayasa ayagapata shows clearly two [[triratna]] symbols on top of the torana, as well as a central [[flame palmette]] design.<ref name="UPS16"/>
