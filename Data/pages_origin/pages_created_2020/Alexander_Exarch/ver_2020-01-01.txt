'''Alexander Exarch''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Екзарх}}, 1810 – 27 September 1891) was a Bulgarian revivalist, publicist and journalist, active participant in the struggle for an independent [[Bulgarian Exarchate]].

It comes from a wealthy family. He studied in [[Bucharest]], [[Budapest]], [[Munich]]. From 1836 he was in [[Paris]], where he first studied mathematics, and later, with Ottoman state scholarship - medicine (1839 - 1841).

In 1841, he accompanied as a translator [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]], sent by the French government to investigate the consequences of the [[Niš rebellion (1841)]]. Blanqui reflects it in his diary as Bulgarian, pointing to [[Niš]] as the capital of Bulgaria. He strongly opposes the insinuation of [[Ioannis Kolettis]] (at that time the Greek ambassador to Paris) that the uprising was Greek. In 1842 - 1846, he sent several memoirs (memos) to the Western European governments to improve the situation of the Bulgarians. <ref>[https://kultura.bg/web/%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8A%D1%80-%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%85-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D1%83-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B8/ АЛЕКСАНДЪР ЕКЗАРХ МЕЖДУ СВЕТЛИНАТА И СЯНКАТА]</ref>

With financial assistance from Russia, he published in [[Constantinople]] the Bulgarian „Constantinople newspaper” (1848 - 1862), whose editor-in-chief was between 1850 and 1860.

After the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] he was twice a candidate for [[Head of State]] ([[Prince]]) of Bulgaria (1879, 1886). <ref>[https://www.bulgarkamagazine.com/%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8A%D1%80-%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%85-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BA%D0%BD%D1%8F/ Александър Екзарх можеше да стане княз на българите]</ref>
