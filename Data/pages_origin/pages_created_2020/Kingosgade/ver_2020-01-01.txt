==History==
[[File:Et Partie fra Have Selskabets Have d. 17. Septb. 1842.png|thumb|[[Ole Jørgen Rawert]]:'' The [[Royal Danish Horticultural Society's Garden|Royal Horticultural Society's Garden]] on 17 September 1842'' ]]
A roadside inn named Gule Hest (Yellow Horse) was in the 18th century located at the site. It was one of four inns known as "Horses" located along the western access road to Copenhagen. The Yellow Horse had four [[pavilion]]s and two [[bowling|bowling courses]].

[[File:Vesterbrogade 108, Håbet.png|thumb|left|Haabet seen from the garden, 1864]]
Gule Hest was in 1778 purchased by [[Peter Borre]], renamed Haabet (The Hope) and used as a tobacco factory. Part of the area between the Vestre Landevej and [[Frederiksberg Allé]] was laid out as tobacco fields and a horse-driven mill was constructed for the processing of tobacco into [[snus]]. Other exotic produce cultivated on the estate included [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]] and [[grape]]s.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.berlingske.dk/kultur/den-sorte-hest-paa-vesterbro|title=Den Sorte Hest på Vesterbro|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

The [[Royal Danish Horticultural Society's Garden|Royal Danish Horticultural Society]]'s first garden was in 1837 laid out on a piece of land to the north of Haabet.

Haabet (Vesterbrogade 108) was in the late 1840s purchased by textile manufacturer [[Ole Ferdinand Olsen]]. He sold off the land in lots. The three-winged main building was demolished in circa 1883.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kbhbilleder.dk/kbh-museum/85901|title=Vesterbrogade 108, Håbet|language=Danish|publisher=kbhbilleder.dk|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref>

The new streets in the area were given the names Kingosgade, Boyesgade and Brorsonsgade after the priest-and-hymn writers [[Thomas Kingo]], Casper Johannes Boye (1791-1853) and [[Hans Adolph Brorson]].<ref name="hovedstadshistorie">{{cite web|url=https://www.hovedstadshistorie.dk/frederiksberg-2/kingosgade/|title=Kingosgade|language=Danish|publisher=hovedstadshistorie.dk|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> The Royal Horticultural Society's Garden had relocated to its current location at [[Frederiksberg Runddel]] in 1883 and another new a fourth new street at the site was renamed Haveselskabetvej to commemorate its old location.

C. F. Riedel & Lindegaard, an iron foundry and machine factory, was from 1867 located on the east side of the street.

==Buildings==
The building at Kingosgade 2/Vesterbrogade 106B, is from 1884-86 and was designed by [[Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen]].

The building at the eastern corner with Frederiksberg Allé (Frederiksberg Allé 23) is colloquially known as ''Little Rosenborg'' due to its [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style with two small towers and rich decorations, although its resemblance to [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s [[Rosenborg Castle]] can hardly be described as striking. It was designed by [[Johan Daniel Herholdt]]´in collaboration with Christian V. Nielsen and completed in 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=173|title=Frederiksberg, Frederiksberg Allé 23, Lille Rosenborg
