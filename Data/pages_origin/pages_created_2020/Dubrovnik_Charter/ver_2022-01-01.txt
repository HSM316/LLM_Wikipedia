'''The Dubrovnik Charter''' is a document from 1230, by which the [[Tsar]] [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] gives the Dubrovnik merchants the right to trade freely in his country.

The charter contains information about the territorial expansion of the [[Second Bulgarian State]] after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]], as well as valuable data on the status of the [[Middle Bulgarian language]] in the 13th century. It is stored in the handwriting department of the Library of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. <ref>[https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/dubrovnik-charter-of-tsar-ivan-ii-asen/viewer Dubrovnik Charter]</ref>
