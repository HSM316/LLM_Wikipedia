The '''1874-75 Scottish Districts season''' is a record of all the  [[rugby union]] matches for Scotland's district teams.

It includes the Inter-City fixtures between [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District]] and [[Edinburgh District (rugby union)|Edinburgh District]].

==History==

The matches here remain 20 - a - side. These matches, with more players on the park, made it harder to score.

In addition, scoring a try did not count for points. The try gave you an attempt to get a score by means of the conversion; if the conversion was missed then it did not benefit the try scoring team. It was only goals that mattered.

Both inter-city matches this season show just how difficult it was to score when the teams were 20-a-side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W5JQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PDQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1813,5786422|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CVNEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wbEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5464,2796189|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>

The February 1875 match was the fourth draw in succession, although the ''North British Mail'' noted that [[Glasgow District (rugby union)|Glasgow District]] had the best of the Inter-City match.<ref>https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002683/18750222/055/0004</ref> It was noted that the 1875 match was played in two halves lasting 50 minutes each.<ref>https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000452/18750222/040/0003</ref>
