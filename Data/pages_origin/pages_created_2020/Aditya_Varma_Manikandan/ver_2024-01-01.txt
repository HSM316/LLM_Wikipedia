== The Battle of Changanassery ==

It was a time when an alliance between Aditya Varma and his younger brother Goda Varma broke out. The king was willing to the alliance with Kochi, however, the crown prince was sympathetic to Travancore and Marthanda Varma. Goda Varman (crown prince of Thekkumkur) and [[Marthanda Varma]] of Travancore were classmates at Madurai when they were studying of Rajyadharma. After hearing of the military advance of the [[Travancore]] under the leadership of [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] and [[Eustachius De Lannoy|Caption De Lannoy]]; the crown prince of Thekkumkur (Goda Varman) then advised king ''Aditya Varma Manikandan'' to make a friendship with Travancore kingdom by understanding the downfall of princely state [[Purakkad|Ampalapuzha]] (Chempakassery) and the fall of princely state [[Odanad|Kayamkulam]].<ref>https://www.namboothiri.com/ articles/naaduvaazhikal.htm</ref> Meanwhile, when Marthanda Varma seized [[Odanad|Kayamkulam]] and [[Purakkad|Chempakassery]], Aditya Varma realized that they were the next victims and sent his brother to [[Thiruvananthapuram]] for an unconditional peace mission and met [[Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] of Travancore and requested help. Unfortunately, Marthanda Varma asked Goda Varman, to promise that he would be in power if he helped to oust king Adithya Varman. Marthanda Varma had already heard the rift between the brothers. The younger king was well-received in the southern part of Thekkumkur kingdom. The self-righteous crown prince decided to return to Thekkumkur soon after the disagreement. The evil intelligence of Marthanda Varma and [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] aroused together. He sent a messenger to the younger king and told him the fake news, saying, "Departure to Kottayam immediately; the mother's health is bad".<ref>Book Title: Mahakshetrangalude Munnil;
