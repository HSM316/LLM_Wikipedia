==Reception==
Andy Butcher reviewed ''The Shapeshifters Manual'' for ''Arcane'' magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall.<ref name="Arcane8">{{cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Andy|date=July 1996|title=Games Reviews|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=8|pages=76}}</ref> Butcher comments that "''The Shapeshifter's Manual'' is both attractively designed and packed with information. It has to be said that using this book will add a fair amount of complexity to the game, both in terms of new rules, and new jargon for players and referees to learn. Despite this, it's something of a must for any ''Immortal'' group, new or old."<ref name="Arcane8"/>
