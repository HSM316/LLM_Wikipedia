==Reception==
In the July 1996 edition of ''[[Arcane (magazine)|Arcane]]'' (Issue 8), Andy Butcher didn't like all the new rules presented in this book but thought that ''Immortal'' players needed the book, commenting that "''The Shapeshifter's Manual'' is both attractively designed and packed with information. It has to be said that using this book will add a fair amount of complexity to the game, both in terms of new rules, and new jargon for players and referees to learn. Despite this, it's something of a must for any ''Immortal'' group, new or old." Butcher gave the book an above average rating of 8 out of 10.<ref name="Arcane8">{{cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Andy|date=July 1996|title=Games Reviews|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=8|pages=76}}</ref>

In the September 1996 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue 233), [[Rick Swan]] was unimpressed with the book, calling it "not so good." Swan thought the animal powers presented "are okay", but found the rest of the book to be "an excess of filler (like the l-o-n-g introduction)." Swan gave the book a below average rating of 3 out of 6, calling it "non-essential."<ref name=dragon233>{{cite journal|last=Swan|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Swan| date=September 1996|title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=233|pages=110â€“112}}</ref>
