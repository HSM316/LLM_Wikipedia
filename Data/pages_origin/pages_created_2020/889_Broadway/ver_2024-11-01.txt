'''889 Broadway''', also known as the '''Gorham Manufacturing Company Building''', is a [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]] building located at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[19th Street (Manhattan)|East 19th Street]] in the [[Flatiron District]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], within the [[Ladies' Mile Historic District]]. Built in 1883&ndash;1884, it was designed by [[Edward Hale Kendall]].

889 Broadway served as a retail store for the [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]], a major manufacturer of sterling and silverplate, until 1905. The stories above the second floor were originally rented as bachelor apartments until Gorham expanded into the rest of the building. The building was subsequently converted into lofts and offices in 1913. In 1977, the original layout was restored, and in 1984, the building was designated an official city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].

While Broadway below [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], at [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], was known as an upscale residential district, the section to the north did not see similar development, and the most opulent residence on this stretch would be Peter Goelet's residence on 19th Street, which stood until 1897.<ref name="NYCL p. 2" /><ref name=":1" /> However, starting in the 1870s, the section of Broadway from Union Square to [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] was turned into what later became dubbed as the "[[Ladies' Mile Historic District|Ladies Mile]]", occupied by stores such as [[Tiffany & Co.]] (at [[15 Union Square West]]), [[Lord & Taylor]] (at [[901 Broadway]]), and [[Arnold Constable & Company]] (at 881-887 Broadway).<ref name="NYCL p. 2" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Manhattan moves uptown : an illustrated history|last=Lockwood|first=Charles|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1976|isbn=978-0-395-24674-0|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/manhattanmovesup0000lock/page/178 178]|oclc=2331510|url=https://archive.org/details/manhattanmovesup0000lock/page/178}}</ref> Any residential usages were quickly supplanted by commercial ventures, which at the time were quickly expanding along this section of Broadway.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 99" />

Upon acquiring their uncles' land, Robert and Ogden Goelet wished to build a new structure, hiring [[Edward Hale Kendall]] to design a new building on the northwest corner of 20th Street and Broadway.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 98" /> The Goelet brothers originally intended their new development as a mixed-use building, with the first and second floors used for retail and the rest intended for residential use.<ref name="NYCL p. 4"/> Kendall, who had used different architectural styles for his previous buildings, might have picked the Queen Anne style as being more suitable for a structure that contained apartments over retail space.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 99">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1989|ps=.|p=99}}</ref> Construction started in June 1883 and the building was completed a year later.<ref name="NYCL p. 4"/>

The building was converted by [[John H. Duncan]] in 1912 into [[loft]]s and offices, removing a corner tower and adding roof [[dormers]].

=== Facade ===
Located on a trapezoidal lot, 889 Broadway contains a [[facade]] of brick with sandstone trim.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> The building measures {{Convert|55|ft||abbr=}} wide on Broadway, with three vertical [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] along that facade,<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 99" /> and {{Convert|109|ft||abbr=}} along 19th Street, with seven bays.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 100">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1989|ps=.|p=100}}</ref> The northern facade is {{Convert|92|ft||abbr=}} wide and the western facade is {{Convert|53|ft||abbr=}} wide; neither facade contains ornamentation.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 101">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1989|ps=.|p=101}}</ref> The bays are generally divided by vertical [[Pier (architecture)|pier]]s made of brick.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> At the corner of Broadway and 19th Street, there was originally a tower topped by a [[cupola]]. This was later replaced by a [[chamfer]]ed corner containing window openings.<ref name="NYCL p. 5" />

The lowest two stories comprise the base of the building and were originally designed for commercial tenancy. Originally, the vertical bays within the base were separated by carved piers in [[relief]].<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> Along Broadway, the original three-bay facade on the first floor was replaced in 1912 with the current five-bay-wide storefront, made of limestone. On the second story, the windows are made of arched frames inside rectangular openings, except for the center bay on Broadway, where there are three [[sash window]]s. A gabled canopy was also located above the entrance to the Gorham store, above the center bay on Broadway. Between the second and third floors is a pair of stone [[Belt course|string courses]].<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 99" /><ref name="NYCL p. 5" />

Above the lower two stories, the window bays on the Broadway facade contain similarly-designed sash windows, except that the center bay is narrower. . A string course runs between the fifth and sixth floors, wrapping around to the 19th Street facade.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 100" /><ref name="NYCL p. 6">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1984|ps=.|p=6}}</ref> On the 19th Street facade, all of the window bays contain one sash window per floor on the third through seventh floors. The columns of windows are grouped into two patterns. Going from Broadway, the first, fourth, and seventh columns of windows are identical to each other and contain black iron window frames. The second/third and fifth/sixth columns of windows are paired, with brick-and-stone bands separating each window both horizontally and vertically. Notable features of both facades include [[segmental arch]]es above the fifth floor of several bays, as well as carved scroll motifs and slightly projecting piers.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 100" /><ref name="NYCL p. 6" />

889 Broadway is topped by a steep [[slate roof]].<ref name="NYCL p. 5" /> Dormer windows were installed on the roof, at the eighth story, in 1912. A penthouse was built on the northern half of the roof in 1977. The dormers are located above all three window bays along Broadway, and above the first, fourth, and seventh window bays along 19th Street.<ref name="NYCL (1989) p. 100" />
