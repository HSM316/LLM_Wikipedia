This is a list of '''earthquakes in 2020'''. Only [[earthquake]]s of magnitude 6 or above are included, unless they result in damage and/or casualties, or are notable for other reasons. All dates are listed according to [[UTC]] time. Maximum intensities are indicated on the [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale]] and are sourced from [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[Strong ground motion|ShakeMap]] data.

An increase in detected earthquake numbers does not necessarily represent an increase in earthquakes ''per se''. Population increase, habitation spread, and advances in earthquake detection technology all contribute to higher earthquake numbers being recorded over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/faq/taxonomy/term/9830|title=USGS Earthquake Myths|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319120417/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/taxonomy/term/9830|archivedate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>
