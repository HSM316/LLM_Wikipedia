'''Jumbo Mountain''', sometimes called '''Mount Jumbo''', is a 3,437 meter (11,276 ft) elevation mountain summit located {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[Invermere]] in the [[Purcell Mountains]] of southeast [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].<ref name=bcgnis>{{cite bcgnis|id=12100|name=Jumbo Mountain|access-date=2021-05-15}}</ref><ref name="pb"/> The nearest higher peak is [[Mount Farnham]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north-northeast, and [[Karnak Mountain]] is set {{convert|0.79|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west.<ref name="pb">{{cite peakbagger|id=3084|name=Mount Jumbo, British Columbia|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Jumbo and Karnak form a [[double summit]] [[massif]] which is the second-highest mountain in the Purcells, and fourth-highest in the [[Columbia Mountains]].<ref name="pb"/> The [[first ascent]] of Jumbo Mountain was made August 4, 1915, by H.O. Frind, A.H. & E.L. MacCarthy, M & W.E. Stone, B. Shultz, and [[Conrad Kain]] via the North/Northeast Slopes.<ref name=bivouac/> The peak was named by Edward Warren Harnden after the 1892 Jumbo Mineral Claim on nearby Toby Creek, which in turn was named for [[Jumbo]] the elephant.<ref name=bivouac/> The mountain's name was officially adopted March 31, 1924, when approved by the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]].
