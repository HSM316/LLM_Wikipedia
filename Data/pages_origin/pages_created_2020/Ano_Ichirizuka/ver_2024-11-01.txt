The {{nihongo|'''Ano Ichirizuka '''|阿野一里塚|}}  is a pair of Japanese distance markers akin to a [[milestone]], consisting of two earthen mounds flanking the route of the old [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō highway]] located in what is now part of the city of [[Toyoake, Aichi|Toyoake]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] in the [[Tōkai region]] of [[Japan]]. It was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/138717 |title=阿野一里塚 |trans-title=Ano Ichirizuka|language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Overview==
During the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]] established ''ichirizuka'' on [[Kaidō|major roads]], enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by ''[[kago]]'' or [[palanquin]].<ref name="Nishigahara">{{cite web |url=http://www.taims.metro.tokyo.jp/kyoiku/bunkazai.nsf/8045b76903affdfa492576aa0022941b/39a80a32844bf3de492579cf000eb37d?OpenDocument |title=Tokyo Cultural Properties Database: Nishigahara Ichirizuka |publisher=[[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These mounds, denoted the distance in ''[[Japanese unit#Length|ri]]'' {{convert|3.927|km|mi}} to [[Nihonbashi]], the "Bridge of Japan", erected in [[Edo]] in 1603.<ref name="Nenzi">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTs3bzz4sHwC&pg=PA22 |title=Excursions in Identity: Travel and the Intersection of Place, Gender, and Status in Edo Japan |author=Nenzi, Laura |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-824-83117-2 |pages=21–22}}</ref> They were typically planted with an [[Celtis sinensis|''enoki'']] or [[Japanese red pine]] to provide shelter for travelers. Since the [[Meiji period]], most of the ''ichirizuka'' have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the "Ichirizuka Abolition decree" was issued by the [[Meiji government]] and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ''ichirizuka'' are designated as national historic sites.

In the case of the Ano ''ichirizuka'', the mounds flank the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]], the main highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]] and are located between [[Chiryū-juku]] in [[Mikawa Province]] and [[Narumi-juku]] in [[Owari Province]]. This ''ichirizuka'' was the 86th marker from [[Nihonbashi]], and is a rare case on the Tōkaidō where both of the mounds have survived. These markers were constructed in 1604.The site is about a 15-minute walk from [[Zengo Station]] on the [[Meitetsu Nagoya Main Line]].<ref name="Shiseki">{{cite book |last1=Isomura |first1=Yukio |last2=Sakai |first2=Hideya |title=(国指定史跡事典) National Historic Site Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=学生社 |isbn=978-4311750403}}{{in lang|ja}}</ref>
