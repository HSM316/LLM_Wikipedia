The {{nihongo|'''Ano Ichirizuka '''|阿野一里塚|}}  is a pair of Japanese distance markers akin to a [[milestone]], consisting of two earthen mounds flanking the route of the old [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō highway]] located in  in what is now part of the city of [[Toyoake, Aichi|Toyoake]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] in the [[Tōkai region]] of [[Japan]]. It was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/138717 |title=阿野一里塚 |trans-title=Ano Ichirizuka|language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Overview==
During the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]] established ''[[ichirizuka]]'' on [[Kaidō|major roads]], enabling calculation both of distance travelled and of the charge for transportation by ''[[kago]]'' or [[palanquin]].<ref name="Nishigahara">{{cite web |url=http://www.taims.metro.tokyo.jp/kyoiku/bunkazai.nsf/8045b76903affdfa492576aa0022941b/39a80a32844bf3de492579cf000eb37d?OpenDocument |title=Tokyo Cultural Properties Database: Nishigahara Ichirizuka |publisher=[[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] |accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref> These mounds, denoted the distance in ''[[Japanese unit#Length|ri]]'' ({{convert|3.927|km|mi}}) to [[Nihonbashi]], the "Bridge of Japan", erected in [[Edo]] in 1603.<ref name="Nenzi">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yTs3bzz4sHwC&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Excursions in Identity: Travel and the Intersection of Place, Gender, and Status in Edo Japan |author=Nenzi, Laura |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-824-83117-2 |pages=21–22}}</ref>

In the case of the Ano ''ichirizuka'', the mounds flank the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]], the main highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]] and are located between [[Chiryū-juku]] in [[Mikawa Province]] and [[Narumi-juku]] in [[Owari Province]]. This ''ichirizuka'' was the 86th marker from [[Nihonbashi]], and is a rare case on the Tōkaidō where both of the mounds have survived.
