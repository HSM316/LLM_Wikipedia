Its original lcoation and commissioner are unknown, though it may have be the earliest surviving example of an Italian rectangular altarpiece. Sometime between 1450 and 1500 the [[seraphim]] in wreathes between the arches were added - [[Roberto Longhi]] attributes them to [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. It is recorded in the Stuart royal collection and ended up in [[Parma]], where it and two other works were exchanged for [[Parmigianino]]'s ''[[Turkish Slave]]'' during the Fascist era<ref>{{it icon}} Gloria Fossi, ''Uffizi'', Giunti, Firenze 2004.
