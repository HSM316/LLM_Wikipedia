'''''Christ the Redeemer with Four Saints''''' (Italian - ''Redentore tra la Vergine e tre santi'') is a 1271 tempera and gold on panel painting, signed and dated by [[Meliore di Jacopo]]. From the left to right the saints are [[Saint Peter|Peter]], the Virgin Mary, [[John the Evangelist]] and [[Paul of Tarsus]]. It is now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in Florence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/catalogo/scheda.asp?nctn=00284546&value=1|title=Catalogue entry}}</ref>

Its original location and commissioner are unknown, though it may be the earliest surviving example of an Italian rectangular altarpiece. Sometime between 1450 and 1500 the [[seraphim]] in wreathes between the arches were added - [[Roberto Longhi]] attributes them to [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. It is recorded in the Stuart royal collection and ended up in [[Parma]], where it and two other works were exchanged for [[Parmigianino]]'s ''[[Turkish Slave]]'' during the Fascist era.<ref>{{in lang|it}} Gloria Fossi, ''Uffizi'', Giunti, Firenze 2004. {{ISBN|88-09-03675-1}}</ref>
