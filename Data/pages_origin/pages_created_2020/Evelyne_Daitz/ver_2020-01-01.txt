In 1988 Daitz hosted a show of 64 new prints of photographs by [[Walter Ballhause]], who documented life in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41384440/weimars_silent_witness/|title=Weimar's Silent Witness|last=Groenfeldt|first=Tom|date=1988-12-11|work=The Record|access-date=2019-12-31|url-status=live|pages=164|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Some of the gallery's shows under Daitz had unusual themes, such as "On the Elbow" (1993), fifty photographs of elbows, and "Sur la Tête" (1998), photographs of objects on human and animal heads, inspired by the work of [[Graciela Iturbide]]. "Sur la Tête" was described by the ''New York Times'' photography critic as "provocative, mysterious, whimsical, just plain beautiful, or a combination thereof." <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Photography Review|last=Loke|first=Margarett|date=August 21, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=E38|via=ProQuest}}</ref> The gallery's last show, "Clothes Off" (1999), focused on photography and the nude subject, including works by [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Judy Dater]], [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]], [[Edward Weston]], [[Mário Cravo Neto]], [[Arnold S.
