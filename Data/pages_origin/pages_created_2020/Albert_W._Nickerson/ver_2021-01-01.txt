==Homes==
===Dedham===
Nickerson lived in Jamaica Plain until 1878 when he purchased the home of a failed Dedham lawyer, Edward S. Rand, near Connecticut Corner in Dedham.<ref name=obit/><ref name="great house"/> He soon became civically involved,  running for selectman, and making charitable contributions to causes around town.<ref name=obit/><ref name="great house"/><ref name=vogler/>

Four years after moving to Dedham, he wanted to build a new house on the highest point of land along Common Street.<ref name=obit/> To do so would require moving the street, which the [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County Commission]] refused to do.<ref name=obit/><ref name="great house"/> Around the same time, the Dedham Board of Assessors dramatically increased his taxes to a level he felt was unfair.<ref name="great house"/><ref name=obit/> Partially as a result of these two setbacks, Nickerson sold the house to his brother George and he moved to an estate on [[Buzzards Bay]] in [[Marion, Massachusetts]].<ref name=obit/><ref name="soiree"/><ref name="great house"/>

===Marion===
In Marion, Nickerson bought a large estate known as "Great Hill,"  with 40 rooms and seven square miles of forests and winding driveways.<ref name="great house"/> He undertook an extensive remodeling of the waterfront home, adding conservatories and stables, and redecorated it with expensive furnishings.<ref name="great house"/> It was here that he would host president [[Grover Cleveland]] and convinced him to purchase the nearby [[Grey Gables]] estate.<ref name="great house"/>

===Riverdale===
Nickerson quarreled with Marion officials over his taxes as well and, three years before his death, moved back to Dedham.<ref name="great house"/> There, he purchased Riverdale, an {{convert|600|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} estate on the [[Charles River]] that was the childhood home of [[John Lothrop Motley]].<ref name=obit/><ref name="great house"/><ref name="guidebook"/> 

In 1886, he commission the architectural firm of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] to build him a castle on the estate and hired [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s firm to do the landscaping.<ref name="Uses"/><ref name="great house"/> It was constructed by [[Norcross Brothers]].<ref name="great house"/> Olmsted determined the exact spot upon a hill for the home, <ref name=lore/> laid out the roads on the property and changed  the direction of the road rather than cut down a favored tree.<ref name=lore/> [[Russell Sturgis]] called it "one of the best pieces existing of the peculiar Romanesque sculpture of semi-Byzantine character which Mr. Richardson’s work introduced to this community."<ref name=schaff/>

The castle has a number of interesting architectural elements but its best known is its numerous secret passages<ref name="castle"/> and "legendary underground mazes and hallways."<ref name="why"/><ref name=lore/> At Nickerson's request, Richardson also included a number of unusual features to add both protection and entertainment.<ref name=lore/> Below the study was a wading pool, rifle range, and a dungeon.<ref name=lore/> The escape routes and secret hiding places were presumably added because Nickerson was concerned that people "would try to murder him for his abundant wealth."<ref name=lore/>{{efn|There is rumored to be a secret tunnel that exits on the other side of the Charles River that has never been found.<ref name=lore/>}}

It was built on top of a rocky hill "so that the Castle and the River appeared magically to carriages or cars arriving through the forested Pine Street entrance."<ref name="nobles"/> The home cost $300,000 to build and $200,000 to furnish.<ref name=obit/> While the mansion was being built, Nicekrson lived in a home on the property that once belonged to [[Joseph Guild]].<ref name=fisher/>

==Philanthropy==
Nickerson was the wealthiest man in Dedham at the time of his death.<ref name=vogler/> <ref name="great house"/> He was a member of Dedham's St. Paul's Episcopal Church, but donated $10,000 towards the construction costs of [[St. Mary's Church (Dedham, Massachusetts)|St. Mary's Church]], a Catholic church in Dedham.<Ref name=farewell/><ref name=history/>{{sfn|Byrne|Leahy|Dowling|Young|Finen|1899|p=323}}<ref name=Leahy/><ref name=obit/> He had previously paid off the Catholic parish's $800 debt.<ref name=farewell/><ref name=canceled/>  This was welcome news, as the parish was bankrupt at the time.<ref name=vogler/> He also contributed $5,000 to the construction of the Dedham Public Library.<ref name=obit/><ref name=vogler/> 

==Death and legacy==
Nickerson died on May 17, 1893 of a burst appendix.<ref name="great house"/> His funeral at St. Paul's Church attracted a large number of mourners, and special trains were run from Boston to accommodate them all.<ref name="great house"/> At his death, Nickerson's fortune was estimated at $10,000,000.<ref name=obit/>{{efn|This is the equivalent of $304,564,605 in 2018 dollars.}} The [[Panic of 1893]] greatly reduced his fortune, and his family was forced to sell off his 60,000 shares in the Atchison railroad to hold onto their property.<ref name="great house"/> They also sold Great Hill.<ref name="great house"/> They attempted to hold onto Riverdale, but eventually Nickerson's widow sold the property and moved to Europe.<ref name="great house"/>
