==History==

===Early years===
After the arrival of the [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot]] in 1845, many were discharged and transferred to the Band of the Auckland Volunteer Rifles, formed in 1858.<ref name="govt5">{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/43233/band-of-the-royal-regiment-of-new-zealand-artillery|title=Band of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery &ndash; Brass and pipe bands &ndash; Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref><ref name="ibew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibew.org.uk/misc46.htm|title=IBEW - The Internet Bandsman's Everything Within|website=ibew.org.uk|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> The first documented public appearance of the band was chronicled in ''The New Zealander'' newspaper on 23 October 1860.

===Financial assistance===
In the 60s, the band formed an advocacy association to help with its financial backing.<ref name="govt8">{{cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30844012?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject%5D=Band+of+the+Royal+Regiment+of+New+Zealand+Artillery%2C+Northern+Military+District&search%5Bpath%5D=items|title=Untitled &#124; Items|website=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> The Auckland City Council has also giveb financial assistance to the band, giving it in April 1970 a grant of $5,000 to establish a permanent rehearsal hall in the city.<ref name="govt9">{{cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30750214?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject%5D=Band+of+the+Royal+Regiment+of+New+Zealand+Artillery%2C+Northern+Military+District&search%5Bpage%5D=2&search%5Bpath%5D=items|title=$5000 given by Council to Artillery Band &#124; Items|website=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> In the fall of 1974, the band spend up to $20,000 on instruments and uniforms.<ref name="govt10">{{cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30760594?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject%5D=Band+of+the+Royal+Regiment+of+New+Zealand+Artillery%2C+Northern+Military+District&search%5Bpage%5D=2&search%5Bpath%5D=items|title=Smart Artillery Band Gets Back in the... &#124; Items|website=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> The band has also received donations from other brass bands, including the Auckland City Silver and Boys' Band.<ref name="govt11">{{cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30770686?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject%5D=Band+of+the+Royal+Regiment+of+New+Zealand+Artillery%2C+Northern+Military+District&search%5Bpage%5D=2&search%5Bpath%5D=items|title='Tremendous offer' by one band to ano... &#124; Items|website=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref>

===Later years===
During the civic parade of the 4 Troop, [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] in May 1971 organised to welcome home the units during the [[Vietnam War]], protesters attempted to block the progress of the band through the city.<ref name="govt12">{{cite web|url=https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/protesters-interrupt-161-battery-parade|title=Protesters interrupt 161 Battery parade &#124; VietnamWar.govt.nz, New Zealand and the Vietnam War|website=vietnamwar.govt.nz|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> In October 1973, he band changed its name from the [[1st Brigade (New Zealand)|Northern Military District]] to its current name.<ref name="govt13">{{cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30720587?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject%5D=Band+of+the+Royal+Regiment+of+New+Zealand+Artillery%2C+Northern+Military+District&search%5Bpage%5D=2&search%5Bpath%5D=items|title=Band's new name &#124; Items|website=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> On 24 September 1995, Major F. F. Whiting opened the current rehearsal ball that the band uses to this day.

===2012 re-organization===
This was a result of a 2012 decision to stop public government funding from going to reserve bands, effectively dissolving bands such as the artillery band, which was then based in [[Maungarei]]. It formerly received around $112,000 a year for providing support to communities from [[Kaitaia]] to [[Palmerston North]]. Bob Davis, Secretary of the Auckland Artillery Band Association criticized the decision was "unnecessary, expensive and flawed".<ref name="stuff">{{cite web|url=http://i.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/east-bays-courier/7185568/Brass-bands-get-the-boot|title=Brass bands get the boot|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref><ref name="parliament">{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/resource/0000199347&ved=2ahUKEwjNxP-JnabnAhVJLKwKHYjpA64QFjAGegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw0nVavAMmEUEmZRbVEappt2|website=parliament.nz|title=Server Error|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref> In April 2013, bandmaster Dennis Schofield revealed a need for the band to expand, saying that an extra 10 members would be needed to join the then 26 members to meet its demands for  services that follow over the five years that follow.<ref name="stuff2">{{cite web|url=http://i.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/eastern-courier/8599248/Artillery-band-looks-for-fresh-talent|title=Artillery band looks for fresh talent|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2020-02-01}}</ref>
