The '''LIII Army Corps''' was a corps of the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German Army]] during [[World War II]]. It was first deployed in 1941 and was active as part of various armies under [[Army Group Centre]] until 1944, when it was destroyed during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] operations [[Operation Bagration|Bagration]] and [[Operation Kutuzov|Kutuzov]] in June and July 1944.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The corps suffered enormous casualties as a result of the Soviet attacks. All of its divisions were destroyed and all but a few of the soldiers were killed or captured by the Soviet Union.<ref name=":4" /> A new unit named LIII Army Corps was subsequently deployed in December 1944, when it was assigned to [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] and fought on the western front until surrendering to [[United States Army]] forces in April 1945.<ref name=":0" />

The ''Generalkommando'' of LIII Army Corps was first deployed on 15 February 1941, in ''[[Wehrkreis]] XVIII'' ([[Salzburg]]).

3rd Panzer Army fell into military disaster in the [[Vitebsk]] salient, where it was ordered to stand its ground against overwhelming Soviet forces instead of mounting a fighting retreat. This came as a result of a direct order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and could thus not be overruled by local military commanders. By 24 June, there was a gap between the German units that exposed the rear of LIII Army Corps. On the request from the local commanders to obtain consent from Hitler and the high command to retreat out of Vitebsk and with the urgent message from [[Ernst Busch (field marshal)|Ernst Busch]] that 24 June was the last day where this operation might be possible, [[Kurt Zeitzler]] personally flew to the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] in [[Berchtesgaden]], where he was instead instructed to confirm Hitler's original command that 3rd Panzer Army was to stand its ground to the last. Soviet troops captured the last remaining road connecting LIII Army Corps with the German lines on the same day. [[Friedrich Gollwitzer]], commander of LIII Army Corps, decided to disobey Hitler's orders and attempt to escape with his forces towards German positions. Several breakout attempts were undertaken on 25 June and 26 June, but the Soviets had already reinforced the ring. The final breakout attempt and the last signal from LIII Army Corps was received in the early morning hours of 27 June, when large parts of the corps attempted the westwards breach through Soviet-controlled areas that were now 80 kilometers deep. Of the 28,000 soldiers who attempted the breakout, some 10,000 were taken prisoner. Only a small number reached the German lines, whereas the rest perished during the attempt.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=The Eastern Front 1943–1944: The War in the East and on the Neighbouring Fronts|last=Frieser|first=Karl-Heinz|last2=Schmider|first2=Klaus|last3=Schönherr|first3=Klaus|last4=Schreiber|first4=Gerhard|last5=Ungváry|first5=Krisztián|last6=Wegner|first6=Bernd|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=2007|isbn=9780198723462|series=Germany and the Second World War|volume=8|location=Oxford|pages=536–537|translator-last=Smerin|translator-first=Barry|display-authors=1|author-link=Karl-Heinz Frieser}}</ref>
