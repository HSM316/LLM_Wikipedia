A '''prop gun''' is a [[gun]] or gun [[replica]] that is used primarily by [[movie]] and [[television]] productions or in [[theatre]] performances. As a [[theatrical property|prop]], these guns can be divided into non-firing guns (replicas) and firing guns (firearms). [[Firearm]]s are subject to restriction by law and safety regulations in use, due to their inherent danger.

==Replica guns==
Stage replicas can made from metal, resin, plastic, or rubber.<ref name=specialists>{{cite web |url=https://www.thespecialistsltd.com/prop-firearms-0 |author=NN| title=Prop Firearms |publisher=The Specialists LTD| date=2020| accessdate=October 25, 2021}}</ref> They cannot fire or hold any type of round and typically they produce no noise or smoke effects, these can be added during the [[post-production]] process. Some replica guns are equipped with an electronically triggered muzzle flash.

==Firearms as props==
Prop firearms are either real guns or specifically made to be [[blank ammunition|blank]] firing only.<ref name=brown>{{cite news |url=https://ascmag.com/blog/filmmakers-forum/filming-with-firearms |author=Dan Brown |title=Filming with Firearms| publisher=American Cinematographer |date=July 18, 2019 |accessdate=October 27, 2021}}</ref>

Blank ammunition has a cartridge that when fired produces realistic effects such as noise, smoke, a muzzle flash and recoil, they contain [[gunpowder]] but does not have a [[bullet]]. To achieve a desired visual effect, the amount of gunpowder used may vary, sometimes using more than a regular [[Ammunition|live round]].<ref name="brown" />

[[Dummy round|Dummy rounds]] are replicas that may be used if the chambered bullets in the cylinder of a revolver are visible to the camera. They can be constructed from pre-used live rounds or be moulded from resin.

==Gun safety==
In the interest of safety, the use of prop firearms is strictly regulated. Besides legal requirements, industry standards and guidelines have been set.<ref>[https://www.csatf.org/production-affairs-safety/safety-bulletins/ Safety Regulations by CSATF]</ref> The [[weapons master]] or armorer, a position that prior to the 1980s was handled by the [[prop master]], is responsible for making sure these regulations are followed. The armorer may undertake the training of the actors and is present at the set while they are used. They are in charge of the loading, handling, preparation and testing of the firearm to be used as a prop. 

Blanks expel gunpowder and hot gases out of the front of the barrel in a cone shape. This is harmless at longer ranges, but even without a projectile, the burning flame and debris from burned and unburned flakes of gunpowder create a very real hazard at close distances and can be lethal if the muzzle becomes blocked with debris.<ref name=brown/>

If the gun is aimed towards the camera during filming extra precautions are taken to protect the [[film crew]], such as [[perspex]] screening, eye protection or remote operation of the camera.

[[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) can produce effects that mimic the noise and smoke of a firing gun. This has increasingly replaced the use of prop guns with blanks as a safe alternative.
