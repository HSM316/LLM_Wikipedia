When the party executive committee was re-elected in June 2018, she decided not to run for office again, stating that she wanted to concentrate on her work as deputy parliamentary party leader in the Bundestag.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war's noch lange nicht! - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1306.das-war-s-noch-lange-nicht.html|access-date=2019-03-18|date=2018-04-20|language=de}}</ref>

Lay is considered a representative of the libertarian, undogmatic spectrum of her party. In autumn 2006 she initiated the foundation of the Emancipatory Left, together with [[Katja Kipping]].

== Political positions ==
Caren Lay is active in housing policy and has been the spokesperson for rent, construction and housing policy of the Die Linke parliamentary group in the Bundestag since 2016.

Caren Lay promotes a "red-red-green" government alliance at federal level. Together with members of the SPD, Alliance 90/The Greens, and the Left Party in the Bundestag, she organized several meetings of the "Trialogue for a progressive policy."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rot-Rot-Grün will raus aus den Hinterzimmern|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bundestagswahl-2017-rot-rot-gruen-will-raus-aus-den-hinterzimmern/14608106.html|access-date=2019-06-27|language=de}}</ref>

Lay is committed to stopping the decline of public housing.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} For a long time, she also advocated an amendment to the Basic Law that would allow the federal government to continue to provide the Länder with money for social housing even after the funds for unbundling from Federalism Reform I had expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grundgesetzänderung für neue Sozialwohnungen - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1353.grundgesetzänderung-für-neue-sozialwohnungen.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-09-28|language=de}}</ref> Lay demanded that the federal government set up a public housing program based on the Vienna model. Through Lay's proposal, with 10 billion euros annually, the federal government should promote social, non-profit, municipal and cooperative housing construction. In this way, 250,000 new social housing units would be built each year. In addition, municipalities are to bring formerly public housing back into public ownership. In four years, a total of 1.5 million new and affordable apartments would be built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keine soziale Wohnungspolitik ohne Neubau|url=https://www.rosalux.de/publikation/id/40050/|access-date=2019-03-20|language=de}}</ref> Lay thinks that such a housing construction program could initiate a "turnaround in the housing market."<ref>{{cite web|title=Öffentliches Wohnungsbauprogramm nach Wiener Vorbild - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1382.öffentliches-wohnungsbauprogramm-nach-wiener-vorbild.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-11-20|language=de}}</ref> She also believes that the government itself should build affordable housing with long-term social ties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Der Bund muss selber Wohnungen bauen - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1317.der-bund-muss-selber-wohnungen-bauen.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-06-26|language=de}}</ref>

Lay is committed to ensuring that public land is no longer privatized. Her opinion is that public land should only be granted with hereditary building lease. She lobbies for a new renter's movement to be established in Germany, which would put pressure on the federal government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeit für eine neue Mieter*innen-Bewegung im Bund! - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1315.zeit-für-eine-neue-mieter-innen-bewegung-im-bund.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-04-06|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Meilenstein für eine neue Mietenbewegung - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1342.meilenstein-für-eine-neue-mietenbewegung.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-06-09|language=de}}</ref> In this context, she participated in the protests against the Federal Government's Housing Summit and the Alternative Housing Summit in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zusammen gegen #Mietenwahnsinn - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/1350.zusammen-gegen-mietenwahnsinn.html|access-date=2019-03-20|date=2018-09-24|language=de}}</ref> Lay advocates the reintroduction of the housing public benefit, so that developers who are oriented towards the common good can receive tax breaks with investment subsidies if they build affordable rented apartments for this purpose on a permanent basis.

As federal manager, she initiated a "rent policy offensive" of the Left Party in spring 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Linke Offensive zur Wohnungs- und Mietenpolitik|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7xDOhAb168|access-date=2019-03-18|last=DIE LINKE|date=2012-05-09}}</ref>

Lay regularly takes part in anti-Nazi protests, including a blockade against the annual Nazi march in Dresden in 2011. Her citizens' offices in Bautzen and Hoyerswerda have already been attacked several times as a result.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nazischmierereien am neuen LINKEN-Bürgerbüro in Bautzen - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/864.nazischmierereien-am-neuen-linken-buergerbuero-in-bautzen.html|access-date=2019-03-18|date=2014-02-16|language=de}}</ref> For her, the fight against the shift to the right is "one of the most urgent tasks of the left, indeed of the entire enlightened society."<ref>{{cite web|title=Persönliches - Caren Lay|url=http://www.caren-lay.de/de/article/95.ueber-mich.html|access-date=2019-03-18|date=2010-04-30|language=de}}</ref>

As a construction worker with West German roots, Lay advocates a different economic and structural policy for East Germany. She advocates a socio-ecologically compatible structural turnaround in [[Lusatia]]. In addition, she advocates the establishment of equal living conditions in East and West.

Caren Lay is rooted in the women's movement. Within her party, she has developed a mentoring program for young women. In 2011 she initiated the Left Party's Clara Zetkin Women's Prize as Federal Executive Director, which honors projects that aim to improve women's living conditions and gender equality. Since then, the prize has been awarded annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clara-Zetkin-Frauenpreis|url=https://www.die-linke.de/themen/feministische-politik/clara-zetkin-frauenpreis/clara-zetkin-frauenpreis-2019/|access-date=2019-03-18|language=de}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In December 2017, the planned awarding of a prize to [[Ken Jebsen]] in Berlin's Babylon cinema caused controversy within the Left Party. The Berlin Senator for Culture [[Klaus Lederer]] (Die Linke) publicly criticized the award ceremony. He was then criticized by some party members. A rally was announced in front of the federal office, where former Left Party politician [[Wolfgang Gehrcke]] also announced his participation. On the initiative of Caren Lay, the executive committee of the Left Party then distanced itself in a motion entitled "Clear Edge against [[Third Position]]" in which it "unequivocally dissociated itself from the activities of right-wing populists, nationalists, conspiracy theorists and anti-Semites who want to make right-wing populist patterns of explaining the world and 'transverse front' strategies socially acceptable", and expressed its solidarity with Klaus Lederer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Linke im Kampf gegen die Querfront|periodical=Tagesspiegel.de|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/streit-um-preis-fuer-ken-jebsen-die-linke-im-kampf-gegen-die-querfront/20666844.html|access-date=2019-03-20|last=Matthias Meisner|date=2017-12-04}}</ref>
