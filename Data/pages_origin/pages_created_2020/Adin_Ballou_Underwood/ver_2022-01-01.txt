'''Adin Ballou Underwood''' (May 19, 1828 â€“ January 24, 1888) was a general in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
Underwood was born in [[Milford, Massachusetts]], on May 19, 1828. He studied law at [[Brown University]], attended [[Harvard Law School]] and spent a year in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. When the civil war began he practiced law in Boston. He was commissioned as Captain in the [[2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|2nd Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]]. In 1862 he joined the new [[33rd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|33rd Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]] as a Major and served in that unit; eventually becoming its Colonel in April 1863.<ref>Eicher, p. 540</ref>

After the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]], of which the regiment was part of, transferred to the west.

On October 29, at the [[Battle of Wauhatchie]], Underwood was shot in the thigh and crippled for life. He still was promoted to Brigadier General in November. The wound healed slowly and when he returned to duty in 1865 he was medically unfit for field service, instead doing court-martial duty.<ref>Welsh, p. 347</ref> In August 1865 he was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] to Major General and mustered out of the [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]]. Returning to Boston; he served as surveyor of the port and practiced law again. Underwood died there on January 24, 1888.<ref>Warner, p. 519</ref>
