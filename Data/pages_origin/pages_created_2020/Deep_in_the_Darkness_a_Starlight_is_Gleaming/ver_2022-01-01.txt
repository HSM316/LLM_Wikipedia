== History ==
"Deep in the darkness a starlight is gleaming" was written by Jan Berry, a [[Baptist]] and [[United Reformed Church]] minister.<ref name=m>{{cite web |url=https://www.methodist.org.uk/our-faith/worship/singing-the-faith-plus/hymns/deep-in-the-darkness-a-starlight-is-gleaming-stf-625/ |title=Deep in the Darkness a Starlight is Gleaming |publisher=The Methodist Church |accessdate=2020-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224161947/https://www.methodist.org.uk/our-faith/worship/singing-the-faith-plus/hymns/deep-in-the-darkness-a-starlight-is-gleaming-stf-625/ |archive-date=2019-12-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The hymn came about after a United Reformed Church minister approached her and stated that they could not find an appropriate hymn for Epiphany that covered the massacre of the Holy Innocents by [[King Herod the Great|King Herod]] at the end of the Epiphany timeline.<ref name=m /> This was because not many hymns cover the topic, except for [[Coventry Carol]], and a verse in "[[Unto Us Is Born a Son]]".<ref name=m /> Berry copyrighted the hymn in 2011 when it was published in the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]]'s ''[[Singing the Faith]]'' hymnal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hymnary.org/text/deep_in_the_darkness_a_starlight_is |title=Deep in the darkness a starlight is gleaming |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2020-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224162121/https://hymnary.org/text/deep_in_the_darkness_a_starlight_is |archive-date=2019-12-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was originally set to the "Epiphany Hymn" tune, the same one used in the fellow Epiphany hymn "[[Brightest and Best|Brightest and Best of the Sons of the Morning]]".<ref>{{cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Duncan |title=Shine On, Star of Bethlehem |publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd |date=2004 |isbn=1853115886 |page=241}}</ref> However an original hymn tune called "High Point" was created for it by Paul Leddington Wright.<ref name=m /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hymnary.org/tune/high_point_wright |title=High Point |publisher=Hymnary.org |date= |accessdate=2020-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224162129/https://hymnary.org/tune/high_point_wright |archive-date=2019-12-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>
