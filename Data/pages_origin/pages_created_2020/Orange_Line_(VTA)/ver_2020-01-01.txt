The '''Orange Line''' is a [[light rail]] in [[Santa Clara County, California]], and part of the [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA) light rail system. It serves 26 stations in the cities of [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], traveling between [[Downtown Mountain View station|Mountain View]] and [[Alum Rock Transit Center|Alum Rock]] stations. The line connects to [[Great America (California)|Great America]], [[Levi's Stadium]], and in the future will connect to the [[Milpitas (BART station)|Milpitas BART station]]. It runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays, with [[Headway|headways]] of 15 minutes for most of the day. On weekends, train run at 20 minute headways for most of the day. After around 8pm on weekdays and weekends trains run at 30 minute headways.

==Route description==
The Orange Line starts from the [[Downtown Mountain View station]] in [[Mountain View, California]], travels toward the east, passing under [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] at Ellis Avenue, following Mathilda Avenue to Java Drive, crossing [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] and turning east on Tasman Drive, which eventually becomes Capitol Avenue. For the rest of the trip the line follows Capitol Avenue until it reaches its eastern terminus, the [[Alum Rock Transit Center]].

==Construction history==
The route that the Orange Line now runs on is constructed in three different expansion projects: the original '''Guadalupe line''', the '''Tasman West extension''', and the '''Vasona extension'''.

===Guadalupe line===
The trackway between [[Old Ironsides (VTA)|Old Ironsides]] station and First Street is part of the Guadalupe line, the first light rail line constructed in Santa Clara county.  The Guadalupe line opened for revenue service on December 10, 1987 originally running from Old Ironsides station to [[Civic Center (VTA)|Civic Center]] station in San Jose. [[Champion (VTA)|Champion]] station was not part of the original line; it was added as intermediate stop as part of the Tasman West project.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Robinson| first1=Bert| others=et al.| title=All Aboard - It's Off and Rolling| newspaper=San Jose Mercury News| date=December 11, 1987| at=Sec A:1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Grant| first=Joanne| title=Mishap Won't Delay Light Rail| newspaper=San Jose Mercury News| date=November 6, 1987| at=Sec B:3}}</ref>

===Tasman West extension===
The Tasman West extension project was constructed with funds from 1996 Measure B sales tax measure. [[Champion (VTA)|Champion]] station was the first to open as an infill stop along the existing Guadalupe line trackway, opening March 24, 1997.<ref>{{cite news| last=Barnacle| first=Betty| title=Light Rail Opens New Stop; First Station on Tasman Line to Serve North S.J. High-Tech Firms| newspaper=San Jose Mercury News| date=March 24, 1997| at=Sec B:1}}</ref> On December 17, 1999, {{convert|7.6|mi}} of trackway and 12 new light rail stations added between the existing [[Old Ironsides (VTA)|Old Ironsides station]] and the new [[Downtown Mountain View station]]. On the same day, [[Baypointe (VTA)|Baypointe]] station opened just east of the intersection of 1st and Tasman.

===Tasman East/Capitol extension===
The first phase of the '''Tasman East''' extension opened in May 2001 between Baypointe and [[I-880/Milpitas (VTA)|I-880/Milpitas]] stations.<ref>{{cite web |title=VTA Facts: Light Rail System |publisher=[[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] |date=2006-11-30 |url=http://www.vta.org/news/factsheets/bus_lightrail_trolly_information/09_light_rail_system_110705.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704200157/http://www.vta.org/news/factsheets/bus_lightrail_trolly_information/09_light_rail_system_110705.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-04}}</ref><ref name="vta-tec-project">{{cite web |title = Tasman East/Capitol Project Description |work = Completed projects |publisher = [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] |date = 2008-05-12 |url = http://www.vta.org/projects/te_cap/project/ |accessdate = 2008-11-16}}</ref>

On June 24, 2004, the 8.3-mile (13.4-km) '''Tasman East/Capitol''' extension was opened, incorporating 8 new stations. This extension runs from the I-880/Milpitas station east along the Great Mall Parkway in Milpitas, then into East San Jose on Capitol Avenue to [[Alum Rock Transit Center]] on Alum Rock Avenue. This extension brings service to the [[Great Mall of the Bay Area]] in [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]]. The total cost of this extension was $432.9 million.<ref name="vta-tec-project"/>

=== Light Rail Efficiency Project ===
In 2014, a new storage track and crossover was constructed between Old Ironsides and Reamwood as part of improvements to support events at [[Levi's Stadium]] and the future [[Silicon Valley BART extension]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.vta.org/projects-and-programs/transit/light-rail-efficiency| title=Light Rail Efficiency| accessdate=May 13, 2015| website=Light Rail Efficiency| publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority}}</ref>

To provide better headways and service reliability, a second track was constructed between Whisman and Downtown Mountain View. Work began in summer 2014 and was completed in late 2015. Evelyn Station was permanently closed in mid-March 2015 as part of track construction.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.vta.org/projects-and-programs/transit/light-rail-efficiency/mountain-view-double-track| title=Mountain View Double Track| accessdate=May 13, 2015| website=Mountain View Double Track| publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority}}</ref>

===2019 reconfiguration===
Ahead of the opening of the Silicon Valley BART extension to Berryessa / North San Jose, the Orange Line was created. Starting in early 2019, station signage was changed reflect the new configuration, displaying line colors rather than terminus icons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Downtown Mountain View station|work=Mapillary|date=February 27, 2019|accessdate=March 4, 2019|url=https://www.mapillary.com/map/im/CyiLY1mIydftpEA-xn5YvA}}</ref>

VTA have proposed a future extension to this line running along the median of [[Capitol Expressway]]. Under the 2005 Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR), an initial operating segment would extend from Alum Rock, terminating at Eastridge.<ref name=FEIR-Capitol/>{{rp|1-8}} Phase 1 of the Capitol Expressway extension would include new light rail stations at Story Road and VTA's [[Eastridge Transit Center]], extending the line {{convert|2.4|mi}} south from Alum Rock.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://vtaorgcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Site_Content/Ch_01_ExecSummary_SEIR-2.pdf |title=Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report-2 |volume=1 |chapter=1: Executive Summary |publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> Actual construction remains contingent on funding availability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vtaorgcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Site_Content/CELR%20fs_032118.pdf |title=Fact Sheet: Eastridge to BART Regional Connector - Capitol Expressway Light Rail Project |date=March 2018 |publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> An earlier version of the project also included a station at Ocala as part of Phase 1,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vta.org/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/068A0000001HBvG |title=Capitol Expressway Light Rail to Eastridge |date=June 2013 |publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> but the Ocala station was eliminated in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vtaorgcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Site_Content/NOP_FINAL_All_Signed_180529.pdf#page=4 |title=Notice of Preparation of a Draft Second Supplemental Environmental Impact Report for the Eastridge to BART Regional Connector: Capitol Expressway Light Rail Project |date=May 29, 2018 |author=Jaworski, Christine |publisher=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority |accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>

Phase 2 of the extension would complete a loop to the existing [[Capitol (VTA)|Capitol]] station.
