== History and Situation ==
The Meggen station was inaugurated in 1897 with the commissioning of the Lucerne - Immensee line, which connected Lucerne to the Immensee - Chiasso line, better known as the Gotthard line.

It is located in the center of the urban area of Meggen. It has two central platforms accessed by two through tracks and one dead-end track, as well as a branch to a factory in the northeast of the station. Since 2006, there has been a new station in the locality, Meggen Zentrum, which has a more central location.

In railway terms, the station is situated on the Lucerne - Immensee line. Its adjacent railway facilities are the Meggen Zentrum station towards Lucerne and the Merlischachen station towards Immensee.
