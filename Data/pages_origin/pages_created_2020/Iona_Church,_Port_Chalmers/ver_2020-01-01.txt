== History ==
Iona church was designed to replace a earlier wooden church. The new stone church was designed by [[Nathaniel Young Armstrong Wales]]. The foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the building was opened on 7 January 1872. As a result of a growing congregation an additional gallery was added between 1882-83. The new gallery became the main church and the original church building became the church hall.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d3-d1-d20.html|title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Cyclopedia Company Limited|first=|publisher=The Cyclopedia Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=Christchurch|pages=}}</ref><ref name=":0" />
