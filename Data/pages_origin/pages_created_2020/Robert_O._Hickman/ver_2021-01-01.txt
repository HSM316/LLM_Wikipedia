'''Robert Othello Hickman''' ([[Monticello, Utah]] September 27, 1926&ndash;May 10, 2019) was a Seattle-area pediatric nephrologist and inventor of the [[Hickman catheter]].

He served in the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1940s and married Lucy Jean Whitesides before going on to receive his medical degree from the [[University of Maryland]] School of Medicine.

He was part of a team that put the first patient in the world on kidney dialysis and broke ground developing catheters and shunts.<ref>[https://www.medicalalumni.org/bulletin/spring_2007/alumni.html Biography on University of Maryland site]</ref> The Hickman catheter is currently used to deliver medication sub-cutaneously, particularly to cancer patients, as well as for the withdrawal of blood for analysis.

In 1991, he took a three-year sabbatical to serve as a church mission president. Seven years later, he took a second sabbatical as the doctor for the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center, administering to about 800 students.<ref>[https://www.medicalalumni.org/bulletin/spring_2007/alumni.html Ibid.]</ref>
