{{Short description|Pediatric nephrologist and inventor}}
'''Robert Othello Hickman''' ([[Monticello, Utah]] September 27, 1926&ndash;May 10, 2019) was a Seattle-area pediatric nephrologist and inventor of the [[Hickman catheter]]. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Hickman was raised in [[Logan, Utah]]. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1945-1946. From 1947-1949 he served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ in France. He married Lucy Jean Whitesides in 1950. He earned his undergraduate degree in anatomy from the [[University of Utah]]. He later received his medical degree from the [[University of Maryland]] School of Medicine. He did an internship with the [[University of Utah]] and a residency with the [[University of Washington]], where he worked with [[Belding Scribner]] on hemodialysis.

He was part of a team that put the first patient in the world on kidney dialysis and broke ground developing catheters and shunts.<ref>[https://www.medicalalumni.org/bulletin/spring_2007/alumni.html Biography on University of Maryland site]</ref> The Hickman catheter is currently used to deliver medication sub-cutaneously, particularly to cancer patients, as well as for the withdrawal of blood for analysis.

In 1991, he took a three-year sabbatical to serve as a mission president for The Church of Jesus Christ. First he served over the Haiti Port-au-Prince mission. However a decision was made by higher up leaders to place that mission under a Haitian president due to worsening political instability, and Hickman was transferred to being president of the Raleigh North Carolina Mission. Seven years later, he took a second sabbatical as the doctor for the [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center]], administering to about 800 students.<ref>[https://www.medicalalumni.org/bulletin/spring_2007/alumni.html Ibid.]</ref>

Hickman served in many positions in The Church of Jesus Christ. This included service as a bishop, stake president of the Lynnwood Washington Stake,<ref>[https://www.deseret.com/1991/4/27/20763320/pres-and-sister-robert-hickman-pres-and 1991 article on Hickman's call as a mission president]</ref> stake patriarch and temple sealer.

Hickman and his wife Lucy were the parents of six children.
