'''Deborah Marrow''' (October 18, 1948 – October 1, 2019) was a foundation director and art historian who spent a 36-year career with the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She worked at the Trust from 1983 to 2019 including two assignments as interim president and chief executive officer and 30 years as Director of the Getty Foundation.

==Early life and education==
She was born in New York City on October 18, 1948, to Adele (Wolin) Marrow and Seymour A. Marrow. She was raised in [[Scarsdale, New York]], attending Quaker Ridge Elementary School and [[Scarsdale High School]]. She was an exceptional student and worked on many school activities. She was a devoted camper at Camp Walden in Denmark, Maine, where her daughter, Anna, and her sister, Jane Marrow Bemis, also attended.

In 1966, she started college at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia. She graduated ''cum laude'' from Penn with a degree in history in 1970. She went on to obtain a master's degree in art history at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland in 1972. She went back to Penn and finished her PhD in art history in 1978. Her major and minor fields were baroque art and modern art, respectively.

==Personal life==
Marrow met her husband, [[Michael J. McGuire]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on the third night of her freshman year (1966). They were married for 48 years and had two children, Anna Marrow McGuire and David Marrow McGuire. She married Michael on June 19, 1971, in a simple ceremony at her parents' house in Scarsdale. Marrow and Michael spent a year in London, Paris and Florence in 1976-77 while she did her thesis research. She moved to California with Michael in 1977.

==Early career==
Before, during, and after obtaining her PhD, she was a teacher. In the 1970s, he taught art history at local colleges in the Philadelphia area. In California, she finished her doctoral thesis on the art patronage of Maria de' Medici (1978) after which she taught at colleges and universities in the Los Angeles area. She was an adjunct assistant professor at [[Occidental College]] in 1979, 1981 and 1982, and she was a field faculty advisor at [[Goddard College]] from 1975 to 1979. In the late 1970s, she was managing editor and member of the editorial board of the feminist publication ''[[Chrysalis (magazine)|Chrysalis]]''.

In 1983, she started work with the Getty as publication coordinator in the new publications program. She was appointed director of the Getty Grant Program (now the [[Getty Foundation]]) in 1989 where she spent the rest of her career.

During her tenure at the Getty she was called upon to become the acting director of the [[Getty Research Institute]] (1999–2000), and in 2000, she assumed the additional role of dean for external relations for the Getty. She was asked to step in as interim president and chief executive officer during two periods.
