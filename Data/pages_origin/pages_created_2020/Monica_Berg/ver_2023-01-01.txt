==Style, cocktails and influences==

Berg's cocktails often center around fresh, seasonal ingredients.<ref name="Sgarbi"/> Berg works with local farmers in the United Kingdom to source ingredients for cocktails.<ref name="Smith2"/> At Tayēr + Elementary, Berg works in what she describes a "collective effort" with other staff members to create cocktails, instead of each bartender creating their own individual drinks. Berg also wants to make accessible cocktails, using a test called "Would you serve this to your mother?" to decide if the beverage should make the Tayēr + Elementary menu.<ref name="Sgarbi"/>
