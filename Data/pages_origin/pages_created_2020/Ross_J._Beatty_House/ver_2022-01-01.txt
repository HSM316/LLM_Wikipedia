The '''Ross J. Beatty House''', also known as '''Halcyon Hall''', is a historic house at 344 Ravine Drive in [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]]. Built circa 1909, the house was the second of two homes built in Highland Park for steel magnate Ross J. Beatty. Originally situated on a large lot, the house is a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]]-style mansion with a [[carriage house]], [[greenhouse]], and [[gazebo]] on its grounds.
