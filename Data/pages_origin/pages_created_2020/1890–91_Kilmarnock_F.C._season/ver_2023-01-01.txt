Season '''1890–91''' was the 18th season of competitive football by [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].

==Overview==
Kilmarnock entered the [[Scottish Cup]] for the 18th time and also competed in the [[Ayrshire Cup]]. They were eliminated in the first round of the Scottish Cup in a replay by [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] for the second consecutive season despite scoring six times in the two matches.

''Killie'' fared better in the Ayrshire Cup. After defeating [[Irvine F.C.|Irvine]], 5–0, in the first round, they recorded a club-record 15–0 win against [[Lanemark F.C.|Lanemark]] in the second round, a record which still stands after {{age|1890|11|22}} years. They overcame [[Kilbirnie F.C.|Kilbirnie]] 3–1 in a third round replay to reach the semi-finals where they defeated local rivals [[Kilmarnock Athletic F.C.|Kilmarnock Athletic]], 3–2. In the final, Kilmarnock set another record as they defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 7–1 – the largest margin of victory in an Ayrshire Cup final.

After three seasons playing in black and white stripes, Kilmarnock changed their uniforms back to the original Oxford blue. The team would play the next five seasons decked all in blue.<ref name="Kits">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Kilmarnock/Kilmarnock.htm |title=Kilmarnock – Historical Football Kits |publisher=Historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>
