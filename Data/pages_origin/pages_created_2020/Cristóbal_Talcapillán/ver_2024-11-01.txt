'''Cristóbal Talcapillán''' (born {{Circa}} 1649), also known as Don Cristóbal,<ref name=Vea574>de Vea 1886, p. 574</ref> was a [[Chono people|Chono]] man who became known for his role in ushering the expeditions of [[Bartolomé Gallardo]] (1674–1675) and [[Antonio de Vea expedition|Antonio de Vea]] (1675–1676) into the [[fjords and channels of Chile|fjords and channels of Patagonia]].

==Talcapillán's allegations and map==
In the early 1670s the English sailor [[John Narborough]] [[English expedition to Valdivia|explored the coasts of Patagonia]].<ref name=MartMoor1982>{{cite journal |last1=Martinic B. |first1=Mateo |author-link1=Mateo Martinic |last2=Moore |first2=David M. |date=1982 |title=Las exploraciones inglesas en el estrecho de Magallanes. El mapa manuscrito de John Narborough |url=http://bibliotecadigital.umag.cl/bitstream/handle/20.500.11893/850/Martinic_Anales_1982_vol13_pp7-20.pdf?sequence=1 |language=es |journal=[[Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia]] |volume=13 |pages=7–20 }}</ref> This caused great alarm among Spanish authorities who feared the establishment of an English base in Patagonia.<ref name=MartMoor1982/><ref name=Urbina2016/> As a consequence various expeditions were sent from the Spanish settlements of [[Chiloé Archipelago|Chiloé]] to the south. Jerónimo Díaz de Mendoza led an expedition in 1674 that having failed to find any Europeans in Patagonia went back to Chiloé with Cristóbal Talcapillán and other indigenous Chono they encountered.<ref name=Urbina2016/> In 1674 he was about 25 years old according to estimations of the Spanish.<ref name=Urbina2016>{{cite journal |last1=Urbina Carrasco |first1=Ximena|author-link=Ximena Urbina |date=2016 |title=Interacciones entre españoles de Chiloé y Chonos en los siglos XVII y XVIII: Pedro y Francisco Delco, Ignacio y Cristóbal Talcapillán y Martín Olleta |language=es|trans-title=Interactions between Spaniards of Chiloé and Chonos in the XVII and XVII centuries: Pedro and Francisco Delco, Ignacio and Cristóbal Talcapillán and Martín Olleta |url=http://www.chungara.cl/Vols/2016/48-1/07-URBINA.pdf |journal=[[Chungara (journal)|Chungara]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–114 |access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> In [[Chacao, Chile|Chacao]] Cristóbal Talcapillán rapidly learned [[Mapuche language|Veliche]]<ref name=Urbina2016/> which was the main language of Chiloé –including the Spanish settlements– at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cárdenas A. |first=Renato |last2=Montiel Vera |first2=Dante |last3=Grace Hall |first3=Catherine |date=1991 |title=Los chono y los veliche de Chiloé |url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0012567.pdf |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=Olimpho |page=277 |author-link1=Renato Cárdenas |language=es}}</ref> While there he began to give indications about the existence of European settlements in the archipelagoes of Patagonia. Spanish authorities learned about this and interviewed him. He drew accurate "maps" of the territory south of Chiloé giving credibility to his allegations.<ref name=Urbina2016/> Authorities went was far as sending Cristóbal Talcapillán to Lima, the capital of the viceroyalty, to investigate his claims.<ref name=Urbina2016/> Cristóbal Talcapillán was sent back to Chiloé and it was then decided that a major expedition should be sent to the verify the presence of Englishmen or other Europeans.<ref name=Urbina2016/>

==Guide and translator in the Antonio de Vea expedition==
Thus an [[Antonio de Vea expedition|expedition led by Antonio de Vea]] departed from [[El Callao]] in September 1675.<ref>de Vea 1886, p. 543</ref> Picking Cristóbal Talcapillán in Chiloé where the expedition was also outfitted with nine [[dalca]]s.<ref name=MartMoor1982/><ref>de Vea 1886, p. 557</ref> During the navigation in the fjords and channels, the Spanish began to doubt the indications of Cristóbal Talcapillán. Cristóbal Talcapillán's help in translating interrogations of a captured Chono woman suggested his translations were fabrications. Subsequently, when he was enquired about his allegations Talcapillán retracted indications about where to find iron anchors and said he had been coerced to lie by [[Bartolomé Gallardo]] and his father [[Francisco Gallardo del Águila|Francisco Gallardo]].<ref name=Vea578>de Vea 1886, p. 578</ref> It is possible that the fabrications of Cristóbal Talcapillán were done to appease the Spanish as he learned about Spanish culture and what kind of things were of their interest.<ref name=Urbina2016/>

Having realized that Cristóbal Talcapillán was highly unreliable the expedition returned to Chiloé in late January 1676.<ref name=Vea586>de Vea 1886, p. 586</ref><ref name=Urbina2016/> The possibility of Talcapillán's reports being false was already considered when [[Antonio de Vea]] received his instructions in Peru.<ref name=Vea580>de Vea 1886, p. 580</ref><ref name=Vea581>de Vea 1886, p. 581</ref> In such case Talcapillán was to be left in Chiloé at the disposal of Spanish authorities.<ref name=Vea580/><ref name=Vea581/>

==Prisoner in Peru==
Eventually Talcapillán was punished for the false alarm.<ref name=Barana120/> According to the Viceroy of Peru [[Baltasar de la Cueva, Count of Castellar|Baltasar de la Cueva]] Talcapillán was condemned to two hundred [[Flagellation|lashes]] in addition to a lifetime sentence of [[penal labour]]. He was to quarry stone in [[San Lorenzo Island (Peru)|San Lorenzo Island]] for use in the walls of the local [[presidio]].<ref name=Barana120>Barros Arana 1884, p. 120</ref>
