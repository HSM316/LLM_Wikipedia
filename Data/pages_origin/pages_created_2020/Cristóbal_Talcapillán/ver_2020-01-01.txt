'''Cristóbal Talcapillán''', also known as Don Cristóbal,<ref name=Vea574>de Vea 1886, p. 574</ref> was an young [[Chono]] man who became known for his role in ushering the [[Antonio de Vea expedition]] into the [[fjords and channels of Chile|archipelagoes of Patagonia]].

In the early 1670s the English sailor [[John Narborough]] explored of the coasts of southern Patagonia.<ref name=MartMoor1982>{{cite journal |last1=Martinic B. |first1=Mateo |author-link1=Mateo Martinic |last2=Moore |first2=David M. |date=1982 |title=Las exploraciones inglesas en el estrecho de Magallanes.

Jerónimo Díaz de Mendoza led an expedition in 1674 that having failed to find any Europeans in Patagonia went back to Chiloé with Cristóbal Talcapillán and other indigenous Chono they encontered.<ref name=Urbina2016/> In 1674 he was about 25 years old according to estimations of the Spanish.<ref name=Urbina2016>{{cite journal |last1=Urbina Carrasco |first1=Ximena |date=2016 |title=Interacciones entre españoles de Chiloé y Chonos en los siglos XVII y XVIII: Pedro y Francisco Delco, Ignacio y Cristóbal Talcapillán y Martín Olleta |language=Spanish|trans-title=Interactions between Spaniards of Chiloé and Chonos in the XVII and XVII centuries: Pedro and Francisco Delco, Ignacio and Cristóbal Talcapillán and Martín Olleta |url=http://www.chungara.cl/Vols/2016/48-1/07-URBINA.pdf |journal=[[Chungara (journal)|Chungara]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–114 |doi= |access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> In [[Chacao, Chile|Chacao]] Cristóbal Talcapillán rapidly learned [[Mapuche language|Veliche]]<ref name=Urbina2016/> which was the main language of Chiloé –including the Spanish settlements– at the time.{{fact}} While there he begun to give indications about the existence of European settlements in the archipelagoes of Patagonia. Spanish authorities learned about this and interviewed him. He drew accurate "maps" of the territory south of Chiloé giving credibility to his allegations.<ref name=Urbina2016/> Authorities went was far as sending Cristóbal Talcapillán to Lima, the capital of the viceroyalty, to investigate his claims.<ref name=Urbina2016/> Cristóbal Talcapillán was sent back to Chiloé and it was then decided that a major expedition should be sent to the verify the presence of Englishmen or other Europeans.<ref name=Urbina2016/>

Thus an [[Antonio de Vea expedition|expedition led by Antonio de Vea]] departed from [[El Callao]] in September 1675.<ref>de Vea 1886, p. 543</ref> Picking Cristóbal Talcapillán in Chiloé where the expedition was also outfitted with nine [[dalca]]s.<ref name=MartMoor1982/><ref>de Vea 1886, p. 557</ref>

During the navigation in the fjords and channels the Spanish begun to dubt the indications of Cristóbal Talcapillán. Cristóbal Talcapillán help in translating interrogations of a captured Chono woman suggested his translations were fabrications. Don Cristobal retracted indications about where to find iron anchors and said he had been coherced to lie.<ref name=Vea578>de Vea 1886, p. 578</ref> It is possible that the fabications of Cristóbal Talcapillán were done to applease the Spanish as he learned about Spanish culture and what kind things were of their interest.<ref name=Urbina2016/>

Having realised that Cristóbal Talcapillán was highly unreliable the expedition returned to Chiloé in late January 1676.<ref name=Vea586>de Vea 1886, p. 586</ref><ref name=Urbina2016/>
