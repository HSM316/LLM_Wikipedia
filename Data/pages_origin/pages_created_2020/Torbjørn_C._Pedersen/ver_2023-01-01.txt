== Once Upon a Saga ==
In 2013, Pedersen began planning a project which aimed at visiting every country in the world in a single unbroken journey explicitly without the use of air transport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/12/30/travelling-world-no-planes/|title=This man is travelling the world without ever getting on a plane|website=Lonely Planet News|language=en|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leifwalcutt/2017/02/14/around-the-world-by-container-ship-one-mans-quest-to-visit-every-country/|title=Around The World By Container Ship: One Man's Quest To Visit Every Country|last=Walcutt|first=Leif|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> [[Graham Hughes]] holds the world record of fastest visiting all countries by public surface transport, according to [[Guinness World Records]]. Hughes was however permitted to fly home to Britain twice during his journey, as long as he returned to the same airport in order to continue his journey. To visit every country in the world, in one single journey, without catching a single flight is something that has never been done before.<ref name="The National">Leve, Andy [https://amp.thenational.ae/lifestyle/travel/torbjorn-pedersen-the-man-on-a-mission-to-visit-every-country-in-the-world-without-taking-a-single-flight-1.907263 "Torbjorn Pedersen: the man on a mission to visit every country in the world, without taking a single flight"], ''The National'', Abu Dhabi, 7 September 2019. <!--accessed 08 January 2020--></ref>

Through the project Pedersen intends to reach every country without flying, while promoting every country and the world in a positive way.
