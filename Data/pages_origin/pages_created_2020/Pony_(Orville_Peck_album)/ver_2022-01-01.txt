== Themes and influences ==
''Pony'' mainly focuses on themes of love and heartbreak through lyrical storytelling, with many characters based on people from the artist's own life.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Orville Peck Is a Lone Stranger Singing Country Songs From Behind a Mask|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/zma7a3/orville-peck-pony-turn-to-hate-interview|access-date=2021-09-29|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref> Peck describes the inspiration behind the album as his "love letter to a classic country album … a collection of stories."<ref>{{Citation|title=Orville Peck Talks Influences, 'Pony' & Approaching Music From A "Visual" Place {{!}} On The Road|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xgrmR2ehs|language=en|access-date=2021-09-29}}</ref> Tracks from the album such as "Big Sky" and "Dead of Night" portray different characters falling in and out of love and the escapades of their lives, whereas "Roses Are Falling" describes a fictional love interest that the narrator loves so much, they want to kill them. "Turn To Hate" discusses personal heartbreak and "the anxiety that comes with being on the outside of things,"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Indie cowboy Orville Peck wrestles with resentment on new country classic “Turn To Hate”|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/discovery/orville-peck-turn-to-hate|access-date=2021-09-29|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en}}</ref> while trying to keep one's sorrow from developing into hatred. Peck's self-described 'visual approach' to music combines his adoration for classic cowboy imagery such as [[Nudie suit|Nudie suits]] with modern fashion elements, especially the musician's famous fringe mask that conceals his identity.

''Pony'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Many critics praised Peck's reverence for traditional country styles, as well as the album's exploration of [[queer]] themes. "Tracks like 'Roses Are Falling' and 'Take You Back (The Iron Hoof Cattle Call)' are solid entries to the classic country canon of [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Loretta Lynn]], while his impressive vocal range helps keep the album varied." said Matt Bobkin of ''[[Exclaim!]]''.
