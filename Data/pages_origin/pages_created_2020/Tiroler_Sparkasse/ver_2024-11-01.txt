The '''Tiroler Sparkasse Bankaktiengesellschaft Innsbruck''' (known as '''Tiroler Sparkasse''') is an Austrian [[savings bank]] that focuses on private customers, [[freelancer]]s and small and medium-sized enterprises in the [[Tyrol (federal state)|Tyrol region]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infina.at/infina/partnerbanken/tiroler-sparkasse-bank-ag/|title=Tiroler Sparkasse Bank AG|last=|first=|date=|website=Infina|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref>

The bank was founded in 1822 and is part of the Austrian [[Sparkassengruppe Österreich]]. {{as of |2018}} it held a leading position in its regional market with a market share of around 30% for private customers and almost 50% for corporate customers in the region with around 153,500 customers.  

It is a member of the Austrian Savings Banks Liability Association, which guarantees the payment of customer deposits in excess of the legally guaranteed amount of €100,000.

==History==
In 1822, during economically difficult years, [[Karl, Count Chotek of Chotkow and Wognin|Count Chotek]] and ''Felix Adam von Riccabona'' founded the "Sparkasse zu Innsbruck" as the first financial institution in [[Tyrol]] and the second oldest association savings bank in [[Austria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uibk.ac.at/newsroom/graf-chotek-preis-verliehen.html.de|title=Graf Chotek-Preis verliehen|last=|first=|date=6 May 2019|website=Universität Innsbruck|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> The aim was to encourage the building up of savings and financial provision for broad sections of the population and to use savings for economic development in the region. The city of Innsbruck provided the first business premises in the former town hall next to the city tower.

In 1822 the Sparkasse became a general savings institution and could thus be used by all sections of the population. Until then, this only applied to the socially and economically disadvantaged. In 1866 the institute moved to the Magistratsgebäude at Pfarrplatz 2, today's Domplatz. In 1877, the Sparkasse moved into its later property in Erlerstraße. In 1885 it was given the statutory name "Sparkasse der Stadt Innsbruck". The first [[World Savings Day]] was held in 1925.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.meinbezirk.at/oberoesterreich/c-wirtschaft/der-weltspartag-und-seine-geschenke_a3699432|title=Der Weltspartag und seine Geschenke |last=|first=|date=21 October 2019|website=BezirksRundschau|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> In the same year the first exchange office was opened in Maria-Theresien-Straße.

The main branch of the ''Tiroler Bauernsparkasse'' in Innsbruck merged with the Sparkasse of the city of Innsbruck in 1943. The ''Sparefroh'' was "born" in 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.170jahre.at/geschichte/wiederaufbau-und-oeffentlichkeit-1945-1978/der-sparefroh-in-ganz-oesterreich-1955|title=Der Sparefroh in ganz Österreich.|last=|first=|date=|website=Sparkasse Oberösterreich|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> One year later the first branch was opened in [[Innsbruck#Boroughs and statistical divisions|Pradl]]. In 1974 a new seven-storey building was erected on ''Sparkassenplatz'' and was given the official address ''Sparkassenplatz 1''. In 1975 it merged with the ''Sparkasse der Stadt Solbad [[Hall in Tirol|Hall]]''. The Sparkasse now bore the name ''Sparkasse der Stadt Innsbruck mit Sparkasse der Stadt Hall''. The first ATM in Tyrol was opened in 1980 in the Sparkassen Arcade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kurier.at/wirtschaft/digital-life/geschichte-der-bankomaten/197.936.739|title=Geschichte der Bankomaten|last=|first=|date=|website=Kurier|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref>

In 1982 the institute changed its name to ''Sparkasse Innsbruck-Hall, Tiroler Sparkasse''. One year later the right to use the Tyrolean coat of arms was granted. Tirolinvest KAG was founded in 1988 as Tirol's only fund company. In 1990 the entire banking business of the Sparkasse was transferred to ''Tiroler Sparkasse Bankaktiengesellschaft Innsbruck''.<ref name="assets" /><ref name="location" /> ''Erste Bank'' became the majority owner of Tiroler Sparkasse in 2001. Tiroler Sparkasse thus became part of ''[[Erste Group]]'' (with around 15.7 million customers). The Innsbruck branch of ''Die Zweite Sparkasse'' was opened in 2007. ''Tirolinvest KAG'' was merged with ''Erste-Sparinvest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft m.b.H.'' in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2017-11/42151825-tirolinvest-kag-mit-erste-sparinvest-kag-verschmolzen-484.htm|title=Tirolinvest KAG mit Erste Sparinvest KAG verschmolzen|last=|first=|date=6 November 2017|website=FinanzNachrichten|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref>

== Locations ==
In addition to its head office at Sparkassenplatz, the Tiroler Sparkasse has 26 branches and 25 self-service and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] locations (mainly in the districts of [[Innsbruck]]-Stadt and Innsbruck-Land) as well as the ''wohn²Center'' at ''Sparkassenplatz 1''.
