'''Bates's chip''' (also called a '''sloppy chip''' or '''fuzzy chip''') is a theoretical [[Integrated circuit|chip]] proposed by [[MIT Media Lab]]'s [[computer scientist]] Joseph Bates that would incorporate [[fuzzy logic]] to do calculations. The resulting calculations would be less accurate, though they would be performed significantly faster.<ref name="Bennett">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_06/b4214040532062.htm|title=Innovator: Joseph Bates - BusinessWeek|last=Bennett|first=Drake|date=January 28, 2011<!--, 9:00PM EST-->|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="Hardesty">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fuzzy-logic-0103.html|title=The surprising usefulness of sloppy arithmetic|last=Hardesty|first=Larry|date=January 3, 2011|work=MIT News Office|accessdate=30 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110129211523/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fuzzy-logic-0103.html| archivedate= 29 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>
