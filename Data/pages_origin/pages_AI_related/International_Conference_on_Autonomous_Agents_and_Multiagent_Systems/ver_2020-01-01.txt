The '''International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems''' or '''AAMAS''' is the leading scientific conference for research in the areas of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, and multiagent systems. It is annually organized by a non-profit organization called the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).

== History ==
The AAMAS conference is a merger of three major international conferences/workshops, namely International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS), and International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aamas-conference.org/ | title=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS) | accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref> As such, this highly respected joint conference provides a quality forum for discussing research in this area.

== Activities ==

Besides the main program that consists of a main track, an industry and applications track, and a couple of special area tracks, AAMAS also hosts over 20 workshops (e.g., AOSE, COIN, DALT, ProMAS, to mention a few) and many tutorials. There is also a demonstration session and a doctoral symposium. Finally, each year AAMAS features a bunch of awards, most notably the IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award. It publishes [[proceedings]] which are available online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE146&tab=pubs&CFID=81044068&CFTOKEN=86050602 |title=Event: AAMAS | publisher=[[ACM Digital Library#Digital Library|ACM Digital Library]] |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>
