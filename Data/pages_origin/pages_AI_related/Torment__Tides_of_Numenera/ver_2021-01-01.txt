'''''Torment: Tides of Numenera''''' is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[inXile Entertainment]] and published by [[Techland Publishing]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[MacOS]], [[Linux]], [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Inxile_Ent/status/761226439379202049|title=InXile Entertainment on Twitter|access-date=2016-08-04}}</ref> It is a [[spiritual successor]] to 1999's ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''.

The game takes place in [[Numenera]], a [[science fantasy]] [[campaign setting]] written by [[Monte Cook]]. It uses the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]]. ''Torment: Tides of Numenera'', like its predecessor, is primarily story-driven while placing greater emphasis on interaction with the world and characters, with combat and item accumulation taking a secondary role.

The game was successfully crowd-funded through [[Kickstarter]] in the first six hours of the project's launch in March 2013. At the campaign's conclusion, ''Torment: Tides of Numenera'' had set the record for highest-funded video game on Kickstarter with over US$4 million pledged. The release date was initially set for December 2014, but was pushed back to February 2017.

Instead of a classic [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] system acting as a character's ethical and moral compass, ''Torment: Tides of Numenera'' uses "Tides" to represent the reactions a person inspires in their peers. Each Tide has a specific color and embodies a number of nuanced concepts that are associated with it. The composition of Tides a character has manipulated the most determines their Legacy, which roughly describes the way they have taken in life. Different Legacies may affect what bonuses and powers certain weapons and relics provide, as well as give a character special abilities and enhance certain skills.<ref name="Gameplay"/>

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
Tides of Numenera has a [[science fantasy]] setting. In the [[far future]] (one [[billion years]]), the rise and fall of countless civilizations have left Earth in a roughly [[Middle ages|medieval]] state, with most of humanity living in simple settlements, surrounded by technological relics of the mysterious past. The current age is called the "Ninth World" by its scholars, who believe that eight great ages existed and were destroyed, disappeared or left the [[Earth]] for unknown reasons before the present day, leaving ruins and various oddities and artifacts behind. These artifacts are known as the "numenera" and represent what is left of the science and technology of these past civilizations. Many of them are irreparably broken, but some are still able to function in ways that are beyond the level of understanding of most humans, who believe these objects to be [[Magic (supernatural)|magical]] in nature.<ref name="Story">{{cite web|url=http://tormentrpg.tumblr.com/story|title=More about the story&nbsp;– A World Unlike Any Other|publisher=[[inXile Entertainment]]|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

===Characters===
Character complexity and dialogue depth were identified among the primary elements of the ''Planescape: Torment'' legacy to be preserved and refined by the developers of ''Torment: Tides of Numenera''.<ref name="Gameplay"/>

The tormented nature of the game's protagonist, the Last Castoff, attracts other, similarly affected people. They will play a significant role in his or her story as friends and companions, or as powerful enemies.<ref name="Gameplay"/> The game contains seven companions in total: Aligern, Callistege, Erritis, Matkina, Oom, Tybir, and Rhin.

===Plot===
The protagonist of the story, known as the Last Castoff, is the final vessel for the consciousness of an ancient man, who managed to find a way to leave his physical body and be reborn in a new one, thus achieving a kind of immortality by means of the relics. The actions of this man, known as the Changing God to some, attracted the enmity of "The Sorrow" (renamed from "The Angel of Entropy" to reduce the potential to imply a religious role), who now seeks to destroy him and his creations. The Last Castoff, being one such "creation", is also targeted by the Sorrow, and must find their master before both are undone. To do so, the protagonist must explore the Ninth World, discovering other castoffs, making friends and enemies along the way. One means of such exploration are the "Meres"&nbsp;– artifacts that let their user gain control over the lives of other castoffs, and experience different worlds or dimensions through them. Through these travels the Last Castoff will leave their mark on the world&nbsp;– their Legacy&nbsp;– and will find an answer to the fundamental question of the story: What does one life matter?<ref name="Story"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Fraser|title=InXile talks Torment, story details, and crowd-funding|url=http://www.destructoid.com/inxile-talks-torment-story-details-and-crowd-funding-247907.phtml|accessdate=May 16, 2015|website=[[Destructoid]]|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

While the overall story varies wildly depending on personal preferences and specific interactions, the central storyline follows the Last Castoff as they search for a way to defeat or escape the Sorrow. They explore Sagus Cliffs after falling from a great height into a domed structure, destroying an artifact known as a resonance chamber that is believed to be capable saving the Last Castoff from the Sorrow. Finding another castoff, Matkina, The Last uses a Mere, a repository of memory to locate the entrance to Sanctuary. Using the Mere also alters the past, allowing Matkina to be healed of her mental damage. The Last finds Sanctuary, which the Changing God created as a hiding place from the Sorrow, where the Last finds a number of castoffs who represent both sides of the Eternal War: a conflict between followers of the Changing God, and followers of the First Castoff, who believe the God is selfish and malevolent. The Sorrow breaches Sanctuary after the Last is told that the resonance chamber will "defeat" the Sorrow by destroying every castoff in existence. After escaping the Sorrow through a portal to the Bloom, an apparition appears claiming to be the actual Changing God and attempts to possess the Last by force of will.

In a 2007 interview, designers [[Chris Avellone]] and [[Colin McComb]], who had worked on ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', stated that although a direct sequel was not considered because the game's story was over, they were open to the idea of a similar-themed ''Planescape'' game if they could gather most of the original development team and find an "understanding set of investors". This combination was deemed infeasible at the time.<ref name="RPGWatch2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/show/article?articleid=56|title=Tales of Torment, Part 2|last=Beekers|first=Thomas "Brother None"|date=August 1, 2007|publisher=RPGWatch|accessdate=March 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iqx3F0oa?url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/show/article?articleid=56|archivedate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Talks about creating a sequel with the help of a crowd funding platform resumed in 2012, but attempts to acquire a Planescape license from [[Wizards of the Coast]] failed.<ref name="EuroGamerPostMortem">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-22-planescape-torment-a-podcast-post-mortem-with-the-games-makers|title=Planescape: Torment: a podcast post-mortem with the game's makers|last= Purchese|first= Robert|date=August 24, 2012|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref> Later that year, Colin McComb joined inXile, which was at the time working on its successfully crowd funded ''[[Wasteland 2]]'' project.

In January 2013, inXile's CEO Brian Fargo announced that the [[spiritual successor]] to ''Planescape: Torment'' was in pre-production and would be set in the [[Numenera]] [[Campaign setting|RPG universe]] created by [[Monte Cook]]. Cook acted as one of the designers of the [[Planescape]] setting, and Fargo saw the Numenera setting as the natural place to continue the themes of the previous ''Torment'' title. Although the connections to its predecessor will not be relatively overt, due to licensing issues, it was noted that certain traditional RPG elements are relatively hard to copyright, and some elements of ''Planescape: Torment'' may make a reappearance. Development of the game began shortly after the acquisition of the ''Torment'' license, and various inXile staff will transition over to the Numenera team as production on ''Wasteland 2'' winds down.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Pleasure Without Planescape: A New Torment?|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/09/planescape-torment-sequel/#more-137374|date=January 9, 2013|newspaper=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=January 9, 2013}}</ref> In late January 2013, inXile confirmed the game's title as ''Torment: Tides of Numenera'', and announced that ''Planescape: Torment'' composer [[Mark Morgan (composer)|Mark Morgan]] would create the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunneley|first=Stephany|title=Torment: Tides of Numenera nabs original Planescape: Torment composer|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/01/29/torment-tides-of-numenera-nabs-original-planescape-torment-composer/|date=January 29, 2013|website=[[VG247]]|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref> The pre-production period was initially expected to continue until October 2013.

A [[Kickstarter]] campaign to [[Crowd funding|crowd fund]] ''Torment: Tides of Numenera'' was launched on March 6, 2013 with a {{US$|900,000|link=yes}} goal. Project director Kevin Saunders explained this choice of a funding source by stating that the traditional [[Video game publisher|publisher-based]] funding model is flawed because it forces the developer into attempting to appeal to an abstract [[target audience]], picked by the publisher. A crowd funding platform, on the other hand, would allow the developers to present their vision directly to potential buyers and determine its viability early on, making it a better choice for a mid-sized or smaller developer studio, like inXile.<ref name="ChangingTidesPolygon"/> The campaign had attracted several high-profile backers, such as the creator of ''[[Minecraft]]'', [[Markus Persson]], and chief of [[Razer USA]], [[Min-Liang Tan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Mara|first=Matthew|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2013/03/08/torment-tides-of-numenera-kickstarter-tops-funding-goal-in-six-hours/|title=Torment: Tides of Numenera Kickstarter tops funding goal in six hours|newspaper=[[Financial Post]]|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref>

''Torment: Tides of Numenera'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name="MCPC"/><ref name="MCPS4"/><ref name="MCXONE"/>

''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Ray Porreca scored the game a 7.5/10, arguing that "[its] various parts [...] come together in a solid package. Though it isn’t perfect, there’s no doubt that this is an RPG that will appeal to a specific type of person." Porecca criticized the combat, saying "[t]he turn-based system is functional, but even with a host of skills and companions to help pitch in, it still feels clunky". He, however, praised the worldbuilding and character creation and recommended it to "role-players keen on experiencing a game of consequences and twisted fantasy".<ref name="Destruct"/>

James Kozanitis's 4.5 out of 5 stars score on [[Game Revolution]] stated that "Whereas the fun in a game like For Honor comes from physically learning how to play, the fun in ''Tides of Numenera'' comes from achieving encyclopedic knowledge of a whole new universe through truly meaningful choices."<ref name="GameRev"/>
