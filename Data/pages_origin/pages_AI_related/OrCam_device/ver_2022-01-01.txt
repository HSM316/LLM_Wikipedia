'''OrCam devices''' such as ''OrCam MyEye'' are portable, artificial vision devices that allow visually impaired people<ref>The NYTimes article headlined "Simple Home Improvements for the Vision Impaired" (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/realestate/simple-home-improvements-for-the-vision-impaired.html) uses twice the words "visually impaired"</ref> to understand text and identify objects through audio feedback, describing what they are unable to see.

Reuters described an important part of how it works as "a wireless smartcamera" which, when attached outside eyeglass frames, can read and verbalize text, and also supermarket barcodes. This information is converted to spoken words and entered "into the userâ€™s ear." [[Face recognition|Face-recognition]]<ref name=TCrunch>{{cite web

==Devices==
OrCam Technologies Ltd has created three devices; OrCam MyEye 2.0, OrCam MyEye 1, and OrCam MyReader.

'''OrCam My Eye 2.0:'''                [[File:OrCam155.jpg|thumb|OrCam MyEye 2.0]]
* OrCam debuted the second-generation model, the OrCam MyEye 2.0 in December 2017.                                       
* About the size of a finger, the MyEye 2.0 is battery-powered, and has been compressed into a self-contained device.
* The device snaps onto any eyeglass frame magnetically.
* Orcam 2.0 is smaller and lighter (only 22.5 grams/0.8 ounces) with more functionality to restore independence to the visually impaired.<ref>{{cite news |website=CBSLocal.com (CBS, New York)

==Clinical Studies==
'''JAMA Ophthalmology:'''
In 2016 JAMA Ophthalmology conducted a study involving 12 legally blind participants to evaluate the usefulness of a portable artificial vision device (OrCam) for patients with low vision. The results showed that the OrCam device improved the patient's ability to perform tasks simulating those of daily living, such as reading a message on an electronic device, a newspaper article or a menu.<ref>{{cite news |title=Portable Artificial Vision Device May Be an Effective Aid for Patients with Low Vision - For The Media - JAMA Network |url=https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/portable-artificial-vision-device-may-be-an-effective-aid-for-patients-with-low-vision/ |work=media.jamanetwork.com}}</ref>

'''Wills Eye:'''
Wills Eye was a clinical study designed to measure the impact of the OrCam device on the quality of life of patients with End-stage Glaucoma. The conclusion was that OrCam, a novel artificial vision device using a mini-camera mounted on eyeglasses, allowed legally blind patients with end-stage glaucoma to read independently, subsequently improving their quality of life.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waisbourd |first1=Michael |last2=Ahmed |first2=Osama |last3=Siam |first3=Linda |last4=Moster |first4=Marlene R. |last5=Hark |first5=Lisa A. |last6=Katz |first6=L.

In 2018 a team headed by [[New York (State)]] Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]] introduced use of OrCam devices to ten individuals screened for what he termed "new Israeli technology that really makes a difference to the blind."<ref>{{cite web

While early language support was for English, French, German, Hebrew and Spanish,<ref name=AFB18/> others now available include Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish.

==History==
OrCam Technologies Ltd was founded in 2010 by Professor Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram. Before co-founding OrCam, the two in 1999 co-founded [[Mobileye]], an Israeli company that develops vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) providing warnings for collision prevention and mitigation, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017.
OrCam launched OrCam MyEye in 2013 after years of development and testing, and began selling it commercially in 
2015.<ref>[http://www.visionaware.org/blog/visionaware-blog/the-orcam-a-portable-wearable-visual-system-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-persons/12 Vision Aware]</ref>

In its early years, the company raised $22 million, $6 million of which came from Intel Capital. By 2014, Intel, which was also investing in ''Google Glass'', had invested $15 million in Orcam.<ref>{{cite web

===Marketing===
One outcome of initial marketing in the USA was that they "reached a deal with the California Department of Rehabilitation, ...qualifying blind and visually impaired state residents."
