== History ==
The journal was created in response to the machine learning explosion of the 2010s. It launched in January 2019, and its opening was met with controversy and boycotts within the machine learning research community due to opposition to Nature publishing the journal as closed access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/04/30/tech-giant-ai-researchers-boycott-nature-machine-intelligence-journal/#4eba55b45e01|title=Tech Giant AI Researchers Boycott Nature 'Machine Intelligence' Journal|website=[[Forbes]] }}</ref> To address this issue, now Nature Machine Intelligence gives authors an option to publish open access papers for an additional fee,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Open access at the Nature Portfolio {{!}} Nature Portfolio|url=https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access|access-date=2022-01-20|website=www.nature.com|language=en}}</ref> and "authors remain owners of the research reported, and the code and data supporting the main findings of an article should be openly available. Moreover, preprints are allowed, in fact encouraged, and a link to the preprint can be added below the abstract, visible to all readers."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=17 January 2020|title=Let's go 2020|journal=Nature Machine Intelligence|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1038/s42256-020-0144-y|issn=2522-5839|doi-access=free}}</ref>
