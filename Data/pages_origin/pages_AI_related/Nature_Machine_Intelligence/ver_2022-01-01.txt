'''''Nature Machine Intelligence''''' is a transformative (offering optional open access) [[scientific journal]] dedicated to covering [[Machine learning|machine learning]] and [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]]. It was created by [[Nature Research]] in response to the machine learning explosion of the 2010s. It launched in January 2019, and its opening was met with controversy and boycotts within the machine learning research community due to opposition to Nature publishing the journal as closed access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2018/04/30/tech-giant-ai-researchers-boycott-nature-machine-intelligence-journal/#4eba55b45e01|title=Tech Giant AI Researchers Boycott Nature 'Machine Intelligence' Journal}}</ref>
