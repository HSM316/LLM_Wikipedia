"'''Be Right Back'''" is the first episode of the second series of British science fiction [[anthology series]] ''[[Black Mirror]]''. It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]], directed by [[Owen Harris (director)|Owen Harris]], and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 11 February 2013.

The episode tells the story of Martha ([[Hayley Atwell]]), a young woman whose boyfriend Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) is killed in a car accident. As she mourns him, she discovers that technology now allows her to communicate with an artificial intelligence imitating Ash, and reluctantly decides to try it. "Be Right Back" had two sources of inspiration: the question of whether to delete a dead friend's phone number from one's contacts, and the idea that [[Twitter]] posts could be made by software mimicking dead people.

"Be Right Back" explores the theme of grief; it is a melancholy story similar to the previous episode, "[[The Entire History of You]]". The episode received positive reviews, with the performances of Atwell and Gleeson receiving universal acclaim. Some critics believe it to be the best episode of ''Black Mirror'', though the ending was met with criticism. Several real-life artificial intelligence products have been compared to the one shown in the episode, including a Luka chatbot that was partially inspired by the episode.

==Plot==
Martha Powell ([[Hayley Atwell]]) and Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) are a young couple who have moved to Ash's remote family house in the countryside. The day after moving in, Ash is killed while returning the hired van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah ([[Sinead Matthews]]) talks about a new online service which helped her in a similar situation. Martha yells at her, but Sarah signs Martha up anyway. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries it out. Using all of Ash's past online communications and [[social media]] profiles, the service creates a new virtual "Ash". Starting out with [[instant messaging]], Martha uploads more videos and photos and begins to talk with the artificial Ash over the phone. Martha takes it on countryside walks, talking to it constantly while neglecting her sister's messages and calls.

At a checkup, Martha hears her child's heartbeat, and on her way out accidentally drops her phone and temporarily loses contact with the artificial Ash. After consoling her, the artificial Ash tells her about the service's experimental stage. Following his instructions, Martha turns a blank, synthetic body into an android that looks almost exactly identical to Ash. From the moment the android is activated, Martha is uncomfortable and struggles to accept its existence. Despite the android satisfying her sexually, she is concerned by his inability to sleep and absence of Ash's negative personality traits. One night, she orders the robot Ash to leave and is annoyed that he does so, as the real Ash would have resisted. The next morning, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders him to jump off. As he begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. The android begs for its life. Martha screams.

Several years later, it is Martha's daughter's (Indira Ainger) birthday. Martha keeps the Ash android locked in the attic and only allows her daughter to see the android on weekends, but she makes an exception for her birthday. Her daughter chats away to the android while Martha stands at the bottom of the attic steps, and forces herself to join them.

"Be Right Back" was the first episode of the second series of ''[[Black Mirror]]'', produced by Zeppotron for [[Endemol]].

===Conception and writing===
The episode was written by series creator [[Charlie Brooker]]. A few months after the death of a person he knew, Brooker was removing unneeded contacts from his phone, and considered it to be "weirdly disrespectful" to delete their name. This idea later became an inspiration for "Be Right Back", along with another idea Brooker had when using [[Twitter]]: "what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts?"<ref name="TimeOut">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/tv-and-radio-guide/charlie-brooker-and-hayley-atwell-discuss-black-mirror|title=Charlie Brooker and Hayley Atwell discuss 'Black Mirror'|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|last=Tate|first=Gabriel|date=31 January 2013|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>

Prior to the writing of "Be Right Back", Brooker had read about the 1960s artificial intelligence program [[ELIZA]], and how the creator's secretary was engaged in a very personal conversation with ELIZA within minutes of first testing it.<ref name="BFI"/> Brooker also considered the inauthenticity of social media users, commenting in another interview that "I found myself being inauthentic on there and it reminded me of writing columns for a newspaper".<ref name="wired interview"/> In 2013, Brooker said that he rationed his Twitter usage as it caused him unhappiness.<ref name="TimeOut"/>

{{Quote box|quote=Several years ago, someone I knew died, and a few months later I was going through my phone, making some space by deleting numbers. It felt weirdly disrespectful to delete this person's name. Then last year after we had a baby I spent a lot of time up late and on Twitter, thinking: what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts? And if you're grieving, if you've got something you know isn't the person, but evokes enough memories to remind you of them, is that enough?|align=right|width=30%|author=[[Charlie Brooker]]|source=Interview with ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''.<ref name="TimeOut"/>}}

The episode was written shortly after Brooker had his first child with [[Konnie Huq]]. The couple took it in turns to watch the baby whilst the other slept, and Brooker wrote the episode during his shifts. The script was written quickly, and Brooker commented that having recently had a baby led the writing to be "more soppy and emotional" than it may otherwise have been.<ref name="ibm">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = Be Right Back | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>

In a [[British Film Institute]] panel, Brooker notes that the episode mirrors stages of [[internet dating]], progressing from text conversations to phone calls to real-life interactions, and believes the "biggest leap" to be the synthetic flesh version of Ash, while the rest is "not that far-fetched". Executive producer Annabel Jones compares the technology to [[mediumship]], as both are used for comfort.<ref name="BFI"/>

An unused idea for the episode was to emphasise the financial nature of the [[artificial intelligence]] company. Brooker says in an interview that "there was a point where she runs out of credit and has to top it up. I think that was even shot".<ref name="wired interview">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/black-mirror-technology-changing-lives|title=Charlie Brooker on where Black Mirror will take us next|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|last=Temperton|first=James|date=11 October 2016|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref> Another idea was for the episode to feature other characters and their android replacements of loved ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-interview-release-date-joe-wright-nosedive-shut-up-and-dance-a7372841.html|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker interview: 'I'm loathe to say this is the worst year ever because the next is coming'|date=21 October 2016|website=The Independent|access-date=21 October 2016}}</ref>

===Casting and filming===
[[File:Hayley Atwell.jpg|alt=photograph|thumb|upright|[[Hayley Atwell]] was cast as Martha in "Be Right Back".]]
Hayley Atwell, who plays Martha, was a fan of the first series of the show, calling it "inventive and very smart", so she asked her agent to get her a part in the second series. Atwell's first impression of the script was that it was "really poignant, but it still had the wit."<ref name="DS interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/black-mirror/interviews/a456189/black-mirror-returns-charlie-brooker-hayley-atwell-talk-series-two/|title='Black Mirror' returns: Charlie Brooker, Hayley Atwell talk series two|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|date=8 February 2013|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref> Asked in a 2013 interview, Atwell said that she was a heavy user of the internet.<ref name="TimeOut"/> Domhnall Gleeson plays Ash, and said in a 2018 interview that the role led him to try to use his phone less, with a stage direction where he frantically searches his phone particularly resonating with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a22961199/a-scene-in-black-mirror-changed-the-way-domhnall-gleeson-used-his-phone-forever/|title=A Scene In 'Black Mirror' Changed The Way Domhnall Gleeson Used His Phone Forever|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|last=Nicholson|first=Tom|date=9 April 2018|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref>

The episode was directed by [[Owen Harris (director)|Owen Harris]], who later directed the series-three episode "[[San Junipero]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/black-mirror-season-3-review/ |title=''Black Mirror'' Season 3 Review: The Future is Slightly Sunnier on Netflix |author=Adam Chitwood |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=4 October 2016 |access-date=4 October 2016 }}</ref> – an episode which Harris described as "strangely similar" to this one as both are "relationship-led".<ref name="Hollywood Harris">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/black-mirror-director-san-junipero-ending-spinoffs-season-4-947617|title='Black Mirror' Director Shares His Take on "San Junipero's" Ending and Ideas for a Spinoff|last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=23 November 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> Harris was drawn to "Be Right Back" by its "intimate" exploration of "grander themes of love and death and loss".<ref name="ibm"/> Brooker believes that Harris is "very good with performers" and "gravitates" towards ''Black Mirror'' episodes that are "more tender". Brooker praises Harris' "good eye for those authentic, bittersweet and painful moments."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/06/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-san-junipero-emmys-interview-season-4-news-1202062619/|title='Black Mirror' Creator Charlie Brooker On His Affinity For "Idea-Based Dramas" And What's To Come In Season 4|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|last=Grobar|first=Matt|date=22 June 2017|access-date=17 December 2017}}</ref> He describes that the story "on the one hand is about technology and on the other hand is about grief".<ref name="BFI">{{cite AV media|date=12 February 2013|title=BFI Q&A - Be Right Back|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFntkrwLAcQ|access-date=12 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131215540/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFntkrwLAcQ|archive-date=31 January 2014|medium=Video interview|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Vince Pope composed the episode's soundtrack.

Atwell was keen to keep Martha grounded and use [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] to emphasise Martha's grief and aid plausibility of the science fiction concepts. Harris describes Martha as a "[[girl next door]]" character, whose goal was to lead a "simple life" with Ash. Before filming, Atwell and Gleeson met at [[Dans le Noir]], a restaurant in which food is served in darkness.<ref name="ibm"/>

Harris wished to make the episode appear as if it could be possible in the near future, as if one could "walk into the [[Macintosh|Mac]] store tomorrow and it wouldn't be out of place to see people trialling software like this".<ref name="BFI"/> Production designer Joel Collins said in 2018 that the technology is "almost real now", but "seemed fantastical" at the time. The petrol station has "micro cars", which Collins suggests are [[electric car]]s that could be a part of a "simple, small, eco-friendly" future.<ref name="ibm"/> A touch-screen easel is shown briefly in the episode. Brooker commented that "the design team had a field day with that easel" and that they suggested copyrighting the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/22/charlie-brooker-black-mirror_n_6508790.html|title='Black Mirror' Intends To 'Actively Unsettle' Audiences, But It's Not Technology That You Should Fear|last=Duca|first=Lauren|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=22 January 2015|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref> Brooker wished to avoid a trope of "histrionic" technology interfaces in television, using more subtle cues such as Martha deleting an email on her touch-free laptop with a simple hand movement. One email sent to Martha is a targeted advertisement for books about dealing with grief.<ref name="New Yorker">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror|title=The Speculative Dread of "Black Mirror"|last=Harvey|first=Giles|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=28 November 2016|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>

Harris has said that different endings were discussed, but that "I think we pretty much ended up where we'd started". Harris suggested a family dinner downstairs, but Brooker and Jones preferred for Martha to allow her daughter to see Ash once per week. Atwell described the ending as "very pessimistic", calling her character "numb" and perhaps "medicated". During filming for the final scene, Gleeson had begun to grow a beard for another project; though there was debate over whether the android could have a beard to mark the passage of time, it was removed in editing. This was a difficult and expensive process, as Ash has to talk and walk through shadows and light.<ref name="ibm"/>

==Analysis==
"Be Right Back" has grief as a central concept, according to Emily Yoshida of ''[[Grantland]]'' and [[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name="grantland">{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-4-be-right-back-death-and-the-realdoll/|title=Black Mirror Episode 4, 'Be Right Back': Death and the RealDoll|work=[[Grantland]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=4 December 2013|access-date=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="ew ranking"/> Luke Owen of ''Flickering Myth'' summarised the episode as a "sombre, low-key and all together depressing affair about grief and how people deal with it in different ways",<ref name="flickering myth"/> with Giles Harvey of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commenting on the episode's exploration of postmodern grief possibilities, suggesting that a targeted email to Martha about grief "stands for an accumulation of such intrusive moments—the death of solitude by a thousand digital cuts".<ref name="New Yorker"/> Other themes in the episode are also present. Ryan Lambie of ''Den of Geek'' believed the episode's theme to be "technology's effects on relationships".<ref name="dog review"/> Johnston noted that in addition to grief, the episode explores how people behave in "increasingly mediated public spaces".<ref name="boston globe"/>

The episode was described by Brooker as "a ghost story"<ref name="wired interview"/> and many critics have commented on its tone. David Sims of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described it as a "spare, haunting piece",<ref name="avclub"/> though Megan Logan of ''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]'' said that whilst episode is tragic it does contain a "deep-seated optimism".<ref name="inverse" /> Focusing on the interconnection of content and tone, Charles Bramesco of ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'' wrote that the episode amalgamates a "cerebral sci-fi thought [experiment]" and a "sentimental core", making it a "high-concept tearjerker".<ref name="vulture ranking"/> Tom Sutcliffe of ''[[The Independent]]'' connected the episode's tone to a development in Brooker's writing since his marriage and first child, calling it "tender" and "wistful".<ref name="independent">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/tv-review-black-mirror-channel-4-charlie-brookers-writing-has-changed-since-he-became-a-husband-and-8490799.html|title=TV review: Black Mirror, Channel 4 - Charlie Brooker's writing has changed since he became a husband and a father|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|date=12 February 2013|access-date=17 December 2017}}</ref>

Unlike past episodes of ''Black Mirror'', "Be Right Back" features a character beginning to use a technology, rather than one who is used to it.<ref name="grantland"/> According to Daniel M. Swain of ''[[HuffPost]]'', the episode is a "powerful reminder to the soullessness of social media",<ref name="huffpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/daniel-m-swain/what-be-right-back-says-about-us-_b_2665568.html|title=What Black Mirror Episode Be Right Back Says About Us and Technology|work=[[HuffPost]]|last=Swain|first=Daniel M.|date=12 February 2013|access-date=17 October 2014}}</ref> and Sameer Rahim of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the episode contains ideas about the falsity of social media personas and growing addiction to the internet.<ref name="tele"/> Roxanne Sancto of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' said the episode "examines our own mortality and our desire to play God", and demonstrates how humans have a "desperate need to reverse a natural and necessary part of life without considering the consequences".<ref name=paste>{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/10/every-episode-of-black-mirror-so-far-ranked.html | title=Every Episode of Black Mirror So Far, Ranked | author=Sancto, Roxanne | date=20 October 2016 | website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] | access-date=24 December 2017}}</ref>

Other critics posed their thoughts more on the relationship in the episode, and suggested it was relationship-led. According to Lambie, Ash is "an affectionate boyfriend" and Martha is "blissfully in love", though Ash is easily distracted by his phone; Martha and Ash only appear together in a few scenes, but we see their love through "little in-jokes, shared love of cheesy 70s tunes and childhood memories".<ref name="dog review"/> Bojalad wrote that they are "one of the most realistically comfortable and happy couples" in the series,<ref name="dog Bojalad"/> and Owen agreed, writing that though the relationship has little screentime, the audience feel "an instant connection with them".<ref name="flickering myth"/> These scenes are later mirrored: examples include the android Ash disliking the [[Bee Gees]] and engaging in sex that feels "robotic".<ref name="DS"/> Ash's cause of death is "neither clear nor important", though Sims and Sancto thought that it relates to him checking his phone while driving.<ref name="avclub"/><ref name="paste"/>

Yoshida said that the presence of the android Ash is "menacing" though he has a "docile" demeanour, further commenting that Martha is unable to resist him, despite her repulsion at the situation.<ref name="grantland"/> Sims stated that the replica of Ash is "self-aware", as it "knows it cannot replace Ash fully". Sims also described the robotic Ash as "like a lost puppy" who follows Martha obediently.<ref name="avclub"/> Swain noted this non-humanness, too, writing that though the android Ash is witty, his personality lacks meaning,<ref name="huffpost"/> with Morgan Jeffery of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' calling him "hollow" and commenting that he is missing "so much of what made Ash the man he was".<ref name="DS"/> Logan said the episode is about "the intangibles of humanness that make up the people we love".<ref name="inverse"/> Sutcliffe believed the robotic Ash fails as a replacement because humans miss their loved ones' "sourness" as well as their "sweetness".<ref name="independent"/>

===Comparisons to other media===
[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|alt=Black and white image of a monstrous man with a bolt through his neck|thumb|upright|The episode has been compared to Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', with the artificial Ash paralleling [[Frankenstein's monster]].]]
In contrast to the previous series opener, "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]", Brooker described "Be Right Back" as "more earnest than people might expect" as well as "melancholy" and "very intimate and personal".<ref name="DS interview"/> Lambie made similar comments.<ref name="dog review"/> Lambie and Jeffery both compared the episode to "The Entire History of You", an episode from the first series written by [[Jesse Armstrong]].<ref name="dog review"/><ref name="DS"/> Yoshida noted that "The Entire History of You" begins with Liam obsessing over a job interview, which he is able to replay through his grain device. Yoshida compared his inability to drop the matter with Martha's choice to "forever nurse herself on a slow drip of delayed acceptance" by replacing Ash with an android.<ref name="grantland"/> Maura Johnston of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said that both episodes have memory as a central concept and "[play] on the ideas of love and the ideal".<ref name="boston globe">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2014/12/05/the-warped-perfect-world-black-mirror/mwTDmWfyGOdfKva40hrlgO/story.html|title=The warped, perfect world of 'Black Mirror'|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|last=Johnston|first=Maura|date=5 December 2014|access-date=17 December 2017}}</ref>

===Comparisons to AI technology===
In 2015, Luka co-founder Eugenia Kuyda used her AI startup resources to build an online service using [[chat log]]s from her late friend Roman Mazurenko; "Be Right Back" was one of the sources of inspiration for the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2016/10/06/black-mirror-woman-texting-dead-friend/|title='Black Mirror' Is Real: A Woman Is Texting Her Dead Friend — And You Can, Too!|work=Decider|publisher=[[New York Post]]|last=O'Keefe|first=Meghan|date=6 October 2016|access-date=5 December 2017}}</ref> Having seen the episode after her friend's death, she questioned of the concept: "Is it letting go, by forcing you to actually feel everything? Or is it just having a dead person in your attic?"
