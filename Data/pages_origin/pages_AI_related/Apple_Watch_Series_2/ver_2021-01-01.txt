== Features ==
Apple Watch Series 2 introduces water resistance at a rating of 50 meters. It can keep track of the number of laps and distance during Swimming workouts. During swimming, the touch function can be manually disabled with 'Underwater mode'. Once this is turned off, by rotating the Digital Crown continuously, it uses the speaker to expel residual water through a series of 10 vibrations. The Apple Watch Series 2 has a built-in GPS system.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine |last = McGarry |first = Caitlyn |title = Apple Watch Series 2 Review: A Faster, Brighter Fitness Machine |magazine = Macworld |edition = Digital |volume = 33 |issue = 11 |date = November 2016 |pages = 113–120 |via = EBSCOhost |url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=119028546&site=ehost-live&scope=site }}</ref> The most recently used apps are saved in the background, so apps and information load faster.

== Confusion ==
The Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 watches were released at the same time and have faster processors than the first-generation model, but the Series 2 has GPS, waterproofing for swimming workouts, and has a 1000-nit display. However, with the exception of the faster processor, the Series 1 makes little to no changes from the 1st generation. The first-generation Apple Watch is commonly called the Series 0 by the surrounding communities, but Apple itself doesn't use this name, instead referring to the Series 0 as "Apple Watch (1st generation)".
