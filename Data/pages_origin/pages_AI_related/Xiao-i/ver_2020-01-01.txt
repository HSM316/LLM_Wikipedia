==History==
Xiao-i was founded in 2001 in Shanghai and debuted its first chatbot in 2004 over Microsoft Network’s (MSN) messaging platform. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digfingroup.com/xiaoi/|title=How Xiao-i’s robot became the voice of China’s banks|first=Larissa|last=Ku|date=17 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>Xiao-i’s first development phase focused on natural language processing(NLP) with the aim of enhancing the customer experience with AI technology and applications.

In 2008, Xiao-i began to collaborate with its first corporate client Jiangsu Mobile to develop an intelligent customer service robot that provided service to the telecommunications company’s customers through its website and addressed customer queries over mobile phone text messaging<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2015-01/13/content_19301903_9.htm|title=The rise of robot waiter|website=China Daily}}</ref>.
