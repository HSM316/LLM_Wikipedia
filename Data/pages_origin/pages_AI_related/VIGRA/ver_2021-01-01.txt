'''VIGRA'''<ref>{{cite book |author=Köthe U |title=Generische Programmierung für die Bildverarbeitung |publisher=Universität Hamburg |year=2000 |isbn=3-8311-0239-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Jähne B, Haußecker H, Geißler P |title=Reusable Software in Computer Vision |publisher=Academic Press |year=1999 |volume=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Köthe U |title=STL-Style Generic Programming with Images |journal=C++ Report Magazine |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2000}}</ref> is the abbreviation for "'''Vision with Generic Algorithms'''". It is a free [[open-source software|open-source]] [[computer vision]] library which focuses on customizable algorithms and [[data structures]]. VIGRA component can be easily adapted to specific needs of target application without compromising execution speed, by using template techniques similar to those in the [[Standard Template Library|C++ Standard Template Library]].

==Features==
VIGRA is cross-platform, with working builds on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[OpenBSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/graphics/vigra|via=[[GitHub]]|publisher=[[OpenBSD]]|title=ports/graphics/vigra at master - openbsd/ports}}</ref> Since version 1.7.1, VIGRA provides [[Python (programming language)|Python]] bindings based on [[numpy]] framework.

==History==
VIGRA was originally designed and implemented by scientists at
[[University of Hamburg]] faculty of computer science; its core maintainers are now working at Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing (HCI) [[University of Heidelberg]]. In the meantime, many developers have contributed to the project.

==Application==
[[CellCognition]] and [[ilastik]] uses VIGRA computer vision library.

[[OpenOffice.org]] uses VIGRA as part of its headless software rendering backend; [[LibreOffice]] does so until version 5.2.
