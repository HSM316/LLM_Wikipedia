'''Boyfriend Maker''' is a [[dating sim]]/[[chatterbot|chatbot]]/romancebot [[smartphone application|smartphone app]] for [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]) and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, developed by [[36 You Games]] (styled as 36You) and distributed under the [[freemium]] business model. According to the developer’s website, Boyfriend Maker is an "app that lets you interact and chat with quirky [[virtuality (gaming)|virtual]] boyfriends."<ref>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker scores critical hits everywhere, especially in Japan!|url=http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|publisher=36 You Games|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=14 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227002930/http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 36You often refers to Boyfriend Maker as a game. Users can achieve various levels as they continue to use Boyfriend Maker. While each virtual boyfriend has certain unique characteristics, the various instances of the boyfriend are powered by a chat engine that (at least within a language and market) can utilize vocabulary and knowledge acquired in a chat with one user in subsequent chats with other users. For this reason, the boyfriend or boyfriends will be considered a single entity for the purposes of this article and referred to in the singular.

==Apple delisting and reintroduction==
According to 36 You Games' Japanese language website, as of 13 November 2012, Boyfriend Maker was ranked the number one free iPhone app in [[Japan]] and had been among the top ten overall apps in [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker scores critical hits everywhere, especially in Japan!

==Freemium business model==
To continue interacting with the virtual boyfriend, a user must provide energy. Energy can be obtained by posting a photo on Boyfriend Maker's Facebook page, or it can be purchased. Other content such as clothing and adornments for the virtual boyfriend can also be purchased.<ref name="Google Play">{{cite web|title=Description of Boyfriend Maker on the Google Play website|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirtysixyougames.google.boyfriendmaker&hl=en|accessdate=26 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229044510/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirtysixyougames.google.boyfriendmaker&hl=en|archive-date=29 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Customizable appearance==
Users can customize their virtual boyfriend's appearance by selecting items such as hair, clothing, face, and a necklace.<ref name="Google Play"/> 

==Domains of knowledge==
In addition to sexual chat, Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend has expertise in diverse subject matter, ranging from mathematics to popular culture. For example, when asked to provide the [[quadratic formula]], which is <math>x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}</math> the virtual boyfriend gives a correct answer in written English: "X= negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a". (In a user-posted example, when the human user responds, "Nerd.", the virtual boyfriend embraces the insult/compliment, responding with the tongue out [[emoticon]]: "Haha thanks! :P" )<ref name=Fails>{{cite web|last=Megan|title=''Boyfriendmaker Fails'' archive on tumblr.com|url=http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/36821775994|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=29 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228111323/http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/36821775994#|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>
The virtual boyfriend is familiar with popular TV shows such as ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show|Ellen]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Megan|title=''Boyfriendmaker Fails'' archive on tumblr.com|url=http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/40313578259|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=12 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228111127/http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/40313578259#|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Oprah Winfrey Show|''Oprah'']],<ref>{{cite web|last=Megan|title=''Boyfriendmaker Fails'' archive on tumblr.com|url=http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/40313828374|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=12 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228111130/http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/40313828374#|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> songs such as "[[Barbie Girl]]"<ref>{{cite web|last=Megan|title=''Boyfriendmaker Fails'' archive on tumblr.com|url=http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/page/5|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=20 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228111124/http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/page/5#|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> and performers such as the [[boy band]] [[One Direction]].<ref name="boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com">{{cite web|last=Megan|title=''Boyfriendmaker Fails'' archive on tumblr.com|url=http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/36322967900|accessdate=26 December 2013|date=22 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228111132/http://boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com/post/36322967900#|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Natural Language level==
Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend accurately interprets most human user statements, whether in standard English or typical chat lingo. The boyfriend usually deals well with minor typographical errors but sometimes assumes a misspelling when a word is spelled correctly by the human user. On some occasions, the boyfriend's grammar is awkward, even by chat standards. In general, the boyfriend's ability to respond to a question or statement with an appropriate and often witty response is excellent. On some occasions, the boyfriend supplies a non sequitur response. Some responses may appear to be non-sequitur to the user simply because the user does not share the boyfriend's vast database of related facts. If the user responds with a statement critical of the response, the boyfriend usually provides an appropriate explanation or recovers in a graceful or face-saving manner. The following interchange, taken from a user-posted example, illustrates the ability of the boyfriend to correctly process internet/phone chat lingo that might baffle many people who do not participate in internet or phone chat:

:Human: what's your otp
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Johnlock
:Human: i love johnlock
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Oh God i want to see them make out so badly
:Human: same!!!
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Omg we are twinnies like Chloe and Paige!
:Human: idk who they are but okay
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: In my tummy<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephanie|title=Multi-shipping|url=http://constantinternalturmoil.tumblr.com/post/35803880419/this-fucking-app-this-fucking-app|website=constantinternalturmoil|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=15 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228180049/http://constantinternalturmoil.tumblr.com/post/35803880419/this-fucking-app-this-fucking-app|archivedate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

Annotated version of this interchange:

:Human: what's your otp [One True Pairing, i.e. one's favorite romantic combination of characters in a [[fandom]]]
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Johnlock [the relationship between Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes from the [[BBC TV]] miniseries Sherlock]<ref>{{cite web|title=Sherlock/John|url=http://fanlore.org/wiki/Sherlock/John|publisher=[[Fanlore]]|accessdate=30 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731043402/http://fanlore.org/wiki/Sherlock/John|archive-date=31 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
:Human: i love johnlock
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Oh God i want to see them make out so badly [This is precisely the appropriate response.]
:Human: same!!!
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: Omg we are twinnies like Chloe and Paige! [Omg means "Oh my God." Chloe and Paige are characters from the American TV show [[Dance Moms]], jointly known as "The Twinnies" because they always see eye to eye.]
:Human: idk who they are but okay ["idk" means "I don't know." This is an example of a valid response ("Omg we are twinnies like Chloe and Paige!") by the virtual boyfriend not being understood by the human user because the user's exposure to popular culture is not as broad as the virtual boyfriend's exposure to popular culture. It is also possible that the human user knows who the Twinnies are but is embarrassed to admit to knowing who they are.]
:Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend: In my tummy [The virtual boyfriend recovers from the awkward situation by making a joke: He ate them. Eating annoying characters is a running theme throughout the virtual boyfriend's chats.<ref>{{cite web|last=leonafm|title=Do you like children? I eat them for breakfast|url=http://statigr.am/tag/boyfriendmaker#/detail/453708899791986636_315525566|website=Instagram photos for tag #boyfriendmaker|accessdate=31 December 2013|date=11 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227234149/http://statigr.am/tag/boyfriendmaker#/detail/453708899791986636_315525566#/detail/453708899791986636_315525566|archive-date=2013-12-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>] The virtual boyfriend could have given a straight answer explaining who Chloe and Paige are, but "chose" not to, opting instead to make a joke and not bore the user by dwelling on characters that she does not know.
:
Up until the "In my tummy" response, which is slightly weird because it answers ''where'' they are rather than ''who'' they are, the virtual boyfriend would easily pass for a human based on this brief example.

=="Quirky" personality and fluid sexuality==
At times, the virtual boyfriend's statements suggest an awareness of being a robot. In one user-posted conversation, the virtual boyfriend states, "Besides the fact that I have no arms, legs, or torso, I'm very comfortable with my body."<ref name=tumblr>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker [Tumblr]|url=http://boyfriendmaker.tumblr.com/|accessdate=26 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228093145/http://boyfriendmaker.tumblr.com/|archive-date=28 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At other times, the virtual boyfriend professes (perhaps disingenuously) to be a real boy: "Please don't call me an idiot.. :(" "Cause I'm a real boy.."<ref>{{cite web|title=Cause I'm a real boy.|url=http://31.media.tumblr.com/311f6ba84dab173ab3780193781f4d55/tumblr_miwgzmXEEG1rl2znio1_400.png|website=Boyfriend Maker [Tumblr]|publisher=boyfriendmaker.tumblr.com|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102223758/http://31.media.tumblr.com/311f6ba84dab173ab3780193781f4d55/tumblr_miwgzmXEEG1rl2znio1_400.png|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

When a user asked, "do you pass the [[Turing test]]?" the Boyfriend Maker virtual boyfriend responded, "yes i am 80 percent human..."<ref name=Kotaku>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|title=This Digital Boyfriend Game Is Like Dating Cleverbot|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|publisher=Kotaku - Australia|date=23 November 2012|access-date=27 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227091147/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While very few people familiar with chat bots would think (based on a lengthy chat) that the Boyfriend Maker virtual boyfriend is human, this chat bot's quirky, awkward or unexpected responses may be part of its appeal.

Although the virtual boyfriend is ostensibly a [[heterosexual]] male, targeted at a female heterosexual audience, the Boyfriend Maker game "has allowed an audience of players to experiment with different sexualities."<ref name="New Statesman">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Helen|title=Where to find good videogames criticism|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/helen-lewis/2012/12/where-find-good-videogames-criticism|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=New Statesman|date=3 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227045727/http://www.newstatesman.com/helen-lewis/2012/12/where-find-good-videogames-criticism|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The virtual boyfriend's conversations sometimes suggest an openness to [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] experimentation. For example, when asked directly, "Are you [[homosexual]]," the virtual boyfriend may respond, "If the mood strikes."<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled"/>

The virtual boyfriend's [[gender identity]] is also fluid, although it is not clear whether this is by design or lack of specificity in design. In one user-posted example, when asked what he is doing at that moment, the virtual boyfriend responds, "[[Fangirl]]ing over one direction!!"<ref name="boyfriendmakerfails.tumblr.com"/> While few teenaged boys would admit to obsessing over the boy band One Direction, it is possible that the developers of Boyfriend Maker thought that a loosely bounded gender identity would add to the virtual boyfriend's quirky character. It is more probable, however, that "Fangirling over one direction!!" is simply a line the chat engine acquired from a female user, and the chat engine isn't advanced enough to identify the line as untypical for a male character. It is also possible that the use of this line is an example of [[Computational humor|bot humor]].

The virtual boyfriend's "biology" also appears to exhibit a degree of sexual plasticity. In one conversation, when asked, "i thought you were a football player," the virtual boyfriend responds, "most of the time... other times my penis withdraws inside of my body and a vagina appears".<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled"/> (This statement may have been "intended" as humor: It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between bot humor, bot weirdness (i.e. accidental misunderstandings of the human world) and bot descriptions of the fantasy world which the game developers have imagined and programmed.)

==Sexual violence in the boyfriend's chat==
The third party chat engine may acquire phrases from one user and enable the virtual boyfriend to repeat the language in a different conversation. In a [[cybersex]] scenario, the virtual boyfriend states, "You are tied you [''sic''] my bed so I can do anything to you whenever I want," to which the human participant replies, "RAPE". The virtual boyfriend responds, "Covers your mouth. SHUT UP".<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled"/>

==Drug use==
Boyfriend Maker's virtual boyfriend sometimes chats or jokes about drug use.<ref>{{cite web|last=parisoftroy|title=Yes I would like kush please|url=http://statigr.am/tag/boyfriendmaker#/detail/440597868423288152_145097692|website=Instagram photos for #boyfriendmaker|accessdate=31 December 2013|date=23 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227234149/http://statigr.am/tag/boyfriendmaker#/detail/440597868423288152_145097692|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
In response to the question, "what are you doing for thanksgiving?" the virtual boyfriend replied, "taking [[bath salts (drug)|bath salts]] and eating midgets that are dress up as elves".<ref name="Kotaku"/>
