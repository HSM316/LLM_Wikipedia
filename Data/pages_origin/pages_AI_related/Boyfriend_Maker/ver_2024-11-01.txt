'''Boyfriend Maker''' is a [[dating sim]], romance [[chatbot]] [[smartphone application|smartphone app]] for [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]) and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, developed by Japanese<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.36you.com/ |title=Home |website=36you.com}}</ref> studio [[36 You Games]] (styled as 36You) and distributed under the [[freemium]] business model. Boyfriend Maker incorporated advanced artificial intelligence chat technology a decade before products such as [[ChatGPT]]. According to the developer's website, Boyfriend Maker is an "app that lets you interact and chat with quirky [[virtuality (gaming)|virtual]] boyfriends".<ref>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker scores critical hits everywhere, especially in Japan!|url=http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|publisher=36 You Games|access-date=26 December 2013|date=14 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227002930/http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Kotaku>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|title=This Digital Boyfriend Game Is Like Dating Cleverbot|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|publisher=Kotaku - Australia|date=23 November 2012|access-date=27 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227091147/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While each virtual boyfriend has certain unique characteristics, the various instances of the boyfriend are powered by a chat engine, that (at least within a language and market) can utilise vocabulary and knowledge acquired in a chat with one user in subsequent chats with other users.

==Gameplay==
Users gain [[experience point]]s and in-game coins. Users can customize their virtual boyfriend's appearance by selecting items such as hair, clothing, face, and a necklace.

==Apple delisting and reintroduction==
In late November 2012, the original iOS Boyfriend Maker app was delisted from the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] due to "[[Ribaldry|ribald]]" chat, according to the New York Times.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hawgood|first=Alex|title='Interactive' Gets a New Meaning: Sex Toys and Cybersex Are Enhanced by New Technology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/26/fashion/Sex-toys-cybersex-high-tech.html?_r=0|access-date=26 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228112507/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/26/fashion/Sex-toys-cybersex-high-tech.html?_r=0|archive-date=28 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="VentureBeat BFM sneaks">{{cite news|last=Koetsier|first=John|title=Boyfriend Maker sneaks violent sexual content — including references to pedophilia — onto Apple's app store|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/11/23/boyfriend-maker-sneaks-violent-sexual-content-including-references-to-pedophilia-onto-apples-app-store/|access-date=26 December 2013|newspaper=Venture Beat|date=23 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209151811/http://venturebeat.com/2012/11/23/boyfriend-maker-sneaks-violent-sexual-content-including-references-to-pedophilia-onto-apples-app-store/|archive-date=9 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Boyfriend Maker was removed by Apple due to "reports of references to violent sexual acts and pedophilia".<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled">{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker gets pulled from App Store for references to paedophilia|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/26/3692230/boyfriend-maker-gets-pulled-from-app-store-for-references-to|last=Gera|first=Emily|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|access-date=26 December 2013|date=26 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226235739/http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/26/3692230/boyfriend-maker-gets-pulled-from-app-store-for-references-to|archive-date=26 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Boyfriend Maker had an age rating of 4+, even though the chat bot "responds with often strange and explicit text unsuitable for young children".<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Keith|title=UPDATE: Virtual dating app Boyfriend Maker accused of violent sexual content|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/Boyfriend+Maker/news.asp?c=46817|access-date=27 December 2013|date=23 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227032531/http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/Boyfriend+Maker/news.asp?c=46817|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

User-posted chat excerpts indicate that the virtual boyfriend would sometimes transition abruptly to sexual chat in response to a seemingly innocent question.<ref>{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Aja|title=The "Boyfriend Maker" app is as horrifying as you'd expect|url=http://www.dailydot.com/culture/racist-sexual-horrifying-boyfriend-maker-app/|publisher=The Daily Dot|access-date=27 December 2013|date=28 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227094847/http://www.dailydot.com/culture/racist-sexual-horrifying-boyfriend-maker-app/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In one user-posted example, in response to the question, "what kind of wedding cake will we have" the boyfriend responds, "a good sex ima be on top of u u gonna ride oon me bitin the pillow gurrl ima fuck da shit out of u".<ref>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker Tumblr|url=http://25.media.tumblr.com/6e8d7ebfe50515906ab3c3ac7b0d73bf/tumblr_mki7egj2qU1rl2znio1_500.jpg|publisher=boyfriendmaker.tumblr.com|access-date=27 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525153838/http://25.media.tumblr.com/6e8d7ebfe50515906ab3c3ac7b0d73bf/tumblr_mki7egj2qU1rl2znio1_500.jpg|archive-date=25 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The developer's use of the [[SimSimi]]-created third-party chat engine may be responsible for the sexual text.<ref name="polygon BFM-pulled" /> As the virtual boyfriend converses with human users, the SimSimi chat engine acquires vocabulary from users of the game and applies this "learned" vocabulary in chats with other users.

In April 2013, a detuned and presumably tamer version of the app, titled Boyfriend Plus, was permitted on Apple's App Store.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Keith|title=With a new age rating, 'sexually explicit' Boyfriend Maker makes App Store return: Rebranded as Boyfriend Plus|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Boyfriend+Plus/news.asp?c=50304|publisher=Pocket Gamer|access-date=26 December 2013|date=23 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226223340/http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Boyfriend+Plus/news.asp?c=50304|archive-date=26 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
