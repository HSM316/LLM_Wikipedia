'''Boyfriend Maker''' is a [[dating sim]], [[chatbot]], romance bot [[smartphone application|smartphone app]] for [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]) and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, developed by Japanese<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.36you.com/ |title=Home |website=36you.com}}</ref> studio [[36 You Games]] (styled as 36You) and distributed under the [[freemium]] business model. According to the developer's website, Boyfriend Maker is an "app that lets you interact and chat with quirky [[virtuality (gaming)|virtual]] boyfriends".<ref>{{cite web|title=Boyfriend Maker scores critical hits everywhere, especially in Japan!|url=http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|publisher=36 You Games|access-date=26 December 2013|date=14 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227002930/http://www.36you.com/boyfriend-maker-scores-critical-hits-everywhere-especially-in-japan/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Kotaku>{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|title=This Digital Boyfriend Game Is Like Dating Cleverbot|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|publisher=Kotaku - Australia|date=23 November 2012|access-date=27 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227091147/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/11/this-digital-boyfriend-game-is-like-dating-cleverbot/|archive-date=27 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Boyfriend Maker functions in a similar way as a game, since users can achieve various levels as they continue using the app. While each virtual boyfriend has certain unique characteristics, the various instances of the boyfriend are powered by a chat engine that (at least within a language and market) can utilise vocabulary and knowledge acquired in a chat with one user in subsequent chats with other users.

==Apple delisting and reintroduction==

The chat engine might also employ lines harvested from human-human chat logs, song lyrics, movies or TV shows. In April, 2013, a detuned and presumably tamer version of the app, titled Boyfriend Plus, was permitted on Apple's App Store.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Keith|title=With a new age rating, 'sexually explicit' Boyfriend Maker makes App Store return: Rebranded as Boyfriend Plus|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Boyfriend+Plus/news.asp?c=50304|publisher=Pocket Gamer|access-date=26 December 2013|date=23 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226223340/http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Boyfriend+Plus/news.asp?c=50304|archive-date=26 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
