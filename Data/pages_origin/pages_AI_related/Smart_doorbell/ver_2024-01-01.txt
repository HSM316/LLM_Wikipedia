A '''smart doorbell''' is an internet-connected [[doorbell]] that notifies the home owner on his or her device (smartphone or any other gadget) when a visitor arrives at the door. It activates when the visitor presses the button of the doorbell, or alternatively, when the doorbell senses a visitor with its built-in [[motion sensor]]s. The smart doorbell lets the home owner use a smartphone app to watch and talk with the visitor by using the doorbell's built-in high-definition infrared camera and microphone. They can be either battery operated or wired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canitec.org/best-peephole-camera-reviews-and-buying-guide/ |title=Best Peephole Cameras and Buying Guide |website=canitec.org |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2017-01-10 |archive-date=2021-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828081045/https://www.canitec.org/best-peephole-camera-reviews-and-buying-guide/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some smart doorbells also allow the user to open the door remotely using a [[smart lock]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-smart-doorbell-and-which-should-you-buy/ |title=What Is A Smart Doorbell, And Which Should You Buy? |website=Makeuseof.com |date=2015-06-10 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref>

One of the earliest smart doorbells that entered to the market is the [[Ring Video Doorbell]] which was created by entrepreneur [[Jamie Siminoff]] in 2013. Since then, several more smart doorbells have been introduced to the market, some of them with additional, unique features. Another major one is [[Google Nest#Nest Hello|Nest Hello]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safewise.com/resources/smart-doorbell-buyers-guide |title=8 Best Smart Doorbells for Your Home |website=SafeWise.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shu |first=Les |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/smartbell-doorbell/ |title=Smartbell is a smartphone-based doorbell solution for your home |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ding-smart-doorbell-not-smart-good/ |title=Ding Is a Smart Doorbellâ€”But Not Too Smart for Its Own Good |website=Wired.com |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/358684/the-best-video-doorbells |title=The Best Video Doorbells for 2019 |website=pcmag.com}}</ref>

==Privacy issues==
Concerns regarding the security of the smart doorbells have been raised. Researchers at Pen Test Partners in the UK have analyzed the Ring smart doorbell and concluded that it is possible for an attacker to gain access to the homeowner's wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2016/01/14/your-smart-doorbell-may-let-in-unwanted-visitors/ |title=Your smart doorbell may let in unwanted visitors |website=Betanews.com |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> In another security issue that had been observed, a mix-up of two databases allowed some users of the Ring smart doorbell to view live footage from complete strangers' front porches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grahamcluley.com/ring-smart-doorbell-privacy/ |title="Smart" doorbell bug exposes video footage from strangers' homes |website=Grahamcluley.com |date=2016-05-17 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref>
