The novel was released in Polish on March 10, 2015, and shortly afterward, on March 24 that year, in English (translated by Stanley Bill).

The novel has inspired two [[Netflix]] [[Netflix original series|original series]]: the 2020 [[Belgians|Belgian language]] ''[[Into the Night (TV series)|Into the Night]]'', and its 2022 [[Turkish language]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Into the Deep (TV series)|Into the Deep]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-announces-the-first-belgian-original-series-into-the-night|title=Netflix Announces The First Belgian Original Series - ''Into the Night''|website=Netflix Media Center|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last2=Eyiakkan|last1=Melisa|first2=Ener|first1=Yasemin|title=Netflix Ramping Up Investment In Turkey With 10 New Exhilarating Projects|url=https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-ramping-up-investment-in-turkey-with-10-new-exhilarating-projects|work=[[Netflix Media Center]]|date=October 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Plot==
The novel presents a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]], [[cyberpunk]] vision of Earth where biological life has been wiped out, inhabited by [[robot]]s and [[mech]]s, many of which are humans whose [[Mind uploading|consciousness has been digitized]] in the wake of an [[extinction event]].<ref name=":0" />

==Significance and analysis==
The novel is an example of [[electronic literature]], available only in digital formats, and has no traditional paper version. It was designed from the beginning not only to incorporate more traditional elements such as illustrations, but also [[hypertext]], and 3D-[[3D printing|printable]] models of main robotic characters designed by [[Alex Jaeger]], the art director of ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' films.<ref name=":0" /> The novel composition is layered, with the narrative layer, an encyclopedic/hyperlinked footnote layer, and a [[multimedia]] layer, including illustrations and a short promotional video by the Oscar-nominated [[Platige Image]] studio.<ref>{{Citation|last=Image|first=Platige|title=STAROŚĆ AKSOLOTLA / THE OLD AXOLOTL|date=2015-02-10|url=https://vimeo.com/119228459|accessdate=2017-03-21}}</ref>

One of the novel's central questions is: "What does it mean to be human?" Other subjects are "staples of cyberpunk and related genres, such as the [[artificial intelligence]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookinstitute.pl/ksiazki-detal,literatura-polska,10064,old-axolotl-hardware-dreams--the-.html|title=Old Axolotl: Hardware Dreams, The  / Instytut Książki|website=www.bookinstitute.pl|language=pl|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> The novel is representative of Dukaj's prose, posing  philosophical questions about the future of man and technology.<ref name=":0" /> The other major element of the novel is Dukaj's attempts to introduce the reader to the new style of electronic literature.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2015/04/jacek-dukajs-old-axolotl-hardware-dreams-multi-dimensional-profound-read/|title=Jacek Dukaj’s THE OLD AXOLOTL: HARDWARE DREAMS  is a Multi-Dimensional and Profound Read|date=2015-04-09|work=SF Signal|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}</ref>
