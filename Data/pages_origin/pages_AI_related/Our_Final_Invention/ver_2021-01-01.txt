==Summary==
James Barrat weaves together explanations of AI concepts, AI history, and interviews with prominent AI researchers including [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]]. The book starts with an account of how an [[artificial general intelligence]] could become an artificial super-intelligence through recursive self-improvement. In subsequent chapters, the book covers the history of AI, including an account of the work done by [[I. J. Good]], up to the work and ideas of researchers in the field today.

Throughout the book, Barrat takes a cautionary tone, focusing on the threats artificial super-intelligence poses to human existence. Barrat emphasizes how difficult it would be to control or even to predict the actions of something that may become orders of magnitude more intelligent than the most intelligent humans.

==Reception==

On 13 December 2013, journalist [[Matthew Miller (journalist)|Matt Miller]] interviewed Barrat for his [[podcast]], "This... is interesting".  The interview and related matters to Barrat's book, ''Our Final Invention'', were then captured in Miller's weekly opinion piece for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-artificial-intelligence-our-final-invention/2013/12/18/26ed6be8-67e6-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html Artificial intelligence: Our final invention?], Matt Miller, [[Washington Post]] opinion</ref>

[[Seth Baum]], executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute and one of the people cited by Barrat in his book, reviewed the book favorably on ''[[Scientific American|Scientific American's]]'' "invited guest" blog, calling it a welcome counterpoint to the vision articulated by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in his book ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/10/11/our-final-invention-is-ai-the-defining-issue-for-humanity/|title = ''Our Final Invention'': Is AI the Defining Issue for Humanity?|last = Baum|first = Seth|authorlink = Seth Baum|date = October 11, 2013|accessdate = February 2, 2014|magazine = [[Scientific American]]}}</ref>

[[Gary Marcus]] questions Barrat's argument "that tendencies toward self-preservation and resource acquisition are inherent in any sufficiently complex, goal-driven system", noting that present-day AI does not have such drives, but Marcus concedes "that the goals of machines could change as they get smarter", and he feels that "Barrat is right to ask" about these important issues.<ref name=Marcus2013>{{cite news|last1=Marcus|first1=Gary|title=Why We Should Think About the Threat of Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/10/why-we-should-think-about-the-threat-of-artificial-intelligence.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=New Yorker|date=24 Oct 2013}}</ref>
