The annual '''International Web Rule Symposium''' ('''RuleML''') is an international [[academic conference]] on research, applications, languages and standards for rule technologies. Since 2017 it is organised as '''International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning''' ('''RuleML+RR'''). It is a conference in the field of [[rule-based programming]] and [[rule-based system]]s including [[Production system (computer science)|production rules systems]], [[Logic programming|logic programming rule engines]], and [[business rules engine]]s/[[Business rule management system|business rules management systems]]; [[Semantic web|Semantic Web]] rule languages and rule standards (e.g., [[RuleML]], LegalRuleML, Reaction RuleML, [[Semantic Web Rule Language|SWRL]], [[Rule Interchange Format|RIF]], [[Common logic|Common Logic]], [[Production Rule Representation|PRR]], [[Decision Model and Notation]] (DMN), [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules|SBVR]]); [[Complex event processing|rule-based event processing languages (EPLs) and technologies]]; and research on [[inference]] rules, [[Constraint Handling Rules|constraint handling rules]], [[Rule of inference|transformation rules]], [[decision rules]], [[Production (computer science)|production rules]], and [[Event Condition Action|ECA rules]]. RuleML+RR is the leading conference to build bridges between academia and industry in the field of Web rules and its applications, especially as part of the semantic technology stack.<ref>[http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2634 A Report on the Ninth International Web Rule Symposium.

==History==
The RuleML conference series has been held without interruption since 2002. The RuleML Symposium has evolved from an annual series of first international workshops since 2002, international conferences in 2005 and 2006, to the premier International Symposium for the Web rules community since 2007. Since 2017 it is joint with the Web Reasoning and Rule Systems conference series to the new International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR).

==International Rule Challenge==
The '''International Rule Challenge''' has been held since 2007 at the RuleML Symposium. It calls for submissions of benchmarks/evaluations, demos, case studies / use cases, experience reports, best practice solutions (e.g. design patterns, reference architectures, models), rule-based implementations/ tools/ applications, demonstrations engineering methods, implementations of rule standards and industrial problem statements. It also hosts a rule base competition.

==RuleML Doctoral Consortium==
Since 2011 the RuleML symposium organizes a Doctoral Consortium for PhD students.

Since 2017 also the [http://reasoningweb.org/ Reasoning Web Summer Schools] are co-located with the RuleML+RR conference.
