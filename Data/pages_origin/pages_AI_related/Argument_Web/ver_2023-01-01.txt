The '''Argument Web''' is a large-scale Web of interconnected [[argument|arguments]] created by individuals as they express their opinions and interact with the opinions of others.<ref name="rahwan1">Rahwan, Iyad, Fouad Zablith, and Chris Reed.

AIFdb is a database implementation or ‘reification’ of the [[Argument Interchange Format]] (AIF), which allows for the storage and retrieval of AIF compliant argument structures. This database solution was provided as a foundation for an open, integrated Argument Web. It offers an extensive range of [[Web service|web services]] for interacting with stored argument data, while also offering search and argument visualisation features that are all consistent with the formal ontology of AIF.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=John |last2=Bex |first2=Floris |last3=Reed |first3=Chris |last4=Snaith |first4=Mark |editor1-last=Verheij |editor1-first=Bart |editor2-last=Szeider |editor2-first=Stefan |editor3-last=Woltran |editor3-first=Stefan |title=AIFdb: Infrastructure for the Argument Web |journal=Computational Models of Argument |date=September 2012 |volume=245 |pages=515–516 |doi=10.3233/978-1-61499-111-3-515 |url=http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/7471 |ref=comma2012 |series=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications |language=English}}</ref>

At a basic level, the AIFdb web services allow for the insertion and querying of basic components of an [[Argument Interchange Format|AIF]] argument, such as nodes, edges and schemes. Building upon this basis, it also facilitates more complex interactions with these AIF argument structures. Such complex queries could make it possible, for example, to determine all the statements made by a particular person in support a given I-Node. While, at its highest level of interaction, AIFdb can handle the import and export of many standard file formats, including [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[DOT (graph description language)|DOT]], [[RDF/XML]] and other formats of argument theory tools, like Carneades, [[Argument map#Development of computer-supported argument visualization| Rationale]] and [[Araucaria (software)|Araucaria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AIFdb |url=https://arg-tech.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aif2db2.pdf |website=Centre for Argument Technology |publisher=ARG-tech}}</ref>

== Argument blogging ==
ArguBlogging is software which allows its users to select portions of hypertext on webpages in their [[Web browsers]] and to agree or disagree with the selected content, posting their [[arguments]] to their [[blog|blogs]] with [[linked data|linked argument data]].<ref name="bex2">Bex, Floris, Mark Snaith, John Lawrence, and Chris Reed. "Argublogging: An application for the argument web." Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web 25 (2014): 9-15.</ref> It is implemented as a [[bookmarklet]], adding functionality to [[Web browsers]] and interoperating with blogging platforms such as [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Tumblr]].
