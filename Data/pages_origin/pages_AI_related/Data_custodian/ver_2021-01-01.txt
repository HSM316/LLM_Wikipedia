In [[Data governance|Data Governance]] groups, responsibilities for data management are increasingly divided between the business process owners and information technology (IT) departments.  Two functional titles commonly used for these roles are [[Data steward|Data Steward]] and Data Custodian. 

Data Stewards are commonly responsible for data content, context, and associated business rules. Data Custodians are responsible for the safe custody, transport, storage of the data and implementation of business rules.<ref>Carnegie Mellon - Information Security Roles and Responsibilities, http://www.cmu.edu/iso/governance/roles/data-custodian.html</ref><ref>''Policies, Regulations and Rules: Data Management Procedures - REG 08.00.3 - Information Technology'', NC State University, http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/informationtechnology/REG08.00.3.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616052821/http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/informationtechnology/REG08.00.3.php |date=2010-06-16 }}</ref> Simply put, Data Stewards are responsible for what is stored in a data field, while Data Custodians are responsible for the technical environment and database structure.
