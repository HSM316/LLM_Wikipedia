It is the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network, originally introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. Just as [[ImageNet]] can be thought of as a database of classified visual objects, Inception helps classification of objects<ref>{{cite book |last1=Karim and Zaccone |title=Deep Learning with TensorFlow |date=March 2018 |publisher=Packt Publishing |isbn=9781788831109 |pages=Chapter 4 |url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-with/9781788831109/}}</ref> in the world of [[computer vision]].
