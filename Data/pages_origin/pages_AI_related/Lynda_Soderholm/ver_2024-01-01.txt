== Early life and education ==
{{BLP unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
Soderholm was awarded her PhD in 1982 by [[McMaster University]] under the direction of Prof John Greedan. Her dissertation focused on characterizing the structural and magnetic properties of a series of ternary f-ion oxides. After graduating, she was awarded a [[NATO]] postdoctoral fellow at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] in France from 1982 until 1985. After a short postdoctoral appointment as an Argonne postdoctoral fellow she was promoted to staff scientist the same year. Over several years, she moved up the ranks, becoming a senior chemist in 2001. She was also an adjunct professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]] from 2003 until 2007. In 2021, Soderholm was appointed interim Division Director for the Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.anl.gov/hess/2021/03/19/lynne-soderholm-named-interim-division-director/#:~:text=Effective%23April%2016%2C%202021%2C%20Lynda,and%20an%20Argonne%20Distinguished%20Fellow./|title=Lynne Soderholm Named Interim Division Director|last=|first=|date=April 25, 2022|website=Argonne Heavy Element Chemistry and Separation Science Groups Blog|access-date=}}</ref>

== Career and research ==

=== Uncovering structure of Yttrium-123 Superconductor ===
Early in her career, Soderholm focused on the characterizing the magnetic and electronic behavior of compounds containing f-ions (lanthanides and actinides) with a focus on [[High-temperature superconductivity|high-T<sub>c</sub>]] materials, compounds that are superconducting under usually high temperatures. She was part of the research group that first determined<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=David|first1=W. I. F.|last2=Harrison|first2=W. T. A.|last3=Gunn|first3=J. M.

Their discovery formed the foundation for the further developments in the broad field of superconductivity.

=== Understanding f-ion speciation in solution   ===
Continuing her interest in the f-elements, Soderholm shifted her focus from solid-state materials to nanoparticles and solutions, taking advantage of advances in X-ray structural probes made available by synchrotron facilities. Building on her earlier work using neutron scattering, her  team became the first to discover<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Soderholm|first1=L.|last2=Almond|first2=Philip M.|last3=Skanthakumar|first3=S.|last4=Wilson|first4=Richard E.|last5=Burns|first5=Peter C.|date=2008-01-01|title=The Structure of the Plutonium Oxide Nanocluster [Pu38O56Cl54(H2O)8]14−|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=2|pages=298–302|doi=10.1002/anie.200704420|pmid=18072187|issn=1521-3773}}</ref> that [[plutonium]] exists in solution as tiny, well-defined [[nanoparticle]]s. This work solved a longstanding problem in understanding transport of plutonium in the environment and resulted in the development of a new, patented approach<ref name=":2">{{Cite patent|country=US|number=8741237|title=Solvent extraction system for plutonium colloids and other oxide nano-particles|pubdate=2014-06-03|inventor1-last=Soderholm|inventor1-first=Lynda|inventor2-last=Wilson|inventor2-first=Richard E.|inventor3-last=Chiarizia|inventor3-first=Renato|inventor4-last=Skanthakumar||inventor4-first=Suntharalingam|assign=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]}}</ref> to separating plutonium during nuclear reprocessing.

=== Using machine learning to evaluate molecular structures   ===
Soderholm's more recent projects use machine learning to understand the influence of complex molecular structuring in solutions, in connection with  low-energy processes for separation of f-block elements from complex mixtures.
