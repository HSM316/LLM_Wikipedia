In April 2016, [[Nokia]] announced it had struck a deal to acquire Withings and integrate it with the group's Nokia Technologies division.<ref name=Reuters>{{cite web |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-withings-m-a-nokia-corp-idUSKCN0XN0MA |title = Nokia to buy health tracking firm Withings |author = Jussi Rosendahl |publisher = Reuters |date = 26 April 2016 |access-date = 26 April 2016}}</ref> The deal closed on 31 May 2016.
