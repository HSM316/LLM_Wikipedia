==Reception==
The company's "X2" headset model released in 2015 has been generally well-received and is included in many "Best Headphones" lists by [[technology]] and gadget publishers such as [[Engadget]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dragan|first1=Lauren|title=The best exercise headphones|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/24/the-best-exercise-headphones/|publisher=EnGadget}}</ref> [[TechCrunch]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Matney|first1=Lucas|title=The 13 Best Sounding Headphones For Everyone On Your Nice List|url=https://techcrunch.com/gallery/the-12-best-sounding-headphones-for-everyone-on-your-nice-list/|publisher=TechCrunch}}</ref> and [[PC Magazine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenwald|first1=Will|title=The Best Headphones for Running|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410143,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag}}</ref> Tim Gideon, writing for ''PC Magazine'', rated the headset 4 out of 5 stars, and praised it for its "high quality audio performance", and for being "ideal for athletes who need a very secure fit for intense training."<ref name="pcmag_gideon">{{cite web|last1=Gideon|first1=Tim|title=Jaybird X2|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2490095,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag}}</ref> Jeff Dunn from [[Business Insider]] included the X2 in his list of "best headphones for working out". Dunn commented, "For the best sound from an exercise-oriented headphone that isn’t outrageously overpriced, go with the Jaybird X2." Dunn warned however that finding the best fit for each individual user could take time to set up as the headset is shipped with rubber buds, foam ear buds, and fins of various sizes for the user to configure to their ear size.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=These are the best headphones for working out|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/best-exercise-headphones-running-working-out-buying-guide-2015-10|publisher=Business Insider}}</ref>

Jaybird's fitness tracker, "Reign", released in 2014, was met with mixed reviews. Many reviewers praised its ability to determine the optimal time for a user to exercise by tracking their heart rate variability, but criticized its companion [[Mobile app|mobile application]].<ref name="pcmag_gideon" /> Slashgear reviewer Nate Swanner wrote, "Reign is just as good as anything else out there, and much better for workout enthusiasts than many. Start comparing platforms, though, and Reign has a lot of work ahead of it."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Swanner|first1=Nate|title=Jaybird Reign review: in the 'Go Zone' of fitness wearables|date=24 November 2014|url=http://www.slashgear.com/jaybird-reign-review-in-the-go-zone-of-fitness-wearables-23356989/|publisher=Slash Gear}}</ref> In her critical review for ''PC Magazine'', author Jill Duffy surmised: "The Jaybird Reign puts unique functionality into an all-day activity tracker and mobile app, but it ignores basic features that make fitness gadgets truly usable."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Jill|title=Jaybird Reign|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2472276,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag}}</ref>
