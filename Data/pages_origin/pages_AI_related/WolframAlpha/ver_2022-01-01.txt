'''WolframAlpha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|f|r|əm|-}} {{respell|WUUL|frəm|-}}) is a computational knowledge engine and [[answer engine]] developed by [[Wolfram Research]].<ref name="Guardiandatasource">{{cite news |title=Where does Wolfram Alpha get its information? |author=Bobbie Johnson |work=The Guardian |date=May 21, 2009 |access-date=2013-03-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/21/1 }}</ref> It answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced data.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Wolfram{{!}}Alpha: Making the World's Knowledge Computable|url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html|website=wolframalpha.com|access-date = 2015-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/09/search-engine-google |title=British search engine 'could rival Google' |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=March 9, 2009 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=UK |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref>

WolframAlpha was released on May 18, 2009, and is based on Wolfram's earlier product [[Wolfram Mathematica]], a computational platform for calculation, visualization, and statistics capabilities.<ref name="launch date" /> Additional data is gathered from both academic and commercial websites such as the CIA's ''[[The World Factbook]]'', the [[United States Geological Survey]], a Cornell University Library publication called ''All About Birds'', ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]], the ''[[Catalogue of Life]]'',<ref name=Guardiandatasource /> [[CrunchBase]],<ref name=techcrunch>{{cite news |last=Dillet |first=Romain |title=Wolfram Alpha Makes CrunchBase Data Computable Just In Time For Disrupt SF |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/wolfram-alpha-makes-crunchbase-data-computable-just-in-time-for-disrupt/ |publisher=TechCrunch |date=September 7, 2012 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> [[Best Buy]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Golson |first=Jordan |title=Wolfram Delivers Siri-Enabled Shopping Results From Best Buy |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/12/16/wolfram-delivers-siri-enabled-shopping-results-from-best-buy/ |publisher=MacRumors |date=December 16, 2011 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> and the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Barylick |first=Chris |title=Wolfram Alpha search engine now tracks flight paths, trajectory information |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/19/wolfram-alpha-search-engine-now-tracks-flight-paths-trajectory/ |publisher=Engadget |date=November 19, 2011 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> 

== Technology ==
=== Overview ===
Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field. WolframAlpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a [[knowledge base]] of [[Data curation|curated]], [[structured data]] that come from other sites and books. It is able to respond to particularly phrased [[natural language understanding|natural language]] fact-based questions, or more complex questions. It displays its "Input interpretation" of such a question, using standardized phrases. Mathematical symbolism can be parsed by the engine, which responds with numerical and statistical results.

=== Development ===
WolframAlpha is written in the [[Wolfram Language]], a general multi-paradigm programming language, and implemented in [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]] and ran on more than 10,000 CPUs as of 2009.<ref>{{cite news |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |url=http://readwrite.com/2009/04/25/wolframalpha_our_first_impressions |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha: Our First Impressions |date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref>

== Usage ==
WolframAlpha has been used to power some searches in the [[Microsoft]] [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[DuckDuckGo]] search engines but is not currently used.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Krazit |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10315117-265.html |title=Bing strikes licensing deal with Wolfram Alpha |publisher=CNET |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The Wolfram&#124;Alpha Team |date=April 18, 2011 |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/04/18/wolframalpha-and-duckduckgo-partner-on-api-binding-and-search-integration/ |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha and DuckDuckGo Partner on API Binding and Search Integration |work=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> For factual [[question answering]], it is sometimes queried by Apple's [[Siri (software)|Siri]] and [[Amazon Alexa]] for math and science queries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alexa gets access to Wolfram Alpha's knowledge engine|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/alexa-gets-access-to-wolfram-alphas-knowledge-engine/|access-date=2021-03-17|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/tech/alexa-can-now-answer-those-tricky-math-questions-1983751.html|title=Alexa Can Now Answer Those Tricky Math Questions|work=News18}}</ref>

== History ==
Launch preparations began on May 15, 2009, at 7pm [[Central Daylight Time (North America)#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] and were broadcast live on [[Justin.tv]]. The plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later. There were issues due to extreme load. The service was officially launched on May 18, 2009,<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8052798.stm |title=Wolfram 'search engine' goes live |publisher=BBC News |date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> receiving mixed reviews.<ref name="spivack">{{cite web |first=Nova |last=Spivack |title=Wolfram Alpha is Coming – and It Could be as Important as Google |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.novaspivack.com/uncategorized/wolfram-alpha-is-coming-and-it-could-be-as-important-as-google |access-date=2013-02-09 |publisher=Nova Spivack – Minding the Planet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singel |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Fails the Cool Test |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/wolframalpha-fails-the-cool-test/ |publisher=Wired |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> In 2009, Wolfram Alpha advocates pointed to its potential, some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness.<ref name="spivack"/>
