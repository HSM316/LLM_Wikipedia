== Technology ==
=== Overview ===
Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field. WolframAlpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a [[knowledge base]] of [[Data curation|curated]], [[structured data]] that come from other sites and books. It is able to respond to particularly phrased [[natural language understanding|natural language]] fact-based questions. It displays its "Input interpretation" of such a question, using standardized phrases. Mathematical symbolism can also be parsed by the engine, which responds with numerical and statistical results.

=== Development ===
WolframAlpha is written in the [[Wolfram Language]], a general multi-paradigm programming language, and implemented in [[Wolfram Mathematica|Mathematica]], that is proprietary and not commonly used by developers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TIOBE Index |url=https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ |access-date=2022-10-06 |website=TIOBE |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Usage ==
WolframAlpha was used to power some searches in the [[Microsoft]] [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[DuckDuckGo]] search engines but is no longer used to provide search results.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Krazit |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10315117-265.html |title=Bing strikes licensing deal with Wolfram Alpha |publisher=CNET |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The Wolfram&#124;Alpha Team |date=April 18, 2011 |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/04/18/wolframalpha-and-duckduckgo-partner-on-api-binding-and-search-integration/ |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha and DuckDuckGo Partner on API Binding and Search Integration |work=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> For factual [[question answering]], WolframAlpha was formerly used by Apple's [[Siri (software)|Siri]] and [[Amazon Alexa]] for math and science queries but is no longer operational within those services.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alexa gets access to Wolfram Alpha's knowledge engine|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/alexa-gets-access-to-wolfram-alphas-knowledge-engine/|access-date=2021-03-17|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/tech/alexa-can-now-answer-those-tricky-math-questions-1983751.html|title=Alexa Can Now Answer Those Tricky Math Questions|work=News18|date=December 26, 2018}}</ref> WolframAlpha data types became available beginning in July 2020 with [[Microsoft Excel]], but the Microsoft-Wolfram partnership ended nearly two years later, in 2022, in favor of Microsoft [[Power Query]] data types.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Excel Data Types with Wolfram End of Support FAQ |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-data-types-with-wolfram-end-of-support-faq-9ac0876c-b8cb-4c8e-bed6-207d0d675bfe |access-date=2022-08-15 |website=support.microsoft.com}}</ref> WolframAlpha functionality in Microsoft Excel will be over in June 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-31 |title=Microsoft is killing Money in Excel along with Wolfram Alpha data types |url=https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-money-excel-wolfram-alpha-data-types/ |access-date=2022-08-15 |website=XDA |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
Launch preparations began on May 15, 2009 at 7 p.m. [[Central Daylight Time (North America)#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] and were broadcast live on [[Justin.tv]]. The plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later. However, there were issues due to extreme load. The service was officially launched on May 18, 2009,<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8052798.stm |title=Wolfram 'search engine' goes live |publisher=BBC News |date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> receiving mixed reviews.<ref name="spivack">{{cite web |first=Nova |last=Spivack |title=Wolfram Alpha is Coming – and It Could be as Important as Google |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.novaspivack.com/uncategorized/wolfram-alpha-is-coming-and-it-could-be-as-important-as-google |access-date=2013-02-09 |publisher=Nova Spivack – Minding the Planet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singel |title=Wolfram&#124;Alpha Fails the Cool Test |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/wolframalpha-fails-the-cool-test/ |publisher=Wired |access-date=2013-02-09}}</ref> In 2009, WolframAlpha advocates pointed to its potential, some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness.<ref name="spivack"/> WolframAlpha was initially launched as free, but later WolframAlpha attempted monetizing the service by launching an [[iOS application]] with a cost of $50, while the website itself was free.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nice Try, Wolfram Alpha.
