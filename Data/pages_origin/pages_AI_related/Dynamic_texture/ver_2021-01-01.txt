'''Dynamic texture''' ( sometimes referred to as '''temporal texture''') is the texture with motion which can be found in videos of sea-waves, fire, smoke, wavy trees, etc.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Temporal texture modeling - IEEE Conference Publication|doi=10.1109/ICIP.1996.560871}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title=Dynamic Texture Recognition Using Local Binary Patterns with an Application to Facial Expressions - IEEE Journals & Magazine|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1110|pmid=17431293|citeseerx=10.1.1.714.2104|year=2007|last1=Zhao|first1=G.|last2=Pietikäinen|first2=M.|volume=29|issue=6|pages=915–28}}</ref> Dynamic texture has a spatially repetitive pattern with time-varying visual pattern.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|last=Péteri|first=Renaud|title=A Brief Survey of Dynamic Texture Description and Recognition|date=2005|work=Computer Recognition Systems|pages=17–26|series=Advances in Soft Computing|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-32390-2_2|isbn=9783540250548|last2=Chetverikov|first2=Dmitry|citeseerx=10.1.1.64.4707}}</ref> Modeling and analyzing dynamic texture is a topic of [[Digital image processing|images processing]] and [[pattern recognition]] in [[computer vision]].

Extracting features that describe the dynamic texture can be utilized for tasks of images sequences [[Image classification|classification]], [[Image segmentation|segmentation]], recognition and retrieval. Comparing with texture found within static images, analyzing dynamic texture is a challenging problem.<ref name=":0" /> It is important that the extracted features from dynamic texture combine motion and appearance description, and also be invariance to some transformation such as rotation, translation and illumination.<ref name=":0" />

== Analysis methods of dynamic texture ==
The methods of dynamic texture recognition can categorized as follows:<ref name=":1" />

# '''Methods based on optical flow''': by applying [[optical flow]] to the dynamic texture, velocity with direction and [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] can be detected and used to recognize the dynamic texture. Due to simplicity of its computation, it is currently the most popular method.
# '''Methods computing geometric properties''': this methods track the surfaces of motion trajectories in spatiotemporal domain.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Feature extraction of temporal texture based on spatiotemporal motion trajectory - IEEE Conference Publication|doi=10.1109/ICPR.1998.711871}}</ref>  
# '''Methods based on local spatiotemporal filtering''' : this methods analyze the local [[spatiotemporal patterns]] and its orientation and energy and employ them as feature used for classification.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bergen|first=James R.|last2=Wildes|first2=Richard P.|date=2000-06-26|title=Qualitative Spatiotemporal Analysis Using an Oriented Energy Representation|journal=Computer Vision — ECCV 2000|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=768–784|doi=10.1007/3-540-45053-X_49|isbn=9783540676867|citeseerx=10.1.1.189.3015}}</ref>
# '''Methods based on global spatiotemporal transform''': this method characterize the motion at different scale using [[wavelet]]s that can decompose the motion into local and global.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Video texture indexing using spatio-temporal wavelets - IEEE Conference Publication|doi=10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039981}}</ref>
# '''Model-based methods''' : These methods aims at generating a model to describe the motion by a set of parameters.

== Applications ==
-      Segmenting the sequence images of natural scenes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Doretto|last2=Cremers|last3=Favaro|last4=Soatto|date=October 2003|title=Dynamic texture segmentation|journal=Proceedings Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision|pages=1236–1242 vol.2|doi=10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238632|isbn=978-0-7695-1950-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.324.456}}</ref> This helps on differentiate between streets and grass alongside these streets which could be used in the application of navigations.

-      Motion detection : Dynamic texture [[Feature extraction|features extracted]] from footage videos can be exploited to detect abnormal crowd activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Simon C.|last2=Marshall|first2=David|last3=Rosin|first3=Paul L.|last4=Lloyd|first4=Kaelon|date=2017-05-01|title=Detecting violent and abnormal crowd activity using temporal analysis of grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture measures|journal=Machine Vision and Applications|volume=28|issue=3–4|pages=361–371|doi=10.1007/s00138-017-0830-x|issn=1432-1769|arxiv=1605.05106}}</ref>

-      Video classification: video of natural scenes or other scenes that exhibit dynamic textures.

-      Video retrieval :  Dynamic textures can be employed as a feature retrieve videos that contain, for example, sea-waves, smoke, clouds, wavy trees.
