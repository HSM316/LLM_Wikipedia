=== Previous Generations ===

====Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front F200)====
This is a stand-alone camera that can be attached to a desktop or laptop computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-3d-camera.html|title=Take Interaction to the Next Level –  Intel RealSense Camera F200|publisher=Intel}}</ref> It is intended to be used for natural gesture-based interaction, face recognition, immersive, video conferencing and collaboration, gaming and learning and 3D scanning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/F200Camera|title=Developing for the Intel RealSense Camera (F200)|publisher=Intel}}</ref>

There is a version of this camera to be embedded into laptop computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-devices.html|title=Devices with Intel RealSense Technology|publisher=Intel}}</ref>

'''Specifications'''

* Full VGA depth resolution
* 1080p RGB camera
* 0.2–1.2 meter range (Specific algorithms may have different range and accuracy)
* USB 3.0 interface

====Intel RealSense Snapshot====
Snapshot is a camera intended to be built into tablet computers and possibly smartphones. Its intended uses include taking photographs and performing after the fact refocusing, distance measurements, and applying motion photo filters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/Snapshot|title=Developing for the Intel RealSense Snapshot|publisher=Intel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514135231/https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/Snapshot|archivedate=May 14, 2015}}</ref>

The refocus feature differs from a [[plenoptic camera]] in that RealSense Snapshot takes pictures with large [[depth of field]] so that initially the whole picture is in focus and then in software it selectively blurs parts of the image depending on their distance.

Dell Venue 8 7000 Series [[Android (operating system)|Android]] tablet is equipped with this camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-snapshot.html|title=Intel RealSense Snapshot|publisher=Intel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503065434/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-snapshot.html|archivedate=May 3, 2015}}</ref>

====Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Rear R200)====
Rear-mounted camera for [[Microsoft Surface]] or a similar tablet, like the HP Spectre X2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.hp.com/us/en/ContentView?storeId=10151&langId=-1&catalogId=10051&eSpotName=new-detachable|title=
HP Spectre X2|publisher=HP}}</ref> This camera is intended for augmented reality applications, content creation, and object scanning. Its depth accuracy is on the order of millimeters and its range is up to 6.0 meters. This makes it the more accurate and longer range of the Intel RealSense 3D cameras. Also unlike the F200 and SR300, the R200 is a stereo camera and is able to obtain accurate depth outdoors as well as indoors.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last=Keselman|first=Leonid|last2=Woodfill|first2=John Iselin|last3=Grunnet-Jepsen|first3=Anders|last4=Bhowmik|first4=Achintya|date=2017-05-16|title=Intel RealSense Stereoscopic Depth Cameras|eprint=1705.05548|class=cs.CV}}</ref>

====Intel RealSense Camera LR200====

====Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front SR300)====
The SR300 camera is the next generation of the Front F200 camera. It improves in various respects over its predecessor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://click.intel.com/intelrrealsensetm-developer-kit-featuring-sr300.html|title=Intel®RealSense™ Developer Kit featuring SR300|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> notably with

* 60% improved range
* >5X reduction in standby power
* 2X improvement in gesture speed (up to 2&nbsp;m/s)
* >8X improvement in depth/RGB latency

====App Challenge====
To address the lack of applications built on the RealSense platform and to promote the platform among [[software developer]]s, in 2014 Intel organized the Intel RealSense App Challenge. The winners were awarded large sums of money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel RealSense App Challenge Winners|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/realsense-winners/|publisher=Intel}}</ref>

== Software Developer Kit:  Librealsense ==
Intel launched their open source cross platform software developer kit with the Intel RealSense depth cameras D435 and D415.  It is available on GitHub.

The SDK (librealsense) allows depth and color streaming, and provides intrinsic and extrinsic calibration information. The library also offers synthetic streams (pointcloud, depth aligned to color and vice versa), and a built-in support for record and playback of streaming sessions.

Key Features of the SDK (librealsense): 
{| class="wikitable"
|'''What'''
|'''Description'''
|-
|'''Intel® RealSense™ Viewer'''
|With this application, you can quickly access your Intel® RealSense™  Depth Camera to view the depth stream, visualize point clouds, record and  playback streams, configure your camera settings, modify advanced controls,  enable depth visualization and post processing and much more.
|-
|'''Depth Quality Tool'''
|This application allows you to test the camera’s depth quality,  including: standard deviation from plane fit, normalized RMS – the subpixel  accuracy, distance accuracy and fill rate. You should be able to easily get  and interpret several of the depth quality metrics and record and save the  data for offline analysis.
|-
|'''Other Debug Tools'''
|Device enumeration, FW logger, etc. as can be seen at the tools  directory
|-
|'''Code Samples to Start  Prototyping Quickly'''
|These simple examples demonstrate how to easily use the SDK to include  code snippets that access the camera into your applications. Check some of  the '''C++ examples''' including capture, pointcloud and more and basic '''C examples'''
|-
|'''Wrappers'''
|Python, .NET, Node.js API, as well as integration with the following 3rd-party  technologies: ROS, LabVIEW, OpenCV, PCL, Unity, and more to come, including Matlab and OpenNI.

==Reception==
In an early preview article in 2015, ''PC World''{{'}}s Mark Hachman concluded that RealSense is an [[enabling technology]] that will be largely defined by the software that will take advantage of its features. He noted that as of the time the article was written, the technology was new and there was no such software.<ref name="puzzlepcworld">{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2893270/hands-on-without-apps-intels-realsense-camera-is-a-puzzle.html|title=Hands on: Without apps, Intel's RealSense camera is a puzzle|date=Mar 5, 2015|work=PC World|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>
