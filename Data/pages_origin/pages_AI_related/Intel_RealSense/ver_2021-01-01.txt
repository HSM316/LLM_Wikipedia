}}'''Intel RealSense Technology''' is a product range of depth and tracking technologies designed to give machines and devices depth perceptions capabilities. The technology, owned by [[Intel]] are used in autonomous drones, robots, AR/VR, smart home devices amongst many others broad market products.  

The RealSense product is made of Vision Processors, Depth and Tracking Modules, and [[depth camera|Depth Camera]]s, supported by an open source, cross-platform SDK, simplifying supporting cameras for third party software developers, system integrators, ODMs and OEMs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realsense.intel.com/|title=Intel RealSense|website=Intel RealSense|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}</ref>

== Technology overview ==
Intel RealSense Group supports multiple depth and tracking technologies including Coded Light Depth, Stereo Depth and Positional Tracking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realsense.intel.com|title=Intel RealSense|website=Intel RealSense|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}</ref>

=== Current Product range ===
As of January 2018, new Intel RealSense D400 Product Family was launched with the Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4, Intel RealSense Depth Module D400 Series, and 2 ready to use depth cameras: Intel RealSense Depth Cameras D435 and D415.

Previous generations of Intel RealSense depth cameras (F200, R200 and SR300) were implemented in multiple laptop and tablet computers by  [[Asus]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-devices.html|title=Devices with Intel RealSense Technology|publisher=Intel}}</ref> Additionally, Razer and Creative offered consumer ready standalone webcams with the Intel RealSense camera built into the design.:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-broadcaster/razer-stargazer|title=Razer Stargazer Depth-Sensing Webcam|date=Feb 22, 2016}}</ref> Razer Stargazer and the Creative BlasterX Senz3D.<ref>http://www.pcgamesn.com/creative/creative-senz3d-razer-stargazer</ref>
== Product series ==

=== Intel RealSense D400 Product Family ===

==== Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4 Series ====
The Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4 series are vision processors based on 28 nanometer (nm) process technology to compute real-time stereo depth data. They utilise a depth algorithm that enables more accurate and longer range depth perception than previously available. There are two products in this family: RealSense Vision processor D4 and RealSense Vision Processor D4m.

==== Other products ====
The Intel RealSense Depth Module D400 Series is designed for easy integration to bring 3D into devices and machines. Intel also released the D415 and D435 in 2018.  Both cameras feature the RealSense Vision processor D4 and camera sensors.  They are supported by the cross-platform and open source Intel RealSense SDK 2.0. The Intel D415 is designed for more precise measurements.

===== Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435 =====
The Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435 is ideal for capturing stereo depth in a variety of applications that help perceive the world in 3D. <ref>https://www.cnx-software.com/2017/05/22/399-intel-euclid-realsense-powered-robotics-devkit-runs-ubuntu-ros-on-intel-atom-x7-z8700-processor/</ref><ref>http://roscon.ros.org/2016/presentations/ROSCon2016_Intel_RealSense.pdf</ref><ref>https://fccid.io/2AK6WEUCLID1/RF-Exposure-Info/SAR-Test-Report-1-3339127</ref><ref>https://newsroom.intel.com/chip-shots/intel-announces-tools-realsense-technology-development/</ref><ref>https://www.patreon.com/posts/intel-euclid-022-12444963</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGvWYMwLzA</ref><ref>https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000024177/emerging-technologies/intel-euclid-development-kit.html</ref><ref>https://www.euclidcommunity.intel.com/</ref><ref>https://www.mouser.de/new/Intel/intel-euclid-dev-kit/</ref><ref>http://wiki.ros.org/IntelEuclid</ref><ref>https://imvc.co.il/Portals/38/Amit%20Moran.pdf</ref><ref>https://github.com/inteleuclid</ref><ref>https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/99400/emerging-technologies/intel-euclid-development-kit.html</ref><ref>https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/emerging-technologies/Euclid_User_Guide.pdf</ref>

== Previous Generations ==

=== Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front F200) ===
This is a stand-alone camera that can be attached to a desktop or laptop computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-3d-camera.html|title=Take Interaction to the Next Level – Intel RealSense Camera F200|publisher=Intel}}</ref> It is intended to be used for natural gesture-based interaction, [[facial recognition system|face recognition]], immersive, video conferencing and collaboration, gaming and learning and 3D scanning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/F200Camera|title=Developing for the Intel RealSense Camera (F200)|publisher=Intel}}</ref> There was also version of this camera to be embedded into laptop computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-devices.html|title=Devices with Intel RealSense Technology|publisher=Intel}}</ref>

=== Intel RealSense Snapshot ===
Snapshot is a camera intended to be built into tablet computers and possibly smartphones. Its intended uses include taking photographs and performing after the fact refocusing, distance measurements, and applying motion photo filters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/Snapshot|title=Developing for the Intel RealSense Snapshot|publisher=Intel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514135231/https://software.intel.com/en-us/RealSense/Snapshot|archivedate=May 14, 2015}}</ref> The refocus feature differs from a [[plenoptic camera]] in that RealSense Snapshot takes pictures with large [[depth of field]] so that initially the whole picture is in focus and then in software it selectively blurs parts of the image depending on their distance. The [[Dell]] [[Dell Venue|Venue]] 8 7000 Series [[Android (operating system)|Android]] tablet is equipped with this camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-snapshot.html|title=Intel RealSense Snapshot|publisher=Intel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503065434/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-snapshot.html|archivedate=May 3, 2015}}</ref>

=== Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Rear R200) ===
Rear-mounted camera for [[Microsoft Surface]] or a similar tablet, like the [[HP Spectre|HP Spectre X2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.hp.com/us/en/ContentView?storeId=10151&langId=-1&catalogId=10051&eSpotName=new-detachable|title=HP Spectre X2|publisher=HP}}</ref> This camera is intended for augmented reality applications, content creation, and object scanning. Its depth accuracy is on the order of millimeters and its range is up to 6.0 meters. The R200 is a stereo camera and is able to obtain accurate depth outdoors as well as indoors.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Keselman|first1=Leonid|last2=Woodfill|first2=John Iselin|last3=Grunnet-Jepsen|first3=Anders|last4=Bhowmik|first4=Achintya|date=2017-05-16|title=Intel RealSense Stereoscopic Depth Cameras|eprint=1705.05548|class=cs.CV}}</ref>

=== App Challenge ===
To address the lack of applications built on the RealSense platform and to promote the platform among [[software developer]]s, in 2014 Intel organized the Intel RealSense App Challenge. The winners were awarded large sums of money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Intel RealSense App Challenge Winners|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/realsense-winners/|publisher=Intel}}</ref>

==Reception==
In an early preview article in 2015, ''PC World''{{'}}s Mark Hachman concluded that RealSense is an [[enabling technology]] that will be largely defined by the software that will take advantage of its features. He noted that as of the time the article was written, the technology was new and there was no such software.<ref name="puzzlepcworld">{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2893270/hands-on-without-apps-intels-realsense-camera-is-a-puzzle.html|title=Hands on: Without apps, Intel's RealSense camera is a puzzle|date=Mar 5, 2015|work=PC World|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>
