'''''17776''''' (also known as '''''What Football Will Look Like in the Future''''') is a serialized [[speculative fiction]] multimedia narrative by [[Jon Bois]], published online through ''[[SB Nation]]''. Set in the distant future, the series follows three [[sentience|sentient]] [[space probe]]s that watch humanity play an evolved form of [[American football]] in which games can be played for millennia over distances of thousands of miles. The series debuted on July 5, 2017, and new chapters were published daily until the series concluded ten days later with its twenty-fifth chapter on July 15.

Bois began developing ''17776'' in 2016. Because the story incorporates text, animated [[GIF]]s, still images, and videos hosted on [[YouTube]], new tools were developed to allow it to be hosted efficiently on the ''SB Nation'' website. The work explores themes of consciousness, hope, despair, and why humans play sports. ''17776'' was well received by critics, who praised it for its innovative use of its medium and for the depth of emotion it evoked. In 2018, the story won a [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation and was longlisted for both the [[Hugo Awards]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|Best Graphic Story]].

It is followed by a two-part [[sequel]] series: ''20020'' released in September to October 2020 and ''20021'' planned for release in 2021. The sequel series follows a 111-team game of [[college football]] on fields spanning the continental United States.

== Premise ==
[[File:Pioneer-6-9.jpg|thumb|A newly sentient ''Pioneer 9'' is one of the main characters of ''17776''.|alt=A barrel-like space probe with several antennae floats through red-black space.]]

The story takes place on an Earth where humans stopped dying, aging, and being born in 2026. All social ills were subsequently eliminated, and technology preventing humans from any injury was developed. In the United States, [[American football]] evolved to include new rules, including those that allow fields thousands of miles long, hundreds of in-game players, and games millennia long. Over time, computers gained [[sentience]] due to constant exposure to broadcast human data.

By the year 17776, the [[space probe]] ''[[Pioneer 9]]'' (called Nine) has gained sentience and made contact with ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' (called Ten) and the ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]]'' (called Juice). As Nine adjusts to a world radically different from that of the 20th century, the three space probes watch multiple football games occurring across the United States: a game using the entirety of [[Nebraska]] as a field in which the next point scored wins the game; a game in which players strive to possess every existing football signed by [[Koy Detmer]]; a game played between the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]] and the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] deadlocked for 13,000 years at the bottom of a [[Canyon|gorge]] in [[Arizona]]; an [[National Football League|NFL]] regulation game between the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] that changed over 15,000 years into 58 playing teams owning and capitalizing upon portions of the field while the ball is lost; a [[500 (ball game)|500]] game that results in the destruction of the [[Centennial Light]]; and a game in which the possessing player is attempting to score an automatic win by hiding in his team's [[end zone]] for 10,000 years.

==Format==
''17776'' is read by [[scrolling]] through pages occupied by large [[GIF]] images and colored dialogue text, interspersed with occasional [[YouTube]] videos. The story is divided into chapters, which were originally published in daily installments between July 5 and July 15, 2017.<ref name=Quartz>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|title=A dazzling new piece of experimental fiction is being serialized on a sports news site|last=Ha|first=Thu-Huong|date=July 8, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115195343/https://qz.com/1024077/an-explanation-of-sb-nations-what-football-will-look-like-in-the-future-17776-by-jon-bois/|archivedate=November 15, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Development ==
Bois wrote and illustrated ''17776'' for [[Vox Media]]'s sports news website ''[[SB Nation]]'', of which he is creative director. Aside from ''17776'', Bois produces two other recurring, humorous video essay programs for the site: ''Pretty Good'', which focuses on unusual sports topics and stories, and ''Chart Party'',  which focuses on statistics and has an emphasis on Bois' use of visual art in his journalism and storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=Lars|title=SB Nation's Jon Bois shows Seahawks are "Least Volatile" in NFL|url=https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years |accessdate= September 4, 2017 |work=[[SB Nation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904063758/https://www.fieldgulls.com/2017/8/23/16193930/seattle-seahawks-chart-party-jon-bois-least-volatile-team-30-years|archive-date=September 4, 2017|date=2017-08-23|url-status=live}}</ref> Bois is also known for the ''Breaking Madden'' series, in which he attempted unusual scenarios in the ''[[Madden NFL]]'' series of video games.<ref name=":2" />

In early 2016, Bois began developing an "anti-sci fi" project as a possible sequel to ''The [[Tim Tebow]] CFL Chronicles'', an earlier work for ''SB Nation'', and set the story in a year far enough in the future that "nobody ever thinks about it." Although he liked the concept and the visuals, he believed the project would not connect with readers and shelved it.<ref name=":0" /> Later, he realized that the story needed a centering character; he wrote one in the form of a small town, [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[talk show]] host before coming up with the characters of the probes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|title=17776: Questions and answers|date=July 24, 2017|work=[[SB Nation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904070557/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=September 7, 2018|last1=Bois|first1=Jon}}</ref> Development renewed in May 2016, and the project solidified after ''SB Nation'' published its article "The Future of Football."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.poynter.org/2017/this-sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-2-3-million-pageviews/466041/|title=This SB Nation story has everything: Robots, football and 2.3 million pageviews|last=Funke|first=Daniel|date=July 10, 2017|publisher=[[Poynter Institute]]|work=Poynter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152053/https://www.poynter.org/news/sb-nation-story-has-everything-robots-football-and-23-million-pageviews|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> Bois described it as the biggest project he ever attempted.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=882763911510052864|user=jon_bois|title=today is day one of the biggest project i've ever tried. it is called 17776|author=|date=July 10, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}</ref>

The series was developed by Graham MacAree, who used a Vox Media tool that creates custom packages from standard article sets to give Bois creative leeway and to accommodate the series' weight on the ''SB Nation'' website. MacAree found that there were few resources online for achieving the desired effects.<ref name=":0" />

== Themes ==
Bois has stated that he had "conceived [''17776''] to give the reader a good time," asserting that this "was literally the whole point."<ref name=":0" />

William Hughes writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described ''17776'' as concerned with why humans play sports: "That is, given the massive resources, time, and information at our disposal (not to mention those available to our descendants), why does communal game-playing still hold such an important place in society?" He also listed consciousness, hope, and despair as among the work's themes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/future-football-post-human-despair-and-fascinating-257765|title=The future of football is post-human despair (and fascinating sports meta-fiction)|last=Hughes|first=William|date=July 6, 2017|access-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=live|work=[[The A.V.

She also felt that Ten and Juice take on the [[Shoulder angel|role of angel and devil]], and she suggested the two may be [[unreliable narrator]]s.<ref name="io9">{{cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|title=Sports Site Dives Into Scifi with Series About the Future of Football|last=Elderkin|first=Beth|date=July 9, 2017|work=[[io9]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080645/http://io9.gizmodo.com/sports-site-dives-into-scifi-with-series-about-the-futu-1796753325|archivedate=September 17, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian Crouch of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' felt that the work had a "tonal echo" of [[Don DeLillo]]'s 1972 novel ''[[End Zone]]'' due to thematic similarities "with the way that the order and logic of football might act as a counterbalance to the chaos of the real world".<ref name=":2" />

== Reception ==

According to the communications director at Vox Media, ''17776'' garnered over 2.3 million pageviews by July 10.<ref name=":0" /> Two days later, it had received more than 2.9 million pageviews.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|title=The Experimental Fiction That Imagines Football-Obsessed Americans in the Extremely Distant Future|last=Crouch|first=Ian|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613014956/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/the-experimental-fiction-that-imagines-football-obsessed-americans-in-the-extremely-distant-future|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> Average engagement time was over nine minutes, and 43 percent of readers finished each installment of the series published by July 7.<ref name=":0" /> On July 19, Bois claimed that ''17776'' received 700,000 [[unique visitors]] and 4 million total pageviews, with an average engagement time of 11 minutes.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=887538023805669376|user=jon_bois|title=over the last two weeks, 17776 got four million pageviews and 700,000 unique visitors. people stuck around for an average of 11 minutes|author=|date=July 19, 2017|access-date=July 25, 2017|last=Bois|first=Jon}}</ref>

Thu-Huong Ha for ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' described ''17776'' as "part [[Italo Calvino]], part Peter Heller [author of ''[[The Dog Stars]]''], with humor seemingly from within the depths of [[Reddit]]," saying that the story would appeal to fans of both sports and literature.<ref name="Quartz" /> [[Tor.com]] described the first chapter as full of tension and felt that receiving answers is a "surprisingly heartbreaking" experience "lessened by a gleeful bouncing immaturity" one would not expect from the characters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|title=You Don't Know It Yet, But You're Reading a Hilarious Sci-Fi Short Story|date=July 6, 2017|website=On Our Radar|publisher=[[Tor.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010826/https://www.tor.com/2017/07/06/jon-bois-future-of-football-17776-story/|archive-date=August 11, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref> Beth Elderkin at ''io9'' said the series is "akin to ''[[Homestuck]]''" and described it as "weird, complex, and pretty spectacular".<ref name="io9" /> William Hughes writing for ''The A.V. Club'' felt that ''17776'' is a "truly innovative piece of work".<ref name=":1" /> After reading the first three chapters, Agatha French of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that she was "impressed and excited by the innovation" of what she saw, and that she was intrigued despite not knowing what the work is or is saying. She felt the work took full advantage of its online medium and suggested that it "may also be a glimpse into the future of reading on the Internet".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|title=Radiant children, the future of football and eau de literary hero|last=French|first=Agatha|date=July 12, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=September 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202044237/http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-litweek-20170712-htmlstory.html|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian Crouch of ''The New Yorker'' described the series as, "despite its seemingly meagre parts, a thing of startling beauty". Of the chapters published by July 12, he felt "the most striking chapter" to be one that utilized audio of [[Verne Lundquist]] calling [[Kick Six|the end of a 2013 game]] between the [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|University of Alabama]] and [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn University]] over a video panning over Earth. He also noted that the series was compared to ''Homestuck'' and relayed additional comparisons to [[Thomas Pynchon]] novels and "a Reddit thread hijacked by robot [[Internet troll|trolls]]".<ref name=":2" />

The series won the inaugural [[National Magazine Award]] for Digital Innovation from the [[American Society of Magazine Editors]]; this was the first National Magazine Award nomination and win for ''SB Nation''. It was described by the judges as "an extraordinary combination of art, fiction and technology, an online [[acid trip]] that had to be experienced to be believed."<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=

It focuses on a similarly lengthy, interconnected, 111-team competition based on [[college football]]. The sentient space probes featured in ''17776'' return, with Juice serving as the games' designer and commissioner. ''20020''{{'}}s format largely resembles ''17776'' with a more involved use of YouTube video storytelling interspersed regularly into the presented narrative.
