=== Rail freight ===
{{Main|Rail freight transport}}

The Freight Technology Group, responsible for identifying relevant technologies for the freight sector in the UK, has identified three key technical innovations already in use in [[Rail freight transport|rail freight]].<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/552492/rail-freight-strategy.pdf|title=Rail Freight Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=gov.uk.dft|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> These include [[timetable]] advisory systems which allow drivers to track train progress against timetables via software hosted on tablets, freight collaborative decision-making systems which offer real-time information on arrivals of freight services, and mobile consisting applications which reduce the amount of information sent manually to relevant parties and authorities by collecting information and transmitting it directly.<ref name=":15" />

However, advancements in rail freight technology have progressed more slowly than in other sectors due to the decades-long life cycles of [[locomotive]]s and [[Railroad car|railcars]]<ref name=":11" /> and the lack of power supply in [[Goods wagon|freight cars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/connected-freight-trains-are-better-freight-trains-43171.html|title=Connected freight trains are better freight trains|website=Bosch Media Service|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

A $10 billion upgrade to the [[Rail transportation in the United States|North American rail system]] was mandated by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to include automated safety overrides after a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 commuter train accident]], laying the groundwork for autonomous rails in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/2019/07/29/autonomous-trains-challenges/|title=Autonomous Trains Are Ready to Roll, but May Face Challenges Gaining Acceptance|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

=== Sea freight ===
{{Main|Maritime transport}}

The growing number of [[smart port]]s around the world are increasing capacity and efficiency for shippers, ports, and [[Freight forwarder|freight forwarding]] partners, such as trucking carriers.<ref name=":10" /> Reductions in labour and machinery costs can be seen at ports thanks to improvements in automated and semi-automated [[Crane (machine)|cranes]], which reduce the need for yard transfer vehicles.<ref name=":12" />

In 2018, shipping conglomerate [[Maersk]] partnered with [[IBM]] to create TradeLens, a platform for sharing and streamlining shipping information across shipping partners, businesses, and different authorities.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":4" /> By 2019, the platform covered nearly half of the world’s shipments of cargo containers.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-ocean-cargo-carriers-join-blockchain-initiative-11559044800|title=Big Ocean Cargo Carriers Join Blockchain Initiative|last=Paris|first=Costas|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=28 May 2019 |language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2019/12/09/ibm-tech-trends-to-watch-in-2020--and-beyond/#6c6383c54c1c|title=IBM Tech Trends To Watch In 2020 … And Beyond|last=|first=|date=2019-12-09|website=[[Forbes]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

=== Intermodal freight ===
{{Main|Intermodal freight transport}}

Freight that is shipped using multiple modes of transport is called [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal freight]].<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|url=https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/efficiency-sustainabilty-multimodal-supply-chains.pdf|title=Efficiency and Sustainability in Multimodal Supply Chains|last=Rodrigue|first=Jean-Paul|date=2018-10-17|website=International Transport Forum |archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Freight technology plays a pivotal role in intermodal freight transport by streamlining communication, documentation, and dispute resolution across various industry players as cargo changes hands.<ref name=":16" /> Freight technology offers a way to increase transparency across industry players at each step of the supply chain. [[Smart contract]]s, for example, can use information collected by data loggers, such as temperature data on cold chain shipments, to resolve or dispute a contract depending on whether the agreed upon terms of shipping have been followed.<ref name=":16" />
