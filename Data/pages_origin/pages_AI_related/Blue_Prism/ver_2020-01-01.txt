==History==
===Formation===
Blue Prism was founded in 2001 by a group of [[process automation]] experts to develop technology that could be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.builtinaustin.com/2019/01/24/blue-prism-130-million-funding|title=Blue Prism is raising $130M to fuel new technologies|website=Built In Austin|language=en|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> Initially their focus was on the [[back office]] where they recognised an enormous unfulfilled need for automation. The company was co-founded by Alastair Bathgate and David Moss to provide a new approach that today is known as robotic process automation, or RPA.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/blue-prism-looks-to-partners-to-expand-robotic-process-automation-with-ai/|title=Blue Prism looks to partners to expand robotic process automation with AI|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref> 

In 2003, Blue Prism's first commercial product, Automate, was launched. In 2005, the second version of Automate was released with features for large scale processing. [[Co-operative Financial Services]] began using Blue Prism software in 2005 to automate manual processes in customer services.<ref name="cw-extends">
