'''Machina''' is a clothing brand company specializing in [[wearable technology]] based in [[Mexico City]] and [[San Francisco]], accelerated by [[PCH International#Highway1|Highway1]] and [[Wayra]].<ref name = "H1">{{cite web|url=http://highway1.io/founder-friday-obes-antonio-and-linda-machina/ | title=Innovator's Under 35|work=MIT Technology Review}}</ref>

The company attempted to make a [[MIDI]] controlling [[jacket]]. A 2012 review in [[TechCrunch]] called the jacket "a cool concept and an interesting and kinetic way to trigger and control beats and sounds."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/machina-midi-jacket-sound-movement-and-fashion/|title=Machina MIDI Jacket: Sound, Movement and Fashion|author=Jay Donovan|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}</ref> The company was founded in 2011 by Linda Franco, Antonio Perdigón, and Daniel Fernández de Córdova <ref name = "Forbes">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/los-30-negocios-mas-prometedores-en-mexico/|title=30 promesas de los negocios en México|author=Stephanie Lewis & Lourdes Contreras|publisher=Forbes Mexico|work=Forbes}}</ref>

A [[Kickstarter]] project in 2013 produced a prototype, with a delay of almost a year behind the projected delivery date. Since then, there have been no substantial updates and the announced [[open-source hardware]] has not materialized.  The company is currently developing OBE, a jacket for [[virtual reality]] with accelerometers and vibration motors.<ref name="MIT">{{cite web|url=https://www.innovatorsunder35.com/the-list/linda-franco/|title=Linda Franco|work=MIT Technology Review}}</ref>

In 2017 Linda Franco was named one of MIT's innovators under 35,<ref name = "MIT"></ref> and in 2014 the company appeared as one of Forbes Mexico's [[Forbes 30 Under 30|30 under 30]].<ref name = "Forbes"></ref>
