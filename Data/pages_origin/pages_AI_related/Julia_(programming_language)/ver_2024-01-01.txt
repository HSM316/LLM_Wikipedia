Julia can be run similar to (interpreted) [[scripting language]]s (i.e. Julia has a [[read–eval–print loop|REPL]]), and does by default using its runtime (when preinstalled),<ref name="PackageCompiler.jl" /> but Julia programs/[[source code]] can also optionally be sent to users in one ready-to-install/run file, which can be made quickly, not needing anything preinstalled. Julia programs can also be (separately) compiled to [[binary executable]]s, even allowing no-source-code distribution. Such compilation is not needed for speed, since Julia is also compiled when running interactively, but it can help with hiding source code. With separate compilation all features of Julia can be used (by building in the runtime, or alternatively without the runtime, allows for tiny executables or libraries, but then with limited capabilities). Julia can be called from other languages, e.g. Python and R, and several Julia packages have been made easily available from those languages, in the form of libraries for them.

==History==
Work on Julia began in 2009, when [[Jeff Bezanson (programmer)|Jeff Bezanson]], [[Stefan Karpinski]], [[Viral B. Shah]], and [[Alan Edelman]] set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. On 14 February 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language's mission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Bezanson |author2=Stefan Karpinski |author3=Viral Shah |author4=Alan Edelman |title=Why We Created Julia|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia|website=JuliaLang.org|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[InfoWorld]]'' in April 2012, Karpinski said of the name "Julia": "There's no good reason, really. It just seemed like a pretty name."<ref name="infoworld" /> Bezanson said he chose the name on the recommendation of a friend,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torre |first1=Charles |title=Stefan Karpinski and Jeff Bezanson on Julia |url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Stefan-Karpinski-and-Jeff-Bezanson-Julia-Programming-Language |website=Channel 9 |publisher=MSDN |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref> then years later wrote:

Julia's [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] is now considered stable, since version 1.0 in 2018, and Julia has a [[backward compatibility]] guarantee for 1.x and also a stability promise for the documented (stable) [[application programming interface|API]], while in the years before in the early development prior to 0.7 the syntax (and semantics) was changed in new versions. All of the (registered package) [[ecosystem]] uses the new and improved syntax, and in most cases relies on new APIs that have been added regularly<!-- , e.g. in {{nowrap|Julia 1.6 [[long-term support|LTS]]}}-->, and in some cases minor additional syntax added in a forward compatible way e.g. in Julia&nbsp;1.7.

In the 10 years since the 2012 launch of pre-1.0 Julia, the community has grown. The Julia package ecosystem has over 11.8 million lines of code (including docs and tests).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Newsletter August 2021 - Julia Computing Completes $24 Million Series A Fundraise and Former Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia Joins Julia Computing Board of Directors - JuliaHub |url=https://juliahub.com/blog/2021/08/newsletter-august/ |access-date=2022-11-16 |website=juliahub.com}}</ref> The JuliaCon [[academic conference]] for Julia users and developers has been held annually since 2014 with JuliaCon2020<ref>{{Cite web |title=JuliaCon 2020 |url=https://juliacon.org/2020/ |access-date=2023-10-06 |website=JuliaCon 2020 |language=en}}</ref> welcoming over 28,900 unique viewers,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-11|title=JuliaCon 2020 Wrap-up|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/juliacon-2020-wrapup/#outcomes|access-date=2020-12-20|website=julialang.org}}</ref> and then JuliaCon2021 breaking all previous records (with more than 300 JuliaCon2021 presentations available for free on YouTube, up from 162 the year before), and 43,000 unique viewers during the conference.<ref>{{Cite web|title=JuliaCon 2021 Highlights|url=https://julialang.org/blog/2021/08/juliacon-highlights/|access-date=2021-09-06|website=julialang.org|language=en}}</ref>

The main features of the language are:
* Multiple dispatch: providing ability to define function behavior across combinations of argument types
* [[Dynamic type]] system: types for documentation, optimization, and dispatch
* Performance approaching that of [[type system|statically-typed]] languages like C
* A built-in [[package manager]]
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like macros and other [[metaprogramming]] facilities
* Designed for [[parallel computing|parallel]] and [[distributed computing]]
* [[Coroutine]]s: lightweight [[green thread|''green'' threading]]
* Automatic generation of code for different argument types
* Extensible conversions and promotions for numeric and other types
Multiple dispatch (also termed [[multimethod]]s in Lisp) is a [[generalization]] of [[single dispatch]]{{snd}} the [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic mechanism]] used in common [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) languages, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Smalltalk]]{{snd}} that uses [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]. In Julia, all concrete types are [[subtyping|subtypes]] of abstract types, directly or indirectly subtypes of the <code>Any</code> type, which is the top of the type hierarchy. Concrete types can not themselves be subtyped the way they can in other languages; composition is used instead (see also [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)#Inheritance vs subtyping|inheritance vs subtyping]]).

By default, the Julia runtime must be pre-installed as user-provided source code is run. Alternatively, Julia (GUI) apps can be quickly bundled up into a single file with AppBundler.jl<ref>{{Citation |title=AppBundler.jl |date=2023-12-13 |url=https://github.com/PeaceFounder/AppBundler.jl |access-date=2023-12-18 |publisher=PeaceFounder}}</ref> for "building Julia GUI applications in modern desktop application installer formats. It uses Snap for Linux, [[.msix|MSIX]] for Windows, and DMG for MacOS as targets. It bundles full Julia within the app".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-30 |title=[ANN] AppBundler.jl - Bundle Your Julia GUI Application |url=https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-appbundler-jl-bundle-your-julia-gui-application/106971 |access-date=2023-12-18 |website=Julia Programming Language |language=en}}</ref> PackageCompiler.jl can build standalone [[executable]]s that need no Julia source code to run.<ref name="PackageCompiler.jl">{{cite web|title=GitHub - JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl: Compile your Julia Package.|date=2019-02-14|url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl|publisher=The Julia Language|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>

In Julia, everything is an object, much like object-oriented languages; however, unlike most object-oriented languages, all functions use [[multiple dispatch]] to select methods, rather than single dispatch. 

Most programming paradigms can be implemented using Julia's [[Homoiconicity|homoiconic]] macros and packages. Julia's [[Macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|syntactic macros]] (used for [[metaprogramming]]), like Lisp macros, are more powerful than [[Macro (computer science)#Text-substitution macros|text-substitution macros]] used in the [[preprocessor]] of some other languages such as C, because they work at the level of [[abstract syntax tree]]s (ASTs). Julia's macro system is [[hygienic macro|hygienic]], but also supports deliberate capture when desired (like for [[anaphoric macro]]s) using the <code>esc</code> construct.

Julia draws inspiration from various dialects of Lisp, including [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]], and it shares many features with [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], also a multiple-dispatch-oriented dynamic language (which features an [[ALGOL]]-like [[free-form language|free-form]] [[infix notation|infix]] syntax rather than a Lisp-like prefix syntax, while in Julia "everything"<ref name="Learn Julia in Y">{{cite web|url=https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/ |title=Learn Julia in Y Minutes |website=Learnxinyminutes.com |access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> is an [[expression (computer science)|expression]]), and with [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]], another numerical programming language (which features multiple dispatch and a sophisticated parametric type system). While [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS) adds multiple dispatch to Common Lisp, not all functions are generic functions.

In Julia, Dylan, and Fortress, extensibility is the default, and the system's built-in functions are all generic and extensible. In Dylan, multiple dispatch is as fundamental as it is in Julia: all user-defined functions and even basic built-in operations like <code>+</code> are generic. Dylan's type system, however, does not fully support parametric types, which are more typical of the [[generational list of programming languages#ML based|ML lineage of languages]]. By default, CLOS does not allow for dispatch on Common Lisp's parametric types; such extended dispatch semantics can only be added as an extension through the [[Common Lisp Object System#Metaobject Protocol|CLOS Metaobject Protocol]]. By convergent design, Fortress also features multiple dispatch on parametric types; unlike Julia, however, Fortress is statically rather than dynamically typed, with separate compiling and executing phases. The language features are summarized in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Programming language|Language]] !! [[Type system]] !! [[Generic function]]s !! [[Parametric polymorphism|Parametric types]]
|-
| Julia || Dynamic || Default || {{Yes}}
|-
| [[Common Lisp]] || Dynamic || Opt-in || {{Yes2|Yes (but no dispatch)}}
|-
| [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]] || Dynamic || Default || {{Partial}} (no dispatch)
|-
| [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]] || Static || Default || {{Yes}}
|}

An example of the extensibility of Julia, the Unitful.jl package adds support for physical [[unit of measurement|units of measurement]] to the language.

===Interoperability===
Julia has built-in support for calling [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]] language libraries using the <syntaxhighlight lang="julia" inline="">@ccall</syntaxhighlight> macro. Additional libraries allow users to work with [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref>{{Citation |title=PythonCall & JuliaCall |date=2023-10-29 |url=https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl |access-date=2023-10-30 |publisher=JuliaPy}}</ref> [[R (programming language)|R]],<ref>{{Citation |title=RCall.jl |date=2023-10-16 |url=https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl |access-date=2023-10-30 |publisher=JuliaInterop}}</ref> [[C++]],<ref>{{Citation |title=CxxWrap |date=2023-10-28 |url=https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl |access-date=2023-10-30 |publisher=JuliaInterop}}</ref> [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-02 |title=Julia and Spark, Better Together |url=https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2020/06/02/julia-spark.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714205019/https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2020/06/02/julia-spark.html |archive-date=14 July 2020 |website=juliacomputing.com}}</ref> and [[SQL]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Foster |first=Claire |title=SQLREPL.jl |date=2023-10-23 |url=https://github.com/c42f/SQLREPL.jl |access-date=2023-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Noh |first=WooKyoung |title=Octo.jl |date=2023-10-18 |url=https://github.com/wookay/Octo.jl |access-date=2023-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Usage Guide · FunSQL.jl |url=https://mechanicalrabbit.github.io/FunSQL.jl/stable/guide/#Why-FunSQL? |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=mechanicalrabbit.github.io}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=21 October 2022 |title=Using Julia with Oracle Databases |url=https://blogs.oracle.com/timesten/post/using-julia-with-oracle-database}}</ref>

===Separately-compiled executables option===
Julia can be compiled to binary [[executable]]s with PackageCompiler.jl.<ref name="PackageCompiler.jl" /> Smaller executables can also be written using a static subset of the language provided by StaticCompiler.jl that does not support [[runtime dispatch]] (nor garbage collection, since excludes the runtime that provides it).<ref>{{Citation |last=Short |first=Tom |title=StaticCompiler |date=2023-10-30 |url=https://github.com/tshort/StaticCompiler.jl |access-date=2023-10-30}}</ref>

The Julia official distribution includes an interactive command-line [[read–eval–print loop]] (REPL),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/|title=The Julia REPL · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> with a searchable history, [[command-line completion|tab completion]], and dedicated help and [[shell (computing)|shell]] modes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/The_REPL|title=Introducing Julia/The REPL - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|quote=you can install the Julia package OhMyREPL.jl [..] which lets you customize the REPL's appearance and behaviour|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> which can be used to experiment and test code quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/|title=Getting Started · The Julia Language|website=docs.julialang.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> The following fragment represents a sample session example where strings are concatenated automatically by println:<ref>See also: {{URL|https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/}} for string interpolation and the <code>string(greet, ", ", whom, ".\n")</code> example for preferred ways to concatenate strings. <!--While the <code>+</code> operator is not used for string concatenation, it could easily be defined to do so.--> Julia has the println and print functions, but also a @printf macro (i.e., not in function form) to eliminate run-time overhead of formatting (unlike the same function in C).</ref>

<syntaxhighlight lang="jlcon">
julia> p(x) = 2x^2 + 1; f(x, y) = 1 + 2p(x)y
julia> println("Hello world!", " I'm on cloud ", f(0, 4), " as Julia supports recognizable syntax!")
Hello world! I'm on cloud 9 as Julia supports recognizable syntax!
</syntaxhighlight>

The REPL gives user access to the system shell and to help mode, by pressing <code>;</code> or <code>?</code> after the prompt (preceding each command), respectively. It also keeps the history of commands, including between sessions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Julia Documentation|url=https://docs.julialang.org|website=JuliaLang.org|access-date=18 November 2014}}</ref> Code can be tested inside Julia's interactive session or saved into a file with a <code>.jl</code> extension and run from the command line by typing:<ref name="Learn Julia in Y"/>

Julia uses [[UTF-8]] and [[LaTeX]] codes, allowing it to support common math symbols for many operators, such as ∈ for the <code>in</code> operator, typable with <code>\in</code> then pressing {{keypress|TAB}} (i.e. uses [[LaTeX]] codes, or also possible by simply copy-pasting, e.g. {{not a typo|√ and ∛}} possible for [[square root|sqrt]] and [[cube root|cbrt]] functions). Julia has support for the latest Unicode 15.1<ref>{{Cite web |title=support Unicode 15 via utf8proc 2.8 by stevengj · Pull Request #47392 · JuliaLang/julia |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/47392 |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref><!--), (Julia&nbsp;1.11-DEV supports latest 15.1 point release) --> for the languages of the world, even for source code, e.g. variable names (while it's recommened to use English recommended for code for others to read e.g. package names).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-21 |title=support Unicode 14.0.0 (via utf8proc 2.7.0) |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43443 |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=Github |language=en}}</ref>

Julia is supported by [[Project Jupyter|Jupyter]], an online interactive "notebooks" environment,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jupyter.org/ |title=Project Jupyter}}</ref> and [https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl Pluto.jl], a "'''''reactive''''' notebook" (where notebooks are saved as pure Julia files), a possible replacement for the former kind.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Boudreau|first=Emmett|date=2020-10-16|title=Could Pluto Be A Real Jupyter Replacement?|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/could-pluto-be-a-real-jupyter-replacement-6574bfb40cc6|access-date=2020-12-08|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> In addition Posit's (formerly [[RStudio]] Inc's) Quarto publishing system supports Julia, Python, R and Observable [[JavaScript]] (those languages have official support by the company, and can even be weaved together in the same notebook document, more languages are unofficially supported).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Machlis |first=Sharon |date=2022-07-27 |title=RStudio changes name to Posit, expands focus to include Python and VS Code |url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668252/rstudio-changes-name-to-posit-expands-focus-to-include-python-and-vs-code.html |access-date=2023-01-18 |website=InfoWorld |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-20 |title=Heads up!

===Use with other languages===
Julia is in practice [[interoperability|interoperable]] with other languages (e.g. majority of top 10–20 languages in popular use).  is used to call shared library functions individually (such as for written in C or Fortran), and packages are available to allow calling other languages (which do not provide C-exported functions directly) e.g. Python (with PythonCall.jl), R, MATLAB, C# (and other .NET languages with DotNET.jl, from them with JdotNET), JavaScript, Java (and other JVM languages, such as Scala with JavaCall.jl). And packages for other languages allow to call to Julia, e.g. from Python, R, [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], Ruby, or C#. Such as with juliacall (part of PythonCall.jl, pyjulia is a different option) to call from Python and a different JuliaCall package for calling from R. Julia has also been used for hardware, i.e. to compile to [[VHDL]], as a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool (for e.g. [[field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]s).<ref name="HLS/FPGA" />

Julia has packages supporting markup languages such as [[HTML]] (and also for [[HTTP]]), [[XML]], [[JSON]] and [[BSON]], and for [[database]]s (such as PostgreSQL,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home · LibPQ.jl |url=https://invenia.github.io/LibPQ.jl/stable/ |access-date=2022-11-08 |website=invenia.github.io}}</ref> Mongo,<ref name="FunSQL" /> Oracle, including for [[TimesTen]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hood |first=Doug |date=21 October 2022 |title=Using Julia with Oracle Databases |url=https://blogs.oracle.com/timesten/post/using-julia-with-oracle-database}}</ref> MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server,<ref name="FunSQL">{{Cite web |title=Home · FunSQL.jl |url=https://docs.juliahub.com/FunSQL/HGzDG/0.9.2/ |access-date=2022-11-08 |website=docs.juliahub.com}}</ref> Amazon Redshift, Vertica, ODBC) and web use in general.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Genie Builder - Visual Studio Marketplace |url=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenieBuilder.geniebuilder |access-date=2022-11-08 |website=marketplace.visualstudio.com |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-01 |title=How to Build Your First Web App in Julia with Genie.jl 🧞‍♂️ |url=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-web-apps-in-julia/ |access-date=2022-11-08 |website=freeCodeCamp.org |language=en}}</ref>

==Package system==
Julia has a built-in [[package manager]] and includes a default registry system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General|title=JuliaRegistries / General|website=[[GitHub]]|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> Packages are most often distributed as source code hosted on [[GitHub]], though alternatives can also be used just as well. Packages can also be installed as binaries, using artifacts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/artifacts/|title=Pkg.jl - Artifacts|access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref> Julia's package manager is used to query and compile packages, as well as managing environments. Federated package registries are supported, allowing registries other than the official to be added locally.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/registries/|title=Pkg.jl - Registries|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref>

==Implementation==
Julia's core is implemented in Julia and [[C (programming language)|C]],<!--C99, except for 0.4 needing C11 because of static asserts--> together with [[C++]] for the [[LLVM]] dependency. The code parsing and code-lowering were implemented in FemtoLisp, a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] dialect, up to version 1.10.<ref name="JeffBezanson 2019">{{cite web | first=Jeff | last=Bezanson | title=JeffBezanson/femtolisp | website=GitHub | date=6 June 2019 | url=https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp | access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref> Since that version the new pure-Julia package ''JuliaSyntax.jl,'' is used for the parsing (while the old one can still be chosen)<ref>{{Cite web |title=JuliaSyntax |date=2022-08-28 |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaSyntax.jl |publisher=The Julia Programming Language |access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> which improves speed and "greatly improves parser error messages in various cases".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enable JuliaSyntax.jl as an alternative Julia parser by c42f · Pull Request #46372 · JuliaLang/julia |url=https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/46372 |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref> The LLVM compiler infrastructure project is used as the [[Compiler#Back end|back end]] for generating optimized [[machine code]] for all commonly-used platforms.
