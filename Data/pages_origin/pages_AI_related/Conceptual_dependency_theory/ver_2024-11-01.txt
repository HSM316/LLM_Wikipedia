'''Conceptual dependency theory''' is a model of [[natural language understanding]] used in [[artificial intelligence]] systems.

[[Roger Schank]] at [[Stanford University]] introduced the model in 1969, in the early days of artificial intelligence.<ref>[[Roger Schank]], 1969, ''A conceptual dependency parser for natural language'' Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics, Sång-Säby, Sweden pages 1-3</ref> This model was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]] such as [[Robert Wilensky]], Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

Schank developed the model to represent knowledge for natural language input into computers. Partly influenced by the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], his goal was to make the meaning independent of the words used in the input, i.e. two sentences identical in meaning would have a single representation. The system was also intended to draw logical inferences.<ref>Cardiff University on Conceptual dependency theory [http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/AI2/node69.html]</ref>

The model uses the following basic representational tokens:<ref>''Language, mind, and brain'' by Thomas W. Simon, Robert J. Scholes 1982 {{ISBN|0-89859-153-8}} page 105</ref>
:* ''real world objects'', each with some ''attributes''. 
:* ''real world actions'', each with attributes
:* ''times'' 
:* ''locations''

A set of ''conceptual transitions'' then act on this representation, e.g. an ATRANS is used to represent a transfer such as "give" or "take" while a PTRANS is used to act on locations such as "move" or "go". An MTRANS represents mental acts such as "tell", etc.

A sentence such as "John gave a book to Mary" is then represented as the action of an ATRANS on two real world objects, John and Mary.
