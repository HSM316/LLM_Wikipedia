In [[computer science]], '''semantic knowledge management''' is a set of practices that seeks to [[Classification|classify]] content so that the [[Knowledge management|knowledge]] it contains may be immediately accessed and transformed for [[Digital distribution|delivery]] to the desired audience, in the required format. This classification of content is [[Semantics|semantic]] in its nature &ndash; identifying content by its type or meaning within the content itself and via external, descriptive [[metadata]] â€“ and is achieved by employing [[XML]] technologies.

The specific outcomes of these practices are:
* Maintain content for multiple audiences together in a single document 
* Transform content into various [[Content format|delivery formats]] without re-authoring
* [[Search engine technology|Search]] for content more effectively 
* Involve more [[subject-matter expert]]s in the [[Content creation|creation of content]] without reducing quality 
* Reduce production costs for delivery formats 
* Reduce the manual administration of getting the right knowledge to the right people 
* Reduce the cost and time to [[Language localisation|localize]] content
