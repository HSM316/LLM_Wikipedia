The '''Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition''' ('''IHMC''') is a not-for-profit research institute of the [[State University System of Florida]], with locations in [[Pensacola]] and [[Ocala]], Florida. IHMC scientists and engineers investigate a broad range of topics related to building technological systems aimed at amplifying and extending human cognitive, physical and perceptual capacities. These include [[artificial intelligence]], robotics, human-centered computing, [[Agile software development|agile]] and [[distributed computing]] and many related areas.<ref>"Manning up: IHMC Explores the Intersection of Man and Machine."

==History==
1990—IHMC is founded as a research institute by Dr. [[Kenneth M. Ford]] and Dr. Alberto Cañas on the campus of the [[University of West Florida]], growing primarily out of the computer science and psychology departments.<ref>Kenneth M. Ford, et al. "Coordinating Behavior of Distributed Systems," AI Magazine, Summer 2010.    Also: State University System of Florida, Board of Governors; online publication.</ref>

2004—The Florida Legislature, under the K-20 Education Code, establishes IHMC as an independent, statewide research institute.<ref>Florida Statute 1004.447.</ref>   IHMC maintains affiliations with several Florida universities.<ref>State University System of Florida, Board of Governors. Online publication.</ref>

2007—IHMC is recognized by the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] for the institute's impact on downtown Pensacola.<ref>U.S. Economic Development Administration / U.S. Department of Commerce; online publication.</ref>

2008—IHMC director becomes chairman of the [[NASA Advisory Council]].

2010—IHMC opens a new research facility in downtown Ocala in central Florida.<ref>Barnett, Cynthia. "Human, Machine Research Institute Joins Ocala's Downtown". Florida Trend. Summer 2010.</ref>

2013—A team from IHMC competes in the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) Robotics
Challenge, placing first in the [[Virtual Robotics Challenge]] and second in the DRC Trials.<ref name="Markoff 2013">{{cite web | last=Markoff | first=John | title=Japanese Team Dominates Competition to Create Generation of Rescue Robots | website=The New York Times | date=2013-12-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/science/japanese-team-dominates-competition-to-create-rescue-robots.html | accessdate=2016-03-10}}</ref><ref>Davis, Brett.

2014—An IHMC robot sets a new land-speed record for legged robots.<ref>Ackerman, Evan. "This Is What DARPA's Robot Ostrich Will Look Like". IEEE Spectrum. Nov. 14, 2011.     Also: "IHMC robot sets world speed record," IHMC website.</ref>    Also that year, DARPA awards IHMC scientists a $3 million grant to research Big Mechanisms, using computers to analyze vast amounts of research and identify underlying mechanisms in complex systems.<ref>“Big Mechanisms Seeks the ‘Whys’ Hidden in Big Data.” DARPA website, Feb. 20, 2014.  Also: Cohen, Paul R. “DARPA’s Big Mechanisms Program.” DARPA online publication.</ref>

2015—IHMC's team of robotics scientists places second and is awarded $1 million in the final round of the [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]]. The competition pitted bipedal robots from 23 teams from around the world on a course that emulated a disaster area where humans could not safely go. The robots had to drive a car, open a door, turn a valve, throw a switch, cut a hole in a wall, walk over rubble and climb stairs.<ref>Time Magazine, June 8, 2015. "The Iron Man Challenge."
