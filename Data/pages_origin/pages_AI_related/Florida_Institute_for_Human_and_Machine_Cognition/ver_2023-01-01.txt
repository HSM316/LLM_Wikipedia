==History==
IHMC was founded by Dr. [[Kenneth M. Ford]], Dr. Alberto Cañas, and Dr. Bruce Dunn on the campus of the [[University of West Florida]], in 1990.  IHMC was among the first interdisciplinary academic research institutions that allowed computer scientists, philosophers, and cognitive psychologists to collaborate on human centered computing projects.<ref>Kenneth M. Ford, et al. "Coordinating Behavior of Distributed Systems," AI Magazine, Summer 2010. Also: State University System of Florida, Board of Governors; online publication.</ref> IHMC was an early pioneer in human-centered AI, computer-mediated learning, knowledge-based systems and knowledge acquisition, natural language understanding, as well as the philosophical foundations of AI. Early IHMC researchers include [[Henry E. Kyburg Jr.]], [[Clark Glymour]], [[Pat Hayes]], [[James F. Allen (computer scientist)|James F. Allen]], Robert Hoffman, and [[Joseph D. Novak]].<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.197.4167&rep=rep1&type=pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

Over the years, IHMC has developed three core pillars of research: artificial intelligence, robotics, and human performance and resilience. These three research pillars continue to support the original research goal of IHMC, that being to employ science and technology to extend human capabilities.<ref>[https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/pensacola/2022/04/22/institute-human-machine-cognition-closer-turning-downtown-pensacola-lot-into-research-facility/7381116001/ IHMC Research Article PNJ]</ref>

In 2004, the Florida Legislature, under the K-20 Education Code, established IHMC as an independent, statewide research institute.<ref>Florida Statute 1004.447.</ref> IHMC maintains research affiliations with multiple Florida universities.<ref>State University System of Florida, Board of Governors. Online publication.</ref>

In January 2010, IHMC opened a 28,000 square foot research site in Ocala, Florida, strategically located near three major university research partners as well as the central Florida technology corridor. IHMC’s Ocala facilities support computer scientists, engineers, and linguists engaged in research spanning machine learning, natural language understanding, natural language understanding for social cybersecurity, and speech analysis for physiological state determination.<ref>Barnett, Cynthia. "Human, Machine Research Institute Joins Ocala's Downtown". Florida Trend. Summer 2010.</ref><ref>[https://www.ihmc.us/about/aboutihmc/ IHMC Story]</ref>

In 2010 IHMC had been recognized by the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] for the institute's impact on downtown Pensacola.<ref>U.S. Economic Development Administration / U.S. Department of Commerce; online publication.</ref>

The profile of IHMC’s robotics program was enhanced by the team’s participation in the DARPA Robotics Challenge which involved a series of global robotics competitions. This three-year competition pushed humanoid robotics to the realm of usability for first responders in disaster scenarios, partly motivated by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. The Virtual Robotics Challenge, the first of these challenges, saw 26 international teams work to program a virtual humanoid robot avatar to complete multiple tasks modeled after real world challenges that first responders experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/osrf-prepares-for-darpa-virtual-robotics-challenge|title = DARPA's Virtual Robotics Challenge: OSRF Gets Simulator Ready|date = 3 June 2013}}</ref>  The IHMC Robotics team finished first in the Virtual Robotics Challenge, putting the team among eight groups awarded an [[Atlas robot]] built by [[Boston Dynamics]] and funding to compete in the [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]]. In December 2012 the IHMC Robotics team placed second overall in phase two, the DARPA Robotics Trials, and were awarded the funding to compete in the final, three-year leg of the competition.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/DjQx1BT_xts Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140225021741/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjQx1BT_xts&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjQx1BT_xts| title = IHMC Robotics DRC Trials | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>https://www.ocala.com/article/LK/20130704/news/604143826/OS/</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.afcea.org/content/darpa-announces-eight-robotics-challenge-trials-winners|title = DARPA Announces Eight Robotics Challenge Trials Winners| newspaper=Afcea International |date = 7 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="Markoff 2013">{{cite web | last=Markoff | first=John | title=Japanese Team Dominates Competition to Create Generation of Rescue Robots | website=The New York Times | date=2013-12-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/science/japanese-team-dominates-competition-to-create-rescue-robots.html | accessdate=2016-03-10}}</ref><ref>Davis, Brett.
