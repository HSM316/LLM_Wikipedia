==History==
IHMC was founded by Dr. [[Kenneth M. Ford]], Dr. Alberto Cañas, and Dr. Bruce Dunn on the campus of the [[University of West Florida]], in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  IHMC was the first interdisciplinary academic research institution that allowed computer scientists, philosophers, and psychologists to collaborate on human centered computing projects.<ref>Kenneth M. Ford, et al. "Coordinating Behavior of Distributed Systems," AI Magazine, Summer 2010.    Also: State University System of Florida, Board of Governors; online publication.</ref> The first class of IHMC researchers included eminent scholars such as [[Henry E. Kyburg Jr.]], [[Clark Glymour]], [[Pat Hayes]], [[James F. Allen]], Robert Hoffman, and [[Joseph D. Novak]] all of whom are credited for laying the foundational work for how humans interact with machines in the modern world.<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.197.4167&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>

In 2004, after nearly two decades of research as part of the [[University of West Florida]], the Florida Legislature, under the K-20 Education Code, established IHMC as an independent, statewide research institute.<ref>Florida Statute 1004.447.</ref> This classification change allowed IHMC to develop and maintain research affiliations with multiple Florida universities.<ref>State University System of Florida, Board of Governors. Online publication.</ref>  By 2010 IHMC had been recognized by the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] for the institute's impact on downtown Pensacola.<ref>U.S. Economic Development Administration / U.S. Department of Commerce; online publication.</ref>  Around that time, the institute was seeking to expand it's research footprint, which led to IHMC opening a new research facility in downtown Ocala in central Florida.<ref>Barnett, Cynthia. "Human, Machine Research Institute Joins Ocala's Downtown". Florida Trend. Summer 2010.</ref>

In a direct response to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] the [[United States Department of Defense]] began a series of global robotics competitions to push humanoid robots to the realm of usability for first responders in disaster scenarios.  The first leg of these competitions, labeled the Virtual Robotics Challenge, pitted 26 teams from across the globe with the common goal of programming a virtual humanoid robot avatar to complete multiple tasks modeled after real world challenges that first responders experience.<ref>https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/osrf-prepares-for-darpa-virtual-robotics-challenge</ref>  The IHMC Robotics team finished first in the Virtual Robotics Challenge, which awarded the top 8 teams an [[Atlas robot]] built by [[Boston Dynamics]] and funding to compete in the [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]].  In December 2012 the IHMC Robotics team placed second overall in the DARPA Robotics Trials, the first phase of the [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]], which awarded IHMC the funding to compete in the final three year leg of the competition.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/DjQx1BT_xts Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140225021741/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjQx1BT_xts&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjQx1BT_xts| title = IHMC Robotics DRC Trials | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>https://www.ocala.com/article/LK/20130704/news/604143826/OS/</ref><ref>https://www.afcea.org/content/darpa-announces-eight-robotics-challenge-trials-winners</ref><ref name="Markoff 2013">{{cite web | last=Markoff | first=John | title=Japanese Team Dominates Competition to Create Generation of Rescue Robots | website=The New York Times | date=2013-12-22 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/science/japanese-team-dominates-competition-to-create-rescue-robots.html | accessdate=2016-03-10}}</ref><ref>Davis, Brett.
