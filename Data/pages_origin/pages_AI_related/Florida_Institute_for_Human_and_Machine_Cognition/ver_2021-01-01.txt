The '''Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition''' ('''IHMC''') is a not-for-profit research institute of the [[State University System of Florida]], with locations in [[Pensacola]] and [[Ocala]], Florida. IHMC scientists and engineers investigate a broad range of topics related to building technological systems aimed at amplifying and extending human cognitive, physical and perceptual capacities. These include [[artificial intelligence]], robotics, human-centered computing, [[Agile software development|agile]] and [[distributed computing]] and many related areas.<ref>"Manning up: IHMC Explores the Intersection of Man and Machine."

==History==
1990—IHMC is founded as a research institute by Dr. Kenneth M. Ford, Dr. Alberto Cañas, and Dr. Bruce Dunn on the campus of the [[University of West Florida]], growing primarily out of the computer science and psychology departments.<ref>Kenneth M. Ford, et al.

IHMC also supports local education through programs such as its Science Saturdays, I LOVE Science, and robotics open houses and summer camps.<ref>National Robotics Week web site; 2015 Events; iRobot Corp. http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/events.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410090529/http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/events.php |date=2015-04-10 }}</ref>

==Evening Lecture Series==
In early 2000, IHMC began production on the Evening Lecture Series.  Each lecture features a visiting researcher, thought leader, or public figure and focuses on educating the public on a variety of topics. There are over two hundred IHMC Evening Lectures hosted on YouTube as of December 2020. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/user/TheIHMC</ref>
