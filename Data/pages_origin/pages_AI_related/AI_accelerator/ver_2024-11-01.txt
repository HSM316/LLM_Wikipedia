== History ==
Computer systems have frequently complemented the [[central processing unit|CPU]] with special-purpose accelerators for specialized tasks, known as [[coprocessor]]s. Notable [[application-specific integrated circuit|application-specific]] [[expansion card|hardware units]] include [[video card]]s for [[computer graphics|graphic]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[graphics processing unit]]s and [[digital signal processor]]s. As [[deep learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] workloads rose in prominence in the 2010s, specialized hardware units were developed or adapted from existing products to [[hardware acceleration|accelerate]] these tasks.

=== Early attempts ===
First attempts like [[Intel]]'s ETANN 80170NX incorporated analog circuits to compute neural functions.<ref name=ICH_1>{{cite web| title=Inside Track| author=Dvorak, J.C.| url=https://archive.org/details/PC_Magazine_1990_05_29_v9n10/page/n83/mode/2up| publisher=PC Magazine| volume=9| issue=10| date=29 May 1990| access-date=26 December 2023}}</ref>

=== In-memory computing architectures ===
{{Expand section |date=October 2018}}
In June 2017, [[IBM]] researchers announced an architecture in contrast to the [[Von Neumann architecture]] based on [[in-memory processing|in-memory computing]] and [[phase-change memory]] arrays applied to temporal [[Correlation (statistics)|correlation]] detection, intending to generalize the approach to [[heterogeneous computing]] and [[massively parallel]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1706.00511 |author=Abu Sebastian |author2=Tomas Tuma |author3=Nikolaos Papandreou |author4=Manuel Le Gallo |author5=Lukas Kull |author6=Thomas Parnell |author7=Evangelos Eleftheriou |title=Temporal correlation detection using computational phase-change memory |journal=Nature Communications |volume=8 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01481-9 |year=2017 |issue=1 |page=1115 |pmid=29062022 |pmc=5653661|bibcode=2017NatCo...8.1115S }}</ref> In October 2018, IBM researchers announced an architecture based on in-memory processing and [[neuromorphic engineering|modeled on the human brain's synaptic network]] to accelerate [[deep neural network]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-10-brain-inspired-architecture-advance-ai.html |title=A new brain-inspired architecture could improve how computers handle data and advance AI |date=October 3, 2018 |work=American Institute of Physics |access-date=October 5, 2018}}</ref> The system is based on phase-change memory arrays.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1801.06228 |author=Carlos Ríos |author2=Nathan Youngblood |author3=Zengguang Cheng |author4=Manuel Le Gallo |author5=Wolfram H.P.

=== In-memory computing with analog resistive memories ===
In 2019, researchers from Politecnico di Milano found a way to solve systems of linear equations in a few tens of nanoseconds via a single operation. Their algorithm is based on [[in-memory computing]] with analog resistive memories which performs with high efficiencies of time and energy, via conducting [[matrix–vector multiplication]] in one step using Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's law. The researchers showed that a feedback circuit with cross-point resistive memories can solve algebraic problems such as systems of linear equations, matrix eigenvectors, and differential equations in just one step. Such an approach improves computational times drastically in comparison with digital algorithms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Solving matrix equations in one step with cross-point resistive arrays |year=2019 |author=Zhong Sun |author2=Giacomo Pedretti |author3=Elia Ambrosi |author4=Alessandro Bricalli |author5=Wei Wang |author6=Daniele Ielmini |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=116 |issue=10 |pages=4123–4128 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1815682116 |pmid=30782810 |pmc=6410822|bibcode=2019PNAS..116.4123S |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Nomenclature ==
As of 2016, the field is still in flux and vendors are pushing their own marketing term for what amounts to an "AI accelerator", in the hope that their designs and [[application programming interface|APIs]] will become the [[dominant design]]. There is no consensus on the boundary between these devices, nor the exact form they will take; however several examples clearly aim to fill this new space, with a fair amount of overlap in capabilities.

In the past when consumer [[graphics accelerator]]s emerged, the industry eventually adopted [[Nvidia]]'s self-assigned term, "the GPU",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20020111_5424.html |title=NVIDIA launches the World's First Graphics Processing Unit, the GeForce 256|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227145622/http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_20020111_5424.html |archive-date=February 27, 2016 }}</ref>
as the collective noun for "graphics accelerators", which had taken many forms before {{Clarify|text=settling on an overall [[graphics pipeline|pipeline]] implementing a model presented by [[Direct3D]]|date=July 2024}}.

All models of Intel [[Meteor Lake]] processors have a ''Versatile Processor Unit'' (''VPU'') built-in for accelerating [[statistical inference|inference]] for computer vision and deep learning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-to-bring-a-vpu-processor-unit-to-14th-gen-meteor-lake-chips|title=Intel to Bring a 'VPU' Processor Unit to 14th Gen Meteor Lake Chips|website=PCMAG}}</ref>

=== Digital DLPs ===

The major components of DLPs architecture usually include a computation component, the on-chip memory hierarchy, and the control logic that manages the data communication and computing flows.

Regarding the computation component, as most operations in deep learning can be aggregated into vector operations, the most common ways for building computation components in digital DLPs are the [[Multiply–accumulate_operation|MAC]]-based (multiplier-accumulation) organization, either with vector MACs<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> or scalar MACs.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" /> Rather than [[Single_instruction,_multiple_data|SIMD]] or [[Single_instruction,_multiple_threads|SIMT]] in general processing devices, deep learning domain-specific parallelism is better explored on these MAC-based organizations. Regarding the memory hierarchy, as deep learning algorithms require high bandwidth to provide the computation component with sufficient data, DLPs usually employ a relatively larger size (tens of kilobytes or several megabytes) on-chip buffer but with dedicated on-chip data reuse strategy and data exchange strategy to alleviate the burden for memory bandwidth. For example, DianNao, 16 16-in vector MAC, requires 16 × 16 × 2 = 512 16-bit data, i.e., almost 1024&nbsp;GB/s bandwidth requirements between computation components and buffers. With on-chip reuse, such bandwidth requirements are reduced drastically.<ref name=":1" /> Instead of the widely used cache in general processing devices, DLPs always use scratchpad memory as it could provide higher data reuse opportunities by leveraging the relatively regular data access pattern in deep learning algorithms. Regarding the control logic, as the deep learning algorithms keep evolving at a dramatic speed, DLPs start to leverage dedicated ISA (instruction set architecture) to support the deep learning domain flexibly. At first, DianNao used a VLIW-style instruction set where each instruction could finish a layer in a DNN. Cambricon<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Liu|first1=Shaoli|last2=Du|first2=Zidong|last3=Tao|first3=Jinhua|last4=Han|first4=Dong|last5=Luo|first5=Tao|last6=Xie|first6=Yuan|last7=Chen|first7=Yunji|last8=Chen|first8=Tianshi|title=2016 ACM/IEEE 43rd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) |chapter=Cambricon: An Instruction Set Architecture for Neural Networks |date=June 2016|pages=393–405|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/isca.2016.42|isbn=978-1-4673-8947-1}}</ref> introduces the first deep learning domain-specific ISA, which could support more than ten different deep learning algorithms. TPU also reveals five key instructions from the CISC-style ISA.

=== Hybrid DLPs ===

Hybrid DLPs emerge for DNN inference and training acceleration because of their high efficiency. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are one most important type of hybrid DLP. The key design concept of PIM is to bridge the gap between computing and memory, with the following manners: 1) Moving computation components into memory cells, controllers, or memory chips to alleviate the memory wall issue.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Song|first1=Linghao|last2=Qian|first2=Xuehai|last3=Li|first3=Hai|author3-link=Hai Li|last4=Chen|first4=Yiran|title=2017 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) |chapter=PipeLayer: A Pipelined ReRAM-Based Accelerator for Deep Learning |date=February 2017|pages=541–552|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hpca.2017.55|isbn=978-1-5090-4985-1|s2cid=15281419}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Ambrogio|first1=Stefano|last2=Narayanan|first2=Pritish|last3=Tsai|first3=Hsinyu|last4=Shelby|first4=Robert M.|last5=Boybat|first5=Irem|last6=di Nolfo|first6=Carmelo|last7=Sidler|first7=Severin|last8=Giordano|first8=Massimo|last9=Bodini|first9=Martina|last10=Farinha|first10=Nathan C.
