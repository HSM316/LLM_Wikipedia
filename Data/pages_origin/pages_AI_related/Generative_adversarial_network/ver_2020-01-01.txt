A '''generative adversarial network''' ('''GAN''') is a class of [[machine learning]] systems invented by [[Ian Goodfellow]] and his colleagues in 2014.<ref name="GANnips">{{cite conference|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |conference= Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2014) |pages= 2672–2680 |url= https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf |year=2014}}</ref> Two [[neural network]]s contest with each other in a game (in the sense of [[game theory]], often but not always in the form of a [[zero-sum game]]). Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.

==Method==
The [[generative model|''generative'' network]] generates candidates while the [[discriminative model|''discriminative'' network]] evaluates them.<ref name="GANnips"/> The contest operates in terms of data distributions. Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[latent variable|latent space]] to a data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network distinguishes candidates produced by the generator from the true data distribution. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., "fool" the discriminator network by producing novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (are part of the true data distribution)).<ref name="GANnips"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec, Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}</ref>

A known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training it involves presenting it with samples from the training dataset, until it achieves acceptable accuracy. The generator trains based on whether it succeeds in fooling the discriminator. Typically the generator is seeded with randomized input that is sampled from a predefined [[latent variable|latent space]] (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, candidates synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.<ref name="OpenAI_com">{{citation |url=https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/ |title=Generative Models |publisher=[[OpenAI]] |date= |author1=Andrej Karpathy |authorlink1=Andrej Karpathy |author2=Pieter Abbeel|authorlink2=Pieter Abbeel |author3=Greg Brockman |author4=Peter Chen |author5=Vicki Cheung |author6=Rocky Duan |author7=Ian Goodfellow |author8=Durk Kingma |author9=Jonathan Ho |author10=Rein Houthooft |author11=Tim Salimans |author12=John Schulman |author13=Ilya Sutskever |author14=Wojciech Zaremba|accessdate= April 7, 2016}}</ref> The generator is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the discriminator is a [[convolutional neural network]].

A variation of the GANs are used in training a network to generate optimal control inputs to nonlinear dynamical systems. Where the discriminatory network is known as a critic that checks the optimality of the solution and the generative network is known as an Adaptive network that generates the optimal control. The critic and adaptive network train each other to approximate a nonlinear optimal control.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A single network adaptive critic (SNAC) architecture for optimal control synthesis for a class of nonlinear systems|journal = Neural Networks|volume = 19|issue = 10|pages = 1648–1660|last=Padhi|first=Radhakant|last2=Unnikrishnan|first2=Nishant|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2006.08.010|pmid = 17045458|year = 2006}}</ref>

Beginning in 2017, GAN technology began to make its presence felt in the fine arts arena with the appearance of a newly developed implementation which was said to have crossed the threshold of being able to generate unique and appealing abstract paintings, and thus dubbed a "CAN", for "creative adversarial network".<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1706.07068|title=CAN: Creative Adversarial Networks, Generating "Art" by Learning About Styles and Deviating from Style Norms|first1=Ahmed |last1=Elgammal |first2=Bingchen |last2=Liu |first3=Mohamed |last3=Elhoseiny |first4=Marian |last4=Mazzone |class=cs.AI |year=2017}}</ref> A GAN system was used to create the 2018 painting ''[[Edmond de Belamy]],'' which sold for US$432,500.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html|title=AI Art at Christie's Sells for $432,500|last1=Cohn|first1=Gabe|date=2018-10-25|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> An early 2019 article by members of the original CAN team discussed further progress with that system, and gave consideration as well to the overall prospects for an AI-enabled art.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mazzone, Marian |author2=Ahmed Elgammal|date=21 February 2019|title=Art, Creativity, and the Potential of Artificial Intelligence|journal=Arts|volume=8|pages=26|doi=10.3390/arts8010026}}</ref>

In May 2019, researchers at Samsung demonstrated a GAN-based system that produces videos of a person speaking given only a single photo of that person.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kulp |first1=Patrick |title=Samsung's AI Lab Can Create Fake Video Footage From a Single Headshot |url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/samsungs-ai-lab-can-create-fake-video-footage-from-a-single-headshot/ |publisher=AdWeek |date=May 23, 2019}}</ref>

In August 2019, A large dataset consisting of 12,197 MIDI songs each with paired lyrics and melody alignment was created for neural melody generation from lyrics using conditional GAN-LSTM (refer to sources at GitHub [https://github.com/yy1lab/Lyrics-Conditioned-Neural-Melody-Generation AI Melody Generation from Lyrics]).<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1908.05551 |title=Conditional LSTM-GAN for Melody Generation from Lyrics

== Classification ==

=== Bidirectional GAN===
Bidirectional GAN(BiGAN) aims to introduce a generator model to act as the discriminator, whereby the discriminator naturally considers the entire translation space so that the inadequate training problem can be alleviated. To satisfy this property, generator and discriminator are both designed to model the joint probability of sentence pairs, with the difference that, the generator decomposes the joint probability with a source language model and a source-to-target translation model, while the discriminator is formulated as a target language model and a target-to-source translation model. To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively. Two GANs are alternately trained to update the parameters. The resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=Zhirui Zhang |author2=Shujie Liu |author3=Mu Li |author4=Ming Zhou |author5=Enhong Chen|date=October 2018|title=Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks for Neural Machine Translation|url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K18-1019.pdf|journal=|volume=Proceedings of the 22nd Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning|pages=190–199|via=}}</ref>
