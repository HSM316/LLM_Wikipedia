Incorporation of these core functionalities guarantees the successful implementation of Industrial AI and would lead to enormous benefits that didn't exist before.

Recently, to accelerate leadership in AI initiative, the US government launched an official website AI.gov to highlight its priorities in the AI space.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|title= Artificial Intelligence for the American People|url= https://www.whitehouse.gov/ai/|publisher=The White House|accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> There are several reasons for the recent popularity of industrial AI: More affordable sensors and the automated process of data acquisition; More powerful computation capability of computers to perform more complex tasks at a faster speed with lower cost; Faster connectivity infrastructure and more accessible cloud services for data management and computing power outsourcing.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|last1=Schatsky|first1=David|last2=Muraskin|first2=Craig|last3=Gurumurthy|first3=Ragu|title=Cognitive technologies: The real opportunities for business|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/tr/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/cognitive-technologies.html|publisher=Deloitte Review}}</ref> However, the technology alone never creates any business value if the problems in industry are not well studied. The major categories which industrial AI may contribute to include; product and service innovation, process improvement, and insight discovery.<ref name=":5" />

== Categories ==

=== Product applications for user value creation ===

Industrial AI can be embedded to existing products or services to make them more effective, reliable, safer, and to enhance their longevity.<ref name=":5" /> The automotive industry, for example, uses computer vision to avoid accidents and enable vehicles to stay in lane, facilitating safer driving. In manufacturing, one example is the prediction of blade life for self-aware [[Bandsaw|band saw]] machines, so that users will be able to rely on evidence of degradation rather than experience, which is safer, will extend blade life, and build up blade usage profile to help blade selection.<ref>{{cite web|title=【世界翻轉中】不怕機器翻臉　感應器讀懂它的心！ - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFlmZgbbWBA|website=Youtube|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Shanhu|last2=Begheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|last4=Lee|first4=Jay|date=2015|title=A Unified Framework and Platform for Designing of Cloud-Based Machine Health Monitoring and Manufacturing Systems|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering|volume=137|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4030669}}</ref>

Industrial AI can create new products and novel business models.<ref name=":5" /> [[Predix (software)|Predix]] by [[General Electric]] is a [[Cloud Foundry]] that serves as an industrial operating system for narrow AI application development.<ref name=":2" /> InsightCM™<ref>{{cite web|title=NI InsightCMTM Enterprise for Condition Monitoring - National Instruments|url=http://www.ni.com/insightcm/|website=National Instruments|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> by [[National Instruments]] and Watchdog Agent® Toolbox<ref>{{cite web|title=Watchdog AgentTM Prognostics Toolkit for LabVIEW - IMS Center|url=http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/210191|website=National Instruments|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> on the [[LabVIEW]] platform also provide software analytical capabilities. The aforementioned band saw machine manufacturer also announced their service center system to help users improve equipment reliability and sawing efficiency as a novel business model.<ref>{{cite web|title=Service Center Equipment Brands|url=http://www.metalcenternews.com/Portals/51/PDF_Files/1505_Top5_ServiceCenters.pdf|website=Metal Center News|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>

=== Process applications for productivity improvement ===
Automation is one of the major aspects in process applications of industrial AI.<ref name=":5" /> With the help of AI, the scope and pace of automation have been fundamentally changed.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Chui|first2=Michael|last3=Miremadi|first3=Mehdi|last4=Bughin|first4=Jacques|last5=George|first5=Katy|last6=Willmott|first6=Paul|last7=Dewhurst|first7=Martin|date=2017|title=A Future that Works: Automation, Employment, and Productivity|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/MGI-A-future-that-works-Executive-summary.ashx|journal=|volume=|pages=|last1=Manyika|first1=James|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> AI technologies boost the performance and expand the capability of conventional AI applications. An example is the [[collaborative robots]]. Collaborative robotic arms are able to learn the motion and path demonstrated by human operators and perform the same task.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Does Collaborative Robot Mean ?|url=http://blog.robotiq.com/what-does-collaborative-robot-mean|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> AI also automates the process that used to require human participation. An example is the Hong Kong subway, where an AI program decides the distribution and job scheduling of engineers with more efficiency and reliability than human counterparts do.

Another aspect of process applications is the modeling large-scale systems.<ref name=":5" /> [[Cyber manufacturing|Cybermanufacturing]] systems are defined as a manufacturing service system that is networked and resilient to faults by evidence-based modeling and data-driven [[deep learning]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> Such a system deals with large and usually geographically distributed assets, which is hard to be modeled via conventional individual-asset physics-based model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Chao|last2=Djurdjanovic|first2=Dragan|last3=Ardakani Davari|first3=Hossein|last4=Wang|first4=Keren|last5=Buzza|first5=Mathew|last6=Begheri|first6=Behrad|last7=Brown|first7=Patrick|last8=Lee|first8=Jay|title=A comprehensive framework of factory-to-factory dynamic fleet-level prognostics and operation management for geographically distributed assets|journal=2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)|date=2015|pages=225–230|doi=10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294066|isbn=978-1-4673-8183-3}}</ref> With machine learning and optimization algorithms, a bottom-up framework considering machine health can leverage large samples of assets and automate the operation management, spare part inventory planning, and maintenance scheduling process.

=== Insight applications for knowledge discovery ===
Industrial AI can also be used for [[knowledge discovery]] by identifying insights in engineering systems.<ref name=":5" /> In aviation and aeronautics, AI has been playing a vital role in many critical areas, one of which is safety assurance and root cause. NASA is trying to proactively manage risks to aircraft safety by analyzing flight numeric data and text reports in parallel to not only detect anomalies but also relate it to the causal factors. This mined insight of why certain faults happen in the past will shed light on predictions of similar incidents in the future and prevent problems before they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Laskowski|first1=Nicole|title=NASA uses text analytics to bolster aviation safety|url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/NASA-uses-text-analytics-to-bolster-aviation-safety|website=TechTarget Network|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>

[[Predictive maintenance|Predictive]] and [[preventive maintenance]] through data-driven [[machine learning]] is also critical in cost reduction for industrial applications. [[Prognostics]] and health management ([[Prognostics and health management|PHM]]) programs capture the opportunities at the shop floor by modeling equipment health degradation. The obtained information can be used for efficiency improvement and quality improvement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Lapira|first2=Edzel|title=Prognostics and health management tools for semiconductor manufacturing predictability|journal=Nanochip|date=2011|pages=11–15|url=http://imscenter.net/IMS_news/AGS_Nanochip.pdf}}</ref> Please see [[intelligent maintenance system]] for more reference.

== Challenges ==
The challenges of industrial AI to unlock the value lies in the transformation of raw data to intelligent predictions for rapid decision-making. In general, there are four major challenges in realizing industrial AI.<ref name=":0" />

=== Data ===
Engineering systems now generate a lot of data and modern industry is indeed a [[big data]] environment. However, industrial data usually is structured, but may be low-quality. The “3B” issues of [[industrial big data]] is:<ref name="Industrial Big Data">{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|title=Industrial Big Data|date=2015|publisher=Mechanical Industry Press|location=China|isbn=978-7-111-50624-9}}</ref>
* Bad
The quality of the data may be poor, and unlike other consumer-faced applications, data from industrial systems usually have clear physical meanings, which makes it harder to compensate the quality with volume.
* Broken
Data collected for training machine learning models usually is lacking a comprehensive set of working conditions and health states/fault modes, which may cause false positives and false negatives in online implementation of AI systems.
* Background
Industrial data patterns can be highly transient and interpreting them requires domain expertise, which can hardly be harnessed by merely mining numeric data.

=== Speed ===
Production process happens fast and the equipment and work piece can be expensive, the AI applications need to be applied in real-time to be able to detect anomalies immediately to avoid waste and other consequences. Cloud-based solutions can be powerful and fast, but they still would not fit certain computation efficiency requirements. Edge computing may be a better choice in such scenario.<ref name=":0" />

=== High fidelity requirement ===
Unlike consumer-faced AI recommendations systems which have a high tolerance for false positives and negatives, even a very low rate of false positives or negatives rate may cost the total credibility of AI systems. Industrial AI applications are usually dealing with critical issues related to safety, reliability, and operations. Any failure in predictions could incur a negative economic and/or safety impact on the users and discourage them to rely on AI systems.<ref name=":0" />

=== Interpretability ===
Besides prediction accuracy and performance fidelity, the industrial AI systems must also go beyond prediction results and give root cause analysis for anomalies. This requires that during development, data scientists need to work with domain experts and include [[domain know-how]] into the modeling process, and have the model adaptively learn and accumulate such insights as knowledge.<ref name=":0" />
