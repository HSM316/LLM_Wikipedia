{{short description|Methods and techniques in the application of artificial intelligence technology}}
'''Explainable AI''' ('''XAI''')  refers to methods and techniques in the application of [[artificial intelligence]] technology (AI) such that the results of the solution can be understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the "[[black box]]" in machine learning where even their designers cannot explain why the AI arrived at a specific decision.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=Computer says no: why making AIs fair, accountable and transparent is crucial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=the Guardian |date=5 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> XAI may be an implementation of the social [[right to explanation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the Algorithm?

The technical challenge of explaining AI decisions is sometimes known as the '''interpretability problem'''.<ref name="science">{{cite journal|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|accessdate=30 January 2018|journal=Science|date=5 July 2017|language=en}}.</ref> Another consideration is ''[[Information overload|infobesity]]'' (overload of information), thus, ''full transparency'' may not be always possible or even required. However, simplification at the cost of misleading users in order to increase trust or to hide undesirable attributes of the system should be avoided by allowing a tradeoff between interpretability and completeness of an explanation.<ref>{{cite arxiv| last1=Gilpin | first1=Leilani H. | last2=Bau | first2=David | last3=Yuan | first3=Ben Z. | last4=Bajwa | first4=Ayesha | last5=Specter | first5=Michael | last6=Kagal | first6=Lalana | date=2018-05-31 | title=Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning | eprint=1806.00069 | class=stat.AI}}</ref>

AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically-specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.<ref name=science/>

== Goals ==
Cooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]], in this case algorithms and humans, depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formalization of trust criteria is a barrier to straightforward optimization approaches. For that reason, interpretability and explainability are posited as intermediate goals for checking other criteria.<ref name=dosilovic2018>{{cite conference |url=http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey |last1=Dosilovic |first1=Filip |last2=Brcic |first2=Mario |last3=Hlupic |first3=Nikica |date=2018-05-25|book-title=MIPRO 2018 - 41st International Convention Proceedings |pages=210–215 |location=Opatija, Croatia |conference=MIPRO 2018 |doi=10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400040 }}</ref>

AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with [[image recognition]] learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.<ref name=guardian/> In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.<ref>{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk's AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop", without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users should be able to understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact), and should be able to determine when to trust the AI and when the AI should be distrusted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence|website=DARPA|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Holzinger|first1=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}</ref> Other applications of XAI are [[knowledge extraction]] from black-box models and model comparisons.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biecek|first=Przemyslaw|title= DALEX: explainers for complex predictive models|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=19|pages=1–5|arxiv=1806.08915|date=23 June 2018|bibcode=2018arXiv180608915B}}</ref> The term "glass box" has also been used to systems that monitor the inputs and outputs of a system, with the purpose of verifying the system's adherence to ethical and socio-legal values and, therefore, producing value-based explanations.<ref name="Aler Tubella Theodorou Dignum Dignum 2019 p.

== History and methods ==

During the 1970s to 1990s, symbolic reasoning systems, such as [[Mycin|MYCIN]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fagan |first1=L. M. |last2=Shortliffe |first2=E. H. |last3=Buchanan |first3=B.

MYCIN, developed in the early 1970s as a research prototype for diagnosing [[bacteremia]] infections of the bloodstream, could explain <ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Lent |first1=M. |last2=Fisher |first2=W. |last3=Mancuso |first3=M. |date=July 2004 |chapter=An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior |title=Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence |pages=900–907 |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=AAAI Press |isbn=0262511835}}</ref> which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case. Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] developed systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an 'articulate expert', explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.

In the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, rule-based, and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360–362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:
{{Quote
|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: "Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.  Socrates was mortal because he was a man and all men are mortal.  Socrates drank poison because he held dissident beliefs, the government was conservative, and those holding conservative dissident beliefs under conservative governments must drink poison."<ref name="RMS">{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-06157-0| last1 = Forbus| first1 = Kenneth| last2 = De Kleer| first2 = Johan| title = Building Problem Solvers| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| date = 1993}}</ref>{{rp|164–165}}

== Regulation ==

As regulators, official bodies and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for decision making processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).<ref>{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI |accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>

The European Union introduced a [[right to explanation]] in [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Right (GDPR)]] as an attempt to deal with the potential problems stemming from the rising importance of algorithms. The implementation of the regulation began in 2018. However, the right to explanation in GDPR covers only the local aspect of interpretability. In the United States, insurance companies are required to be able to explain their rate and coverage decisions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=Artificial Intelligence Has Some Explaining to Do |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/artificial-intelligence-has-some-explaining-to-do |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>
