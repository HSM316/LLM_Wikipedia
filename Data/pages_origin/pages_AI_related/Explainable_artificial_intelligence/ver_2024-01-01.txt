AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command "maximize the accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset." The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as "reviews containing the word "horrible" are likely to be negative." However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are likely to fail to generalize outside the training set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair." A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea of how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test set.<ref name="science">{{cite journal|date=5 July 2017|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|journal=Science|language=en|access-date=30 January 2018}}.</ref>

== Goals ==
Cooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]] – in this case, algorithms and humans – depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formal trust criteria is a barrier to optimization. Transparency, interpretability, and explainability are intermediate goals on the road to these more comprehensive trust criteria.<ref name=dosilovic2018>{{cite conference |url=http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey |last1=Dosilovic |first1=Filip |last2=Brcic |first2=Mario |last3=Hlupic |first3=Nikica |date=2018-05-25 |book-title=MIPRO 2018 - 41st International Convention Proceedings |pages=210–215 |location=Opatija, Croatia |conference=MIPRO 2018 |doi=10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400040 |isbn=978-953-233-095-3 |access-date=2018-12-09 |archive-date=2018-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210110820/http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is particularly relevant in medicine,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bernal |first1=Jose |last2=Mazo |first2=Claudia |date=2022-10-11 |title=Transparency of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Insights from Professionals in Computing and Healthcare Worldwide |journal=Applied Sciences |language=en |volume=12 |issue=20 |pages=10228 |doi=10.3390/app122010228 |issn=2076-3417|doi-access=free }}</ref> especially with [[clinical decision support system]]s (CDSS), in which medical professionals should be able to understand how and why a machine-based decision was made in order to trust the decision and augment their decision-making process.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Antoniadi |first1=Anna Markella |last2=Du |first2=Yuhan |last3=Guendouz |first3=Yasmine |last4=Wei |first4=Lan |last5=Mazo |first5=Claudia |last6=Becker |first6=Brett A. |last7=Mooney |first7=Catherine |date=January 2021 |title=Current Challenges and Future Opportunities for XAI in Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems: A Systematic Review |journal=Applied Sciences |language=en |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=5088 |doi=10.3390/app11115088 |issn=2076-3417|doi-access=free }}</ref>

AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data but do not reflect the more nuanced implicit desires of the human system designers or the full complexity of the domain data. For example, a 2017 system tasked with [[image recognition]] learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.<ref name=guardian/> In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.<ref>{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk's AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|access-date=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|access-date=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "[[human-in-the-loop]]" without greatly sacrificing AI performance.

The term "glass box" is often used in contrast to "black box" systems, which lack transparency and can be more difficult to monitor and regulate.<ref>Rai, Arun.

MYCIN, developed in the early 1970s as a research prototype for diagnosing [[bacteremia]] infections of the bloodstream, could explain<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Lent |first1=M. |last2=Fisher |first2=W. |last3=Mancuso |first3=M. |date=July 2004 |chapter=An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior |title=Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence |pages=900–907 |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=AAAI Press |isbn=0262511835}}</ref> which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case. Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] resulted in developing systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an "articulate expert", explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain the strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, made use of explicit representations of explanations expressed in a dedicated explanation language, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.<ref name=":1" />

In the 1980s through the early 1990s, [[Truth-maintenance systems|truth maintenance systems]] (TMS) extended the capabilities of causal-reasoning, [[Rule-based system|rule-based]], and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360–362}} A TMS explicitly tracks alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide an explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces. As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:
{{Blockquote
|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: "Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.

== Regulation ==

As regulators, official bodies, and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for [[automated decision-making]] processes to ensure trust and transparency. The first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline was the 2017 [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).<ref>{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI|access-date=17 July 2017|archive-date=4 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404131609/http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The European Union introduced a [[right to explanation]] in the [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Right (GDPR)]] to address potential problems stemming from the rising importance of algorithms. The implementation of the regulation began in 2018. However, the right to explanation in GDPR covers only the local aspect of interpretability. In the United States, insurance companies are required to be able to explain their rate and coverage decisions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=Artificial Intelligence Has Some Explaining to Do |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/artificial-intelligence-has-some-explaining-to-do |access-date=17 December 2018 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref> In France the [[Loi pour une République numérique]] (Digital Republic Act) grants subjects the right to request and receive information pertaining to the implementation of algorithms that process data about them.

== Limitations ==
Despite ongoing endeavors to enhance the explainability of AI models, they persist with several inherent limitations.

=== Adversarial parties ===
By making an AI system more explainable, we also reveal more of its inner workings. For example, the explainability method of feature importance identifies features or variables that are most important in determining the model's output, while the influential samples method identifies the training samples that are most influential in determining the output, given a particular input.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment">{{cite book | last1=Bhatt | first1=Umang | last2=Xiang | first2=Alice | last3=Sharma | first3=Shubham | last4=Weller | first4=Adrian | last5=Taly | first5=Ankur | last6=Jia | first6=Yunhan | last7=Ghosh | first7=Joydeep | last8=Puri | first8=Richir | last9=M.F. Moura | first9=José | last10=Eckersley | first10=Peter | title=Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency | chapter=Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment | date=2022 | pages=648–657 | doi=10.1145/3351095.3375624 | isbn=9781450369367 | s2cid=202572724 | chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3351095.3375624 }}</ref> Adversarial parties could take advantage of this knowledge.

For example, competitor firms could replicate aspects of the original AI system in their own product, thus reducing competitive advantage.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'">{{cite journal | last1=Burrel | first1=Jenna | title=How the machine 'thinks': Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms | series=Big Data & Society | date=2016 | volume=3 | issue=1 | doi=10.1177/2053951715622512 | s2cid=61330970 | url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951715622512 }}</ref> An explainable AI system is also susceptible to being “gamed”—influenced in a way that undermines its intended purpose. One study gives the example of a predictive policing system; in this case, those who could potentially “game” the system are the criminals subject to the system's decisions. In this study, developers of the system discussed the issue of criminal gangs looking to illegally obtain passports, and they expressed concerns that, if given an idea of what factors might trigger an alert in the passport application process, those gangs would be able to “send guinea pigs” to test those triggers, eventually finding a loophole that would allow them to “reliably get passports from under the noses of the authorities”.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Veale | first1=Michael | last2=Van Kleek | first2=Max | last3=Binns | first3=Reuben | title=Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | chapter=Fairness and Accountability Design Needs for Algorithmic Support in High-Stakes Public Sector Decision-Making | date=2018 | volume=40 | pages=1–14 | doi=10.1145/3173574.3174014 | isbn=9781450356206 | s2cid=3639135 | chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3174014 }}</ref>

=== Technical complexity ===
A fundamental barrier to making AI systems explainable is the technical complexity of such systems. End users often lack the coding knowledge required to understand software of any kind. Current methods used to explain AI are mainly technical ones, geared toward machine learning engineers for debugging purposes, rather than toward the end users who are ultimately affected by the system, causing “a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency”.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment" /> Proposed solutions to address the issue of technical complexity include either promoting the coding education of the general public so technical explanations would be more accessible to end users, or providing explanations in layperson terms.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'" />

The solution must avoid oversimplification. It is important to strike a balance between accuracy – how faithfully the explanation reflects the process of the AI system – and explainability – how well end users understand the process. This is a difficult balance to strike, since the complexity of machine learning makes it difficult for even ML engineers to fully understand, let alone non-experts.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment" />

=== Understanding versus trust ===
The goal of explainability to end users of AI systems is to increase trust in the systems, even “address concerns about lack of ‘fairness’ and discriminatory effects”.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'" /> However, even with a good understanding of an AI system, end users may not necessarily trust the system.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Tongxi |last2=Zhang |first2=Xuesong |last3=Bohrer |first3=Gil |last4=Liu |first4=Yanlan |last5=Zhou |first5=Yuyu |last6=Martin |first6=Jay |last7=LI |first7=Yang |last8=Zhao |first8=Kaiguang |title=Crop yield prediction via explainable AI and interpretable machine learning: Dangers of black box models for evaluating climate change impacts on crop yield|journal=Agricultural and Forest Meteorology |date=2023 |volume=336 |page=109458 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109458 |s2cid=258552400 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192323001508}}</ref> In one study, participants were presented with combinations of white-box and black-box explanations, and static and interactive explanations of AI systems. While these explanations served to increase both their self-reported and objective understanding, it had no impact on their level of trust, which remained skeptical.<ref name="Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI">{{cite book | last1=Cheng | first1=Hao-Fei | last2=Wang | first2=Ruotang | last3=Zhang | first3=Zheng | last4=O’Connell | first4=Fiona | last5=Gray | first5=Terrance | last6=Harper | first6= F. Maxwell | last7=Zhu | first7=Haiyi | title=Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI: Strategies to Help Non-Expert Stakeholders | series=Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | date=2019 | volume=559 | pages=1–12 | doi=10.1145/3290605.3300789 | isbn=9781450359702 | s2cid=140281803 | url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290605.3300789 }}</ref>

This outcome was especially true for decisions that impacted the end user in a significant way, such as graduate school admissions. Participants judged algorithms to be too inflexible and unforgiving in comparison to human decision-makers; instead of rigidly adhering to a set of rules, humans are able to consider exceptional cases as well as appeals to their initial decision.<ref name="Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI" /> For such decisions, explainability will not necessarily cause end users to accept the use of decision-making algorithms. We will need to either turn to another method to increase trust and acceptance of decision-making algorithms, or question the need to rely solely on AI for such impactful decisions in the first place.

== Criticism ==
Scholars have suggested that explainability in AI should be considered a goal secondary to AI effectiveness, and that encouraging the exclusive development of XAI may limit the functionality of AI more broadly.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Liam G.|last2=Brenna|first2=Connor T.

Moreover, XAI systems have primarily focused on making AI systems understandable to AI practitioners rather than end users, and their results on user perceptions of these systems have been {{vague|text=somewhat fragmented|date=April 2023}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alizadeh|first=Fatemeh|date=2020|title=eXplainable AI: take one step back, move two steps forward|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344491013|journal=Mensch und Computer}}</ref> Some researchers advocate the use of inherently interpretable machine learning models, rather than using post-hoc explanations in which a second model is created to explain the first. This is partly because post-hoc models increase the complexity in a decision pathway and partly because it is often unclear how faithfully a post-hoc explanation can mimic the computations of an entirely separate model.<ref name=":6" /> However, another view is that what is important is that the explanation accomplishes the given task at hand, and whether it is pre or post-hoc doesn't matter. If a post-hoc explanation method helps a doctor diagnose cancer better, it is of secondary importance whether it is a correct/incorrect explanation.

The goals of XAI amount to a form of [[Lossy compression artefact|lossy compression]] that will become less effective as AI models grow in their number of parameters. Along with other factors this leads to a theoretical limit for explainability.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sarkar |first=Advait |date=2022 |title=Is explainable AI a race against model complexity? |url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3124/paper22.pdf |journal=Workshop on Transparency and Explanations in Smart Systems (TeXSS), in Conjunction with ACM Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2022) |pages=192–199 |arxiv=2205.10119 |via=CEUR Workshop Proceedings}}</ref>

=== Voting ===
Cailloux and Endriss<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cailloux |first1=Olivier |last2=Endriss |first2=Ulle |date=2016-05-09 |title=Arguing about Voting Rules |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2936924.2936968 |journal=Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems |series=AAMAS '16 |location=Richland, SC |publisher=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems |pages=287–295 |isbn=978-1-4503-4239-1}}</ref> present a method for explaining voting rules using the [[axiom]]s that characterize them. They exemplify their method on the [[Borda voting|Borda voting rule]] .

Peters, Procaccia, Psomas and Zhou<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Peters |first1=Dominik |last2=Procaccia |first2=Ariel D |last3=Psomas |first3=Alexandros |last4=Zhou |first4=Zixin |date=2020 |title=Explainable Voting |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/10c72a9d42dd07a028ee910f7854da5d-Abstract.html |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=1525–1534}}</ref> present an algorithm for explaining the outcomes of the Borda rule using O(''m''<sup>2</sup>) explanations, and prove that this is tight in the worst case.

=== Participatory budgeting ===
Yang, Hausladen, Peters, Pournaras, Fricker and Helbing<ref name=":12">{{Cite arXiv |eprint=2310.03501 |class=cs.HC |first1=Joshua C. |last1=Yang |first2=Carina I. |last2=Hausladen |title=Designing Digital Voting Systems for Citizens: Achieving Fairness and Legitimacy in Digital Participatory Budgeting |date=2023 |last3=Peters |first3=Dominik |last4=Pournaras |first4=Evangelos |author5=Regula Häenggli Fricker |last6=Helbing |first6=Dirk}}</ref> present an empirical study of explainability in [[participatory budgeting]]. They compared the Greedy and the [[Method of Equal Shares|Equal Shares]] rules, and three types of explanations: ''mechanism explanation'' (a general explanation of how the aggregation rule works given the voting input), ''individual explanation'' (explaining how many voters had at least one approved project, at least 10000 CHF in approved projects), and ''group explanation'' (explaining how the budget is distributed among the districts and topics). They compared the perceived ''trustworthyness'' and ''fairness'' of Greedy and Equal Shares, before and after the explanations. They found out that, for MES, Mechanism explanation yields the highest increase in perceived fairness and trustworthiness; the second-highest was Group explanation. For Greedy, Mechanims explanation increases perceived trustworthiness but not fairness, whereas Individual explanation increases both perceived fairness and trustworthiness. Group explanation ''decreases'' the perceived fairness and trustworthiness.

=== Payoff allocation ===
Nizri, Azaria and Hazon<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nizri |first1=Meir |last2=Hazon |first2=Noam |last3=Azaria |first3=Amos |date=2022-06-28 |title=Explainable Shapley-Based Allocation (Student Abstract) |url=https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21648 |journal=Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence |language=en |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=13023–13024 |doi=10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21648 |s2cid=250296641 |issn=2374-3468}}</ref> present an algorithm for computing explanations for the [[Shapley value]]. Given a coalitional game, their algorithm  decomposes it to sub-games, for which it is easy to generate verbal explanations based on the axioms characterizing the Shapley value. The payoff allocation for each sub-game is perceived as fair, so the Shapley-based payoff allocation for the given game should seem fair as well. An experiment with 210 human subjects shows that, with their automatically generated explanations, subjects perceive Shapley-based payoff allocation as significantly fairer than with a general standard explanation.
