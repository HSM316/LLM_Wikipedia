'''Explainable AI''' ('''XAI''')  refers to methods and techniques in the application of [[artificial intelligence]] technology (AI) such that the results of the solution can be understood by human experts. It contrasts with the concept of the "[[black box]]" in machine learning where even their designers cannot explain why the AI arrived at a specific decision.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=Computer says no: why making AIs fair, accountable and transparent is crucial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=the Guardian |date=5 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> XAI is an implementation of the social [[right to explanation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the Algorithm?

The technical challenge of explaining AI decisions is sometimes known as the '''interpretability problem'''.<ref name="science">{{cite news|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=5 July 2017|language=en}}.</ref> Another consideration is ''info-besity'' (overload of information), thus, ''full transparency'' may not be always possible or even required.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} 

AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically-specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test-set, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible'" are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.<ref name=science/>

== Goals ==
Cooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]], in this case algorithms and humans, depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formalization of trust criteria is a barrier to straightforward optimization approaches. For that reason, interpretability and explainability are posited as intermediate goals for checking other criteria.<ref name=dosilovic2018>{{cite conference |url=http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey |last1=Dosilovic |first1=Filip |last2=Brcic |first2=Mario |last3=Hlupic |first3=Nikica |date=2018-05-25|book-title=MIPRO 2018 - 41st International Convention Proceedings |pages=210–215 |location=Opatija, Croatia |conference=MIPRO 2018 |doi=10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400040 }}</ref>

AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with [[image recognition]] learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.<ref name=guardian/> In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.<ref>{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk's AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop", without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users should be able to understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact), and should be able to determine when to trust the AI and when the AI should be distrusted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence|website=DARPA|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}</ref> Other applications of XAI are knowledge extraction from black-box models and model comparisons.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biecek|first=Przemyslaw|title= DALEX: explainers for complex predictive models|journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=19|pages=1–5|arxiv=1806.08915|date=23 June 2018|bibcode=2018arXiv180608915B}}</ref>.

== History and methods ==
[[Mycin]], a research prototype that could explain which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case, was developed in the early 1970s.<ref>Van Lent, M., Fisher, W., & Mancuso, M.

By the 1990s researchers also began studying whether it is possible to meaningfully extract the non-hand-coded rules being generated by opaque trained neural networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tickle|first=A.

== Regulation ==

As regulators, official bodies and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for decision making processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).<ref>{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI |accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>

European Union introduced a [[right to explanation]] in [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Right (GDPR)]] as an attempt to deal with the potential problems stemming from the rising importance of algorithms. The implementation of the regulation began in 2018. However, the right to explanation in GDPR covers only the local aspect of interpretability. In the United States, insurance companies are required to be able to explain their rate and coverage decisions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=Artificial Intelligence Has Some Explaining to Do |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/artificial-intelligence-has-some-explaining-to-do |accessdate=17 December 2018 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>
