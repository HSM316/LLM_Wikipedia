AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.<ref name="science">{{cite journal|date=5 July 2017|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|journal=Science|language=en|access-date=30 January 2018}}.</ref>

== Goals ==
Cooperation between [[Agency (sociology)|agents]], in this case algorithms and humans, depends on trust. If humans are to accept algorithmic prescriptions, they need to trust them. Incompleteness in formalization of trust criteria is a barrier to straightforward optimization approaches. For that reason, transparency, interpretability and explainability are posited as intermediate goals for checking other criteria.<ref name=dosilovic2018>{{cite conference |url=http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey |last1=Dosilovic |first1=Filip |last2=Brcic |first2=Mario |last3=Hlupic |first3=Nikica |date=2018-05-25 |book-title=MIPRO 2018 - 41st International Convention Proceedings |pages=210–215 |location=Opatija, Croatia |conference=MIPRO 2018 |doi=10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400040 |isbn=978-953-233-095-3 |access-date=2018-12-09 |archive-date=2018-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210110820/http://docs.mipro-proceedings.com/dsdc/dsdc_11_4754.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is particularly relevant in medicine,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bernal |first1=Jose |last2=Mazo |first2=Claudia |date=2022-10-11 |title=Transparency of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Insights from Professionals in Computing and Healthcare Worldwide |journal=Applied Sciences |language=en |volume=12 |issue=20 |pages=10228 |doi=10.3390/app122010228 |issn=2076-3417|doi-access=free }}</ref> especially [[clinical decision support system]]s (CDSS), where medical professionals should be able to understand how and why a machine-based decision has been made in order to trust the decision and augment their decision-making process.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Antoniadi |first1=Anna Markella |last2=Du |first2=Yuhan |last3=Guendouz |first3=Yasmine |last4=Wei |first4=Lan |last5=Mazo |first5=Claudia |last6=Becker |first6=Brett A. |last7=Mooney |first7=Catherine |date=January 2021 |title=Current Challenges and Future Opportunities for XAI in Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems: A Systematic Review |journal=Applied Sciences |language=en |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=5088 |doi=10.3390/app11115088 |issn=2076-3417|doi-access=free }}</ref>

AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with [[image recognition]] learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.<ref name=guardian/> In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.<ref>{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk's AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|access-date=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|access-date=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

== History and methods ==

During the 1970s to 1990s, [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic reasoning systems]], such as [[Mycin|MYCIN]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fagan |first1=L. M. |last2=Shortliffe |first2=E.

MYCIN, developed in the early 1970s as a research prototype for diagnosing [[bacteremia]] infections of the bloodstream, could explain<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Lent |first1=M. |last2=Fisher |first2=W. |last3=Mancuso |first3=M. |date=July 2004 |chapter=An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior |title=Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence |pages=900–907 |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=AAAI Press |isbn=0262511835}}</ref> which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case. Research in [[intelligent tutoring systems]] resulted in developing systems such as SOPHIE that could act as an 'articulate expert', explaining problem-solving strategy at a level the student could understand, so they would know what action to take next. For instance, SOPHIE could explain the qualitative reasoning behind its electronics troubleshooting, even though it ultimately relied on the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator. Similarly, GUIDON added tutorial rules to supplement MYCIN's domain-level rules so it could explain strategy for medical diagnosis. Symbolic approaches to machine learning, especially those relying on explanation-based learning, such as PROTOS, explicitly relied on representations of explanations, both to explain their actions and to acquire new knowledge.

In the 1980s through early 1990s, truth maintenance systems (TMS) were developed to extend the capabilities of causal-reasoning, [[Rule-based system|rule-based]], and logic-based inference systems.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Second| publisher = Prentice Hall, Pearson Education| isbn = 0-13-790395-2| last1 = Russell| first1 = Stuart| last2 = Norvig| first2 = Peter| title = Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach| location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| series = Prentice Hall Series in Artificial Intelligence| date = 2003}}</ref>{{rp|360–362}} A TMS acts to explicitly track alternate lines of reasoning, justifications for conclusions, and lines of reasoning that lead to contradictions, allowing future reasoning to avoid these dead ends. To provide explanation, they trace reasoning from conclusions to assumptions through rule operations or logical inferences, allowing explanations to be generated from the reasoning traces.  As an example, consider a rule-based problem solver with just a few rules about Socrates that concludes he has died from poison:
{{Blockquote
|text=By just tracing through the dependency structure the problem solver can construct the following explanation: "Socrates died because he was mortal and drank poison, and all mortals die when they drink poison.  Socrates was mortal because he was a man and all men are mortal.

Some techniques allow visualisations of the inputs which individual [[Neuron (software)|software neurons]] respond to most strongly. Several groups have found that neurons can be aggregated into circuits which perform human-comprehensible functions, some of which reliably arise across different networks trained independently.<ref name="Circuits">{{cite journal |last1=Olah |first1=Chris |last2=Cammarata |first2=Nick |last3=Schubert |first3=Ludwig |last4=Goh |first4=Gabriel |last5=Petrov |first5=Michael |last6=Carter |first6=Shan |title=Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits |journal=Distill |date=10 March 2020 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e00024.001 |doi=10.23915/distill.00024.001 |url=https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/ |language=en |issn=2476-0757|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Yixuan |last2=Yosinski |first2=Jason |last3=Clune |first3=Jeff |last4=Lipson |first4=Hod |last5=Hopcroft |first5=John |title=Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations? |journal=Feature Extraction: Modern Questions and Challenges |date=8 December 2015 |pages=196–212 |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v44/li15convergent.html |publisher=PMLR |language=en}}</ref>

At a higher level, various techniques exist to extract compressed representations of the features of given inputs, which can then be analysed by standard [[Cluster analysis|clustering techniques]].

== Regulation ==

As regulators, official bodies, and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for [[automated decision-making]] processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).<ref>{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI|access-date=17 July 2017|archive-date=4 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404131609/http://www.intelligentrobots.org/files/IJCAI2017/IJCAI-17_XAI_WS_Proceedings.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The European Union introduced a [[right to explanation]] in the [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Right (GDPR)]] as an attempt to deal with the potential problems stemming from the rising importance of algorithms. The implementation of the regulation began in 2018. However, the right to explanation in GDPR covers only the local aspect of interpretability. In the United States, insurance companies are required to be able to explain their rate and coverage decisions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=Artificial Intelligence Has Some Explaining to Do |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-12/artificial-intelligence-has-some-explaining-to-do |access-date=17 December 2018 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 December 2018}}</ref> In France the [[Loi pour une République numérique]] (Digital Republic Act) grants subjects the right to request and receive information pertaining to the implementation of algorithms which process data about them.

== Limitations ==
Despite efforts to increase the explainability of AI models, they still have a number of limitations.

=== Adversarial parties === 
By making an AI system more explainable, we also reveal more of its inner workings. For example, the explainability method of feature importance identifies features or variables that are most important in determining the model's output, while the influential samples method identifies the training samples that are most influential in determining the output, given a particular input.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment">{{cite book | last1=Bhatt | first1=Umang | last2=Xiang | first2=Alice | last3=Sharma | first3=Shubham | last4=Weller | first4=Adrian | last5=Taly | first5=Ankur | last6=Jia | first6=Yunhan | last7=Ghosh | first7=Joydeep | last8=Puri | first8=Richir | last9=M.F. Moura | first9=José | last10=Eckersley | first10=Peter | title=Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency | chapter=Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment | series=Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency | date=2022 | pages=648–657 | doi=10.1145/3351095.3375624 | isbn=9781450369367 | s2cid=202572724 | chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3351095.3375624 }}</ref> However, there are a number of adversarial parties that could take advantage of this knowledge.

For example, competitor firms could replicate aspects of the original AI system in their own product, thus reducing competitive advantage.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'">{{cite journal | last1=Burrel | first1=Jenna | title=How the machine 'thinks': Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms | series=Big Data & Society | date=2016 | volume=3 | issue=1 | doi=10.1177/2053951715622512 | s2cid=61330970 | url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053951715622512 }}</ref> An explainable AI system is also susceptible to different parties to “game” the system, or influence the output in a way that undermines the intended purpose. One study gives the example of a predictive policing system; in this case, those who could potentially “game” the system are the criminals subject to the system's decisions. In this study, developers of the system discussed the issue of criminal gangs looking to illegally obtain passports, and they expressed concerns that, if given an idea of what factors might trigger an alert in the passport application process, those gangs would be able to “send guinea pigs” to test those triggers, eventually finding a loophole that would allow them to “reliably get passports from under the noses of the authorities”.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Veale | first1=Michael | last2=Van Kleek | first2=Max | last3=Binns | first3=Reuben | title=Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | chapter=Fairness and Accountability Design Needs for Algorithmic Support in High-Stakes Public Sector Decision-Making | series=Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | date=2018 | volume=40 | pages=1–14 | doi=10.1145/3173574.3174014 | isbn=9781450356206 | s2cid=3639135 | chapter-url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3174014 }}</ref>

=== Technical complexity ===
A fundamental barrier to making AI systems explainable in the first place is the technical complexity of such systems. End users often lack even the prerequisite coding knowledge required to understand software of any kind. Current methods used to explain AI are mainly technical ones, geared toward machine learning engineers for debugging purposes, rather than the end users who are ultimately affected by the system, causing “a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency”.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment" /> Proposed solutions to address the issue of technical complexity include either promoting the coding education of the general public that would make technical explanations more accessible to end users, or developing an outward-facing component that would provide explanations in layperson terms.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'" />

Regardless of the solution, however, it must avoid the pitfall of oversimplification. It is important to strike a balance between accuracy – how faithfully does the explanation reflect the actual process of the AI system – and explainability – how well end users understand the process. However, this is a difficult balance to strike, since complexity of machine learning makes it difficult for even ML engineers to fully understand, let alone non-experts.<ref name="Explainable Machine Learning in Deployment" />

=== Understanding versus trust ===
The goal of explainability to end users of AI systems is ultimately to increase trust in the system, even “address concerns about lack of ‘fairness’ and discriminatory effects”.<ref name="How the machine 'thinks'" /> However, even with a good understanding of an AI system, end users may not necessarily trust the system. In one study, participants were presented with combinations of white-box and black-box explanations, and static and interactive explanations of AI systems. While these explanations served to increase both their self-reported and objective understanding, it had no impact on their level of trust, which remained skeptical.<ref name="Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI">{{cite journal | last1=Cheng | first1=Hao-Fei | last2=Wang | first2=Ruotang | last3=Zhang | first3=Zheng | last4=O’Connell | first4=Fiona | last5=Gray | first5=Terrance | last6=Harper | first6= F. Maxwell | last7=Zhu | first7=Haiyi | title=Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI: Strategies to Help Non-Expert Stakeholders | series=Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems | date=2019 | volume=559 | pages=1–12 | doi=10.1145/3290605.3300789 | s2cid=140281803 | url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290605.3300789 }}</ref>

This outcome was especially true for decisions which impacted the end user in a significant way, such as graduate school admissions. Participants judged algorithms to be too inflexible and unforgiving in comparison to human decision-makers; instead of rigidly adhering to a set of rules, humans are able to consider exceptional cases as well as appeals to their initial decision.<ref name="Explaining Decision-Making Algorithms through UI" /> So for such decisions, explainability will not necessarily cause end users to accept the use of decision-making algorithms. We will need to either turn to another method to increase trust and acceptance of decision-making algorithms, or question the need to rely solely on AI for such impactful decisions in the first place.

== Criticism ==
Recent scholarship has suggested that the pursuit of explainability in AI techniques should be considered a secondary goal to the pursuit of AI's effectiveness, and that encouraging the exclusive development of XAI may limit the functionality of AI more broadly.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Liam G.|last2=Brenna|first2=Connor T.

Moreover, XAI systems have primarily focused on making AI systems understandable to AI practitioners rather than end users, and their results on user perceptions of these systems have been somewhat fragmented.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alizadeh|first=Fatemeh|date=2020|title=eXplainable AI: take one step back, move two steps forward|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344491013|journal=Mensch und Computer}}</ref> Some researchers have also advocated for the use of inherently interpretable machine learning models, rather than using post-hoc explanations, where a second model is created to explain the first. This is partly because post-hoc models increase the complexity in a decision pathway and partly because it is often unclear how faithfully a post-hoc explanation can mimic the computations of an entirely separate model.<ref name=":6" />

Analysis of the goals of XAI find that it requires a form of lossy compression that will become less effective as AI models grow in their number of parameters, and in conjunction with other factors this leads to a theoretical limit for explainability.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sarkar |first=Advait |date=2022 |title=Is explainable AI a race against model complexity? |url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3124/paper22.pdf |journal=Workshop on Transparency and Explanations in Smart Systems (TeXSS), in Conjunction with ACM Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2022) |pages=192–199 |arxiv=2205.10119 |via=CEUR Workshop Proceedings}}</ref>
