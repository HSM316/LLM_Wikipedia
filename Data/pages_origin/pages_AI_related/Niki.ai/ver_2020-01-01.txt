== Product ==
Niki is designed as a virtual agent also known as Bharat ki agent for the emerging internet users of India living in Tier 2 and beyond, to pay monthly bills, do prepaid recharges or make travel bookings, just by talking. The experience being much similar to the offline world, where every service is availed via talking to the service provider, users place online orders using voice, in their own language while it assists them through every step of the payment process and providing 100% fulfilment guarantee. 

Niki caters to the 60% of the 390 million internet users in India who are yet to transact online due to language and interface barriers. Its vernacular users have now expanded to 12,000+ locations such as Jaipur, Gharsana, Surat, Aurangabad, Muzaffarnagar, Ludhiana, Patna, Indore, Sri Ganganagar, Faridabad, Agra. 

The company is currently in its hyper-growth phase, witnessing phenomenal adoption in Tier 2 and Tier 3 with 80% of the current 5 million+ user-base coming from these towns. It will soon launch language support in multiple Indian languages including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali and Marathi to become a one stop commerce solution for all of Bharat.
