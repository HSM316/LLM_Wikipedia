'''GermaNet''' is a [[semantic network]] for the [[German language]].  It relates [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, and [[adjective]]s semantically by grouping lexical units that express the same concept into ''[[synset]]s'' and by defining [[semantic]] relations between these synsets.<ref name="Storjohann2010">{{cite book|author=Petra Storjohann|title=Lexical-semantic relations: theoretical and practical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYBWObJ547AC&pg=PA165|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=23 June 2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-3138-3|pages=165–}}</ref> GermaNet is free for academic use, after signing a license. GermaNet has much in common with the English [[WordNet]] and can be viewed as an on-line [[thesaurus]] or a light-weight [[ontology (information science)|ontology]]. GermaNet has been developed and maintained at the [[University of Tübingen]] since 1997 within the research group for General and Computational Linguistics. It has been integrated into the [[EuroWordNet]], a multilingual lexical-semantic database.<ref name="homepage">{{Cite web|url=https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/142806|title=GermaNet - an Introduction|website=uni-tuebingen.de|accessdate=October 1, 2020}}</ref>

==Database==

===Contents===
GermaNet  partitions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are interlinked by semantic relations. A semantic concept is modeled by a ''[[synset]]''. A synset is a set of words (called lexical units) where all the words are taken to have the same or almost the same meaning. Thus a synset is a set of synonyms grouped under one definition, or "gloss".

In addition to the gloss, synsets are labeled with their syntactic function and accompanied by example sentences for each distinct meaning in the synset.<ref name="GernEdiT">V. Henrich, E. Hinrichs. 2010. [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/264_Paper.pdf GernEdiT - The GermaNet Editing Tool]. In: ''Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on International Language Resources and Evaluation''.</ref>
Just as in WordNet, for each word category the semantic space is divided into a number of [[semantic field]]s closely related to major nodes in the semantic network: ''Ort'', or "location", ''Körper'', or "body", etc.<ref name="homepage" />

As of version 15.0 (release May 2020), GermaNet contains:<ref name="homepage" />

* Synsets:  144113
* Lexical Units: 185000
* Literals: 169521
* Conceptual Relations: 157921
* Lexical Relations (synonymy excluded): 12203 
* Split Compounds: 98905
* Interlingual Index (ILI) Records: 28564
* Wiktionary Sense Descriptions: 29548

===Format===
All GermaNet data is stored in a [[PostgreSQL]] [[relational database]]. The database schema follows the internal structure of GermaNet: there are tables to store synsets, lexical units, conceptual and lexical relations, etc.<ref name="GernEdiT"/> GermaNet data is distributed both in this database format and as [[XML]] files. In the XML data, two types of files, one for synsets and the other for relations, represent all data available in the GermaNet database.<ref name="dataformat">{{Cite web|url=https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/142817|title=Data format|accessdate=October 1, 2020}}</ref>

==Interfaces==
There are software libraries and [[Application Programming Interface|APIs]] available for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Perl]].<ref name="api">{{Cite web|url=https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/142818|title=Applications and Tools|website=uni-tuebingen.de|accessdate=October 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metacpan.org/pod/GermaNet::Flat|title=GermaNet::Flat|website=metacpan.org|accessdate=October 1, 2020}}</ref> These programs are distributed under [[free-software license]]s and provide easy access to all information in various versions of GermaNet.

[https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/rover GermaNet Rover] is an online application that can be used to search for synsets in GermaNet, explore the data associated with them, and calculate the [[semantic similarity]] of pairs of synsets. It features visualizations of the [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernym]] relation and advanced filtering options for synset searching.

==Licenses==
GermaNet 15.0 (released May 2020) can be distributed under one of the following types of [[software license agreement|license agreements]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/142828|title=Licenses|website=uni-tuebingen.de|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref>

* ''Academic Research License Agreement'': for the purpose of research at academic institutions. There is no license fee for academic use. Licenses are not given to individual students, and those seeking a license are required to talk to an academic advisor.

* ''Research and Development License Agreement'': applies to non-academic institutions and research consortia. To be used strictly for technology development and internal research.

* ''Commercial License Agreement'': applies to non-academic institutions and commercial enterprises. It permits technology development and internal research, as well as giving the non-exclusive right to distribute and market any derived product or service.

==Alternatives==
Open-de-WordNet is freely available alternative to GermaNet which is compatible with [[WordNet]].<ref name="odenet">{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet|title=GitHub - hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet: Open German WordNet|date=November 14, 2019|accessdate=November 20, 2019|via=GitHub}}</ref>
