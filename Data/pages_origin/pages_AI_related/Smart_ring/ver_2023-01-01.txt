A '''smart ring''' is a wearable electronics device with advanced mobile components that combine features of mobile devices with innovative features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smart rings, which are typically the size of traditional rings or larger, combine the features of a mobile device, such as the ability to make payments and mitigate access control, with popular innovative uses such as [[gesture control]] and activity tracking. Smart rings can communicate directly with smartphones or compatible devices (such as personal computers) through a variety of applications and websites. Some smart rings can operate without the need of a mobile phone, such as when interacting with back-end systems on the cloud through or performing standalone functions such as activity tracking. They typically do not have a display and operate by contextual relevance, such as by making a payment when near a payment terminal, unlocking an electronic lock when near the lock, or controlling home appliances when making gestures in the home. Some smart rings have physical or capacitive buttons to use as an activation mechanism, such as to initiate a gesture or make a phone call.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/xenxo-s-ring-smart-kickstarter-6096|title=Xenxo's S-Ring wants to replace your smartwatch and fitness tracker|date=2018-05-16|website=Wareable|language=en-US|access-date=2020-11-27}}</ref>

In 2013, the English firm McLear, founded by John McLear, Chris Leach, and Joe Prencipe, released the first smart ring for sale.<ref>{{cite web |title=This NFC Ring Puts Wireless Transfer Tech On Your Finger So You Can Fist-Bump Phones |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/put-an-nfc-ring-on-it/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGMdlujDY4YvoeT5t4E2gQ7MlcjucH1NvU90Ze9P5S0xw_zH8IxJ-dRbpFuWHVHfUnsqAx3oxdoWdKBfPMqK8B1N4_arv4IuyV7JmKX5Uu9kaVmMRrJPaZJwZvLFY5-76TGDP1PRfTMqUbmXH6zjWhzM3KJ9lzWRfWAhIPSOVCx7 |access-date=2021-11-12 |website=[[TechCrunch]] | date=23 July 2013 |language=en}}</ref>

==Use==

One of the main features of the smart ring is to serve as a [[Near field communication|near-field communication]] device, effectively eliminating the need to carry [[credit card]]s, [[key (lock)|door keys]], [[car key]]s, and potentially even [[ID card]]s or [[driver's license]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-long-awaited-NFC-Ring-will-finally-land-on-your-finger-this-December_id84464 | title = The long-awaited NFC Ring will finally land on your finger this December | first = Joe | last= M. | work = Phone Arena | date = August 24, 2016 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nfcworld.com/2016/08/24/346844/nfc-ring-circles-globe/ | title = NFC Ring circles the globe | first = Rian | last= Boden | work = NFC World | date = August 24, 2016 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref> Other uses include connection to a [[smartphone]] in order to notify the user of incoming calls, text, emails, and more; use as gesture-based controller, allowing the user to perform a variety of actions with a simple motion of the hand; and measure steps, distance, sleep, heart rate, and track how many calories the user consumes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/best-smart-rings/ | title = Put a ring on it: 4 smart rings that are more useful than getting you engaged | first = Brandon | last= Widder | work = [[Digital Trends]] | date = February 23, 2015 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wareable.com/smart-jewellery/best-smart-rings-1340 | title = Smart rings: The good, the bad and the ugly in smart jewellery | first = Libby | last= Plummer | work = Wearable.com | date = July 7, 2016 |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref>

===Security===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Secure access control such as for company entry and exit, home access, cars, and electronic devices was the first use of smart rings. Smart rings change the status quo for secure access control by increasing ease of use, decreasing physical security flaws such as by ease of losing the device, and by adding [[Multi-factor authentication|two-factor authentication]] mechanisms including [[biometrics]] and key code entry.

===Payments and ticketing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Smart rings can perform payments and metro ticketing similar to contactless cards, smart cards, and mobile phones. Security of the transaction is equal to or greater than contactless cards. The first smart ring to be created with contactless payments was the NFC Payment Ring, which was mass produced and unveiled at the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics Summer Games]] at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in August 2016. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/smart-rings-seen-as-new-frontier-for-cashless-payments|title=Smart Rings Seen as New Frontier for Cashless Payments|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|date=25 May 2021 |language=en|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref>

===Activity===
Similar to [[Smartwatch|smartwatches]], smart rings utilise in-built sensors to provide activity and wellness tracking. For example, step and heart beat tracking,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mymotiv.com/fitness-tracking/|title=Motiv Ring {{!}} 24/7 Smart Ring {{!}} Fitness + Sleep Tracking {{!}} Online Security Motiv Ring|website=Motiv|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> temperature and sleep tracking (through measuring heart beats and movements) and blood flow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ouraring.com/how-oura-works/|title=Learn how Oura ring works {{!}} Go inside {{!}} Oura Ring|website=Oura Ring|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> The smart ring form factor contains enough space to contain the same components as smartwatches. However, due to size constraints, smaller components are typically used in current smart ring products in the market, such as smaller and less accurate [[Accelerometer|accelerometers]], and smaller batteries leading to lower battery life than smartwatches.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/review/oura-ring/|title=Review:Oura Ring|magazine=WIRED|language=en|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref> 

=== Communications ===
Through the use of a small microphone, or [[bone conduction]], some smart rings can allow the wearer to make phone calls while paired with a compatible mobile phone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orii.io/|title=ORII {{!}} The Voice Powered Smart Ring {{!}} Hong Kong|website=ORII {{!}} The Voice Powered Smart Ring {{!}} Hong Kong|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref> Smart rings are also able to notify the wearer of incoming calls and messages, by means of vibrating or lighting up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ringly.com/products/smart-ring|title=Ringly Luxe - Smart Rings|last=RINGLY|website=RINGLY|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>

Additionally, some smart rings allow the wearer to see and feel real-time heartbeat of the 2nd smart ring wearer, where the heartbeat is displayed on the ring similarly by means of lighting up and vibrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heartbeat-ring_n_57aa1679e4b06e52746dd5e3|title=This Ring Lets You Feel Your Spouse's Heartbeat In Real Time|last=HUFFPOST|website=HUFFPOST|date=9 August 2016 |language=en|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref> Such smart rings require connection to a smartphone with active data or Wi-Fi connection to allow the transfer of data between two smart rings. The idea behind such function is to advance on a premise known as [[Vena amoris|''vena amoris'']] and serve as a digital alternative to classic wedding or engagement rings. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetouchx.com/hbring|title=HB Ring|last=TheTouch X|website=TheTouch X|language=en|access-date=2021-11-10}}</ref>

===Social===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Smart rings provide social feedback to users and can be used to engage in the user's environment in a way that other wearables and mobile devices do not permit. Some smart rings provide notifications (e.g. lights or vibrations) to notify the user when they receive a text message, phone call, or other notification. This enables the user to be aware of the notification without having to constantly check their smartphone.
