'''Google Goggles''' was an [[image recognition]] [[mobile app]] developed by [[Google]]. It was used for searches based on pictures taken by handheld devices. For example, taking a picture of a famous landmark searches for information about it, or taking a picture of a product's barcode would search for information on the product.

== History ==
Google Goggles was developed for use on Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system for mobile devices. While initially only available in a beta version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, [[Google]] announced its plans to enable the software to run on other platforms, notably [[iPhone]] and [[BlackBerry]] devices.<ref name="pcw">PCWorld: {{Cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/184011/Confirmed_Google_Goggles_Will_Reach_Other_Platforms.html |title=Confirmed: Google Goggles Will Reach Other Platforms |last=Raphael |first=JR |date=December 8, 2009 |website=PCWorld |access-date=September 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219184953/https://www.pcworld.com/article/184011/Confirmed_Google_Goggles_Will_Reach_Other_Platforms.html |archive-date=February 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Google]] did not discuss a non-handheld format. Google product manager Shailesh Nalawadi indicated that Google wanted Goggles to be an application platform, much like [[Google Maps]], not just a single product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-we-plan-to-open-up-our-goggles-platform-683454 |date=April 14, 2010 |title=Google: we plan to open up our Goggles platform |work=Techradar |access-date=April 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508030856/http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-we-plan-to-open-up-our-goggles-platform-683454 |archive-date=May 8, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> On October 5, 2010, [[Google]] announced availability of Google Goggles for devices running [[iOS (Apple)|iOS 4.0]].<ref name = "googleblog">{{cite web |url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/10/open-your-eyes-google-goggles-now.html |date=October 5, 2010 |title=Open your eyes: Google Goggles now available on iPhone in Google Mobile App |work=Google Mobile Blog |access-date=October 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008065313/http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/10/open-your-eyes-google-goggles-now.html |archive-date=October 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a May 2014 update to Google Mobile for iOS, the Google Goggles feature was removed. 

At [[Google I/O]] 2017, a similar app, [[Google Lens]] was announced that has similar functions as Goggles and uses the [[Google Assistant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh0ifHt3LEM|title=Google Lens announced at Google I/O 2017 - QPT|last=Rajamanickam Antonimuthu|date=18 May 2017|via=YouTube|access-date=18 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025003856/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh0ifHt3LEM|archive-date=25 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The app was officially discontinued on August 20, 2018 with its last update directing users to download [[Google Lens]] or [[Google Photos]] upon launching the app.<ref name="gogmain">{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.unveil |title=Google Goggles |website=Apps on Google Play |date=August 20, 2018 |access-date=September 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831003842/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.unveil |archive-date=August 31, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/google-goggles-dead-now-prompts-users-install-lens/ |last1=Davenport |first1=Corbin |website=Android Police |title=Google Goggles is dead, now prompts users to install Lens |date=August 16, 2018 |access-date=September 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906233726/https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/16/google-goggles-dead-now-prompts-users-install-lens/ |archive-date=September 6, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Features ==
The system could identify various labels or landmarks, allowing users to learn about such items without needing a text-based search. The system could identify products [[barcode]]s or labels that allow users to search for similar products and prices, solve [[sudoku]]s from photographs,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Busch |first1=Jack |title=How to Solve a Sudoku Puzzle Instantly with Google Goggles |url=https://www.groovypost.com/howto/howto/how-to-solve-a-sudoku-puzzle-instantly-with-google-goggles/ |website=groovyPost |access-date=19 November 2021 |date=11 February 2011}}</ref> and save codes for future reference, similar to the [[CueCat]] from late 1990s. The system also recognized printed text and uses [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) to produce a text snippet, and in some cases even translate the snippet into another language.

=== Metropolitan Museum of Art ===
The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] announced in December 2011 its collaboration with Google to use Google Goggles for providing information about the artworks in the museum through direct [[Hyperlink|links]] to the [[website]] of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref>''[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/news/2011/google-goggles Metropolitan Museum Enhances Online Access to Its Collections with Google Goggles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519010355/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/news/2011/google-goggles |date=2012-05-19 }}''.
