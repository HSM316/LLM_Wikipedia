Prior to its unveiling, it was originally speculated to be a [[mobile operating system]] that could replace [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on future Huawei devices. In June 2019, an Huawei executive told [[Reuters]] that the OS was under testing in China, and could be ready "in months", but by July 2019, some Huawei executives described the OS as being an [[embedded operating system]] designed for [[Internet of things|IoT]] hardware, discarding the previous statements for it to be a mobile operating system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keane|first=Sean|title=Huawei says Hongmeng OS isn't designed as an Android replacement|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719184715/https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|archive-date=19 July 2019|access-date=2019-07-19|website=CNET|language=en}}</ref>

=== Release ===
On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled HarmonyOS at its inaugural developers' conference in [[Dongguan]]. Huawei described HarmonyOS as a [[Free software|free]], [[microkernel]]-based distributed operating system for various types of hardware. The company focused primarily on IoT devices, including smart TVs, [[wearable device]]s, and [[in-car entertainment]] systems, and did not explicitly position HarmonyOS as a mobile OS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/|title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android|title=Huawei's new operating system is called HarmonyOS|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-09|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

== HarmonyOS apps ==
In contrast to Android apps being packaged into [[Android application package|APK]] file format, HarmonyOS apps are released as an App Pack suffixed with .app for distribution at Huawei's AppGallery. Each App Pack contains one or more HarmonyOS Ability Package (HAP) files and a pack.info file.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Document - Application Fundamentals|url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/basic-fundamentals-0000000000041611|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-22|website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref>

The AppGallery allows users to download and install Android apps that are compatible with HarmonyOS, and apps that are specifically designed for HarmonyOS in an APP pack.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Preston|first=Dominic|title=What is HarmonyOS?

Both HarmonyOS apps and Android apps are allowed to utilize [[Huawei Mobile Services]] as an option. However, the distributed communication technology provided in HarmonyOS system is made available for HarmonyOS apps, but not Android apps, based on the design of the operating system.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=阿里云资深专家崮德：谈谈我对华为HarmonyOS 2.0的看法|url=https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000040203399|access-date=2021-06-23|website=segmentfault.com|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=May 2021|first=Gavin Dudley 17|title=HarmonyOS poised to disrupt the tech industry|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/harmonyos-poised-to-disrupt-the-tech-industry|access-date=2021-06-24|website=TechRadar|date=17 May 2021|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Huawei P30 camera.jpg|thumb|The Huawei P30 is one of several Huawei devices to run HarmonyOS.]]
Huawei stated that HarmonyOS would initially be used on devices targeting the Chinese market. The company's former subsidiary brand, [[Honor (brand)|Honor]], unveiled the Honor Vision line of smart TVs as the first consumer electronics devices to run HarmonyOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20798260/huawei-honor-smart-tv-vision-pro-harmonyos-china|title=The Honor Vision TV is Huawei's first HarmonyOS device|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-10|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony"/> The HarmonyOS 2.0 beta launched on 16 December 2020 supports the [[Huawei P30|P30 series]], [[Huawei P40|P40 series]], [[Huawei Mate 30|Mate 30 series]], [[Huawei Mate 40|Mate 40 series]], [[Huawei P50|P50 series]] and MatePad Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jeet|date=2020-12-15|title=Huawei's HarmonyOS 2.0 for smartphones get Android apps support; Beta releasing tomorrow|url=https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/15/huawei-harmonyos-2-android-app-release-roadmap/|access-date=2020-12-20|website=Gizmochina|language=en-US}}</ref> HarmonyOS 2.0 was released as updates for the P40 and [[Huawei Mate X2|Mate X2]] in June 2021.

== Relationship with OpenHarmony, Android and LiteOS ==
OpenHarmony is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation. It supports devices running a mini system with memory as small as 128 KB, or running a standard system with memory greater than 128 MB.<ref>{{Cite web|title=en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md · OpenHarmony/docs|url=http://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md|access-date=2021-07-03|website=Gitee|language=zh-CN}}</ref> The open-source operating system contains the basic capabilities of HarmonyOS and does not depend on the [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developers Taking Off AOSP And Show OpenHarmony Pure Version Of System {{!}} SPARROWS NEWS|url=https://sparrowsnews.com/2021/06/04/openharmony-pure-version-of-system/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=sparrowsnews.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

Conversely, HarmonyOS runs on Huawei's proprietary architecture and has used the AOSP code and a [[Linux kernel]] in smartphones to enable the operating system to run Android apps, in addition to HarmonyOS apps, on devices launching [[Huawei Mobile Services]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-04|title=What HarmonyOS 2 means for the Google and Apple duopoly|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3136017/will-huaweis-harmony-operating-system-end-global-duopoly-googles|access-date=2021-06-21|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
In May 2019, Huawei applied for registration of the trademark "Hongmeng" through the Chinese Patent Office [[China National Intellectual Property Administration|CNIPA]], but the application was rejected in pursuance to Article 30 of the [[China|PRC]] Trade Mark Law, citing the trademark was similar to that of "CRM Hongmeng" in graphic design and "Hongmeng" in Chinese word.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China IP Case Spotlight: May 2021 (Issue 7) - Intellectual Property - China|url=https://www.mondaq.com/china/trademark/1071812/china-ip-case-spotlight-may-2021-issue-7|access-date=2021-06-24|website=www.mondaq.com}}</ref>

In less than a week before launching HarmonyOS 2.0 and new devices by Huawei, the [[Beijing Intellectual Property Court]] announced the first-instance judgement in May 2021 to uphold the decision by CNIPA as the trademark was not sufficiently distinctive in terms of its designated services.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-13|title=Huawei's Android replacement may need a new Chinese name|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3133362/huawei-hits-stumbling-block-harmonyos-roll-out-after-chinese-court|access-date=2021-06-24|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Rouse-Rachel Li-Mei|last2=Am|last3=Yang|first3=a|last4=Cui|first4=Hatty|title=Huawei Hongmeng "Harmony" Trade Mark Refusal Decision was Upheld in the First-Instance Judgment {{!}} Lexology|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d2e26681-d33d-495e-ad6a-91929455d12c|access-date=2021-06-24|website=www.lexology.com|date=21 May 2021|language=en}}</ref>

However, it was reported that the trademark had officially been transferred from Huizhou Qibei Technology to Huawei by end of May 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Huawei has been transferred the trademark of Hongmeng|url=https://equalocean.com/briefing/20210601230050314|access-date=2021-06-24|website=EqualOcean|language=en}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
In depth analysis of Huawei's developer tools by ''[[Ars Technica]]'', HarmonyOS running on smartphones was criticised as a rebranded version of Android and EMUI with nearly identical code bases.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei officially replaces Android with HarmonyOS, which is also Android|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/|access-date=2021-06-24|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref> Following the release of the HarmonyOS 2.0 beta,  ''Ars Technica'' and [[XDA Developers]] speculated that the smartphone version of the OS had been [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from [[Android 10]]. ''Ars'' ''Technica'' found that it resembled the existing [[EMUI]] software used on Huawei devices, but with all references to "Android" replaced by "HarmonyOS". It was also noted that the DevEco Studio software shared components and toolchains with [[Android Studio]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-26|title=Huawei's Harmony OS 2.0 beta appears to be based on Android after all|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/harmony-os-2-0-initial-version-based-on-android/|access-date=2021-01-20|website=xda-developers|language=en-US}}</ref> However, the article was refuted by a famous China IT blogger shortly, pointing out most of the criticisms mentioned in the article were wrong. <ref>{{Cite web|title=钊哥科普：又见BBC？来自西方的科技类媒体也不能免俗，看着他们尬黑鸿蒙实在看不下去，钊哥驳斥一下|website=Leo Li's popular science|url=https://b23.tv/byYdBdM}}</ref>

When testing the new MatePad Pro in June 2021, ''Android Authority'' and ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly observed similarities in behavior, including that it was possible to install apps from Android [[APK file]]s on the HarmonyOS-based tablet, and that it included the Android 10 [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]—affirming the earlier reports.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|date=2021-06-02|title=Harmony OS 2.0 includes Android Q's easter egg app|url=https://www.androidauthority.com/harmony-os-2-android-1231446/|access-date=2021-06-02|website=Android Authority|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

Initially, Huawei stated that HarmonyOS was a microkernel-based, distributed OS that was completely different from Android and iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Deng|date=2020-09-21|title=HarmonyOS/Hongmeng OS: Here's everything you need to know about this new Operating System|url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-hongmeng-os-everything-you-need-to-know/|access-date=2020-12-20|website=Huawei Central|language=en-US}}</ref> A Huawei spokesperson subsequently stated that HarmonyOS supports multiple kernels and uses a Linux kernel if a device has a large amount of RAM, and that the company had taken advantage of a large number of third-party open-source resources, including Linux, to accelerate the development of a comprehensive architecture.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":5" />
