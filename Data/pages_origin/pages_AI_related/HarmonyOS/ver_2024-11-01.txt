'''HarmonyOS''' ('''HMOS''') ({{zh|s=鸿蒙|p=Hóngméng}}) is a [[distributed operating system]] developed by [[Huawei]] for [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet]]s, [[smart TV]]s, [[smart watch]]es, [[personal computers]] and other [[smart device]]s. It has a [[microkernel]] design with single framework: the operating system selects suitable kernels from the [[abstraction layer]] in the case of devices that use diverse resources.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Document – About HarmonyOS |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-overview-0000000000011903 |access-date=2021-06-17 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei's Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs|access-date=2021-06-16|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei's HarmonyOS arrives on tablets with the new MatePad Pro|url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs|access-date=2021-06-16|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

The operating system was initially based on code from the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] Open Source Project (AOSP) and the [[Linux kernel]]; many Android apps can be [[Sideloading|sideloaded]] on HarmonyOS.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2024-06-25 |title=HarmonyOS Next: Huawei gibt Android auf |url=https://www.heise.de/news/HarmonyOS-Next-Huawei-gibt-Android-auf-9776840.html |access-date=2024-06-25 |website=heise online |language=de}}</ref>

The next iteration of HarmonyOS known as [[HarmonyOS NEXT]] was announced on August 4, 2023. It replaces the [[OpenHarmony]] multi-kernel system with its own HarmonyOS [[microkernel]] at its core, removes all Android code and supports only apps in its [[Native (computing)|native]] [[App (file format)|App]] format.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei launches beta of its non-Android phone operating system, HarmonyOS Next |url=https://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/tech-news-huawei-harmonyos-next-beta-launch-hdc-2024-non-android-phone-operating-system |access-date=2024-06-24 |website=www.hardwarezone.com.sg |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS NEXT will be based on Harmony Kernel |url=https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/01/19/huawei-reveals-harmonyos-next-will-be-based-on-harmony-kernel/}}</ref> It is currently in public [[beta testing]] as official launch of HarmonyOS NEXT 5 and is expected to launch stable builds in the fourth quarter of 2024.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Deng |title=Huawei launched HarmonyOS NEXT, its native mobile operating system |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-launched-harmonyos-next/ |website=HC Newsroom |publisher=HC Newsroom |access-date=23 October 2024}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
HarmonyOS is designed with a [[layer (object-oriented design)|layer]]ed [[software architecture|architecture]], which consists of four layers; the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] layer at the bottom provides the upper three layers, i.e., the system service layer, framework layer and application layer, with basic kernel capabilities, such as [[process (computing)|process]] and [[thread (computing)|thread]] management, [[memory management]], [[file system]], [[network management]], and [[peripheral]] management.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About HarmonyOS |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-overview-0000000000011903 |access-date=2023-09-23 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref>

The kernel layer incorporates a subsystem that accommodates [[HarmonyOS kernel]] based on [[microkernel]] as Rich Executed Environment (REE), catering to diverse smart devices. Depending on the device type, different kernels can be selected; for instance, like OpenHarmony base itself but with a single kernel, lightweight systems are chosen for low-power devices like watches and [[Internet of things|IoT]] devices to execute lightweight [[App (file format)|HarmonyOS apps]], whereas large-memory devices like mobile phones, tablets, and PCs utilize standard system. The dual-app framework was replaced with a single-app framework in [[HarmonyOS NEXT|HarmonyOS Next]], supporting only native HarmonyOS apps with [[App (file format)|APP]] format.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Amy |date=2024-04-07 |title=Native HarmonyOS apps exceed 4000 mark reveals Huawei |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/native-harmonyos-apps-exceed-4000-mark-reveals-huawei/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref>

The system includes a communication base called DSoftBus for integrating physically separate devices into a virtual Super Device, allowing one device to control others and sharing data among devices with [[Distributed object communication|distributed communication]] capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Document – Technical Features|url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-features-0000000000011907|access-date=2021-06-19|website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=OpenHarmony/communication_dsoftbus|url=http://gitee.com/openharmony/communication_dsoftbus|access-date=2021-06-19|website=Gitee|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Weekly poll: is HarmonyOS as promising as Android or is it another Windows Phone?|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/weekly_poll_is_harmonyos_as_promising_as_android_or_is_it_another_windows_phone-news-49446.php|access-date=2021-06-22|website=GSMArena.com|language=en-US}}</ref> "To address security concerns" arising from varying devices, the system provides a hardware-based [[Trusted execution environment|Trusted Execution Environment]] (TEE) [[microkernel]] to prevent leakage of sensitive personal data when they are stored or processed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=System Security |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-security-0000000000011934 |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref>

When it launched the operating system, Huawei stated that HarmonyOS plans to become a microkernel-based, distributed OS that was completely different from Android and iOS in terms of target market towards [[Internet of things]].<ref name="micro">{{Cite web |last=Li |first=Deng |date=2020-09-21 |title=HarmonyOS/Hongmeng OS: Here's everything you need to know about this new Operating System |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-hongmeng-os-everything-you-need-to-know/ |access-date=2020-12-20 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref> A Huawei spokesperson subsequently stated that HarmonyOS supported multiple kernels and used a Linux kernel if a device had a large amount of RAM, and that the company had taken advantage of a large number of third-party open-source resources, including Linux kernel with POSIX APIs on OpenHarmony base, as a foundation to accelerate the development of its unified system stack as a future-proof, microkernel-based, and distributed OS running on multiple devices.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |date=2021-06-02 |title=Harmony OS 2.0 includes Android Q's easter egg app |url=https://www.androidauthority.com/harmony-os-2-android-1231446/ |access-date=2021-06-02 |website=Android Authority |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=9 August 2019 |title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android |url=https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-09-huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android.html |access-date=2023-08-01 |website=Engadget |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

At its launch as an operating system for smartphones in 2021, HarmonyOS was, however, rumored by ''[[Ars Technica]]'' to be a "rebranded version of Android and [[EMUI]]" with nearly "identical code bases".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amadeo |first=Ron |date=2021-06-02 |title=Huawei officially replaces Android with HarmonyOS, which is also Android |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/ |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=Ars Technica |language=en-us}}</ref> Following the release of the HarmonyOS 2.0 beta, ''Ars Technica'' and [[XDA Developers]] suggested that "the smartphone version of the OS had been [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from [[Android 10]]". ''Ars Technica'' alleged that it resembled the existing EMUI software used on Huawei devices, but with all references to "Android" replaced by "HarmonyOS". It was also noted that the [[DevEco Studio]] software based on [[JetBrains]] open source [[IntelliJ IDEA]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] "shared components and tool chains" with [[Android Studio]].

When testing the new MatePad Pro in June 2021, ''Android Authority'' and ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly observed similarities in "behavior", including that it was possible to install apps from Android [[APK file]]s on the HarmonyOS-based tablet, and to run the Android 10 [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] apk app, reaffirming earlier rumor mills.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":5" />

Prior to its unveiling, it was originally speculated to be a [[mobile operating system]] that could replace Android on future Huawei devices. In June 2019, an Huawei executive told [[Reuters]] that the OS was under testing in China, and could be ready "in months", but by July 2019, some Huawei executives described the OS as being an [[embedded operating system]] designed for IoT hardware, discarding the previous statements for it to be a mobile operating system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keane|title=Huawei says Hongmeng OS isn't designed as an Android replacement|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719184715/https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|archive-date=19 July 2019|access-date=2019-07-19|website=CNET|language=en}}</ref>

Early versions of HarmonyOS, starting from version 1.0, employed a "kernel [[abstraction layer]]" (KAL) subsystem to support a multi-kernel architecture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Document - About HarmonyOS |url=https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/guide/overview-harmonyos-0000001111162012 |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=device.harmonyos.com}}</ref> This allowed developers to choose different operating system kernels based on the resources available on each device. For low-powered devices such as wearables and Huawei's GT smartwatches, HarmonyOS utilized the LiteOS kernel instead of Linux. It also integrated the [[LiteOS]] [[Software development kit|SDK]] for TV applications and ensured compatibility with Android apps through the [[Ark Compiler]] and a dual-framework approach.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HarmonyOS/README.md at master · Awesome-HarmonyOS/HarmonyOS |url=https://github.com/Awesome-HarmonyOS/HarmonyOS/blob/master/README.md |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=GitHub |language=en}}</ref> HarmonyOS 1.0's original L0-L2 source code branch was contributed to the [[OpenAtom Foundation]] to accelerate system development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=en/device-dev/get-code/source-code-acquisition.md · OpenHarmony/docs |url=https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/bcc8e356b656a5dce685abf27ee6bb826630cbf9/en/device-dev/get-code/source-code-acquisition.md |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=Gitee |language=zh-CN}}</ref>

HarmonyOS 2.0 introduced a modified version of OpenHarmony's L3-L5 source code, expanding its compatibility across smartphones and tablets. Underneath the kernel abstraction layer (KAL) subsystem, HarmonyOS used the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[Android Open Source Project|AOSP]] codebase. This setup enabled Android [[Apk (file format)|APK]] files and [[Android App Bundle|App Bundles]] (AAB) to run natively, similar to older Huawei [[EMUI]]-based devices, without needing [[Rooting (Android)|root]] access.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OpenHarmony 2.0 L2 branch is open source, has pure HarmonyOS app code and not Android’s |url=https://consumer.huawei.com/za/community/details/OpenHarmony-2-0-L2-branch-is-open-source-has-pure-HarmonyOS-app-code-and-not-Android-s/topicId_141777/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=consumer.huawei.com |language=en-ZA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-04 |title=What HarmonyOS 2 means for the Google and Apple duopoly |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3136017/will-huaweis-harmony-operating-system-end-global-duopoly-googles |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref>

Additionally, HarmonyOS supported native apps packaged for [[Huawei Mobile Services]] through the Ark Compiler, leveraging the OpenHarmony framework within its dual-framework structure at the System Service Layer. This configuration allowed the operating system to run apps developed with restricted HarmonyOS [[API|APIs]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amit |date=2021-06-05 |title=HarmonyOS applications launched: More icons with HMOS corners |url=https://www.huaweiupdate.com/harmonyos-applications-launched-more-icons-with-hmos-corners/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=HU |language=en-US}}</ref>

Until the release of HarmonyOS 5.0.0, known as [[HarmonyOS NEXT]] 5, using its microkernel within a single framework, replacing the operating system dual-framework approach for Huawei's HarmonyOS devices with the AOSP codebase.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS NEXT will be based on Harmony Kernel |url=https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/01/19/huawei-reveals-harmonyos-next-will-be-based-on-harmony-kernel/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=HarmonyOS and Android: How to Establish an Independent Ecosystem? - Caixin Global |url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2024-03-09/weekly-preview-harmonyos-and-android-how-to-establish-an-independent-ecosystem-102173753.html |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=www.caixinglobal.com |language=en}}</ref>

[[OpenHarmony]] is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the [[OpenAtom Foundation]], built around a LiteOS kernel descended from original [[LiteOS]] operating system. It supports devices running a mini system such as printers, speakers, smartwatches and any other smart device with memory as small as 128 KB, or running a standard system with memory greater than 128 MB.<ref>{{Cite web|title=en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md · OpenHarmony/docs|url=http://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md|access-date=2021-07-03|website=Gitee|language=zh-CN}}</ref> The open-source operating system contains the basic capabilities of HarmonyOS and does not depend on the [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP) code.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developers Taking Off AOSP And Show OpenHarmony Pure Version Of System |url=https://sparrowsnews.com/2021/06/04/openharmony-pure-version-of-system/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=sparrowsnews.com|date=4 June 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref>

On August 4, 2023 at Huawei Developers Conference 2023 (HDC), Huawei officially announced HarmonyOS NEXT, the next iteration system version of HarmonyOS, supporting only native [[App (file format)|APP]] apps via [[Ark Compiler]] with [[Huawei Mobile Services|Huawei Mobile Services (HMS)]], and ending the support for Android apk apps.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amit |date=2023-09-25 |title=Huawei released HarmonyOS NEXT |url=https://www.huaweiupdate.com/huawei-released-harmonyos-next/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=HU |language=en-US}}</ref>

Built on a custom version of [[OpenHarmony]], HarmonyOS NEXT [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] system has the HarmonyOS [[microkernel]] at its core with a single framework, departing from the common Linux kernel and aimed to replace the current multi-kernel HarmonyOS.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS NEXT will be based on Harmony Kernel |url=https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/01/19/huawei-reveals-harmonyos-next-will-be-based-on-harmony-kernel/}}</ref>

Among the first batch of over 200 developers, [[McDonald's]] and [[KFC in China]] became two of the first multinational food companies to adopt HarmonyOS Next.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web |date=2024-01-03 |title=Huawei's HarmonyOS tipped to beat Apple's iOS in China in 2024: TechInsights |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247172/huaweis-harmonyos-beat-apples-ios-no-2-smartphone-operating-system-china-2024-techinsights-report |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":21">{{Cite web |title=华为发布 HarmonyOS NEXT 鸿蒙星河版，开发者预览版开放申请 - IT之家 |url=https://www.ithome.com/0/745/981.htm |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=www.ithome.com}}</ref>

On September 4, 2023, it was reported on [[Weibo.com|Weibo]] social media in China that a former Huawei executive had claimed that HarmonyOS for PC would be released in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Neowin · |first=Omer Dursun |date=2023-09-07 |title=Former Huawei executive claims that HarmonyOS for PC will release next year |url=https://www.neowin.net/news/former-huawei-executive-claims-that-harmonyos-for-pc-will-release-next-year/ |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=Neowin |language=en}}</ref>

== Trademarks ==
In May 2019, Huawei applied for registration of the trademark "Hongmeng" through the Chinese Patent Office [[China National Intellectual Property Administration|CNIPA]], but the application was rejected in pursuance to Article 30 of the [[China|PRC]] Trade Mark Law, citing the trademark was similar to that of "CRM Hongmeng" in graphic design and "Hongmeng" in Chinese word.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China IP Case Spotlight: May 2021 (Issue 7) – Intellectual Property – China |url=https://www.mondaq.com/china/trademark/1071812/china-ip-case-spotlight-may-2021-issue-7 |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.mondaq.com}}</ref>

In less than a week before launching HarmonyOS 2.0 and new devices by Huawei, the [[Beijing Intellectual Property Court]] announced the first-instance judgement in May 2021 to uphold the decision by CNIPA as the trademark was not sufficiently distinctive in terms of its designated services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-05-13 |title=Huawei's Android replacement may need a new Chinese name |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3133362/huawei-hits-stumbling-block-harmonyos-roll-out-after-chinese-court |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Rouse-Rachel Li-Mei |last2=Am |last3=Yang |first3=a |last4=Cui |first4=Hatty |date=21 May 2021 |title=Huawei Hongmeng "Harmony" Trade Mark Refusal Decision was Upheld in the First-Instance Judgment {{!}} Lexology |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d2e26681-d33d-495e-ad6a-91929455d12c |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.lexology.com |language=en}}</ref>

On October 22, 2024, It has been reported that Huawei has applied for registration of more than 400 HarmonyOS related trademarks in China.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benjamin |date=2024-10-22 |title=Huawei has applied for registration of more than 400 Hongmeng trademarks |url=https://harmonyoshub.com/huawei-has-applied-for-registration-of-more-than-400-hongmeng-trademarks/ |access-date=2024-10-23 |website=HarmonyOSHub |language=en-GB}}</ref>
