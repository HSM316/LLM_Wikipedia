'''Harmony OS''' ({{zh|s=鸿蒙|p=Hóngméng}}), styled as '''HarmonyOS''', is an upcoming [[open source]], [[microkernel]]-based [[distributed operating system]] being developed by [[Huawei]]. Unveiled on 9 August 2019, the platform is designed primarily for [[internet of things]] (IoT) devices.

== History ==
Reports surrounding an in-house operating system being developed by Huawei date back as far as 2012. They intensified in May 2019 after Huawei was subjected to export restrictions by the United States government for violations of [[United States sanctions against Iran]]. Huawei executive Richard Yu described an in-house platform as a "plan B" in case it is prevented from using [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on future [[smartphone]] products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/21/2019-10616/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list|title=Addition of Entities to the Entity List|date=2019-05-21|website=Federal Register|access-date=2019-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608070718/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/21/2019-10616/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list|archive-date=8 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3001685/huawei-confirms-it-has-built-its-own-operating-system-just-case-us|title=Huawei confirms it has its own OS on back shelf as a plan B|date=14 March 2019|website=South China Morning Post|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521023511/https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3001685/huawei-confirms-it-has-built-its-own-operating-system-just-case-us|archive-date=21 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265646/huawei-operating-systems-android-windows-ban|title=Huawei developed its own operating systems in case it's banned from using Android and Windows|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 March 2019|website=The Verge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525004428/https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265646/huawei-operating-systems-android-windows-ban|archive-date=25 May 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/huawei-has-built-its-own-operating-system-for-smartphones-laptops.html|title=Huawei built software for smartphones and laptops in case it can't use Microsoft or Google|last=Kharpal|first=Arjun|date=15 March 2019|website=CNBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522193246/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/huawei-has-built-its-own-operating-system-for-smartphones-laptops.html|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>

Prior to its unveiling, it was originally speculated to be a [[mobile operating system]] that could replace [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on future Huawei devices (in response to financial sanctions imposed on Huawei by the United States government in May 2019), but by July 2019, some Huawei executives were describing Harmony as being an "industrial" [[embedded operating system]] designed for IoT hardware, discarding the previous statements for it to be a mobile operating system. These details were confirmed upon the official unveiling of the platform in 2019, with Huawei listing use cases such as [[smart TV]]s, [[in-car entertainment]], and [[wearable device]]s.

Some media outlets reported that this OS, referred to as "Hongmeng OS", could be released in China in either August or September 2019, with a worldwide release in the second quarter of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18636841/huawei-android-windows-alternatives-europe-us-editorial|title=Huawei's Android and Windows alternatives are destined for failure|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=May 23, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/huawei-our-own-operating-system-could-be-ready-this-year.html|title=Huawei says its own operating system could be ready this year if it can't use Google or Microsoft|first=Arjun|last=Kharpal|date=May 23, 2019|website=CNBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/huaweis-os-to-be-rolled-out-next-month|title=Huawei says its Android OS replacement launch date is still undecided [Updated]|first1=Naushad K.|last1=Cherrayil|first2=John McCann 2019-05-28T15:33:46Z Mobile|last2=phones|website=TechRadar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-may-be-building-an-ark-os-as-it-prepares-for-life-after-android|title=Huawei may be building an Ark (OS) as it prepares for life after Android|first=John McCann 2019-05-28T09:07:56Z Mobile|last=phones|website=TechRadar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huaweis-hongmeng-android-alternative-may-arrive-next-month/|title=Huawei's HongMeng Android alternative launch date uncertain|first=Eli|last=Blumenthal|website=CNET}}</ref> On 24 May 2019, Huawei registered "Hongmeng OS" as a [[trademark]] in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-os-reportedly-far-from-ready-after-android-ban-software/|title=Huawei OS may be called 'Hongmeng,' but it's reportedly 'far from ready'|first=Corinne|last=Reichert|website=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-needs-googles-android-huawei-trademarks-its-own-smartphone-os-11558693195|title=Who Needs Google's Android?

In July 2019, Huawei chairman [[Liang Hua]] stated that the OS was intended for "industrial" use and that Huawei "[had not] decided yet if the Hongmeng OS can be developed as a [[Mobile operating system|smartphone operating system]] in the future" (preferring the continued use of Android for these devices).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technode.com/2019/07/12/huawei-chairman-android-remains-our-first-choice/|title=Android remains our 'first choice': Huawei chairman|date=2019-07-12|website=TechNode|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Building upon the statement, Huawei's senior vice president Catherine Chen stated that it was an [[embedded operating system]] designed for [[Internet of things]] (IoT) hardware.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|title=Huawei says Harmony OS isn't designed as an Android replacement|last=Keane|first=Sean|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700411/huawei-hongmeng-os-android-replacement-not|title=Huawei says its Harmony OS isn't an Android replacement after all|last=Byford|first=Sam|date=2019-07-19|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref><ref name = "Cuthberston, The Independent, 2019" > {{ Cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/huawei-android-us-trade-ban-google-china-hongmeng-os-a8996481.html | title = Huawei reveals Android alternative, claiming it is 60 per cent faster | access-date = 3 August 2019 | first = Anthony | last = Cuthberston | date = 9 July 2019 | website = [[The Independent]] | quote = Ren Zhengfei said his firm's Harmony OS would be up to 60 per cent faster than Android and would connect across multiple smart devices  – ranging from cars to phones. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190710195106/https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/huawei-android-us-trade-ban-google-china-hongmeng-os-a8996481.html | archive-date = 20 July 2019 | df = dmy-all }} </ref>

On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled Harmony OS at its inaugural developers' conference in [[Dongguan]]. Huawei described Harmony as an open source, [[microkernel]]-based distributed operating system for various types of hardware, with faster [[inter-process communication]] than [[QNX]] or Google's [[Google Fuchsia|"Fuchsia"]] microkernel, and [[real-time computing|real-time]] resource allocation. The ARK compiler can be used to port Android [[Android application package|APK packages]] to the OS. Huawei stated that developers would be able to "flexibly" deploy Harmony OS software across various device categories; the company focused primarily on IoT devices, including "smart displays", [[wearable device]]s, and [[in-car entertainment]] systems, and did not explicitly position Harmony OS as a mobile OS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/|title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android|title=Huawei’s new operating system is called HarmonyOS|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-09|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

== Devices ==
Huawei stated that Harmony OS would initially be used on devices targeting the Chinese market. The company's subsidiary brand, [[Honor (brand)|Honor]], unveiled the Honor Vision line of [[smart TV]]s as the first consumer electronics devices to run Harmony OS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/10/20798260/huawei-honor-smart-tv-vision-pro-harmonyos-china|title=The Honor Vision TV is Huawei’s first HarmonyOS device|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-10|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony"/>
