Huawei described HarmonyOS as a [[Free software|free]], [[microkernel]]-based distributed operating system for various types of hardware. The company focused primarily on IoT devices, including smart TVs, [[wearable device]]s, and [[in-car entertainment]] systems, and did not explicitly position HarmonyOS as a mobile OS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/|title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android|title=Huawei's new operating system is called HarmonyOS|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-09|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

In addition to standard folders that require tapping on them to display their contents, folders can be enlarged to always show their contents without text labels directly on the home screen.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Amy |date=2022-09-25 |title=HarmonyOS 3 Large Folders Sizes: 3×1, 1×3, 3×6, 3×3 |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-3-large-folders-sizes-3x1-1x3-3x6-3x3/ |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref>

Apps can support "snippets", which expose a portion of the app's functionality (such as a media player's controls, or a weather forecast) via a pop-up window by swiping up on their icon, and can be pinned to the home screen as a [[Software widget|widget]]. Apps with snippets are denoted by an underline below their icon.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Li |first=Deng |date=2021-07-15 |title=Huawei HarmonyOS 2 Feature: App Snippets |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-harmonyos-2-feature-app-snippets/ |access-date=2022-09-11 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref> Apps and services can provide ''cards''; as of HarmonyOS 3.0, cards can also be displayed as widgets with different sizes and shapes to adapt to the home screen layout, and can also be stacked.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HarmonyOS 3.0 unveiled with improved homescreen, privacy and performance |url=https://www.gsmarena.com/harmonyos_30_unveiled_with_improved_homescreen_privacy_and_performance-news-55218.php |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=GSMArena.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Document {{!}} Huawei Developers |url=https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/quickApp-Guides/quickapp-develop-card-0000001126786241 |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=developer.huawei.com}}</ref>

The user interface font of HarmonyOS is HarmonyOS Sans. It is designed to be easy to read, unique, and universal. The system font is used throughout the operating system alongside its Android-based EMUI 12 counterpart, including third-party HarmonyOS and Android apps.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amit |date=2021-06-09 |title=Huawei HarmonyOS Sans font officially launched |url=https://www.huaweiupdate.com/huawei-harmonyos-sans-font-officially-launched/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Huawei Update |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Software ===
[[Huawei AppGallery]] serves as the [[application store]] for HarmonyOS, and can also distribute Android-compatible; HarmonyOS-native apps are marked with its logo on the corner of icons.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |title=Document – Design Overview |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/design/des-guides/service-overview-0000001139795693 |url-status=live |access-date=2021-06-22 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web |last=Amit |date=2021-06-05 |title=HarmonyOS applications launched: More icons with HMOS corners |url=https://www.huaweiupdate.com/harmonyos-applications-launched-more-icons-with-hmos-corners/ |access-date=2021-06-22 |website=Huawei Update |language=en-US}}</ref> Both HarmonyOS apps and Android apps are allowed to utilize [[Huawei Mobile Services]] as an option.

Applications for HarmonyOS are mostly built using components of ArkUI, a Declarative User Interface framework. ArkUI elements are adaptable to various devices and include new interface rules with automatic updates along with HarmonyOS updates.<ref>{{cite web |title=ArkUI |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/develop/arkUI |website=Huawei |publisher=Huawei}}</ref> 

HarmonyOS primarily uses "App Pack" (.app) files for the distribution of software. Each App Pack contains a manifest file and one or more "HarmonyOS Ability Packages" (HAP, .hap), which are either an "entry" package (the main module of an app, of which there can be multiple instances for different device classes) or a feature module. Each HAP contains code for the module's ''abilities'', resources, libraries, and a [[JSON]] file with configuration information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Document – Application Fundamentals |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/basic-fundamentals-0000000000041611 |url-status=live |access-date=2021-06-22 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref> App Packs are published to AppGallery for distribution. The operating system contains libraries from the Linux kernel and [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP) to provide a compatibility environment for Android apps on supported platforms,<ref name=":10" /> thus Android [[APK file|APK files]] and [[Android App Bundle|App Bundles]] (AAB) may also be published to AppGallery.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":9" /> 

HarmonyOS as a universal single IoT platform allows developers to write apps once and run everywhere across devices such as phones, tablets, personal computers, TVs, cars, smartwatches, single board computers under [[OpenHarmony]], and screen-less IoT devices such as smart speakers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Amadeo |first1=Ron |title=Huawei announces its first operating system, HarmonyOS |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/huawei-announces-its-first-operating-system-harmonyos/ |access-date=August 9, 2019 |website=Ars Technica |date=9 August 2019 |publisher=Ars Technica}}</ref>

MineHarmony is compatible with about 400 types of underground coal mining equipment, providing the equipment with a single interface to transmit and collect data for analysis. Wang Chenglu, President of Huawei’s consumer business AI and smart full-scenario business department, indicated that the launch of MineHarmony OS signified that the HarmonyOS ecology had taken a step further from [[Direct-to-consumer|B2C]] to [[Business-to-business|B2B]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Udin |first1=Efe |title=HUAWEI LAUNCHES HARMONY MINE OPERATING SYSTEM |url=https://www.gizchina.com/2021/09/15/huawei-launches-harmony-mine-operating-system/#:~:text=In%20September%202020%2C%20the%20Open%20Atom%20Open%20Source,units%20established%20the%20OpenHarmony%20project%20group%20working%20committee. |website=gizchina |date=15 September 2021 |publisher=gizchina |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei Launches Industrial Operating System for Coal Mines - Caixin Global |url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-09-16/huawei-launches-industrial-operating-system-for-coal-mines-101773904.html |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=www.caixinglobal.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MineHarmony OS and Mining IoT |url=https://e.huawei.com/en/solutions/industries/mining/mine-ict-technology-enablement/harmony-os |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=Huawei Enterprise |language=en}}</ref>

== Relationship with OpenEuler ==
In terms of architecture, HarmonyOS has close relationship with OpenEuler, a community edition of [[EulerOS]] developed by Huawei, as they have inherited the sharing of kernel technology. The sharing is reportedly to be strengthened in the future in the areas of the distributed [[software bus]], system security, device driver framework and new programming language.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sarkar |first1=Amy |title=HarmonyOS and OpenEuler has shared operating system kernel: Huawei |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-and-openeuler-has-shared-operating-system-kernel-huawei/ |website=Huawei Central |date=9 November 2021 |publisher=Huawei Central |access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref>
== Relationship with OpenHarmony, Linux and LiteOS ==
[[OpenHarmony]] is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the [[OpenAtom Foundation]]. It supports devices running a mini system such as printers, speakers, smartwatches and any other smart device with memory as small as 128 KB, or running a standard system with memory greater than 128 MB.<ref>{{Cite web|title=en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md · OpenHarmony/docs|url=http://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md|access-date=2021-07-03|website=Gitee|language=zh-CN}}</ref> The open-source operating system contains the basic capabilities of HarmonyOS and does not depend on the [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developers Taking Off AOSP And Show OpenHarmony Pure Version Of System {{!}} SPARROWS NEWS|url=https://sparrowsnews.com/2021/06/04/openharmony-pure-version-of-system/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=sparrowsnews.com|date=4 June 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Conversely, HarmonyOS runs on Huawei's proprietary microkernel architecture and has used bits of [[Android (Operating System)|AOSP]] codes from EMUI with the [[Linux kernel]] subsystem in smartphones to enable the operating system to run [[Android application package|APK]] apps with the widgets for compatibility without [[Rooting (Android)|root]] support just as with older Huawei EMUI-based smartphones. In addition, the OS supports native HarmonyOS apps on devices with [[Huawei Mobile Services]] via Ark Compiler.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|date=2021-06-04|title=What HarmonyOS 2 means for the Google and Apple duopoly|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3136017/will-huaweis-harmony-operating-system-end-global-duopoly-googles|access-date=2021-06-21|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>

Using a multi-kernel design, HarmonyOS selects appropriate OS kernels for devices with various resource limitations. It uses the [[LiteOS]] kernel instead of the Linux kernel on low-powered devices such as smartwatches and IoT devices.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Document |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-overview-0000000000011903 |access-date=2022-05-22 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Porter |first=Jon |date=2021-06-02 |title=Huawei's Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch |url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs |access-date=2022-05-22 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>

When testing the new MatePad Pro in June 2021, ''Android Authority'' and ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly observed similarities in "behavior", including that it was possible to install apps from Android [[APK file]]s on the HarmonyOS-based tablet, and that it included the Android 10 [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] app reaffirming earlier rumor mills.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|date=2021-06-02|title=Harmony OS 2.0 includes Android Q's easter egg app|url=https://www.androidauthority.com/harmony-os-2-android-1231446/|access-date=2021-06-02|website=Android Authority|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

Initially, Huawei stated that HarmonyOS was a microkernel-based, distributed OS that was completely different from Android and iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Deng|date=2020-09-21|title=HarmonyOS/Hongmeng OS: Here's everything you need to know about this new Operating System|url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-hongmeng-os-everything-you-need-to-know/|access-date=2020-12-20|website=Huawei Central|language=en-US}}</ref> A Huawei spokesperson subsequently stated that HarmonyOS supports multiple kernels and uses a Linux kernel if a device has a large amount of RAM, and that the company had taken advantage of a large number of third-party open-source resources, including Linux, to accelerate the development of a comprehensive architecture.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":5" />
=== Market share ===
On December 23, 2021, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group claimed that HarmonyOS had reached 300 million smartphones and other [[Smart device|smart devices]], including 200 million devices in the ecosystem and 100 million third-party consumer products from industry partners.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Deng |title=300 Million HarmonyOS Devices Goal Achieved – 200 million Huawei and 100 million third party |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/300-million-harmonyos-devices-goal-achieved-200-million-huawei-and-100-million-third-party/ |access-date=December 24, 2021 |website=HC Newsroom |date=24 December 2021 |publisher=HC Newsroom}}</ref>

Market research conducted in China by Strategy Analytics showed that Harmony OS was the third largest smartphone platform after [[Apple iOS]] and [[Google Android]], reaching a record high of 4% market share in China during the first quarter of 2022, up from zero just a year earlier. This increase in market share took place after the operating system was also launched for smartphone devices in June 2021. HarmonyOS was reported to be the fastest growing smartphone operating-system in China, which was the world's largest smartphone market in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=cycles |first1=This text provides general information Statista assumes no liability for the information given being complete or correct Due to varying update |last2=Text |first2=Statistics Can Display More up-to-Date Data Than Referenced in the |title=Topic: Smartphone market in China |url=https://www.statista.com/topics/1416/smartphone-market-in-china/ |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> The research claimed that in the first quarter of 2022 the platform outgrew its rivals, such as Android and Apple iOS, from a low install base of about 150 million smart devices overall, particularly due to the good support in China and the HarmonyOS software upgrades that Huawei made available for its older handset models and its former sub-brands such as [[Honor (brand)|Honor]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mawston|first=Neil|date=2022-05-10|title=HarmonyOS Hits Record High in China|url=https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/devices/handset-country-share/handset-country-share/2022/05/10/harmonyos-hits-record-high-in-china#.YntCe2S2y6g.twitter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sarkar|first=Amy|date=2021-10-22|title=Huawei HarmonyOS completes 150 million upgrades|url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-harmonyos-completes-150-million-upgrades/|access-date=2021-10-31|website=Huawei Central|language=en-US}}</ref>

	On August 8, 2022, after the soft launch of HarmonyOS 3,  Sina Finance, part of [[Sina Corporation]], and Huawei Central reported that the number of Huawei HarmonyOS Connect devices had exceeded 470 million units. By summer 2022, 14 OpenHarmony distributions had  been launched.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Deng |title=HarmonyOS industry continues to expand, 14 OpneHarmony distributions launched so far |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-industry-continues-to-expand/ |website=Huawei Central |date=8 August 2022 |publisher=Huawei Central |access-date=August 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=上海证券报 |date=2022-08-08 |title=鸿蒙产业链不断延伸，商业化大门逐渐打开 |url=https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2022-08-08/doc-imizmscv5280727.shtml |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=finance.sina.com.cn}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
In May 2019, Huawei applied for registration of the trademark "Hongmeng" through the Chinese Patent Office [[China National Intellectual Property Administration|CNIPA]], but the application was rejected in pursuance to Article 30 of the [[China|PRC]] Trade Mark Law, citing the trademark was similar to that of "CRM Hongmeng" in graphic design and "Hongmeng" in Chinese word.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China IP Case Spotlight: May 2021 (Issue 7) – Intellectual Property – China |url=https://www.mondaq.com/china/trademark/1071812/china-ip-case-spotlight-may-2021-issue-7 |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.mondaq.com}}</ref>

In less than a week before launching HarmonyOS 2.0 and new devices by Huawei, the [[Beijing Intellectual Property Court]] announced the first-instance judgement in May 2021 to uphold the decision by CNIPA as the trademark was not sufficiently distinctive in terms of its designated services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-05-13 |title=Huawei's Android replacement may need a new Chinese name |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3133362/huawei-hits-stumbling-block-harmonyos-roll-out-after-chinese-court |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Rouse-Rachel Li-Mei |last2=Am |last3=Yang |first3=a |last4=Cui |first4=Hatty |date=21 May 2021 |title=Huawei Hongmeng "Harmony" Trade Mark Refusal Decision was Upheld in the First-Instance Judgment {{!}} Lexology |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d2e26681-d33d-495e-ad6a-91929455d12c |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.lexology.com |language=en}}</ref>

However, it was reported that the trademark had officially been transferred from Huizhou Qibei Technology to Huawei by end of May 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei has been transferred the trademark of Hongmeng |url=https://equalocean.com/briefing/20210601230050314 |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=EqualOcean |language=en}}</ref>
