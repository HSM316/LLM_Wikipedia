'''HarmonyOS''' ('''HMOS''') ({{zh|s=鸿蒙|p=Hóngméng}}) is a [[distributed operating system]] developed by [[Huawei]] for smartphones, tablets, TVs, smart watches, and other smart devices. It has a [[multikernel]] design with dual frameworks: the operating system selects suitable kernels from the [[abstraction layer]] in the case of devices that use diverse resources.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Document – About HarmonyOS |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-overview-0000000000011903 |access-date=2021-06-17 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei's Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs|access-date=2021-06-16|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei's HarmonyOS arrives on tablets with the new MatePad Pro|url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463666/huawei-matepad-pro-harmonyos-tablet-features-specs|access-date=2021-06-16|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

The operating system was officially launched by Huawei in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HARMONYOS Everything about HarmonyOS (HongMeng OS) – Features, Eligible Devices, and Release |url=https://consumer.huawei.com/za/community/details/HARMONYOS-Everything-about-HarmonyOS-HongMeng-OS-Features-Eligible-Devices-and-Release/topicId_130783/ |access-date=2023-09-16 |website=consumer.huawei.com |language=en-ZA}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
HarmonyOS is designed with a layered architecture, which consists of four layers; the [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] layer at the bottom provides the upper three layers, i.e., the system service layer, framework layer and application layer, with basic kernel capabilities, such as [[Process (computing)|process]] and [[Thread (computing)|thread]] management, [[memory management]], [[file system]], [[network management]], and [[peripheral]] management.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About HarmonyOS |url=https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/harmonyos-overview-0000000000011903 |access-date=2023-09-23 |website=developer.harmonyos.com}}</ref>

In the kernel layer, the system applies a [[multikernel]] design and selects an appropriate kernel for a device with different resource limitations. For wearables, screenless I/O devices and IoT devices, the system is based on [[real-time operating system]] [[LiteOS]]; while for smartphones and tablets, the system operates by utilizing a Linux kernel subsystem and executing the [[Android (operating system)|AOSP]] code with a modified [[EMUI]] user interface, enabling [[apk (file format)|Android apps]] and [[App (file format)|HarmonyOS apps]] to run seamlessly through a [[compatibility layer]] in the [[User space and kernel space#Overview|userland]] outside the kernel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=阿里云资深专家崮德：谈谈我对华为HarmonyOS 2.0的看法|url=https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000040203399|access-date=2021-06-23|website=segmentfault.com|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Amy |date=2019-04-28 |title=ARK Compiler: Huawei's self-developed Android application compiler – Explained |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/ark-compiler-huaweis-self-developed-android-application-compiler-explained/ |access-date=2022-05-22 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref>

Prior to its unveiling, it was originally speculated to be a [[mobile operating system]] that could replace Android on future Huawei devices. In June 2019, an Huawei executive told [[Reuters]] that the OS was under testing in China, and could be ready "in months", but by July 2019, some Huawei executives described the OS as being an [[embedded operating system]] designed for IoT hardware, discarding the previous statements for it to be a mobile operating system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keane|title=Huawei says Hongmeng OS isn't designed as an Android replacement|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719184715/https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-says-hongmeng-os-isnt-designed-as-android-replacement/|archive-date=19 July 2019|access-date=2019-07-19|website=CNET|language=en}}</ref>

On 9 August 2019, three months after the [[Entity List]] ban, Huawei publicly unveiled HarmonyOS, which Huawei said it had been working on since 2012, at its inaugural developers' conference in [[Dongguan]]. Huawei described HarmonyOS as a [[Free software|free]], [[microkernel]]-based distributed operating system for various types of hardware. The company focused primarily on IoT devices, including smart TVs, [[wearable device]]s, and [[in-car entertainment]] systems, and did not explicitly position HarmonyOS as a mobile OS.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-04 |title=What HarmonyOS 2 means for the Google and Apple duopoly |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3136017/will-huaweis-harmony-operating-system-end-global-duopoly-googles |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/|title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref><ref name="verge-harmony">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android|title=Huawei's new operating system is called HarmonyOS|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-08-09|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

=== MineHarmony OS ===
On 14 September 2021, Huawei announced the launch of MineHarmony OS, a customized operating system by Huawei based on its in-house HarmonyOS for industrial use. MineHarmony is compatible with about 400 types of underground coal mining equipment, providing the equipment with a single interface to transmit and collect data for analysis. Wang Chenglu, President of Huawei’s consumer business AI and smart full-scenario business department, indicated that the launch of MineHarmony OS signified that the HarmonyOS ecology had taken a step further from [[Direct-to-consumer|B2C]] to [[Business-to-business|B2B]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Udin |first1=Efe |title=HUAWEI LAUNCHES HARMONY MINE OPERATING SYSTEM |url=https://www.gizchina.com/2021/09/15/huawei-launches-harmony-mine-operating-system/#:~:text=In%20September%202020%2C%20the%20Open%20Atom%20Open%20Source,units%20established%20the%20OpenHarmony%20project%20group%20working%20committee. |website=gizchina |date=15 September 2021 |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei Launches Industrial Operating System for Coal Mines - Caixin Global |url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-09-16/huawei-launches-industrial-operating-system-for-coal-mines-101773904.html |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=www.caixinglobal.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MineHarmony OS and Mining IoT |url=https://e.huawei.com/en/solutions/industries/mining/mine-ict-technology-enablement/harmony-os |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=Huawei Enterprise |language=en}}</ref>

== Relationship with OpenEuler ==
In terms of architecture, HarmonyOS has close relationship with OpenEuler, which is a community edition of [[EulerOS]], as they have implemented the sharing of kernel technology as revealed by Deng Taihua, President of Huawei's Computing Product Line.<ref>{{Cite web |title=华为公布欧拉系统细节：已与鸿蒙内核共享 |url=https://news.mydrivers.com/1/794/794917.htm |access-date=2023-10-10 |website=快科技}}</ref> The sharing is reportedly to be strengthened in the future in the areas of the distributed [[software bus]], system security, device driver framework and new programming language.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sarkar |first1=Amy |title=HarmonyOS and OpenEuler has shared operating system kernel: Huawei |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-and-openeuler-has-shared-operating-system-kernel-huawei/ |website=Huawei Central |date=9 November 2021 |access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref>

== Relationship with OpenHarmony, Linux and LiteOS ==

=== Architecture ===
[[OpenHarmony]] is an open-source version of HarmonyOS donated by Huawei to the [[OpenAtom Foundation]], built around a LiteOS kernel. It supports devices running a mini system such as printers, speakers, smartwatches and any other smart device with memory as small as 128 KB, or running a standard system with memory greater than 128 MB.<ref>{{Cite web|title=en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md · OpenHarmony/docs|url=http://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/OpenHarmony-Overview.md|access-date=2021-07-03|website=Gitee|language=zh-CN}}</ref> The open-source operating system contains the basic capabilities of HarmonyOS and does not depend on the [[Android Open Source Project]] (AOSP) dependencies in the subsystem.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Developers Taking Off AOSP And Show OpenHarmony Pure Version Of System |url=https://sparrowsnews.com/2021/06/04/openharmony-pure-version-of-system/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=sparrowsnews.com|date=4 June 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref>

HarmonyOS uses a "kernel [[abstraction layer]]" (KAL) subsystem, so that developers can select a different OS kernel and sometimes flexibility with multiple kernels based on the resource limitations on each device. It also adapts to the [[LiteOS]] kernel instead of the Linux kernel on low-powered devices such as wearables, Huawei's GT specific smartwatches and IoT screen and screenless I/O devices.<ref name=":11" />

On smartphones, HarmonyOS runs on the [[Linux kernel]] on top of the kernel abstraction layer<ref>{{Cite web |title=Porting Overview |url=https://docs.openharmony.cn/pages/v3.1/en/device-dev/porting/porting-chip-kernel-overview.md/ |access-date=2023-08-17}}</ref> (KAL) subsystem. The userland uses [[Android (operating system)|AOSP]] code from [[EMUI]] system launcher to run [[Android application package|APK]] apps without [[Rooting (Android)|root]] support just as with older Huawei EMUI-based smartphones. In addition, the OS supports native HarmonyOS apps in [[App (file format)|app packages]] on devices with [[Huawei Mobile Services]] via Ark Compiler, with the OpenHarmony layer of HarmonyOS framework under the dual framework in the System Service Layer.<ref name=":10" />

=== Microkernel ===
HarmonyOS uses a "kernel [[abstraction layer]]" (KAL) subsystem, so that developers can select a different OS kernel and sometimes flexibility with multiple kernels based on the resource limitations on each device.

On August 4, 2023 at Huawei Developers Conference 2023 (HDC), Huawei officially announced HarmonyOS NEXT, a revised version of a [[microkernel]]-based distributed operating system supporting only native [[App (file format)|APP]] apps via Ark Compiler with [[Huawei Mobile Services|Huawei Mobile Services (HMS)]] support. Based on modified [[OpenHarmony]], HarmonyOS NEXT system has the HarmonyOS microkernel at its core with a single framework. It does not include the compatibility layer of [[Android (operating system)|AOSP]] framework with Android libraries from [[EMUI]] in the [[User space and kernel space|user space]] and cannot run Android [[Apk (file format)|apk]] apps natively as the current dual framework HarmonyOS.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cañete |first=Patrick |date=2023-08-10 |title=HarmonyOS NEXT is a standalone HUAWEI OS without Android apps |url=https://www.noypigeeks.com/tech-news/harmonyos-next-without-android-apps/ |access-date=2023-08-11 |website=NoypiGeeks |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the long term, the incoming HarmonyOS NEXT operating system is aimed to replace the current [[multikernel]] HarmonyOS. On August 4, 2023, the developer preview version of HarmonyOS NEXT was opened for cooperating enterprise developers to build and test native mobile apps, as well as building up the kernel component based on the [[microkernel]] architecture that has been partially [[Open-source software|open sourced]] at the [[Gitee]] code repository on the same day of launch.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OpenHarmony-SIG/tee_tee_os_kernel |url=https://gitee.com/openharmony-sig/tee_tee_os_kernel |access-date=2023-09-02 |website=Gitee |language=zh-CN}}</ref> It will be open to all developers in the first quarter of 2024 according to the official announcement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Amy |date=2023-08-07 |title=HarmonyOS NEXT is a pure HarmonyOS without Android apps and future of Huawei ecosystem |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-next-is-a-pure-harmonyos-without-android-apps-and-future-of-huawei-ecosystem/ |access-date=2023-08-11 |website=Huawei Central |language=en-US}}</ref>

On September 4, 2023, it was reported in [[Weibo.com|Weibo]] social media in China with western tech blogs revealing former Huawei executive's claims that HarmonyOS for PC would be released next year, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Neowin · |first=Omer Dursun |date=2023-09-07 |title=Former Huawei executive claims that HarmonyOS for PC will release next year |url=https://www.neowin.net/news/former-huawei-executive-claims-that-harmonyos-for-pc-will-release-next-year/ |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=Neowin |language=en}}</ref>

On September 25, 2023, Huawei during its Autumn Launch Event officially announced HarmonyOS NEXT, the next version of HarmonyOS, which will only run HarmonyOS native applications.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Amit |date=2023-09-25 |title=Huawei released HarmonyOS NEXT |url=https://www.huaweiupdate.com/huawei-released-harmonyos-next/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=HU |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Reception ==
=== Criticism ===
{{See also|Criticism of Huawei|United States sanctions against China}}
HarmonyOS running on smartphones was rumored at ''[[Ars Technica]]'' as a "rebranded version of Android and EMUI" with nearly "identical code bases".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2021-06-02|title=Huawei officially replaces Android with HarmonyOS, which is also Android|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/huaweis-harmonyos-will-rollout-to-100-android-models-over-the-next-year/|access-date=2021-06-24|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref> Following the release of the HarmonyOS 2.0 beta, ''Ars Technica'' and [[XDA Developers]] speculated that "the smartphone version of the OS had been [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from [[Android 10]]". ''Ars Technica'' alleged that it resembled the existing EMUI software used on Huawei devices, but with all references to "Android" replaced by "HarmonyOS". It was also noted that the [[DevEco Studio]] software built based on [[JetBrains]] open source [[IntelliJ IDEA]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] "shared components and tool chains" with [[Android Studio]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-26|title=Huawei's "Harmony OS 2.0 beta appears to be based on Android" after all|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/harmony-os-2-0-initial-version-based-on-android/|access-date=2021-01-20|website=xda-developers|language=en-US}}</ref>

When testing the new MatePad Pro in June 2021, ''Android Authority'' and ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly observed similarities in "behavior", including that it was possible to install apps from Android [[APK file]]s on the HarmonyOS-based tablet, and to run the Android 10 [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] apk app, reaffirming earlier rumor mills.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|date=2021-06-02|title=Harmony OS 2.0 includes Android Q's easter egg app|url=https://www.androidauthority.com/harmony-os-2-android-1231446/|access-date=2021-06-02|website=Android Authority|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

Initially, Huawei stated that HarmonyOS was a microkernel-based, distributed OS that was completely different from Android and iOS.<ref name=micro>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Deng|date=2020-09-21|title=HarmonyOS/Hongmeng OS: Here's everything you need to know about this new Operating System|url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-hongmeng-os-everything-you-need-to-know/|access-date=2020-12-20|website=Huawei Central|language=en-US}}</ref> A Huawei spokesperson subsequently stated that HarmonyOS supports multiple kernels and uses a Linux kernel if a device has a large amount of RAM, and that the company had taken advantage of a large number of third-party open-source resources, including Linux, to accelerate the development of the system as a future-proof, microkernel-based, and distributed OS running on multiple devices.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Huawei reveals HarmonyOS, its alternative to Android |url=https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-09-huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android.html |access-date=2023-08-01 |website=Engadget |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Market share ===
On December 23, 2021, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group claimed that HarmonyOS had reached 300 million smartphones and other [[Smart device|smart devices]], including 200 million devices in the ecosystem and 100 million third-party consumer products from industry partners.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Deng |title=300 Million HarmonyOS Devices Goal Achieved – 200 million Huawei and 100 million third party |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/300-million-harmonyos-devices-goal-achieved-200-million-huawei-and-100-million-third-party/ |access-date=December 24, 2021 |website=HC Newsroom |date=24 December 2021 }}</ref>

Market research conducted in China by Strategy Analytics showed that Harmony OS was the third largest smartphone platform after [[Apple iOS]] and [[Google Android]], reaching a record high of 4% market share in China during the first quarter of 2022, up from zero just a year earlier. This increase in market share took place after the operating system was also launched for smartphone devices in June 2021. 

HarmonyOS was reported to be the fastest growing smartphone operating-system in China, which was the world's largest smartphone market in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=cycles |first1=This text provides general information Statista assumes no liability for the information given being complete or correct Due to varying update |last2=Text |first2=Statistics Can Display More up-to-Date Data Than Referenced in the |title=Topic: Smartphone market in China |url=https://www.statista.com/topics/1416/smartphone-market-in-china/ |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> The research claimed that in the first quarter of 2022 the platform outgrew its rivals, such as Android and Apple iOS, from a low install base of about 150 million smart devices overall, particularly due to the good support in China and the HarmonyOS software upgrades that Huawei made available for its older handset models and its former sub-brands such as [[Honor (brand)|Honor]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mawston|first=Neil|date=2022-05-10|title=HarmonyOS Hits Record High in China|url=https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/devices/handset-country-share/handset-country-share/2022/05/10/harmonyos-hits-record-high-in-china#.YntCe2S2y6g.twitter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sarkar|first=Amy|date=2021-10-22|title=Huawei HarmonyOS completes 150 million upgrades|url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/huawei-harmonyos-completes-150-million-upgrades/|access-date=2021-10-31|website=Huawei Central|language=en-US}}</ref>

On August 8, 2022, after the soft launch of HarmonyOS 3, Sina Finance, part of [[Sina Corporation]], and Huawei Central reported that the number of Huawei HarmonyOS Connect devices had exceeded 470 million units. By summer 2022, 14 OpenHarmony distributions had  been launched.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Deng |title=HarmonyOS industry continues to expand, 14 OpneHarmony distributions launched so far |url=https://www.huaweicentral.com/harmonyos-industry-continues-to-expand/ |website=Huawei Central |date=8 August 2022 |access-date=August 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=上海证券报 |date=2022-08-08 |title=鸿蒙产业链不断延伸，商业化大门逐渐打开 |url=https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2022-08-08/doc-imizmscv5280727.shtml |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=finance.sina.com.cn}}</ref>

In the third quarter of 2023, HarmonyOS had a 3% market share of smartphone operating systems globally and 13% of the Chinese market, despite Huawei being limited to LTE; growth was due to a loyal user base, and came at the expense of Android, according to Counterpoint Research.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-12 |title=Global Smartphone Sales Share by Operating System |url=https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-smartphone-os-market-share/ |access-date=2023-11-23 |website=Counterpoint}}</ref> During the launch of HarmonyOS 4 in August 2023, it was reported that the HarmonyOS had connected to more than 700 million devices.<ref name=":12" />

== Legal issues ==
In May 2019, Huawei applied for registration of the trademark "Hongmeng" through the Chinese Patent Office [[China National Intellectual Property Administration|CNIPA]], but the application was rejected in pursuance to Article 30 of the [[China|PRC]] Trade Mark Law, citing the trademark was similar to that of "CRM Hongmeng" in graphic design and "Hongmeng" in Chinese word.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China IP Case Spotlight: May 2021 (Issue 7) – Intellectual Property – China |url=https://www.mondaq.com/china/trademark/1071812/china-ip-case-spotlight-may-2021-issue-7 |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.mondaq.com}}</ref>

In less than a week before launching HarmonyOS 2.0 and new devices by Huawei, the [[Beijing Intellectual Property Court]] announced the first-instance judgement in May 2021 to uphold the decision by CNIPA as the trademark was not sufficiently distinctive in terms of its designated services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-05-13 |title=Huawei's Android replacement may need a new Chinese name |url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3133362/huawei-hits-stumbling-block-harmonyos-roll-out-after-chinese-court |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Rouse-Rachel Li-Mei |last2=Am |last3=Yang |first3=a |last4=Cui |first4=Hatty |date=21 May 2021 |title=Huawei Hongmeng "Harmony" Trade Mark Refusal Decision was Upheld in the First-Instance Judgment {{!}} Lexology |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d2e26681-d33d-495e-ad6a-91929455d12c |access-date=2021-06-24 |website=www.lexology.com |language=en}}</ref>
