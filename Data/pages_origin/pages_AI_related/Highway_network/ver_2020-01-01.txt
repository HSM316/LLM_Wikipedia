{{About|a technique used in machine learning||Highway}}

In [[machine learning]], a '''highway network''' is an approach to optimizing networks and increasing their depth. Highway networks use learned gating mechanisms to regulate information flow, inspired by [[Long short-term memory|Long Short-Term Memory]] (LSTM) [[recurrent neural networks]]. The gating mechanisms allow neural networks to have paths for information to follow across different layers ("information highways").<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Srivastava|first1=Rupesh Kumar|last2=Greff|first2=Klaus|last3=Schmidhuber|first3=Jürgen|title=Highway Networks|eprint=1505.00387|date=2 May 2015|class=cs.LG}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Srivastava|first1=Rupesh K|last2=Greff|first2=Klaus|last3=Schmidhuber|first3=Juergen|title=Training Very Deep Networks|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28|date=2015|pages=2377–2385|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5850-training-very-deep-networks|publisher=Curran Associates, Inc.}}</ref>

Highway networks have been used as part of [[Semantic analysis (machine learning)|text sequence labeling]] and [[speech recognition]] tasks.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Liu|first1=Liyuan|last2=Shang|first2=Jingbo|last3=Xu|first3=Frank F.|last4=Ren|first4=Xiang|last5=Gui|first5=Huan|last6=Peng|first6=Jian|last7=Han|first7=Jiawei|title=Empower Sequence Labeling with Task-Aware Neural Language Model|eprint=1709.04109|date=12 September 2017|class=cs.CL}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Kurata|first1=Gakuto|last2=Ramabhadran|first2=Bhuvana|last3=Saon|first3=George|last4=Sethy|first4=Abhinav|title=Language Modeling with Highway LSTM|eprint=1709.06436|date=19 September 2017|class=cs.CL}}</ref>

== Model ==
The model has two gates in addition to the '''H(W<sub>H</sub>, x)''' gate: the transform gate '''T(W<sub>T</sub>, x''') and the carry gate '''C(W<sub>C</sub>, x)'''. Those two last gates are non-linear transfer functions (by convention [[Sigmoid function]]). The '''H(W<sub>H</sub>, x)''' function can be any desired transfer function.

The carry gate is defined as '''C(W<sub>C</sub>, x) = 1 - T(W<sub>T</sub>, x)'''. While the transform gate is just a gate with a sigmoid transfer function.

=== Structure ===
The strucutre of a hidden layer follows the equation:

<math>
\begin{align}
y = H(x,W_{H}) \centerdot T(x,W_{T}) + x \centerdot C(x,W_{C}) = H(x,W_{H}) \centerdot T(x,W_{T}) + x \centerdot (1 - T(x,W_{T}))
\end{align}
</math>


The advantage of a Highway Network over the common deep neural networks is that solves or prevents partially the [[Vanishing gradient problem]], thus leading to easier to optimize neural networks.
