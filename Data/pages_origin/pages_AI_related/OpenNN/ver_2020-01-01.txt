'''OpenNN''' (Open Neural Networks Library) is a [[software library]] written in the [[C++]] [[programming language]] which implements [[neural networks]], a main area of [[deep learning]] research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/06/opennn-open-source-library-neural-networks.html|title=OpenNN, An Open Source Library For Neural Networks | publisher=KDNuggets | date= June 2014}}</ref> The library is [[open-source software|open-source]], licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].

==Characteristics==
The software implements any number of layers of non-linear processing units for [[supervised learning]]. This deep architecture allows the design of neural networks with [[Universal approximation theorem|universal approximation]] properties. Additionally, it allows [[multiprocessing]] programming by means of [[OpenMP]], in order to increase [[computer performance]].

OpenNN contains [[data mining]] algorithms as a bundle of functions. These can be embedded in other software tools, using an [[application programming interface]], for the integration of the [[predictive analytics]] tasks. In this regard, a graphical user interface is missing but some functions can be supported by specific visualization tools.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/6491835 | title=Categorization of Data Mining Tools Based on Their Types | author=J. Mary Dallfin Bruxella| journal = International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 445–452 | year = 2014 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==History==
The development started in 2003 at the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia#UPC Research Centers|International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering]], within the research project funded by the [[European Union]] called RAMFLOOD (Risk Assessment and Management of FLOODs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/67049_en.html |title=CORDIS - EU Research Project RAMFLOOD |publisher=European Commission | date=December 2004}}</ref> Then it continued as part of similar projects.
At present, OpenNN is being developed by the [[startup company]] Artelnics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artelnics.com |title=Artelnics home page}}</ref>

==Applications==
OpenNN is a general purpose [[artificial intelligence]] software package.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=142005|title=Here Are 7 Thought-Provoking AI Software Packages For Your Info|publisher=Saurabh Singh|accessdate=25 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627090333/http://efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=142005|archive-date=2014-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> It uses [[machine learning]] techniques for solving [[data mining]] and [[predictive analytics]] tasks in different fields. For instance, the library has been applied in the engineering, energy, or chemistry sectors.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Neural Networks for Variational Problems in Engineering | author = R.
