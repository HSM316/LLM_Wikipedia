'''Apple Watch''' is a line of [[smartwatch]]es designed, developed, marketed and sold by [[Apple Inc.]] It incorporates [[activity tracker|fitness tracking]] and [[Health (Apple)|health-oriented capabilities]] with integration with [[iOS]] and other Apple products and services.

Apple Watch uses a wireless connection to an [[iPhone]] to perform functions such as calling and texting, and can independently connect to a Wi-Fi network for some tasks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/how-your-apple-watch-connects-wi-fi-networks-when-away-your-iphone|title=Connect your Apple Watch to Wi-Fi for direct online usage — here's how|date=2019-07-30|website=iMore|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>. Series 3 and later LTE Apple Watches can independently connect to a [[mobile network]], largely obviating the need for an iPhone after initial setup. First-generation and Series 1 and 2 Apple Watches require an [[iPhone 5]] or later with [[IOS 10|iOS 10 or later;]] Series 3 and later LTE models require an [[iPhone 6s]] or later with iOS 11 or later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207578|title=Set up and use cellular on Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular)|publisher=}}</ref>

The second generation of Apple Watches was released in two tiers in September 2016 — the Apple Watch Series 1 and [[Apple Watch Series 2]] — while the first generation was discontinued.<ref name="anandtech aw1">{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/10659/apple-announces-apple-watch-series-2|title=Apple announces Apple Watch Series 2|first=Matt|last=Humrick|website=[[Anandtech]]|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name="imore aw1">{{cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-3-vs-older-watches-which-should-you-buy|title = Apple Watch 3 vs Apple Watch 2: What's new?|publisher=[[iMore]]|date=September 14, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref>

The Apple Watch Series 5, announced on September 10, 2019, became available on September 20, 2019. Series 4 was discontinued. Apple Watch Series 3 now sells at a lower price-point.

== Development ==
The goal of the Apple Watch was to complement an iPhone and add some new functions.<ref name="wired.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/|title=iPhone Killer: The Secret History of the Apple Watch|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> [[Kevin Lynch (computing)|Kevin Lynch]] was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: "People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?"<ref name="wired.com" /> Apple's development process was held under wraps until a [[Wired (website)|''Wired'']] article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.<ref name="wired.com" />

Rumors surrounded an Apple-developed wearable device back as far as 2011, which conceptualized the device as a variation of the [[iPod]] that would curve around the user's wrist, and feature [[Siri]] integration.<ref name="imore-earlyrumors">{{cite web|title=Rumor: Apple working on wearable iPod with Siri control &#124; iMore|url=http://www.imore.com/apple-working-wearable-ipod-siri-control|website=[[iMore]]|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> On February 10, 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Apple was beginning to develop an [[iOS]]-based smartwatch with a curved display.<ref name="verge-earlyrumors">{{cite web|title=Apple is 'experimenting' with curved glass smartwatch, says NYT and WSJ|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/10/3973364/apple-rumored-to-be-developing-ios-based-smartwatch/in/4286985|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> On February 12, 2013, ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'' reported that Apple's smartwatch project was "beyond the experimentation phase in its development", and employed at least 100 designers.<ref name="bloomberg-watchrumor">{{cite web|title=Apple Said to Have Team Developing Wristwatch Computer|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-12/apple-said-to-have-team-developing-wristwatch-computer|website=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In March 2013, reports indicated that Apple planned to release the device by the end of the year.<ref name="bloomberg-profitable">{{cite news|title=Apple's Planned ‘IWatch’ Could Be More Profitable Than TV|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-04/apple-s-planned-iwatch-could-be-more-profitable-than-tv|accessdate=July 15, 2015|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]}}</ref>  In July 2013, ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.<ref name="verge-ftblitz">{{cite web|title=Apple on iWatch hiring blitz ahead of possible late 2014 launch, says Financial Times|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

==Unveiling and release==
In April 2014, Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that the company was planning to launch new kinds of products that year, but revealed no specifics.<ref name="wsj-cooknewproducts">{{cite web|title=Apple's Cook on New Products: ‘Take the Time to Get It Right’|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/24/apples-cook-on-new-products-take-the-time-to-get-it-right/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In June 2014, [[Reuters]] reported that production was expected to begin in July for a release in October.<ref name="verge-reutersreport">{{cite web|title=Apple's iWatch may launch in October with 2.5-inch screen, says Reuters|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5825178/apple-iwatch-could-launch-in-october/in/4286985|website=}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

On September 9, 2014, during a press event where the [[iPhone 6]] was also presented, the new product was introduced by Tim Cook as "the next chapter in Apple's story" with a video that focused on its design and the various combinations of bands and case styles that would be available to the consumers. After the video, the audience rose to a standing ovation as Tim Cook reappeared onstage wearing an Apple Watch. Cook said that Apple Watch was "a precise timepiece, a new intimate way to communicate from your wrist, and a comprehensive health and fitness device."<ref name="verge-watchannounce">{{cite web|title=Apple Watch announced: available for $349 early next year|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="verge-watchfitness">{{cite web|title=The Apple Watch is poised to dominate the market for digital fitness trackers|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6127839/apple-watch-healthkit-digital-health-fitness|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of Apple Watch focused more on advertising the device as a [[fashion accessory]]; a 12-page advertising spread for Apple Watch in an issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' focused primarily on combinations of body and band styles, and downplayed its technological aspects.<ref name="wp-fashion">{{cite news|title=Apple Watch is competing as a fashion accessory, and that's a risky move|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/03/05/apple-watch-is-competing-as-a-fashion-accessory-and-thats-a-risky-move/|accessdate=July 15, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref name="mashable-applewatch-">{{cite web|title=First Apple Watch ads in U.S. magazines favor fashion lovers over techies|url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/apple-watch-vogue/|website=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> Apple later focused upon its health and fitness-oriented features, competing against dedicated [[activity tracker]]s,<ref name="techradar-isntaboutfashion">{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Bradley|title=Apple Watch isn't about fashion design; it's about the fashion industry|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/portable-devices/other-devices/apple-watch-isn-t-about-fashion-design-it-s-about-the-fashion-industry-1266075|website=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> and with watchOS 3, expanded on them with fitness tracking for wheelchair users, social sharing in the Activity app, and a Breathe app to encourage mindfulness.

===Release===
Pre-orders for the Apple Watch began on April 10, 2015, with the official release on April 24.<ref name="verge-releasedate">{{cite web|title=Apple Watch release date is April 24th, with pricing from $349 to over $10,000|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8162455/apple-watch-price-release-date-2015|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> The device was not branded as "iWatch" (which would put it in line with its pre-existing product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and [[iPad]]) because the inventor decided "Apple Watch" made more visionary sense than "iWatch," which would have followed previously-existing strategems; in the United States, the "iWatch" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics – who was [[crowdfunding]] a device under the same name, and is owned in the [[European Union]] by Irish firm Probendi.<ref name="cnet-iwatchname">{{cite web|title=Non-Apple companies hold iWatch trademark in U.S., U.K., China|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/non-apple-companies-hold-iwatch-trademark-in-u-s-u-k-china/|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="cnbc-applewatchname">{{cite web|title=Why the Apple Watch isn't called the iWatch|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/09/why-the-apple-watch-isnt-called-the-iwatch.html|website=CNBC|publisher=[[NBCUniversal Television Group|NBCUniversal News Group]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for [[trademark infringement]], arguing that through [[keyword advertising]] on the [[Google Search|Google search engine]], it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term "iWatch".<ref name="ars-iwatchlawsuit">{{cite web|title=The Apple iWatch doesn’t exist, but a legal fight over it does|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/the-apple-iwatch-doesnt-exist-but-a-legal-fight-over-it-does/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

Initially, the Apple Watch was not available at the [[Apple Store]]. Beginning on April 10, 2015, customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting, but the device was not in-stock for walk-in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online.

Apple did not explicitly market the first generation Apple Watch as being [[waterproof]], stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion ([[IP code|IPX7]]). However, external testing by [[The Iconfactory]] and others revealed that Apple Watch can function when submerged in various conditions (such as swimming), although its touchscreen experiences "erratic" behavior when submerged.<ref name="macrumors-ipx7">{{cite web|title=A Detailed Look at How the Apple Watch Functions in Water|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2015/07/14/how-apple-watch-functions-in-water/|website=[[MacRumors]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="cultofmac-swimapp">{{cite web|title=Apple Watch swim app works – but it will void your warranty|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/328280/apple-watch-swim-app-works-but-it-will-void-your-warranty/|website=[[Cult of Mac]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

===Hardware===
====First generation====
[[File:Apple S1 module.png|thumb|[[Apple S1]]|100px]]

The first-generation Apple Watch, colloquially referred to as Series 0, uses the single-core [[Apple S1|S1]] [[system-on-chip]]. It does not have a built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It uses a [[linear actuator]] called the "Taptic Engine" to provide [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.<ref name="ars-review" /> The watch is equipped with a built-in [[heart rate monitor|heart rate sensor]], which uses both [[infrared]] and visible-light [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] and [[photodiodes]].<ref>{{citation|periodical=Apple Support|title=Your heart rate.

{{main|Apple Watch Series 4}}
The fourth generation of the Apple Watch<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/09/redesigned-apple-watch-series-4-revolutionizes-communication-fitness-and-health/|title=Apple Watch Series 4: Beautifully redesigned with breakthrough communication, fitness and health capabilities.|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> was revealed during the 2018 Apple Special Event held at the [[Steve Jobs Theater]] in Cupertino, California.

The microphone was moved to the opposite side between the side button and the digital crown to improve call quality. Other changes include the digital crown incorporating haptic feedback with the Apple Haptic Engine and includes the new Apple-designed [[Apple W series|W3]] wireless chip.

====Fifth generation (Series 5)====
{{main|Apple Watch Series 5}}
The fifth generation of the Apple Watch was revealed during the 2019 Apple Special Event. It includes an always-on display with energy saving [[Low-temperature polycrystalline silicon|LTPO]] OLED screen and low-power screen driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling enabling emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more power-efficient S5 processor, improved ambient sensor, doubling of storage to 32 GB, and the addition of a [[magnetometer]], enabling a compass function. It also brought back the "Edition" tier, with a ceramic model absent from the previous generation, and a new titanium model which comes in two colors: space black and white (original)<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-edition/|title=Apple Watch Edition|website=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>.

==Software==
Apple Watch runs [[watchOS]], whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.<ref name="ars-review"/> During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an [[iPhone 5]] or later running [[iOS 8.2]] or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to advertise Apple Watch, pair Apple Watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.<ref name="ars-review">{{cite web|title=Review: The absolutely optional Apple Watch and Watch OS 1.0|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.<ref name="ars-review"/> "Glances" allowed users to swipe between pages containing [[software widget|widget-like]] displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. watchOS also supports [[iOS 8#Continuity|Handoff]] to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device,<ref name="ars-review"/> and act as a [[Electronic viewfinder|viewfinder]] for an iPhone camera,<ref name=theverge2>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6107091/apple-watch-iphone-6-most-important-things|title=The Verge: The 15 most important announcements from the Apple Watch, iPhone 6 event|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> [[Siri]] is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.<ref name="ars-review" /> Apple Watch also supports [[Apple Pay]], and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain [[near-field communication]] (NFC) support.<ref name="ars-review" />

Apple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as [[Apple Mail|Mail]], Phone, Calendar, [[iMessage|Messages]], [[Apple Maps|Maps]], Music, [[Photos (Apple)|Photos]], Reminders, Remote (which can control [[iTunes]] and [[Apple TV]]), Stocks, and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]].<ref name="ars-review" /> Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other [[HealthKit]]-enabled software.<ref name="ars-review" /> With watchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the many stock apps.

With the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 support was dropped, requiring users to use an [[iPhone 5s]] or later with iOS 11 or later to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5. Further, watchOS 5 will not support the first Generation (prior to Series 1) Apple Watch.<ref>{{cite web |title=watchOS 5 Preview |url=https://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/ |website=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>

watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including [[Minnie Mouse]], along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. watchOS 3.0 was released to developers on June 13, 2016 and was made available to the public on September 13, 2016.

watchOS 3.1 was released to the public on October 24, and watchOS 3.2 was released near the end of March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app/|title=Apple Releases watchOS 3.1 to the public with bug fixes, update through iPhone Watch app|website=[[9to5Mac]]|access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.

watchOS 4.3 was released on March 29, 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.

WatchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch walkie-talkie mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/watchos-5-features/|title=watchOS 5 for Apple Watch now available with Podcasts and Walkie-Talkie apps, much more|date=September 17, 2018|work=[[9to5Mac]]|access-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref> It was released to the public on September 17, 2018.<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-4-rumors-launch-features-leaks-specs-price-release-date-reports-bigger-display/</ref>  On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.

WatchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows you to measure the sound around you in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell you what music you're listening to, Activity Trends, and a new UI framework for developers.

===Third-party apps===
WatchOS supports third-party applications; a [[WatchKit]] app runs in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.<ref name=ArsTechnica>{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Andrew|title=Apple releases WatchKit developer tools alongside first iOS 8.2 beta|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=May 15, 2015|date=November 18, 2014}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Since watchOS 2.0, watch apps don't run on the iPhone anymore|date=December 2017}} Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.<ref name="ars-review"/>

Following the announcement, initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied; the watch was praised by some for its "design, potential capabilities and eventual usefulness",<ref name="Time-92914">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3445265/apple-watch-predictions/ |title=Nobody Can Predict the Success of Apple's Watch Yet |last1=Bajarin |first1=Tim|author-link1=Tim Bajarin|date=September 29, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=April 2, 2015}}</ref> while others offered criticism of these same aspects.<ref name="Time-92914" /> Venture capitalist [[Marc Andreessen]] said he "can't wait" to try it,<ref name="CNET_10714">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/zuckerberg-is-worlds-best-ceo-twitter-the-eighth-wonder-says-marc-andreessen/ |title=Zuckerberg is world's best CEO, Twitter the eighth wonder, says Marc Andreessen |date=October 7, 2014 |work=[[CNET]] |accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> and [[Steve Jobs]]' biographer [[Walter Isaacson]] described it as "extremely cool" and an example of future technology that is "much more embedded into our lives".<ref name="Gizmodo-10614">{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/walter-isaacson-talks-gamergate-apple-watch-and-his-1642877801 |title=Walter Isaacson Talks AI, Apple Watch, and His New Book The Innovators |last1=Shaban |first1=Hamza |date=October 6, 2014 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> However, Evan Dashevsky of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the [[Moto 360]], except the customizable vibration notifications.<ref name="PCmag article 1">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468276,00.asp|title=There's Only One Reason to Buy an Apple Watch|website=[[PC Magazine]]|date=September 10, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, Apple Watch was listed by ''Time'' as one of the 25 Best Inventions of 2014.<ref name=TimeInventions>{{cite web|title=The 25 Best Inventions of 2014|url=http://time.com/3594971/the-25-best-inventions-of-2014/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=January 21, 2015|date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>

Initial reviews for the device have been generally positive with some caveats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.smh.com.au/digital-life/wearables/apple-watch-reviews-very-positive-with-some-caveats-20150409-1mh4ef.html|title=Apple watch reviews very positive, with some caveats|last1=Biggs|first1=Tim|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Reviewers praised the watch's potential ability to integrate into everyday life and the overall design of the product, but noted issues of speed and price. Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones. Farhad Manjoo of ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentioned the device's steep learning curve, stating it took him "three long, often confusing and frustrating days" to become accustomed to watchOS 1, but loved it thereafter.<ref name="NYT review">{{cite web|last1=Manjoo|first1=Farhad|title=Apple Watch Review: Bliss, but Only After a Steep Learning Curve|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 25, 2015|date=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Some reviewers also compared it to competing products, such as [[Android Wear]] devices, and claimed "The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense".<ref name="WSJ">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-review-the-smartwatch-finally-makes-sense-1428494495|title=Apple Watch Review: The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense|last1=Fowler|first1=Geoffrey|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 8, 2015|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though, with Geoffrey Fowler of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' saying "the battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely,"<ref name="WSJ" /> and others compared it to the [[Samsung Gear 2]], which "strolls through three days of moderate usage."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Luke|title=Samsung Gear 2: Apps, Battery, Value and Verdict |url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-gear-2-review-apps-battery-value-and-verdict-page-3|website=[[Trusted Reviews]]|accessdate=April 9, 2015|quote=It strolled through three days moderate usage, which is two full days longer than the Galaxy Gear, but's still short of what we would like to see on a wearable.}}</ref> Tim Bradshaw of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' used several applications over a period of days.

When using the Apple Watch, some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including [[tattoos]]. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) which utilizes the green LED lights to measure heart rates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exist.io/blog/fitness-trackers-heart-rate/|title=How do fitness trackers measure your heart rate?|last=Cooper|first=Belle|date=February 21, 2016|website=|access-date=}}</ref> To gauge a user's heart rate, the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/30/how-tattoogate-has-highlighted-a-wider-problem-with-wearables|title=How #tattoogate has highlighted a wider problem with wearables|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=April 30, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref> However, under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204666 |title=Your heart rate.

Some users have complained that the logo and text on the back of the Apple Watch Sport model, primarily the space gray version,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/19/apple-watch-sport-owners-report-unexpected-rear-logo-damage-other-text-scratching-off |title=Apple Watch Sport owners report unexpected rear logo damage, other text scratching off |author=Roger Fingas}}</ref> can be easily worn off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple Watch Sport Users Complain That Lettering And Logo Are Wearing Off|url=http://consumerist.com/2015/08/20/apple-watch-sport-users-complain-that-lettering-and-logo-are-wearing-off/|website=[[Consumerist]]|accessdate= August 20, 2015}}</ref>

===Sales===
Financial analysts offered early sales estimates from a few million to as many as 34.7 million in the first year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Apple Watch sales to reach 36 million in first year, analyst predicts |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-sales-to-reach-36-million-over-first-12-months-predicts-analyst/|website = CNET|accessdate = June 7, 2015}}</ref> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]{{'}}s [[Tim Bajarin]] summarized the breadth of reactions, writing that "there is not enough information yet to determine how this product will fare when it finally reaches the market next year".<ref name="Time-92914" />

Owing to the inadequacy of materials, the Apple Watch's delivery was delayed from its initial pre-order release date of April 10, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apple Watch delays may be due to faulty part|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-delays-may-be-due-to-faulty-taptic-engine/|author=Shara Tibkens|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> As a result, only 22 percent of the pre-ordered Apple Watches were dispatched in the United States during the weekend after the release date.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apple Watch may have shipped to only 22 percent of preorder buyers so far|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-may-have-shipped-to-only-22-percent-of-us-preorder-buyers/|author=Lance Whitney|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate = August 19, 2015}}</ref> It is estimated Apple received almost one million Apple Watch pre-orders in the United States during the initial six hours of the pre-order period on April 10, 2015, after which it sold out and further orders would start delivering in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/381791/apple-watch-pre-orders-were-1-million-in-the-us-on-its-first-day-a-shopping-data-firm-estimates/|title=Apple Watch pre-orders were 1 million in the US on its first day, a shopping data firm estimates|author=Dan Frommer|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}</ref> A report later on by an analyst stated that Apple Watch was already a $10 billion business during its first year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2016/6/29/apple-watch-is-already-a-10-billion-business|title=Apple Watch Is Already a $10 Billion Business|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrydsdaily.com/2016/07/apple-watch-is-colossal-10-billion.html|title=Apple Watch Is A Colossal $10 Billion Business After Just 1 Year In The Market|website=The Cryd's Daily|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/01/apple-watch-business/|title=Here's How Much the Apple Watch Business Is Worth|date=July 1, 2016|website=Fortune|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
In December 2019, a [[New York University]] cardiologist named Dr. Joseph Wiesel sued Apple over allegations that the Apple Watch violates a patented method for detecting [[atrial fibrillation]]. Wiesel claimed he had shared details of the patent with Apple in September 2017, but the company refused to negotiate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/29/new-york-doctor-sues-apple-over-irregular-heartbeat-detection/|title=New York doctor sues Apple over irregular heartbeat detection|website=Engadget|language=en|access-date=2019-12-29}}</ref>
