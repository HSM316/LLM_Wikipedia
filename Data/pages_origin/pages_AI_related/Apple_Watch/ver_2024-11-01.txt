In March 2013, Apple hired ex-Adobe chief technology officer [[Kevin Lynch (computing)|Kevin Lynch]], reporting to [[Bob Mansfield]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Satariano |first=Adam |date=March 20, 2013 |title=Apple Hires Adobe Technology Chief Kevin Lynch as Vice President |language=en |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-19/apple-hires-adobe-executive-kevin-lynch-as-vice-president |access-date=October 26, 2023}}</ref> to lead the watch project, which would become the company's first major new product without input from late co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].<ref name="wired.com" /> Apple started the project without specific use cases in mind, not knowing what problems the watch would solve, but felt that "technology was going to move onto the body", according to Alan Dye, who was in charge of its user interface. According to Kevin Lynch, the team felt people spent too much time on their phone, nagged by notifications, and a watch would provide "that level of engagement [...] in a way that's a little more human, a little more at the moment when you're with somebody".<ref name="wired.com" />

In July 2013, ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 14, 2013 |title=Apple on iWatch hiring blitz ahead of possible late 2014 launch, says Financial Times |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715104924/http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985 |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>

The software evolved more quickly than the hardware. To test it, the team created its first prototype, an iPhone strapped to the wrist with Velcro, which showed the Apple watch software in its true size and an onscreen watch crown for input. The crown was later turned into a physical dongle plugged into the headphone jack. Early on, the user interface and bundled apps were inspired by the iPhone, but they were too complex and underwent three rounds of redesigns, to avoid awkwardly long interactions that would annoy users. The team worked on notification vibrations and sounds for more than a year, attempting to make them reflect the nature of different notifications. They also added a way to show a contextual menu by pressing the display more deeply, called Force Touch. In contrast with Apple's usually narrow design options, the team thought a watch would need to appeal to users' diverse tastes in fashion, so they opted to give a choice of bands, models (like the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition) and watch faces.<ref name="wired.com" />

In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of the Apple Watch promoted the device as a [[fashion accessory]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Apple Watch is competing as a fashion accessory, and that's a risky move |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/03/05/apple-watch-is-competing-as-a-fashion-accessory-and-thats-a-risky-move |url-status=live |access-date=July 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716123229/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/03/05/apple-watch-is-competing-as-a-fashion-accessory-and-thats-a-risky-move |archive-date=July 16, 2015}}; {{Cite web |date=February 26, 2015 |title=First Apple Watch ads in U.S. magazines favor fashion lovers over techies |url=http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/apple-watch-vogue |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716015123/http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/apple-watch-vogue |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |website=[[Mashable]]}}</ref> Apple later focused on its health and fitness-oriented features, in an effort to compete with dedicated [[activity tracker]]s.

Originally at launch, the Apple Watch was marketed as one of three "collections", designating the case material. In order of increasing cost, the collections were:
* Apple Watch Sport (aluminium case)
* Apple Watch (stainless-steel case)
* Apple Watch Edition (originally released as an 18kt gold casing with newer materials in later models)
Starting with Series 1/Series 2, Apple dropped the "Sport" moniker from the branding (apart from the sport bands), and the Apple Watch was available with either an aluminum (lowest cost) or stainless steel case. "Apple Watch Edition" branding still exists, but now refers to watch casings made from ceramic or titanium.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 16, 2016 |title=Watch the Watch! |url=https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-2-unboxing |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308021754/https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-2-unboxing |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |access-date=March 26, 2021 |website=iMore}}</ref>

Apple did not explicitly market the first-generation Apple Watch as being [[waterproof]], stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion ([[IP code|IPX7]]). Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.<ref name="apple"/> The Series 7 also includes an IP6X certification for dust resistance.

=== Size ===
Since the introduction of the Apple Watch, it has been available in two sizes, primarily affecting screen resolution and area. The smaller size at launch was {{Convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}}, referring to the approximate height of the watch case; the larger size was {{Convert|42|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Starting with Series 4, the two nominal sizes changed to {{Convert|40|and|44|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Etienne |first=Stefan |date=September 12, 2018 |title=Apple Watch Series 4 is thinner than previous models but bulkier than the original |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17852388/apple-watch-series-4-dimensions-size-0-comparison-thick-iphone-event-2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192623/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17852388/apple-watch-series-4-dimensions-size-0-comparison-thick-iphone-event-2018 |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 28, 2019 |website=[[The Verge]]}}; {{Cite web |last1=Wuerthele |first1=Mike |last2=O'Hara |first2=Andrew |date=September 25, 2019 |title=Review: The Apple Watch Series 5 leaves the competition in the dust |url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/25/review-the-apple-watch-series-5-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192622/https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/25/review-the-apple-watch-series-5-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 29, 2019 |website=[[AppleInsider]]}}</ref> The nominal sizes changed again with the introduction of Series 7: {{Convert|41|and|45|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

The overall shape and width of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size class. Bands that fit the smaller size class ({{Convert|38|,|40|, and|41|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches) and larger size class ({{Convert|42|,|44|, and|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches) are generally interchangeable within the class.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Steele |first=Chandra |date=October 2, 2018 |title=The Best Apple Watch Bands |url=https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364073/the-best-apple-watch-bands |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192625/https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364073/the-best-apple-watch-bands |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 28, 2019 |website=[[PCMag]]}}</ref> The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to allow the user to change the straps without special tools.

Their displays have a higher maximum brightness than their predecessors. Both Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ship with watchOS 10; they support on-device Siri and a new "double tap" gesture using the index finger and thumb.<ref name="Chen, NYT 2021.09.14 -- Introduction of Apple Watch Series 7" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2: These are the top new features |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/2062755/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-s9-double-tap-gesture-u2-displays-siri.html |access-date=December 26, 2023 |website=Macworld |language=en}}</ref>

Aluminum case models are available in Midnight, Pink, Starlight, Silver, and Product Red color options, while the stainless steel models are available in gold, silver, and graphite finishes.

For [[Apple Watch#Intellectual property disputes|legal reasons]], blood oxygen monitoring is not available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States after January 18, 2024.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Jay |date=January 18, 2024 |title=Apple Watches without banned blood oxygen features are now on sale |url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042395/apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-ban-blood-oxygen-stores |access-date=February 28, 2024 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>

Following a ruling by the International Trade Commission on a lawsuit regarding the blood oxygen monitoring feature, Apple temporarily stopped selling Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 on December 21, 2023, ahead of an import ban going into effect December 26, 2023. At the time, 9to5Mac reported, "Apple says that the ITC’s ban only impacts sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 because those devices offer blood oxygen monitoring capabilities." A US Federal Appeals Court paused the import ban pending a US Customs and Border Protection ruling on whether Apple's changes would be enough to avoid the patent dispute, and Apple resumed sales on December 27, 2023.

As of May 2024, there have been no updates made to the Series 9 / Ultra 2 blood oxygen sensor issues.

==== Carbon neutrality claims ====
Apple markets the Series 9 and Ultra 2 as its first-ever [[Net zero emissions|carbon-neutral]] products (depending on the selected case material and band) due to a combination of cutting the carbon dioxide emissions per watch manufactured and sold (Apple claims a reduction of 78% for the Series 9 and 81% for the Ultra 2{{refn|name=EmissionsNumbers|Series 9 emissions decreased from 36.7kg to 8.1kg,<ref name="Series9EnvironmentalReport" /><ref name="CNBCcarbonNeutral" /> and Ultra 2 emissions from 63.2kg to 12kg<ref name="Ultra2EnvironmentalReport">{{Cite web |date=September 12, 2023 |title=Apple Watch Ultra 2 — Carbon Neutral Product Environmental Report |url=https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/watch/Carbon_Neutral_Apple_Watch_Ultra_2_Sept2023.pdf |access-date=October 26, 2023 |website=Apple}}</ref>}}) and the company's purchases of forestry and nature-based [[carbon offsets and credits]]—which some criticized for being misleading due to reliability issues in [[carbon accounting]] for forestry carbon offsets.<ref name="CNBCcarbonNeutral">{{Cite news |last=Clifford |first=Catherine |date=October 6, 2023 |title=How Apple made its first 'carbon neutral' product |publisher=CNBC |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/how-apple-made-its-first-carbon-neutral-product-apple-watch.html |access-date=October 6, 2023}}</ref>

Most of Apple's claimed emissions reductions were driven by renewable energy requirements imposed on suppliers;<ref name="Series9EnvironmentalReport" /><ref name="Ultra2EnvironmentalReport" /> other factors include increased use of recycled materials, and a lower reliance on shipping products by plane, [[Environmental effects of aviation|which is highly carbon-intensive]].<ref name="CNBCcarbonNeutral" /> Apple says the watches' manufacturing relies on "100% clean electricity", though this partly relies on Apple investing in clean-energy projects to offset suppliers' use of electricity produced from fossil fuels.

On September 20, 2023, the [[European Union]] announced that it would ban most uses of the term "carbon neutral" in advertising by 2026, including claims that are based on carbon offsets, to address [[greenwashing]] and misleading advertising. This decision was praised by Monique Goyens, director-general of EU consumer group [[The European Consumer Organisation|BEUC]], who also called Apple's claims "bogus" and scientifically inaccurate. Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at non-profit Carbon Market Watch, said it was "misleading to consumers" for Apple to give "the impression that buying the Watch has no impact on the climate at all", based on what he described as "accounting tricks". Other environmental groups criticized Apple's emphasis on carbon emissions without accounting for [[e-waste]], due to the difficulty of repairing these products.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Hancock |first=Alice |date=September 20, 2023 |title=EU to ban 'climate neutral' claims by 2026 |url=https://www.ft.com/content/53f84f03-1f1c-4240-977f-9de0e4893377 |url-access=subscription |access-date=October 26, 2023 |work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kurmayer |first=Nikolaus J. |date=September 20, 2023 |title=EU reaches deal banning 'climate-neutral' product claims |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-reaches-deal-banning-climate-neutral-product-claims/ |website=Euractiv}}</ref> Berkeley Carbon Trading Project director Barbara Haya praised the products' ~80% emissions reduction, but also criticized Apple's use of the term "carbon neutral" in advertising.<ref name="CNBCcarbonNeutral" />

=== Tenth generation (Series 10) ===
The Apple Watch Series 10 was announced at an [[List of Apple Inc. media events|Apple event]] on September 9, 2024. The device features its thinnest design ever, measuring 10% thinner than the Series 9. It has the largest display Apple has ever built for a wearable device, larger than even the [[Apple Watch Ultra]], with up to 30% more screen area. The display allows for an additional line of text, enhancing the visibility of messages, mail, and news.

Succeeding from the [[Apple silicon#Apple S9|Apple S9]], the [[Apple silicon#Apple S10|Apple S10]] is the second time utilizing the energy-efficient Sawtooth cores from the [[Apple A16|A16 Bionic]].

The Series 10 introduces a wider [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] with rounded corners for both the display and case. The display is also 40% brighter when viewed at an angle, improving visibility, and updates once per second in Always On mode, compared to the previous rate of once per minute.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Song |first=Victoria |date=September 9, 2024 |title=Apple Watch Series 10 hands-on: bigger, brighter, and thinner |url=https://www.theverge.com/24236958/apple-watch-series-10-hands-on-bigger-brighter-and-thinner |access-date=September 9, 2024 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>

Apple also introduced a new glossy aluminum finish in jet black, polished using silicon nanoparticles for a specialized surface shine. Other finish options include rose gold and silver aluminum, which are up to 10% lighter than previous models. Additionally, a new titanium finish, which is 20% lighter and carbon-neutral, replaces the stainless steel option from earlier generations.

The Apple Watch Series 10 retains 50 meters of water resistance and is the fastest-charging Apple Watch to date, reaching 80% battery in 30 minutes. The device features an 18-hour battery life.

The Apple Watch Series 10 also includes a sleep apnea detector, pending FDA approval, which is also planned to be supported by the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

To enhance phone call quality, the Series 10 incorporates a neural network that suppresses background noise for clearer conversations. The fitness features have been expanded to include tracking for kayakers, canoers, and rowers, along with a Tides App and new depth and water temperature sensors.

Prices for the Apple Watch Series 10 start at $399, with preorders available immediately. The device was released on September 20, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Haselton |first=Hayden Field,Ashley Capoot,Kif Leswing,Todd |date=September 9, 2024 |title=Here's everything Apple just announced: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4 and more |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/apple-event-2024-live-updates-iphone-16-apple-watch-10.html |access-date=September 9, 2024 |website=CNBC |language=en}}</ref>

== Software ==
[[watchOS]] is a distinct [[operating system]] designed specifically for Apple Watch. While based on iOS, which is used in iPhones, it offers a tailored experience for the smaller screen and wrist-worn form factor.

Features:

* Timekeeping: Telling time is a core function with various watch faces to choose from.
* Notifications: View and respond to notifications from an iPhone directly on a watch.
* Health and Fitness: Extensive health and fitness tracking features like heart rate monitoring, workout programs, and activity rings to stay motivated.
* Apps: Download and use various apps specifically designed for Apple Watch, covering fitness, communication, news, and more.
* Integration with iPhone: Works seamlessly with an iPhone for functions like making calls, sending texts, unlocking an iPhone, and using Apple Pay.
* Updates: Apple frequently releases updates to watchOS, bringing new features, bug fixes, and security improvements. One can update a watch through the Watch app on an iPhone or directly on the Apple Watch itself (if it has watchOS 6 or later).

Apple Watch runs watchOS, whose interface is around a home screen with circular app icons, which can be changed to a list view in the devices settings. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.<ref name="ars-review" /> During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an [[iPhone 5]] or later running [[iOS 8.2]] or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.<ref name="ars-review">{{Cite web |date=May 3, 2015 |title=Review: The absolutely optional Apple Watch and Watch OS 1.0 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705153302/https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0 |archive-date=July 5, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |website=Ars Technica}}</ref>

At [[WWDC]] 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by ''[[CNET]]'' as a "significant revamp", it included a new [[software development kit]] that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Get ready for Apple Watch 2.0 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/get-ready-for-apple-watch-2-0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610015933/http://www.cnet.com/news/get-ready-for-apple-watch-2-0 |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |access-date=June 10, 2015 |website=[[CNET]]}}</ref> WatchOS 2.0 was released in September 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=September 21, 2015 |title=After delay, Apple releases watchOS 2.0 to the public |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/after-delay-apple-releases-watchos-2-0-to-the-public |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922001233/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/after-delay-apple-releases-watchos-2-0-to-the-public |archive-date=September 22, 2015 |access-date=September 21, 2015 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 24, 2015 |title=Why I'm cheating on my Apple Watch |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/393831/why-im-cheating-on-my-apple-watch |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313132823/http://www.cultofmac.com/393831/why-im-cheating-on-my-apple-watch |archive-date=March 13, 2016 |access-date=March 13, 2016 |website=Cult of Mac}}</ref>

watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including [[Minnie Mouse]], along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. It was made available to the public in September 2016.

watchOS 3.1 was released to the public in October 2016, and watchOS 3.2 was released in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 24, 2016 |title=Apple Releases watchOS 3.1 to the public with bug fixes, update through iPhone Watch app |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412214615/https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app |archive-date=April 12, 2017 |access-date=May 27, 2017 |website=[[9to5Mac]]}}</ref> Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.

watchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 and released to the public in September 2017. watchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces [[Apple GymKit]], a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.

watchOS 4.3 was released in March 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.

watchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch [[Walkie-Talkie (Apple)|walkie-talkie]] mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 17, 2018 |title=watchOS 5 for Apple Watch now available with Podcasts and Walkie-Talkie apps, much more |work=[[9to5Mac]] |url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/watchos-5-features |url-status=live |access-date=November 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118122743/https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/watchos-5-features |archive-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref> It was released to the public in September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $399, packs larger displays and EKG sensor – CNET<!-- Bot generated title --> |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-4-rumors-launch-features-leaks-specs-price-release-date-reports-bigger-display |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828140416/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-4-rumors-launch-features-leaks-specs-price-release-date-reports-bigger-display |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.

watchOS 6.0 was released to the public in September 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native watchOS app store. watchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows one to measure ambient sound in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to, activity trends, and a new UI framework for developers.

watchOS 7.0 was announced on June 22, 2020, at the WWDC, and released on September 16, 2020; new functions include sleep tracking, additional watch faces, handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing.<ref name="appleWatchOS7"/>

=== Third-party apps ===
In watchOS 1, third-party [[WatchKit]] applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Apple releases WatchKit developer tools alongside first iOS 8.2 beta |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081020/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |access-date=May 15, 2015 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.<ref name="ars-review"/>

With the release of watchOS 2, Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS 2 SDK from June 1, 2016, onwards; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Apple requires all new watchOS apps be native by June 1 |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/22/apple-requires-all-new-watchos-apps-be-native-by-june-1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429004239/http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/22/apple-requires-all-new-watchos-apps-be-native-by-june-1 |archive-date=April 29, 2017 |access-date=May 15, 2017 |website=AppleInsider}}</ref> This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself, thus improving the responsiveness of third-party apps.

In watchOS 5 and earlier, all watchOS apps are dependent apps – the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Creating Independent watchOS Apps – Apple Developer Documentation |url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps#overview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917012336/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps#overview |archive-date=September 17, 2020 |access-date=September 20, 2020 |website=Apple Developer}}</ref> In watchOS 6 or later, developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps, and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone.

In October 2023, the [[United States International Trade Commission]] (ITC) ruled that Apple Watch products infringed upon [[patent]]s for light-based pulse oximetry that are owned by medical technology company Masimo. The company alleged that Apple had approached Masimo with offers to acquire or otherwise partner with the company, and went on to [[Employee poaching|poach]] engineers from Masimo to develop the infringing technology after it declined the offers. This ruling would allow the ITC to impose an import ban, provided it is not overruled by presidential veto power within a 60-day review period ending December 25.
