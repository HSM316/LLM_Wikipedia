Originally at launch, the Apple Watch was marketed as one of three "collections", designating the case material. In order of increasing cost, the collections were:
* Apple Watch Sport (Aluminium case)
* Apple Watch (Stainless steel case)
* Apple Watch Edition (Originally released as an 18kt gold casing with newer materials in later models)
Starting with Series 1/Series 2, Apple dropped the "Sport" moniker from the branding (apart from the sport bands), and the Apple Watch was available with either an aluminum (lowest cost) or stainless steel case. "Apple Watch Edition" branding still exists, but now refers to watch casings made from ceramic or titanium.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 16, 2016 |title=Watch the Watch! |url=https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-2-unboxing |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308021754/https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-2-unboxing |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |access-date=March 26, 2021 |website=iMore}}</ref>

Apple did not explicitly market the first-generation Apple Watch as being [[waterproof]], stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion ([[IP code|IPX7]]). Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.<ref name="apple"/> The Series 7 also includes an IP6X certification for dust resistance.

=== Size ===
Since the introduction of the Apple Watch, it has been available in two sizes, primarily affecting screen resolution and area. The smaller size at launch was {{Convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}}, referring to the approximate height of the watch case; the larger size was {{Convert|42|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Starting with Series 4, the two nominal sizes changed to {{Convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} (smaller) and {{Convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}} (larger).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Etienne |first=Stefan |date=September 12, 2018 |title=Apple Watch Series 4 is thinner than previous models but bulkier than the original |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17852388/apple-watch-series-4-dimensions-size-0-comparison-thick-iphone-event-2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192623/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17852388/apple-watch-series-4-dimensions-size-0-comparison-thick-iphone-event-2018 |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 28, 2019 |website=[[The Verge]]}}; {{Cite web |last1=Wuerthele |first1=Mike |last2=O'Hara |first2=Andrew |date=September 25, 2019 |title=Review: The Apple Watch Series 5 leaves the competition in the dust |url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/25/review-the-apple-watch-series-5-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192622/https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/25/review-the-apple-watch-series-5-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 29, 2019 |website=[[AppleInsider]]}}</ref> The nominal sizes changed again with the introduction of Series 7: {{Convert|41|mm|in|abbr=on}} (smaller) and {{Convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} (larger).

The overall shape and width of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size class. Bands that fit the smaller size class ({{Convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and {{Convert|41|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches) and larger size class ({{Convert|42|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and {{Convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches) are generally interchangeable within the class.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Steele |first=Chandra |date=October 2, 2018 |title=The Best Apple Watch Bands |url=https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364073/the-best-apple-watch-bands |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928192625/https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364073/the-best-apple-watch-bands |archive-date=September 28, 2019 |access-date=September 28, 2019 |website=[[PCMag]]}}</ref> The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to allow the user to change the straps without special tools.

[[File:Apple Watch back sensors.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Underside of three Apple Watches, showing the digital crown and updates to the back sensors; L–R: Series 3, 5, and 6]]
For input, the Watch features a "digital [[watch#Handedness|crown]]" on one side which can be turned to scroll or zoom content on screen, and pressed to return to the home screen. Next to the crown (on the same side of the watch) is the Side Button, which can be used to display recently used apps and access [[Apple Pay]], which is used for contactless payment.<ref name="theverge2"/> The Watch also prominently features a [[touchscreen]]; prior to Series 6/SE, the screen included [[Force Touch]] technology, which enabled the display to become pressure-sensitive and therefore capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press for displaying contextual menus.<ref name="ars-review"/> Force Touch has since been physically removed in Watch Series 6 and Watch SE,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ghani |first=Uzair |date=2020-09-15 |title=Apple Watch Series 6 and SE Do Not Feature 'Force Touch' Displays |url=https://wccftech.com/apple-watch-series-6-and-se-do-not-feature-force-touch-displays |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214131354/https://wccftech.com/apple-watch-series-6-and-se-do-not-feature-force-touch-displays |archive-date=February 14, 2022 |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=Wccftech |language=en-US}}</ref> and has been disabled via software on Watch Series 5 and earlier on models supporting watchOS 7.<ref>{{Cite web |title=watchOS 7 Removes Force Touch Support From Your Apple Watch, Here's Everything That's Changed |url=https://www.macrumors.com/guide/watchos-7-force-touch-gone |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216154357/https://www.macrumors.com/guide/watchos-7-force-touch-gone |archive-date=December 16, 2021 |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=MacRumors |language=en}}</ref>

=== Bands ===
Apple Watch comes with an included band (strap) to attach it to the user's wrist. The band can be easily changed to other types by holding down the connectors on the bottom of the watch and sliding the band pieces out. Third party bands are compatible with Apple Watch; Apple produces bands in a variety of materials and colours. Bands designed for the original Series 1-3 38&nbsp;mm and 42&nbsp;mm case sizes are compatible with the Series 4-6 40&nbsp;mm and 44&nbsp;mm cases, as well as the Series 7 41&nbsp;mm and 45&nbsp;mm cases, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Change your Apple Watch band |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204818 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220205095233/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204818 |archive-date=February 5, 2022 |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=Apple Support |language=en}}</ref>

Starting with Apple Watch Series 5, Apple introduced the online Apple Watch Studio which allows customers to mix and match bands on purchase, eliminating the need to purchase a specific combination of case and band design, and allows for a simplification of packaging (since Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple Watch Studio |url=https://www.apple.com/shop/studio/apple-watch |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313042637/https://www.apple.com/shop/studio/apple-watch |archive-date=March 13, 2022 |access-date=March 17, 2022 |website=apple.com}}</ref>

== Hardware ==
=== First generation ===
[[File:Apple S1 module.png|thumb|[[Apple S1]]|100px]]

The 1st generation Apple Watch (colloquially referred to as Series 0) uses the single-core [[Apple S1|S1]] [[system-on-chip]]. It does not have a built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It features a new [[linear actuator]] hardware from Apple called the "Taptic Engine", providing realistic [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.<ref name="ars-review"/> The watch is equipped with a built-in [[heart rate monitor|heart rate sensor]], which uses both [[infrared]] and visible-light [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] and [[photodiodes]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Your heart rate.

== Software ==
Apple Watch runs [[watchOS]], whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons, which can be changed to a list view in the devices settings. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.<ref name="ars-review"/> During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an [[iPhone 5]] or later running [[iOS 8.2]] or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.<ref name="ars-review">{{Cite web |date=May 3, 2015 |title=Review: The absolutely optional Apple Watch and Watch OS 1.0 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705153302/https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0 |archive-date=July 5, 2017 |access-date=July 15, 2015 |website=Ars Technica}}</ref>

With the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 and [[iPhone 5C]] support was dropped, requiring users to use an [[iPhone 5S]] or later with iOS 11 or later to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C.

At [[WWDC]] 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by ''[[CNET]]'' as a "significant revamp", it included a new [[software development kit]] that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Get ready for Apple Watch 2.0 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/get-ready-for-apple-watch-2-0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610015933/http://www.cnet.com/news/get-ready-for-apple-watch-2-0 |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |access-date=June 10, 2015 |website=[[CNET]]}}</ref> WatchOS 2.0 was released in September 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=September 21, 2015 |title=After delay, Apple releases watchOS 2.0 to the public |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/after-delay-apple-releases-watchos-2-0-to-the-public |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922001233/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/after-delay-apple-releases-watchos-2-0-to-the-public |archive-date=September 22, 2015 |access-date=September 21, 2015 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 24, 2015 |title=Why I'm cheating on my Apple Watch |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/393831/why-im-cheating-on-my-apple-watch |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313132823/http://www.cultofmac.com/393831/why-im-cheating-on-my-apple-watch |archive-date=March 13, 2016 |access-date=March 13, 2016 |website=Cult of Mac}}</ref>

watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including [[Minnie Mouse]], along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. It was made available to the public in September 2016.

watchOS 3.1 was released to the public in October 2016, and watchOS 3.2 was released in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 24, 2016 |title=Apple Releases watchOS 3.1 to the public with bug fixes, update through iPhone Watch app |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412214615/https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app |archive-date=April 12, 2017 |access-date=May 27, 2017 |website=[[9to5Mac]]}}</ref> Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.

WatchOS 4.3 was released in March 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.

watchOS 6.0 was released to the public in September 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native watchOS app store. watchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows you to measure the sound around you in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to, activity trends, and a new UI framework for developers.

watchOS 7.0 was announced on June 22, 2020, at the WWDC, and released on September 16, 2020; new functionalities include sleep tracking, additional watch faces, handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing.<ref name="appleWatchOS7"/>

watchOS 9.0 was released to public on September 13, 2022. It enhances the Workout display with new views of metrics like Activity rings, Heart Rate Zones, Power, and Elevation. It also support better sleep tracking and additional watch faces.

=== Third-party apps ===
In watchOS 1, third-party [[WatchKit]] applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Andrew |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Apple releases WatchKit developer tools alongside first iOS 8.2 beta |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081020/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |access-date=May 15, 2015 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.<ref name="ars-review"/>

With the release of watchOS 2, Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS 2 SDK from June 1, 2016, onwards; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Apple requires all new watchOS apps be native by June 1 |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/22/apple-requires-all-new-watchos-apps-be-native-by-june-1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429004239/http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/22/apple-requires-all-new-watchos-apps-be-native-by-june-1 |archive-date=April 29, 2017 |access-date=May 15, 2017 |website=AppleInsider}}</ref> This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself, thus improving the responsiveness of third-party apps.

In watchOS 5 and earlier, all watchOS apps are dependent apps – the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Creating Independent watchOS Apps – Apple Developer Documentation |url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps#overview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917012336/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps#overview |archive-date=September 17, 2020 |access-date=September 20, 2020 |website=Apple Developer}}</ref> In watchOS 6 or later, developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps, and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone. This was assisted by the introduction of a separate App Store on the Apple Watch itself.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Abent |first=Eric |date=June 3, 2019 |title=Apple Watch independent apps cut out the iPhone |url=https://www.slashgear.com/apple-watch-independent-apps-cut-out-the-iphone-03578919 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809024116/https://www.slashgear.com/apple-watch-independent-apps-cut-out-the-iphone-03578919 |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |access-date=September 20, 2020 |website=SlashGear}}</ref>
