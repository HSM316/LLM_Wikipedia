AuT technologies share many common traits, which justify the common notation. They are all based on recent breakthroughs in the domains of (deep) [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/234669-turing-learning-breakthrough-computers-can-now-learn-from-pure-observation|title=Turing Learning breakthrough: Computers can now learn from pure observation – ExtremeTech|newspaper=Extremetech |date=August 30, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence/|title=The Three Breakthroughs That Have Finally Unleashed AI on the World|first=Kevin|last=Kelly|magazine=Wired |publisher=}}</ref> They all require extensive and prompt regulatory developments to specify the requirements from them and to license and manage their deployment<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/auto|title=Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles for Public Operation|first=California Department of Motor|last=Vehicles|website=www.dmv.ca.gov}}</ref> (see the further reading below). And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., [[automobile safety]]) and security,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/01/worried-about-cybersecurity-and-the-connected-car-theres-a-bill-for-that/|title=Worried about cybersecurity and the connected car?

As an example, the [[autonomous car]] both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues. It is expected to be much safer than existing vehicles, by eliminating the single most dangerous element{{snd}}the driver. The US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 94 percent of US accidents were the result of [[human error]] and poor decision-making, including speeding and impaired driving,<ref name="moral dilemma"/> and the Center for Internet and Society at [[Stanford Law School]] claims that "Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2013/12/human-error-cause-vehicle-crashes |title=Human error as a cause of vehicle crashes |author=Bryant Walker Smith |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> So while safety standards like the [[ISO 26262]] specify the required safety, there is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety.

While car accidents claim every year 35,000 lives in the US,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812348 |title=Quick Facts 2015 |work=[[US DOT]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> and 1.25&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/en/|title=Road traffic deaths|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> some{{Who|date=August 2017}} believe that even "a car that's 10 times as safe, which means 3,500 people die on the roads each year [in the US alone]" would not be accepted by the public.<ref name="moral dilemma">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/02/20/the-big-moral-dilemma-facing-self-driving-cars/ |title=The big moral dilemma facing self-driving cars |author=Steven Overly |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |quote="[..] Would we accept that?" asks John Hanson, a spokesman for the Toyota Research Institute, which is developing the automaker's self-driving technology. |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> The acceptable level may be closer to the current figures on [[aviation accidents and incidents]], with under a thousand worldwide deaths in most years<ref>"Death Rate per Year". Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (ACRO). Retrieved April 18, 2017</ref>{{snd}}three orders of magnitude lower than cars. This underscores the unprecedented nature of the safety requirements that will need to be met for cars, with similar levels of safety expected for other Autonomous Things.
