'''My Friend Cayla''' was a line of {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} dolls which uses [[speech recognition]] technology in conjunction with an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[iOS]] mobile app to recognize the child's speech and have a conversation. The doll uses the internet to search what the child said which then answers with what it collected online. My Friend Cayla was created by Bob Delprincipe, inventor of [[Cindy Smart]] and [[Tekno the Robotic Puppy]]. The doll is banned in [[Germany]] as an [[surveillance device|illegal surveillance device]].<ref name="Germany">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39002142|title=German parents told to destroy Cayla dolls over hacking fears|date=17 February 2017|accessdate=18 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

== Technology ==
Cayla functions by sending microphone inputs to an app on an [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)]] device via [[Bluetooth]]. The app then parses the speech into text and uses keywords to search the Internet for a response. The app translates the text back into speech and sends it back to the doll, who answers after around a one-second delay.

Cayla, operated by [[AA batteries|3 AA batteries]], also has a "personality", with a database containing details of her family, pets, her favorite food, pop star, and film.

The creator of the doll, Bob Delprincipe, says: "She's not a search engine, she's a seven-year-old girl. There are some things she just doesn't know." And he argued that though there had been 'intelligent' toys before, there had never been an Internet-connected doll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10881303/Meet-Cayla-the-first-Internet-connected-doll.html|title=Meet Cayla - the first Internet connected doll|publisher=}}</ref>

== Styles ==
Cayla is available in 3 styles: Blonde, Brunette and African American. The UK saw a limited release of a Princess Edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfriendcayla.co.uk/|title=My Friend Cayla - The doll you can talk to like a real friend!|publisher=}}</ref>

== Distribution ==
My Friend Cayla is distributed by Vivid in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vividtoysandgames.co.uk/|title=Vivid Imaginations|publisher=}}</ref> Genesis is the US distributor.

== Awards ==
The doll was named 2014 Innovative Toy of the Year by the London Toy Industry Association, and was a top 10 toy for all key European retailers this past holiday season. The doll was later sold in the United States market in August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-interactive-doll-makes-north-american-debut-at-toy-fair-2015-300035732.html|title=World's First Interactive Doll Makes North American Debut At Toy Fair 2015|first=|last=Genesis|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2015 My Friend Cayla won Most Wanted Dolls of 2015 from TTPM (Toys, Tots, Pets & More)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ttpm.com/p/14825/genesis-toys-/my-friend-cayla/|title=My Friend Cayla from Genesis Toys|first=|last=TTPM.com|publisher=}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Ken Munro of security firm Pen Test Partners claimed he hacked the doll, and demonstrated the hack in [[BBC World News]] Tech Tent program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techworm.net/2015/01/vivid-toys-cayla-talking-doll-vulnerable-hacking-says-security-researcher.html|title=Vivid Toy's 'Cayla' Talking Doll vulnerable to hacking says security researcher|date=30 January 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31059893|title=What did she say?! Talking doll Cayla is hacked|work=BBC News|date=2015-01-30|access-date=2017-02-14}}</ref> Tim Medin from Counter Hack also hacked the doll by simply using bluetooth to use it as a remote speaker and microphone, which could be used to communicate with children.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doll Hacking: The Good, The Bad(words) and the Ugly (features) |url=https://www.redsiege.com/blog/2015/11/doll-hacking-good-badwords-and-ugly/ |accessdate=18 November 2015}}</ref> "Cayla was basically the subject of a tech prank," said Peter Magalhaes, general manager of Cayla manufacturer Genesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/hello-headaches-barbie-of-the-internet-age-has-even-more-security-flaws/|title=Hello Barbie: She's just insecure|publisher=}}</ref>

In February 2017 the German [[Federal Network Agency]] notified parents that they were obliged to "destroy" any Cayla in their possession as it constitutes a concealed espionage device violating the German Telecommunications Act.<ref name="Germany"/><ref>[https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Versteckte-Spionage-Spielzeug-Puppe-Cayla-laut-Netzagentur-verboten-3629872.html Versteckte Spionage: Spielzeug-Puppe "Cayla" laut Netzagentur verboten], [[heise.de]], issued 17 February 2017</ref> The agency also considers the Bluetooth device as insecure, allowing connections to Cayla's speaker and microphone within a 10m radius.<ref name="Germany"/>

The doll has also been criticised by the [[Norwegian Consumer Council]] for allowing the use of the collected data from the child's speech for targeted advertisements and other commercial purposes and its sharing with third parties, as well as for hidden advertisements through the doll's positive statements about certain products and services.<ref>[https://www.forbrukerradet.no/siste-nytt/cayla-forbudt-i-tyskland-pa-salg-i-norge/ Tangen, Guro Birkeland. 2017. Cayla forbudt i Tyskland, på salg i Norge. Accesse 11 November 2017]</ref>

In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] is investigating similar complaints over whether My Friend Cayla's upload of child speech constitutes an undue violation of privacy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0218/Privacy-concerns-threaten-sales-of-hi-tech-doll |title=Privacy concerns threaten sales of hi-tech doll  |last=Reilly |first=Patrick |date=February 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref>

The resulting controversy led to the doll's inclusion in the [[Museum of Failure]] in [[Sweden]], where similar failed products and services which were either commercial failures or are controversial in their own right are on display.<ref name="lidz">{{cite web |last1=Lidz |first1=Franz |title=The Museum of Failure Showcases the Beauty of the Epic Fail |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/strange-beauty-epic-fail-180967228/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The [[Spy Museum Berlin]] also has a Cayla doll on display, the first toy in its collection of various espionage and surveillance devices. The doll was donated by a German mother who found the doll in her daughter's room after hearing about a government order to destroy the dolls following a ban on its sale and possession.<ref name="thomas">{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Andrea |title=Germany Issues Kill Order for a Domestic Spy—Cayla the Toy Doll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-issues-kill-order-for-a-domestic-spycayla-the-toy-doll-1492098755 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="Spionagepuppe">{{cite web |title=Spionagepuppe „My Friend Cayla“ – oder auch: „Abhören von Freunden, das geht gar nicht.“ |url=https://www.deutsches-spionagemuseum.de/2017/02/28/spionagepuppe-friend-cayla-oder-auch-abhoeren-von-freunden-das-geht-gar-nicht |website=Deutsches Spionagemuseum |accessdate=28 March 2020 |language=de-DE |date=28 February 2017}}</ref>
