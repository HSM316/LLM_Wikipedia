Research in [[artificial intelligence (AI)]] is known to have impacted [[medical diagnosis]], [[Algorithmic trading|stock trading]], [[robot control]], and several other fields. Perhaps less popular is the contribution of AI in the field of [[music]]. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence and music (AIM) has, for a long time, been a common subject in several conferences and workshops, including the [[International Computer Music Conference]], the Computing Society Conference<ref>[http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html INFORMS Computing Society Conference: Annapolis: Music, Computation and AI] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120630221600/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html |date=2012-06-30 }}. Rcf.usc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.</ref> and the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]. In fact, the first International Computer Music Conference was the ICMC 1974, Michigan State University, East Lansing, US.<ref>[http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/ International Computer Music Association - ICMC].

Current research includes the application of AI in [[Musical composition|music composition]], [[performance]], theory and digital [[Audio signal processing|sound processing]].

Several [[music software]] programs have been developed that use AI to produce music.<ref>{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

}}</ref> Like its applications in other fields, the A.I. in this case also simulates mental tasks. A prominent feature is the capability of the A.I. algorithm to learn based on information obtained such as the computer accompaniment technology, which is capable of listening to and following a human performer so it can perform in synchrony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823141845/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 23, 2018|title=Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Music Understanding|last=Dannenberg|first=Roger|website=Semantic Scholar|access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref> Artificial intelligence also drives the so-called interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to the performance of a live musician. There are several other A.I. applications to music that covers not only music composition, production, and performance but also the way it is marketed and consumed. Apart from programs that use AI to produce music, several music player programs have been developed to use voice recognition and natural language processing technology for music voice control.

==History==
In 1960, Russian researcher R. Kh. Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the "[[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]]" computer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=R.Kh.|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}</ref>

In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html | title=About Ray Kurzweil}}</ref>

In 1997, an artificial intelligence program called [[Experiments in Musical Intelligence]] (EMI) appeared to outperform a human composer at the task of composing a piece of music imitating the style of [[Bach]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=George |title=Undiscovered Bach? No, a Computer Wrote It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/11/science/undiscovered-bach-no-a-computer-wrote-it.html |accessdate=29 April 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=11 November 1997| quote=Dr. Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece -- a simple, engaging form called a two-part invention -- was written by the computer. But he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners went on to decide that the invention composed by EMI (pronounced ''Emmy'') was genuine Bach.}}</ref>

==Software applications==

===Interactive scores===
Multimedia Scenarios in interactive scores are represented by
temporal objects,
temporal relations and
interactive objects. Examples of temporal objects are sounds, videos and light controls.
Temporal objects can be triggered by interactive objects (usually launched by the user) and
several temporal objects can be executed simultaneously.  A temporal object may contain
other temporal objects:  this hierarchy allows us to control the start or end of a temporal
object by controlling the start or end of its parent.  Hierarchy is ever-present in all kinds
of music:  Music pieces are often hierarchized by movements, parts, motives, measures,
among other segmentations.<ref>Mauricio Toro, Myriam Desainte-Catherine, Camilo Rueda. Formal semantics for interactive music scores: a framework to design, specify properties and execute interactive scenarios.

===ChucK===
{{main|ChucK}}

Developed at Princeton University by Ge Wang and Perry Cook, ChucK is a text-based, cross-platform language that allows real-time synthesis, composition, performance and analysis of music.<ref>[http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/ ChucK => Strongly-timed, On-the-fly Audio Programming Language]. Chuck.cs.princeton.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.</ref> It is used by [[SLOrk]] (Stanford Laptop Orchestra)<ref>Driver, Dustin.

===MorpheuS===
MorpheuS<ref>{{cite journal| title = MorpheuS: Automatic music generation with recurrent pattern constraints and tension profiles
| author = D. Herremans, E. Chew
| year = 2016
| journal = IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing
| volume = PP(1)
| doi = 10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2737984| arxiv = 1812.04832
}}</ref> is a research project by [[Dorien Herremans]] and Elaine Chew at [[Queen Mary University of London]], funded by a Marie Skłodowská-Curie EU project. The system uses an optimization approach based on a [[variable neighborhood search]] algorithm to morph existing template pieces into novel pieces with a set level of tonal tension that changes dynamically throughout the piece. This optimization approach allows for the integration of a pattern detection technique in order to enforce long term structure and recurring themes in the generated music. Pieces composed by MorpheuS have been performed at concerts in both Stanford and London.

===[[AIVA]]===
Created in February 2016, in [[Luxembourg]], [[AIVA]] is program that produces soundtracks for any type of media. The algorithms behind AIVA are based on deep learning architectures<ref>[http://www.aiva.ai]. AIVA 2016</ref> AIVA has also been used to compose a Rock track called ''On the Edge'',<ref>[https://medium.com/@aivatech/the-making-of-ai-generated-rock-music-with-aiva-9ae0257e6d5c] AI-generated Rock Music: the Making Of</ref> as well as a pop tune ''Love Sick''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQSPjAYTlx8] Love Sick | Composed with Artificial Intelligence - Official Video with Lyrics | Taryn Southern</ref> in collaboration with singer [[Taryn Southern]],<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/ai-is-the-future-of-rhythm-nation/] Algo-Rhythms: the future of album collaboration</ref> for the creation of her 2018 album "I am AI".
