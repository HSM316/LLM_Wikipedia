{{Artificial intelligence}}
'''Music and artificial intelligence (AI)''' is the development of [[music software]] programs which use AI to generate music.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=D. Herremans |author2=C.H. |author3=Chuan, E.

A prominent feature is the capability of an AI algorithm to learn based on past data, such as in computer accompaniment technology, wherein the AI is capable of listening to a human performer and performing accompaniment.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dannenberg |first=Roger |title=Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Music Understanding |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823141845/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf |archive-date=August 23, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2018 |website=Semantic Scholar |s2cid=17787070}}</ref> Artificial intelligence also drives interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to a live performance. There are other AI applications in music that cover not only music composition, production, and performance but also how music is marketed and consumed. Several music player programs have also been developed to use voice recognition and natural language processing technology for music voice control. Current research includes the application of AI in [[Musical composition|music composition]], [[performance]], theory and digital [[Audio signal processing|sound processing]].

[[Erwin Panofsky|Erwin Panofksy]] proposed that in all art, there existed three levels of meaning: primary meaning, or the natural subject; secondary meaning, or the conventional subject; and tertiary meaning, the intrinsic content of the subject.<ref>[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''.

==History==
Artificial intelligence finds its beginnings in music with the transcription problem: accurately recording a performance into musical notation as it is played. [[Marie-Dominique-Joseph Engramelle|Père Engramelle]]'s schematic of a "piano roll", a mode of automatically recording note timing and duration in a way which could be easily transcribed to proper musical notation by hand, was first implemented by German engineers J.F. Unger and J. Hohlfield in 1752.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |title=Research in music and artificial intelligence |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/4468.4469 |access-date=2024-03-06 |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |date=1985 |language=en |doi=10.1145/4468.4469 |last1=Roads |first1=Curtis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=163–190 }}</ref>

In 1957, the ILLIAC I (Illinois Automatic Computer) produced the "Illiac Suite for String Quartet", a completely computer-generated piece of music. The computer was programmed to accomplish this by composer [[Lejaren Hiller]] and mathematician [[Leonard Isaacson]].<ref name=miranda/>{{rp|v–vii}}
In 1960, Russian researcher Rudolf Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the [[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]] computer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=Rudolf|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}</ref>

In 1965, inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] developed software capable of recognizing musical patterns and synthesizing new compositions from them. The computer first appeared on the quiz show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ray Kurzweil |url=https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/ray-kurzweil/ |access-date=2024-09-10 |website=National Science and Technology Medals Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref>

By 1983, [[Yamaha Corporation]]'s Kansei Music System had gained momentum, and a paper was published on its development in 1989. The software utilized music information processing and artificial intelligence techniques to essentially solve the transcription problem for simpler melodies, although higher-level melodies and musical complexities are regarded even today as difficult deep-learning tasks, and near-perfect transcription is still a subject of research.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Katayose |first1=Haruhiro |last2=Inokuchi |first2=Seiji |date=1989 |title=The Kansei Music System |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3679555 |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=72–77 |doi=10.2307/3679555 |jstor=3679555 |issn=0148-9267}}</ref>

In 1997, an artificial intelligence program named Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI) appeared to outperform a human composer at the task of composing a piece of music to imitate the style of [[Bach]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=George |title=Undiscovered Bach?

But he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners went on to decide that the invention composed by EMI (pronounced ''Emmy'') was genuine Bach.}}</ref> EMI would later become the basis for a more sophisticated algorithm called [[Emily Howell]], named for its creator.

In 2002, the music research team at the Sony Computer Science Laboratory Paris, led by French composer and scientist [[François Pachet]], designed the Continuator, an algorithm uniquely capable of resuming a composition after a live musician stopped.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pachet |first=François |date=September 2003 |title=The Continuator: Musical Interaction With Style |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/jnmr.32.3.333.16861 |journal=Journal of New Music Research |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=333–341 |doi=10.1076/jnmr.32.3.333.16861 |issn=0929-8215|hdl=2027/spo.bbp2372.2002.044 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

[[Emily Howell]] would continue to make advancements in musical artificial intelligence, publishing its first album ''From Darkness, Light'' in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lawson |first=Mark |date=2009-10-22 |title=This artificially intelligent music may speak to our minds, but not our souls |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/22/music-computer-compose-copy |access-date=2024-09-10 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Since then, many more pieces by artificial intelligence and various groups have been published.

In 2010, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] became the first AI to produce a fragment of original contemporary classical music, in its own style: "Iamus' Opus 1". Located at the Universidad de Malága (Malága University) in Spain, the computer can generate a fully original piece in a variety of musical styles.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2013-01-02 |title=Iamus: Is this the 21st century's answer to Mozart? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-20889644 |access-date=2024-09-10 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="miranda" />{{rp|468–481}} August 2019, a large dataset consisting of 12,197 MIDI songs, each with their lyrics and melodies (https://github.com/yy1lab/Lyrics-Conditioned-Neural-Melody-Generation), was created to investigate the feasibility of neural melody generation from lyrics using a deep conditional LSTM-GAN method.

With progress in [[generative AI]], models capable of creating complete musical compositions (including lyrics) from a simple text description have begun to emerge. Two notable web applications in this field are [[Suno AI]], launched in December 2023, and [[Udio]], which followed in April 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nair |first=Vandana |date=2024-04-11 |title=AI-Music Platform Race Accelerates with Udio |url=https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-music-platform-race-accelerates-with-udio/ |access-date=2024-04-19 |website=Analytics India Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Musical applications ==
Artificial Intelligence has the opportunity to impact how producers create music by giving reiterations of a track that follow a prompt given by the creator. These prompts allow the AI to follow a certain style that the artist is trying to go for.<ref name=miranda/>

AI has also been seen in musical analysis where it has been used for feature extraction, pattern recognition, and musical recommendations.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Yifei |date=December 2023 |title=Utilizing Computational Music Analysis and AI for Enhanced Music Composition: Exploring Pre- and Post-Analysis |journal=Journal of Advanced Zoology |volume=44 |issue=S-6 |pages=1377–1390 |doi=10.17762/jaz.v44is6.2470 |s2cid=265936281 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Composition ===
Artificial intelligence has had major impacts in the composition sector as it has influenced the ideas of composers/producers and has the potential to make the industry more accessible to newcomers. With its development in music, it has already been seen to be used in collaboration with producers. Artists use these software to help generate ideas and bring out musical styles by prompting the AI to follow specific requirements that fit their needs. Future compositional impacts by the technology include style emulation and fusion, and revision and refinement. Development of these types of software can give ease of access to newcomers to the music industry.<ref name=miranda/> Software such as [[ChatGPT]] have been used by producers  to do these tasks, while other software such as [[IZotope|Ozone11]] have been used to automate time consuming and complex activities such as [[Mastering (audio)|mastering]]. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Sunkel |first=Cameron |date=2023-12-16 |title=New Research Reveals Top AI Tools Utilized by Music Producers |url=https://edm.com/gear-tech/top-ai-tools-music-producers |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists |language=en}}</ref>

{{Further|Artificial intelligence and copyright}}

In the United States, the current legal framework tends to apply traditional copyright laws to AI, despite its differences with the human creative process.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Art created by AI cannot be copyrighted, says US officials – what does this mean for music? |url=https://musictech.com/news/industry/art-created-by-ai-cannot-be-copyrighted-says-us-officials-what-does-this-mean-for-music/ |access-date=2022-10-27 |website=MusicTech |language=en-GB}}</ref> However, music outputs solely generated by AI are not granted copyright protection. In the [[Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices|compendium of the U.S. Copyright Office Practices]], the Copyright Office has stated that it would not grant copyrights to “works that lack human authorship” and “the Office will not register works produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author.”<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-28 |title=Can (and should) AI-generated works be protected by copyright? |url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2022/02/can-and-should-ai-generated-works-be-protected-by-copyright.html |access-date=2022-10-27 |website=Hypebot |language=en-US}}</ref> In February 2022, the Copyright Review Board rejected an application to copyright AI-generated artwork on the basis that it "lacked the required human authorship necessary to sustain a claim in copyright."<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/a-recent-entrance-to-paradise.pdf|title=Re: Second Request for Reconsideration for Refusal to Register A Recent Entrance to Paradise (Correspondence ID 1-3ZPC6C3; SR # 1-7100387071)|publisher=Copyright Review Board, [[United States Copyright Office]]|date=2022-02-14}}</ref>

The recent advancements in artificial intelligence made by groups such as [[Stability AI]], [[OpenAI]], and [[Google]] has incurred an enormous sum of copyright claims leveled against generative technology, including AI music.

==Musical deepfakes==
A more nascent development of AI in music is the application of [[audio deepfake]]s to cast the lyrics or musical style of a pre-existing song to the voice or style of another artist. This has raised many concerns regarding the legality of technology, as well as the ethics of employing it, particularly in the context of artistic identity.<ref>[https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3528/paper3.pdf DeepDrake ft. BTS-GAN and TayloRVC: An Exploratory Analysis of Musical Deepfakes and Hosting Platforms]</ref> Furthermore, it has also raised the question of to whom the authorship of these works is attributed.

In 2023, an artist known as ghostwriter977 created a musical deepfake called "[[Heart on My Sleeve (Ghostwriter977 song)|Heart on My Sleeve]]" that cloned the voices of [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]] by inputting an assortment of vocal-only tracks from the respective artists into a deep-learning algorithm, creating an artificial model of the voices of each artist, to which this model could be mapped onto original [[Scratch vocal|reference vocals]] with original lyrics.<ref name=":02">{{Cite magazine |last=Robinson |first=Kristin |date=2023-10-11 |title=Ghostwriter, the Mastermind Behind the Viral Drake AI Song, Speaks For the First Time |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/ghostwriter-heart-on-my-sleeve-drake-ai-grammy-exclusive-interview-1235434099/ |access-date=2024-04-03 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> The track was submitted for [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] consideration for the best rap song and song of the year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Drake/The Weeknd deepfake song "Heart on My Sleeve" submitted to Grammys |url=https://www.thefader.com/2023/09/06/drake-the-weeknd-song-heart-on-my-sleeve-submitted-to-grammys |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=The FADER |language=en}}</ref> It went viral and gained traction on [[TikTok]] and received a positive response from the audience, leading to its official release on [[Apple Music]], [[Spotify]], and [[YouTube]] in April of 2023.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=The AI deepfake of Drake and The Weeknd will not be eligible for a GRAMMY |url=https://mixmag.net/read/ai-deepfake-drake-and-the-weeknd-track-is-not-eligible-for-grammy-award-news |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=Mixmag}}</ref> Many believed the track was fully composed by an AI software, but the producer claimed the songwriting, production, and original vocals (pre-conversion) were still done by him.<ref name=":02" /> It would later be rescinded from any Grammy considerations due to it not following the guidelines necessary to be considered for a Grammy award.<ref name=":12" /> The track would end up being removed from all music platforms by [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name=":12" /> The song was a watershed moment for AI voice cloning, and models have since been created for hundreds, if not thousands, of popular singers and rappers.

=== "Where That Came From" ===
In 2013, country music singer [[Randy Travis]] suffered a [[stroke]] which left him unable to sing. In the meantime, vocalist James Dupré toured on his behalf, singing his songs for him. Travis and longtime producer [[Kyle Lehning]] released a new song in May 2024 titled "[[Where That Came From]]", Travis's first new song since his stroke. The recording uses AI technology to re-create Travis's singing voice, having been composited from over 40 existing vocal recordings alongside those of Dupré.<ref name="Tennesseean">{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/05/06/randy-travis-now-where-that-came-now-ai-origin/73585407007/|title=Randy Travis' shocks music industry with AI pairing for 'Where That Came From.'
