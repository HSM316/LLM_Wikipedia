An '''artificial intelligence arms race''' is a competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "[[artificial intelligence]]" (AI). Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have argued that such a global [[arms race]] for better artificial intelligence has already begun.

A South Korean manufacturer states, "Our weapons don't sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can't.

Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate.  Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained.  AI failures have already led to tragedy.  Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars.  In the wrong situation, AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an instant.  When an enemy is trying to manipulate and hack an AI system, the risks are even greater."  (p.&nbsp;140.)
