'''Catapult''' is a sports performance analytics company, listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]]. The company is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia.

== History ==
Catapult was founded by engineers Shaun Holthouse and Igor van de Griendt,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/05/08/aussie-tech-catapult-gps/ |title=The Australian Tech That's Improving The World's Best Athletes |work=Forbes |accessdate=2014-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609073621/http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/05/08/aussie-tech-catapult-gps/ |archive-date=2014-06-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> and is today led by CEO Will Lopes. In 1999 the pair were working with the [[Cooperative Research Centres]] during a project with the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] seeking to replace laboratory-based performance testing with microtechnology, as athletes were not exerting themselves in lab conditions in the same way as they do in competition.
Catapult was launched as a business in 2006 and became a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2014.

== Products ==
There are three physical products: Catapult Vector S7, T6, and the newly announced T7. Each of these pieces of hardware is worn by athletes to help track different elements of their performances. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportstech.today/catapult-sports-makes-wearable-technology-sports-analytics/|title=Catapult Sports Makes Wearable Technology for Sports Analytics|publisher=SportsTech.Today|accessdate=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812181810/http://sportstech.today/catapult-sports-makes-wearable-technology-sports-analytics/|archive-date=2018-08-12|url-status=live}}</ref>
