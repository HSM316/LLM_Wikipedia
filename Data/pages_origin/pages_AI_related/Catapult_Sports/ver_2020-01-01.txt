== History ==
Catapult was founded by engineers Shaun Holthouse and Igor van de Griendt,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/05/08/aussie-tech-catapult-gps/ |title=The Australian Tech That's Improving The World's Best Athletes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2014-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609073621/http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/05/08/aussie-tech-catapult-gps/ |archive-date=2014-06-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> and is today led by CEO Joe Powell. In 1999 the pair were working with the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) during a project with the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) seeking to replace laboratory-based performance testing with microtechnology, as athletes were not exerting themselves in lab conditions in the same way as they do in competition.
Catapult was launched as a business in 2006 and became a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2014.

== Products ==
There are three physical products: the Clearsky T6, Optimeye S5, and Optimeye S6. Each of these pieces of hardware is worn by athletes to help track different elements of their performances. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportstech.today/catapult-sports-makes-wearable-technology-sports-analytics/|title=Catapult Sports Makes Wearable Technology for Sports Analytics|publisher=SportsTech.Today|accessdate=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812181810/http://sportstech.today/catapult-sports-makes-wearable-technology-sports-analytics/|archive-date=2018-08-12|url-status=live}}</ref>

Catapultâ€™s main product is the OptimEye S5, a GNSS-enabled monitor that accesses both GPS and GLONASS satellites to gather data.

Catapult also developed a pioneering goalkeeper monitor, the G5, which quantifies the direction and intensity of dives, jumps, accelerations/decelerations, changes of direction, repeat high intensity efforts, and time to recovery.
