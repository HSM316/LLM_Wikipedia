In November 2015, Shine 2 was launched. The second generation device is thinner than its predecessor, has a different type of lights on its face, and adds the ability to configure vibrating alarms and notifications, but otherwise maintains the same features and battery life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/20/misfit-shine-2/|title=Misfit's Shine 2 Is a Thinner, More Colorful Activity Tracker|publisher=Engadget |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar|date=October 20, 2015|access-date=November 29, 2015}}</ref>

===Flash===
The Flash is the second activity tracker product produced by Misfit. It is made of soft touch plastic that come in seven colors. The Flash is a lower-priced and more casual wearable compared to the Shine, but has similar capabilities such as tracking steps, sleep, cycling and calories burned. Initial versions were labelled as being "Waterproof" and listed swimming as a trackable activity, however later versions are "Water Resistant" and no longer support swim tracking. The activity information is also paired with a mobile app.<ref>{{cite web| title=Misfit Wearables Launches The Flash, A More Affordable Fitness And Sleep Tracker| date=September 16, 2014| author=Kim-Mai Cutler| publisher=TechCrunch| url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/16/misfit-wearables-2/| access-date=February 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Misfit releases lower-priced version of its flagship Shine health wearable| date=September 16, 2014| author=Mark Sullivan| publisher=Venture Beat| url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/16/misfit-releases-lower-priced-plastic-version-of-its-flagship-shine-health-wearable/| access-date=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

In July 2015, Misfit launched the Link, a squeezable clicker, with activity tracking features making it similar to the Flash without a wristband. It connects to the Misfit app, becoming a remote control for the applications functions such as pausing a song.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/16/misfit-debuts-the-flash-link-a-20-activity-tracker-that-also-controls-apps-and-smart-home-devices/| title=Misfit Debuts The Flash Link| last=Perez |first=Sarah |date=July 16, 2015 |publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/misfit-flash-link-smart-button-wearable/| title=Misfit Newest Product is Flash Link, the Universal Remote Control and Fitness Tracker|last=Chang |first=Lulu |date=July 16, 2015 |publisher=DigitalTrends| access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref> This remote control functionality, referred to by Misfit as a "Smart Button", was retroactively added to the Flash, and has been included in every subsequent fitness tracker sold by Misfit including the Ray, Shine 2 and Flare, as well as the Phase, Path and Command hybrid devices.

In 2017, Misfit launched the Flare,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2017-04-11|title=Misfit's $60 Flare is a fitness tracker for people who just want a fitness tracker|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/11/15257398/misfit-flare-fitness-tracker-announced|access-date=2020-09-09|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref> a fitness tracker with similar features to the Flash, which occupies the lowest price point in Misfit's product lineup<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-24|title=Misfit Flare: Essential guide to the minimalist, budget fitness tracker|url=https://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/misfit-flare-price-specs-release-date-4271|access-date=2020-09-09|website=Wareable|language=en}}</ref> after the Flash was discontinued. Its user interface is more sparse than the Flash, with a single LED which flashes different patterns depending on how close the wearer is reaching their daily goal.

=== Ray ===
The Ray is the most minimalist and versatile tracker.  It automatically tracks steps, distance, light and restful sleep.  It is a non‐charging tracker with replaceable batteries lasting up to 4 months.  It is water resistant.  There are 11 colors and 4 options for wearable style: sport band, leather band, bangle and necklace.  There is a customization option as well as packaged sets.

This line was discontinued in 2018.

===Vapor===
The Vapor is an [[Android Wear]]-based [[smartwatch]] which was launched in early 2017 and made available for ordering from select countries on 31 October 2017.

The watch was originally reported to come with Misfit's own software and integrated [[GPS]] and [[Near field communication|NFC]] chips for mobile payment but the design was later changed to be based on Android Wear 2.0 and that the GPS and NFC chips were no longer present. The watch is available in four colours and has interchangeable straps of different types and colours. It features a unique Virtual Touch Bezel that can be used to navigate between apps on the watch. While integrated GPS is no longer part of the watch, it still has a strong focus on fitness use with heart-rate sensor and support for connected GPS (where it uses the GPS of the connected phone) and it is swimproof and [[water resistant]] to 50 metres.

=== Phase, Command, and Path ===
Misfit introduced the Phase in late 2016. Marketed as a hybrid smartwatch, it features a mechanical analog watch face together with Misfit's typical suite of step, activity, sleep tracking and Smart Button capabilities. It also includes an alarm and notification system, with vibrating alerts and a small circular slot in the watch face which can turn a variety of different background colours depending on the type of notification. The hour and minute hands can also be prompted to serve as a progress indicator towards the user's daily activity goals, and they can move to predetermined locations when vibration alerts occur to provide additional detail about the notification.

Following up on the Phase, Misfit introduced the Command in 2017. Unlike the Phase, the Command has a separate mechanical dial (instead of the notification slot) which normally displays the user's current activity progress, and can also help identify vibration alerts.

The Path is Misfit's third hybrid mechanical watch and fitness tracker, released in 2018. Omitting both the Command's separate progress/notification dial and the Phase's color-coded notification slot, it only includes mechanical hour and minute hands, used to indicate the time-of-day, identify vibration notification alerts, and display the user's activity progress.

===Connected home===
Misfit has several smart home products such as the Beddit Sleep Monitor, a sleep-monitoring strip that fits over a mattress, as well as the Bolt Smart Bulb, a wirelessly-connected color-changing light bulb.<ref>{{cite web| title=Misfit introduces a smart bulb to go with its sleep tracker| date=January 6, 2015| author=Adi Robertson| publisher=The Verge| url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7488419/misfit-bolt-smart-bulb-mobile-app-sleep-tracker| access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> The Bolt Smart Bulbs also function as alarm clocks that can be connected to Misfit’s sleep-monitoring devices such as Shine, Flash or Beddit. The lightbulbs support color combinations that create light-scapes resembling sunsets, sunrises, bright days, or other scenes.<ref>{{cite web|  title=Misfit Debuts "Bolt," A $50 Smart Bulb That Works With Sleep Monitoring Devices| date=January 6, 2015| author= Sarah Perez| publisher=TechCrunch| url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/06/misfit-debuts-bolt-a-50-smart-bulb-that-works-with-sleep-monitoring-devices/| access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref>

Misfit Home includes a mobile app for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating systems as well as additional smart-home capabilities such as wireless controls for lights, locks and thermostats.<ref>{{cite web| title=Misfit turns $50 Flash fitness band into smart home remote, too| date= January 27, 2015| author=Scott Stein| publisher=CNet| url=http://www.cnet.com/news/misfit-turns-50-flash-fitness-band-into-smart-home-remote-too/| access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref>
