{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}
'''OpenAI Five''' is a [[computer program]] by [[OpenAI]] that plays the five-on-five [[video game]] ''[[Dota 2]]''. Its first public appearance occurred in 2017, where it was demonstrated in a live one-on-one game against the professional player [[Dendi (video game player)|Dendi]], who lost to it. The following year, the system had advanced to the point of performing as a full team of five, and began playing against and showing the capability to defeat professional teams.

By choosing a game as complex as ''[[Dota 2]]'' to study [[machine learning]], OpenAI thought they could more accurately capture the unpredictability and continuity seen in the real world, thus constructing more general problem-solving systems. The algorithms and code used by OpenAI Five were eventually borrowed by another [[neural network]] in development by the company, one which controlled a physical robotic hand. OpenAI Five has been compared to other similar cases of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) playing against and defeating humans, such as [[AlphaStar (software)|AlphaStar]] in the video game ''[[StarCraft II]]'', [[AlphaGo]] in the board game [[Go (game)|Go]], [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] in [[chess]], and [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] on the television game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.

==History==
Development on the algorithms used for the bots began in November 2016. OpenAI decided to use ''[[Dota 2]]'', a competitive five-on-five video game, as a base due to it being popular on the [[live stream]]ing platform [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], having native support for [[Linux]], and had an [[application programming interface]] (API) available.<ref>{{cite web |author=OpenAI|url=https://openai.com/five/#timeline |title=OpenAI Five |website=openai.com/five |access-date=10 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901172612/https://openai.com/five/#timeline |archive-date=1 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before becoming a team of five, the first public demonstration occurred at [[The International 2017]] in August, the annual premiere championship tournament for the game, where [[Dendi (video game player)|Dendi]], a professional Ukrainian player of the game, lost against an OpenAI bot in a live one-on-one matchup.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Savov |first1=Vlad |title=My favorite game has been invaded by killer AI bots and Elon Musk hype |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16141938/dota-2-openai-bots-elon-musk-artificial-intelligence |website=The Verge |date=14 August 2017 |access-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626030145/https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16141938/dota-2-openai-bots-elon-musk-artificial-intelligence |archive-date=26 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Blair Hanley|title=OpenAI's bot beats top Dota 2 player so badly that he quits|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/11/openais-bot-beats-top-dota-2-player-so-badly-that-he-quits/|website=Venture Beat|access-date=12 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812065202/https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/11/openais-bot-beats-top-dota-2-player-so-badly-that-he-quits/|archive-date=12 August 2017}}</ref> After the match, CTO [[Greg Brockman]] explained that the bot had learned by playing against itself for two weeks of [[Elapsed real time|real time]], and that the learning software was a step in the direction of creating software that can handle complex tasks "like being a surgeon".<ref>{{cite web|author=OpenAI|title=Dota 2|url=https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/|website=blog.openai.com|date=11 August 2017 |access-date=12 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811235617/https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/|archive-date=11 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=OpenAI|title=More on Dota 2|url=https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/|website=blog.openai.com|date=16 August 2017 |access-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816161246/https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/|archive-date=16 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> OpenAI used a methodology called [[reinforcement learning]], as the bots learn over time by playing against itself hundreds of times a day for months, in which they are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and destroying towers.<ref name="Simonite June 2018">{{cite magazine |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |date=25 June 2018 |title=Can Bots Outwit Humans in One of the Biggest Esports Games? |url=https://www.wired.com/story/can-bots-outwit-humans-in-one-of-the-biggest-esports-games/ |magazine=Wired |access-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625213810/https://www.wired.com/story/can-bots-outwit-humans-in-one-of-the-biggest-esports-games/ |archive-date=25 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=A Bot Backed by Elon Musk Has Made an AI Breakthrough in Video Game World |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/musk-backed-bot-conquers-e-gamer-teams-in-ai-breakthrough |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=25 June 2018 |access-date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627144300/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/musk-backed-bot-conquers-e-gamer-teams-in-ai-breakthrough |archive-date=27 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Clifford June 2018" />

==Architecture==
Each OpenAI Five bot is a neural network containing a single layer with a 4096-unit [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/#lstm-networks|title=Understanding LSTM Networks|work=colah's blog|access-date=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801085410/http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/#lstm-networks|archive-date=1 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> that observes  the current game state extracted from the Dota developer's API. The neural network conducts actions via numerous possible action heads (no human data involved), and every head has meaning. For instance, the number of ticks to delay an action, what action to select â€“ the X or Y coordinate of this action in a grid around the unit. In addition, action heads are computed independently. The AI system observes the world as a list of 20,000 numbers and takes an action by conducting a list of eight enumeration values. Also, it selects different actions and targets to understand how to encode every action and observe the world.<ref name="OpenAI June 2018" />

OpenAI Five has been developed as a general-purpose reinforcement learning training system on the "Rapid" infrastructure. Rapid consists of two layers: it spins up thousands of machines and helps them â€˜talkâ€™ to each other and a second layer runs software. By 2018, OpenAI Five had played around 180 years worth of games in reinforcement learning running on 256 [[GPU]]s and 128,000 [[CPU]] cores,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1348177/why-are-ai-researchers-so-obsessed-with-games|title=Why are AI researchers so obsessed with games?|work=QUARTZ|date=4 August 2018 |access-date=4 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804131643/https://qz.com/1348177/why-are-ai-researchers-so-obsessed-with-games/|archive-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> using [[Proximal Policy Optimization]], a [[policy gradient method]].<ref name="OpenAI June 2018" /><ref>{{Cite arXiv|title=Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms|eprint = 1707.06347|last1 = Schulman|first1 = John|last2 = Wolski|first2 = Filip|last3 = Dhariwal|first3 = Prafulla|last4 = Radford|first4 = Alec|last5 = Klimov|first5 = Oleg|class = cs.LG|year = 2017}}</ref>

==Comparisons with other game AI systems==
Prior to OpenAI Five, other AI versus human experiments and systems have been successfully used before, such as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' with [[Watson (computer)|Watson]], [[chess]] with [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], and [[Go (game)|Go]] with [[AlphaGo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy|title=IBM computer Watson wins Jeopardy clash|journal=The Guardian|access-date=17 February 2011|date=17 February 2011|last1=Gabbatt|first1=Adam|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060018/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>

'''Long run view''': The bots run at 30 [[frames per second]] for an average match time of 45 minutes, which results in 80,000 ticks per game. OpenAI Five observes every fourth frame, generating 20,000 moves. By comparison, chess usually ends before 40 moves, while Go ends before 150 moves.

'''Partially observed state of the game''': Players and their allies can only see the map directly around them. The rest of it is covered in a [[fog of war]] which hides enemies units and their movements. Thus, playing ''Dota 2'' requires making inferences based on this incomplete data, as well as predicting what their opponent could be doing at the same time. By comparison, Chess and Go are "full-information games", as they do not hide elements from the opposing player.<ref name="Knight June 2018" />

'''Continuous action space''': Each playable character in a ''Dota 2'' game, known as a hero, can take dozens of actions that target either another unit or a position. The OpenAI Five developers allow the space into 170,000 possible actions per hero. Without counting the perpetual aspects of the game, there are an average of ~1,000 valid actions each tick. By comparison, the average number of actions in chess is 35 and 250 in Go.

'''Continuous observation space''': ''Dota 2'' is played on a large map with ten heroes, five on each team, along with dozens of buildings and [[non-player character]] (NPC) units. The OpenAI system observes the state of a game through developersâ€™ bot API, as 20,000 numbers that constitute all information a human is allowed to get access to. A chess board is represented as about 70 lists, whereas a Go board has about 400 enumerations.

OpenAI Five have received acknowledgement from the AI, tech, and video game community at large. [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] called it a "big deal", as their victories "required teamwork and collaboration".<ref name="Clifford June 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/bill-gates-openai-robots-beating-humans-at-dota-2-is-ai-milestone.html|title=Bill Gates says gamer bots from Elon Musk-backed nonprofit are 'huge milestone' in A.I.|work=CNBC|access-date=28 June 2018|date=28 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628231125/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/bill-gates-openai-robots-beating-humans-at-dota-2-is-ai-milestone.html|archive-date=28 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-hails-huge-milestone-for-ai-as-bots-beat-humans-at-dota-2-2018-6|title=Bill Gates hails 'huge milestone' for AI as bots work in a team to destroy humans at video game 'Dota 2'|work=Business Insider|access-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627131504/http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-hails-huge-milestone-for-ai-as-bots-beat-humans-at-dota-2-2018-6|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Chess player [[Garry Kasparov]], who lost against the [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] AI in 1997, stated that despite their losing performance at The International 2018, the bots would eventually "get there, and sooner than expected".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1033108573151092736|title=Garry Kasparov's Twitter|access-date=24 August 2018|date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

In a conversation with ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', AI experts also considered OpenAI Five system as a significant achievement, as they noted that ''Dota 2'' was an "extremely complicated game", so even beating non-professional players was impressive.<ref name="Knight June 2018">{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|date=25 June 2018|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611536/a-team-of-ai-algorithms-just-crushed-expert-humans-in-a-complex-computer-game|title=A team of AI algorithms just crushed humans in a complex computer game|work= MIT Tech Review|access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref> ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that their wins against professional players was a significant event in machine learning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Morgan |title=How the OpenAI Five tore apart a team of Dota 2 pros |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-the-openai-five-tore-apart-a-team-of-dota-2-pros/ |access-date=25 May 2020 |work=PC Gamer |date=11 August 2018}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]]'' wrote that the victory was "basically cheating" due to the simplified hero pools on both sides, as well as the fact that bots were given direct access to the API, as opposed to using [[computer vision]] to interpret pixels on the screen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gault |first1=Matthew |title=OpenAI Is Beating Humans at 'Dota 2' Because It's Basically Cheating |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy3nvq/ai-beat-humans-at-dota-2 |access-date=25 May 2020 |work=Vice |date=17 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref> ''[[The Verge]]'' wrote that the bots were evidence that the company's approach to reinforcement learning and its general philosophy about AI was "yielding milestones".<ref name="Statt April 2019" />

In 2019, [[DeepMind]] unveiled a similar bot for ''[[Starcraft II]]'', [[AlphaStar (software)|AlphaStar]]. Like OpenAI Five, AlphaStar used reinforcement learning and self-play. ''The Verge'' reported that "the goal with this type of AI research is not just to crush humans in various games just to prove it can be done. Instead, itâ€™s to prove that â€” with enough time, effort, and resources â€” sophisticated AI software can best humans at virtually any competitive cognitive challenge, be it a board game or a modern video game." They added that the DeepMind and OpenAI victories were also a testament to the power of certain uses of reinforcement learning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Statt |first1=Nick |title=DeepMind's StarCraft 2 AI is now better than 99.8 percent of all human players |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939147/deepmind-google-alphastar-starcraft-2-research-grandmaster-level |access-date=25 May 2020 |work=The Verge |date=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

It was OpenAI's hope that the technology could have applications outside of the digital realm. In 2018, they were able to reuse the same reinforcement learning algorithms and training code from OpenAI Five for [[OpenAI#Dactyl|Dactyl]], a human-like robot hand with a neural network built to manipulate physical objects.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author1=OpenAI |last2=Andrychowicz |first2=Marcin |last3=Baker |first3=Bowen |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=JÃ³zefowicz |first5=RafaÅ‚ |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Pachocki |first7=Jakub |last8=Petron |first8=Arthur |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ray |first11=Alex |last12=Schneider |first12=Jonas |last13=Sidor |first13=Szymon |last14=Tobin |first14=Josh |last15=Welinder |first15=Peter |last16=Weng |first16=Lilian |last17=Zaremba |first17=Wojciech |date=2019 |title=Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation |eprint=1808.00177v5 |class=cs.LG}}</ref> In 2019, Dactyl solved the [[Rubik's Cube]].<ref>{{cite arXiv |author1=OpenAI |last2=Akkaya |first2=Ilge |last3=Andrychowicz |first3=Marcin |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Litwin |first5=Mateusz |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Petron |first7=Arthur |last8=Paino |first8=Alex |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ribas |first11=Raphael |date=2019 |title=Solving Rubik's Cube with a Robot Hand |eprint=1910.07113v1 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>
