'''MeVisLab''' is a cross-platform [[application framework]] for [[medical image processing]] and [[scientific visualization]]. It includes advanced algorithms for [[image registration]], [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], and quantitative morphological and functional image analysis. An [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] for graphical programming and rapid user interface prototyping is available.

MeVisLab is written in [[C++]] and uses the [[Qt (framework)|Qt framework]] for graphical user interfaces. It is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The software development is done in cooperation between [[:de:MeVis Medical Solutions|MeVis Medical Solutions AG]] and Fraunhofer MEVIS.

A freeware version of the MeVislab SDK is available (see [[#Licensing|Licensing]]). Open source modules are delivered as [[#MeVisLab public sources|MeVisLab Public Sources in the SDK]] and available from the [[#MeVisLab community and community sources|MeVisLab Community and Community Sources project]].

==History==

MeVisLab development began in 1993 with the software ILAB1 of the CeVis Institute, written in C++. It allowed to interactively connect algorithms of the Image Vision Library (IL) on [[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics (SGI)]] to form image processing networks. In 1995, the newly founded MeVis Research GmbH (which became [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer MEVIS]] in 2009) took over the ILAB development and released ILAB2 and ILAB3. [[Open Inventor|OpenInventor]] and [[Tcl]] scripting was integrated but both programs were still running on SGI only.<ref name="mevislabhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.mevislab.de/mevislab/history/ |title=MeVisLab History |publisher=Mevislab.de |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref>

In 2000, ILAB4 was released with the core rewritten in [[Objective-C]] for Windows. For being able to move away from the SGI platform, the Image Vision Library was substituted by the platform-independent, inhouse-developed MeVis Image Processing Library (ML). In 2002, the code was adapted to work on the application framework Qt.<ref name="mevislabhistory" />

In 2004, the software was released under the name MeVisLab. It contained an improved IDE and was available on Windows and Linux.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mevislab.de/index.php?id=17&backPID=17&begin_at=20&tt_news=5 |title=MeVisLab 1.0 Release News |publisher=Mevislab.de |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314221521/http://www.mevislab.de/index.php?id=17&backPID=17&begin_at=20&tt_news=5 |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> See the [[#Release history|Release history]] for details.

In 2007, MeVisLab has been acquired by [[:de:MeVis Medical Solutions|MeVis Medical Solutions AG]]. Since then, MeVisLab has been continued as a collaborative project between the MeVis Medical Solutions and Fraunhofer MEVIS.

==MeVisLab principles==

[[Image:Mevislab macosx wp B.jpg|thumb|300px|MeVisLab GUI]]
MeVisLab is a modular development framework. Based on modules, networks can be created and applications can be built.

To support the creation of image processing networks, MeVisLab offers an [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]] that allows data-flow modelling by [[Visual programming language|visual programming]]. Important IDE features are the [[Multiple document interface|multiple document interface (MDI)]], module and connection inspectors with docking ability, advanced search, scripting and debugging consoles, movie and screenshot generation and galleries, module testing and error handling support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mevislab.de/fileadmin/docs/current/MeVisLab/Resources/Documentation/Publish/SDK/MeVisLabManual/index.html |title=MeVisLab Reference Manual |publisher=Mevislab.de |date=September 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref>

In the visual network editor, modules can be added and combined to set up data flow and parameter synchronization. The resulting networks can be modified dynamically by scripts at runtime. Macro modules can be created to encapsulate subnetworks of modules, scripting functionality and high-level algorithms.

On top of the networks, the medical application level with viewers and UI panels can be added. Panels are written in the MeVisLab Definition Language (MDL), can be scripted with Python or JavaScript and styled using MeVisLab-internal mechanisms or Qt features.

The development of own modules written in C++ or Python is supported by [[Wizard (software)|wizards]].
