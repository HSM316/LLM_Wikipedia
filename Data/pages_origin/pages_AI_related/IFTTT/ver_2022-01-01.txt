IFTTT has partnerships with different service providers that supply event notifications to IFTTT and execute commands that implement the responses. Some event and command interfaces are simply public APIs.<ref name="Peers">{{cite web|last=Peers|first=Nick|date=October 2, 2014|title=Your Online Life Made Simpler, Thanks to IFTTT|url=http://blog.1and1.co.uk/2014/10/02/your-online-life-made-simpler-thanks-to-ifttt/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015050508/http://blog.1and1.co.uk/2014/10/02/your-online-life-made-simpler-thanks-to-ifttt/|archive-date=October 15, 2014|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
On December 14, 2010, Linden Tibbets, the co-founder of IFTTT, posted a blog post titled “ifttt the beginning...” on the IFTTT website, announcing the new project. The first IFTTT applications were designed and developed by Tibbets and co-founder Jesse Tane and the product officially launched on September 7, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive|title=ifttt is alive!|last=Alexander|first=Jesse|date=September 7, 2011|access-date=November 8, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924230856/http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive|archive-date=September 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= ifttt is alive! |url= http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive |date= September 7, 2011 |access-date= October 18, 2014 |archive-date= September 24, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110924230856/http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive |url-status= live }}</ref>

By April 2012, users had created one million tasks.<ref>{{cite web |title=One million tasks created |url=http://blog.ifttt.com/post/22129854971/one-million-tasks-created |date=April 30, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2014 |archive-date=October 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018120837/http://blog.ifttt.com/post/22129854971/one-million-tasks-created |url-status=live }}</ref> In June 2012, the service entered the [[Internet of Things]] space by integrating with [[Belkin Wemo]] devices,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/06/20/task-automation-tool-ifttt-gets-new-look-moves-into-physical-world-with-belkin-wemo-compatibility/|title=Task automation tool IFTTT gets new look, moves into physical world with Belkin WeMo compatibility|last=Panzarino|first=Matthew|date=June 20, 2012|access-date=July 25, 2012|archive-date=August 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806162921/http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/06/20/task-automation-tool-ifttt-gets-new-look-moves-into-physical-world-with-belkin-wemo-compatibility/|url-status=live}}</ref> allowing applets to interact with the physical world.

On February 19, 2015, IFTTT launched three new applications. Do Button triggers an action when you press it. Do Camera automatically uploads the image to the service of your choice ([[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Dropbox]], etc). Do Notes does the same as Do Camera except with notes instead of images. In November 2016, the four apps were merged. By December 2016, the company announced a partnership with [[JotForm]] to integrate an applet to create actions in other applications.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jotform-and-ifttts-new-integration-connects-form-responses-to-hundreds-of-new-apps-300373092.html | title = JotForm and IFTTT's New Integration Connects Form Responses to Hundreds of New Apps | work = PR Newswire | date = 6 December 2016 | access-date = 11 January 2017 | archive-date = 13 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113153626/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jotform-and-ifttts-new-integration-connects-form-responses-to-hundreds-of-new-apps-300373092.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://tech.co/little-ifttt-applets-company-try-2016-12 | title = 6 Little-Known IFTTT Applets Your Company Should Try | work = Tech.co | date = 7 December 2016 | access-date = 11 January 2017 | archive-date = 13 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113171313/http://tech.co/little-ifttt-applets-company-try-2016-12 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Part of the revenue of IFTTT comes from "IFTTT Platform" partners, who pay to have their products connected to the service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

On September 10, 2020, the service switched to a limited [[freemium]] model with a subscription-based version known as "IFTTT Pro", which allows services to use conditional statements and query data for more complex tasks. At the same time, all existing users were limited to three custom applets, being required to subscribe to Pro in order to remove this limitation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=IFTTT Pro will let users create more complex actions for $10 per month|url=https://www.engadget.com/ifttt-pro-applets-subscription-142815488.html|access-date=2020-09-14|website=Engadget|language=en|archive-date=2020-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914120804/https://www.engadget.com/ifttt-pro-applets-subscription-142815488.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ricker|first=Thomas|date=2020-09-10|title=IFTTT introduces Pro subscriptions, limits free version to three applets|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430265/ifttt-pro-subscriptions-free-controversy|access-date=2020-09-14|website=The Verge|language=en|archive-date=2020-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200916161038/https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430265/ifttt-pro-subscriptions-free-controversy|url-status=live}}</ref> This decision generated criticism from IFTTT's community of users.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Charlton |first1=Alistair |title=IFTTT Pro causes user backlash as free access restricted |url=https://www.gearbrain.com/ifttt-pro-subscription-service-explained-2647566439.html |website=Gearbrain |access-date=17 September 2020 |archive-date=24 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924181656/https://www.gearbrain.com/ifttt-pro-subscription-service-explained-2647566439.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Features ==
=== Overview ===
[[File:Ifttt screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of the IFTTT website]]
IFTTT employs the following concepts:
* Services (formerly known as channels) are the basic building blocks of IFTTT.<ref name= "wtf">{{cite web| url=https://ifttt.com/wtf| title=About IFTTT| publisher=IFTTT.com| access-date=October 23, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015215100/https://ifttt.com/wtf| archive-date=October 15, 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> They mainly describe a series of data from a certain web service such as YouTube or [[eBay]]. Services can also describe actions controlled with certain [[API]]s, like SMS. Sometimes, they can represent information in terms of weather or stocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseackerman/2012/09/23/ifttt-the-san-francisco-startup-lets-anyone-control-the-internet-of-things/|title=San Francisco Startup Lets Anyone Control The Internet of Things|last=Ackerman|first=Elise|date=September 23, 2012|work=forbes.com|access-date=October 23, 2014|archive-date=October 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023040343/http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseackerman/2012/09/23/ifttt-the-san-francisco-startup-lets-anyone-control-the-internet-of-things/|url-status=live}}</ref> Each service has a particular set of triggers and actions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ifttt.com/channels | title=IFTTT Channels | publisher=IFTTT.com | access-date=October 23, 2014 | archive-date=October 22, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022192151/https://ifttt.com/channels | url-status=live }}</ref>
* Triggers are the "this" part of an applet. They are the items that trigger the action. For example, from an [[RSS feed]], you can receive a notification based on a keyword or phrase.<ref name="Peers" />
* Actions are the "that" part of an applet. They are the output that results from the input of the trigger.
* Applets (formerly known as recipes) are the [[First-order logic|predicates]] made from Triggers and Actions. For example, if you like a picture on Instagram (trigger), an IFTTT app can send the photo to your [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] account (action).<ref name="wtf" />
* Ingredients are basic data available from a trigger—from the email trigger, for example; subject, body, attachment, received date, and sender’s address.<ref name="wtf" />

=== Usage examples ===
* IFTTT can automate web-application tasks, such as posting the same content on several social networks.
* Marketing professionals can use IFTTT to track mentions of companies in [[RSS feeds]].<ref name="Sara">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4919-ifttt-for-business.html|title=10 Ways IFTTT Can Help Your Business|date=August 12, 2013|access-date=October 27, 2014|last=Angeles|first=Sara|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022005809/http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4919-ifttt-for-business.html|archive-date=October 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* IFTTT also is used in home automation, for instance switching on a light when detecting motion in a room (with associated compliant devices).<ref name=":0" />
