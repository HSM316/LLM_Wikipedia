'''If This Then That''', also known as '''IFTTT''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|f|t}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ifttt.com/m/brand-guidelines |title=Brand guidelines |accessdate=July 22, 2017 |website=IFTTT}}</ref><ref name="ifttt_wtf">{{cite web|url=https://ifttt.com/wtf|accessdate=16 Oct 2014|title=About IFTTT}}</ref> is a free [[Web service|web-based service]] to create chains of simple [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]], called ''applets''.

An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as [[Gmail]], [[Facebook]], [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]], [[Instagram]], or [[Pinterest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/tech/web/what-is-ifttt-and-how-can-it-improve-your-digital-life| title=What Is IFTTT and How Can it Improve Your Digital Life? | date=July 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 16, 2014| last= Escobar| first= Eric}}</ref>

For example, an applet may send an e-mail message if the user [[Twitter|tweets]] using a hashtag, or copy a photo on Facebook to a user's archive if someone tags a user in a photo.<ref name="Peers">{{cite web|url=http://blog.1and1.co.uk/2014/10/02/your-online-life-made-simpler-thanks-to-ifttt/|title=Your Online Life Made Simpler, Thanks to IFTTT|last=Peers|first=Nick|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>

In addition to the web-based application, the service runs on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. In February 2015, IFTTT renamed its original application to IF, and released a new suite of apps called Do, which lets users create shortcut applications and actions.<ref>{{cite web |title= IFTTT launches Do – a suite of apps to simplify recipes into customizable shortcuts|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/02/19/ifttt-launches-suite-apps-simplify-recipes-customizable-shortcuts/| publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=February 19, 2015 }}</ref> As of 2015, IFTTT users created about 20 million recipes each day.<ref>{{cite web |title= IFTTT Launches 3 "Do" Apps To Automate Photo Sharing, Tasks, Notes; Rebrands Main App "IF"|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/ifttt-launches-3-do-apps-to-automate-photo-sharing-tasks-notes-rebrands-main-app-if/| publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=February 22, 2015 }}</ref> All of the functionalities of the Do suite of apps have since been integrated into a redesigned IFTTT app.

== History ==
On December 14, 2010, Linden Tibbets, the co-founder of IFTTT, posted a blog post titled “ifttt the beginning...” on the IFTTT website, announcing the new project. The first IFTTT applications were designed and developed by Tibbets and co-founder Jesse Tane. On September 7, 2011, Tibbets announced the launch on the official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive|title=ifttt is alive!|last=Alexander|first=Jesse|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=November 8, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924230856/http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive|archivedate=September 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= ifttt is alive! |url= http://blog.ifttt.com/post/9919161101/ifttt-is-alive | date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref>

By April 30, 2012, users had created 1 million tasks.<ref>{{cite web |title=One million tasks created |url= http://blog.ifttt.com/post/22129854971/one-million-tasks-created | date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> In June 2012, the service entered the [[Internet of Things]] space by integrating with [[Belkin Wemo]] devices,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/06/20/task-automation-tool-ifttt-gets-new-look-moves-into-physical-world-with-belkin-wemo-compatibility/|title=Task automation tool IFTTT gets new look, moves into physical world with Belkin WeMo compatibility|last=Panzarino|first=Matthew|date=June 20, 2012|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref> allowing applets to interact with the physical world. On July 10, 2013, IFTTT released an iPhone app and later released a version for iPad and iPod touch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifttt.com/post/55130449805/the-power-of-ifttt-now-in-your-pocket|title=The power of IFTTT, now in your pocket|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> On April 24, 2014, IFTTT released a version for Android.<ref>{{cite web |title= The power of IFTTT, now on Android |url= http://blog.ifttt.com/post/83729472199/the-power-of-ifttt-now-on-android | date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2014, the IFTTT business was valued at approximately USD 170 million.<ref>{{cite web |title= 10 most valued Internet of Things startups from around the world |url= http://www.hottopics.ht/stories/lists/10-most-valued-internet-of-things-startups/ | date=February 2, 2015 |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref>

On February 19, 2015, IFTTT launched three new applications. Do Button triggers an action when you press it. Do Camera automatically uploads the image to the service of your choice (Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, etc.). Do Notes does the same as Do Camera except with notes instead of images. As of November 2016, the four apps have been combined into one. By December 2016, the company announced a partnership with [[JotForm]] to integrate an applet to create actions in other applications.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jotform-and-ifttts-new-integration-connects-form-responses-to-hundreds-of-new-apps-300373092.html | title = JotForm and IFTTT's New Integration Connects Form Responses to Hundreds of New Apps | work = PR Newswire | date = 6 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://tech.co/little-ifttt-applets-company-try-2016-12 | title = 6 Little-Known IFTTT Applets Your Company Should Try | work = Tech.co | date = 7 December 2016}}</ref>

Part of the revenue of IFTTT comes from "IFTTT Platform" partners, who pay to have their products connected to the service, among them GE, BMW, Microsoft and Google. Others are Dropbox, The New York Times, Twitter, Slack and Spotify. Partners can choose from various monthly plans, such as "Lite" which is free to use, "Basic" for $ 199 and "Enterprise" for $ 499. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tecnoblog.net/267831/como-o-ifttt-ganha-dinheiro/|title=Como o IFTTT ganha dinheiro?|date=2018-11-16|website=Tecnoblog|language=pt-br|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> In July 2019 IFTTT announced a tenfold increase to those monthly charges, pricing out smaller integration partners.

== Features ==
=== Overview ===
[[File:Ifttt screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of the IFTTT website]]
IFTTT employs the following concepts:
* Services (formerly known as channels) are the basic building blocks of IFTTT.<ref name= "wtf">{{cite web | url=https://ifttt.com/wtf| title=About IFTTT | publisher=IFTTT.com  | accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref> They mainly describe a series of data from a certain web service such as YouTube or [[eBay]]. Services can also describe actions controlled with certain [[API]]s, like SMS. Sometimes, they can represent information in terms of weather or stocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseackerman/2012/09/23/ifttt-the-san-francisco-startup-lets-anyone-control-the-internet-of-things/|title=San Francisco Startup Lets Anyone Control The Internet of Things|last=Ackerman|first=Elise|date=September 23, 2012|publisher=forbes.com|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref> Each service has a particular set of triggers and actions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ifttt.com/channels | title=IFTTT Channels | publisher=IFTTT.com  | accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref>
* Triggers are the "this" part of an applet. They are the items that trigger the action. For example, from an [[RSS feed]], you can receive a notification based on a keyword or phrase.<ref name="Peers" />
* Actions are the "that" part of an applet. They are the output that results from the input of the trigger.
* Applets (formerly known as recipes) are the [[First-order logic|predicates]] made from Triggers and Actions. For example, if you like a picture on Instagram (trigger), an IFTTT app can send the photo to your [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] account (action).<ref name="wtf" />
* Ingredients are basic data available from a trigger—from the email trigger, for example; subject, body, attachment, received date, and sender’s address.<ref name="wtf" />

=== Usage examples ===
* IFTTT can automate web-application tasks, such as posting the same content on several social networks.
* Marketing professionals can use IFTTT to track mentions of companies in [[RSS feeds]].<ref name="Sara">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4919-ifttt-for-business.html| title=10 Ways IFTTT Can Help Your Business |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=October 27, 2014| last= Angeles| first= Sara}}</ref>
* IFTTT also is used in home automation, for instance switching on a light when detecting motion in a room (with associated compliant devices).<ref name=":0" />
