=== Competitions ===
Many [[machine-learning]] competitions have been run on Kaggle since the company was founded. Notable competitions include one improving gesture recognition for [[Microsoft Kinect]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Kaggle launches competition to help Microsoft Kinect learn new gestures|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/12/kaggle-competition-microsoft-kinect-learn-new-gestures/|access-date=13 December 2011|newspaper=VentureBeat|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref> making a [[soccer|football]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], coding a trading algorithm for [[Two Sigma Investments]],<ref name="ft-novel">{{cite news |last=Wigglesworth |first=Robin |date=March 8, 2017 |title=Hedge funds adopt novel methods to hunt down new tech talent |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1fd47a60-03e5-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12 | work=[[The Financial Times]] |location=United Kingdom |access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> and improving the search for the [[Higgs boson]] at [[CERN]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The machine learning community takes on the Higgs|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/july-2014/the-machine-learning-community-takes-on-the-higgs/|access-date=14 January 2015|newspaper=Symmetry Magazine|date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>

The competition host prepares the data and a description of the problem; the host may choose whether it's going to be rewarded with money or be unpaid. Participants experiment with different techniques and compete against each other to produce the best models. Work is shared publicly through Kaggle Kernels to achieve a better benchmark and to inspire new ideas. Submissions can be made through Kaggle Kernels, through manual upload or using the Kaggle [[Application programming interface|API]]. For most competitions, submissions are scored immediately (based on their predictive accuracy relative to a hidden solution file) and summarized on a live leaderboard. After the deadline passes, the competition host pays the prize money in exchange for "a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license [...] to use the winning Entry", i.e. the algorithm, software and related [[intellectual property]] developed, which is "non-exclusive unless otherwise specified".<ref>{{cite web |author=Kaggle |title=Terms and Conditions - Kaggle |url=https://www.kaggle.com/terms}}</ref>

Alongside its public competitions, Kaggle also offers private competitions, which are limited to Kaggle's top participants. Kaggle offers a free tool for data science teachers to run academic machine-learning competitions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kaggle |title=Kaggle in Class |url=http://inclass.kaggle.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616013541/http://inclass.kaggle.com/ |archive-date=2011-06-16 |access-date=2011-08-12}}</ref> Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview at leading data science companies like [[Facebook]], [[Winton Group|Winton Capital]], and [[Walmart]].

Kaggle's competitions have resulted in successful projects such as furthering [[HIV]] research,<ref>{{cite news|last=Carpenter|first=Jennifer|title=May the Best Analyst Win|url=https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.331.6018.698|access-date=1 April 2011|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=February 2011|volume=331 |issue=6018 |pages=698–699 |doi=10.1126/science.331.6018.698 }}</ref> [[chess]] ratings<ref>{{cite news|last=Sonas|first=Jeff|title=The Deloitte/FIDE Chess Rating Challenge|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7020|access-date=3 May 2011|newspaper=Chessbase|date=20 February 2011}}</ref> and [[traffic]] forecasting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Foo|first=Fran|title=Smartphones to predict NSW travel times?|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/smartphone-used-to-predict-nsw-travel-times/story-e6frgakx-1226034533295|access-date=3 May 2011|newspaper=The Australian|date=April 6, 2011}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[George Dahl]] used deep [[neural networks]] to win a competition hosted by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} Vlad Mnih (one of Hinton's students) used deep neural networks to win a competition hosted by [[Adzuna]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} This resulted in the technique being taken up by others in the Kaggle community. Tianqi Chen from the [[University of Washington]] also used Kaggle to show the power of [[Xgboost|XGBoost]], which has since replaced [[Random forest|Random Forest]] as one of the main methods used to win Kaggle competitions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Several academic papers have been published on the basis of findings made in Kaggle competitions.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v42/ |title= NIPS 2014 Workshop on High-energy Physics and Machine Learning | book-title= JMLR W&CP | volume=42}}</ref>  A contributor to this is the live leaderboard, which encourages participants to continue innovating beyond existing best practices.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Value of Feedback in Forecasting Competitions|last1=Athanasopoulos|first1=George|last2=Hyndman|first2=Rob|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|year=2011|volume=27|pages=845–849|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V92-52S72B8-1-1&_cdi=5886&_user=559483&_pii=S0169207011000495&_origin=&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2011&_sk=999729996&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzb-zSkWl&_valck=1&md5=7c0b261207c4204b14d21a95adc9d6bb&ie=/sdarticle.pdf|access-date=2022-03-04|archive-date=2019-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216230244/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V92-52S72B8-1-1&_cdi=5886&_user=559483&_pii=S0169207011000495&_origin=&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2011&_sk=999729996&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzb-zSkWl&_valck=1&md5=7c0b261207c4204b14d21a95adc9d6bb&ie=%2Fsdarticle.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> The winning methods are frequently written on the Kaggle Winner's Blog.

=== Progression System ===
{{Importance section|date=June 2023}}
Kaggle has implemented a progression system to recognize and reward users based on their contributions and achievements within the platform. This system consists of five tiers: Novice, Contributor, Expert, Master, and Grandmaster. Each tier is achieved by meeting specific criteria in competitions, datasets, kernels (code-sharing), and discussions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kaggle Progression System |url=https://www.kaggle.com/progression |publisher=Kaggle |access-date=2023-04-03 }}
</ref>

The highest and most prestigious tier, Kaggle Grandmaster, is awarded to users who demonstrate exceptional skills in data science and machine learning. Achieving this status is extremely challenging. As of April 4, 2023, out of 12 million Kaggle users, only 2,331 (about 1 out of every 5500 users) have reached the Master level.

Among these Masters, only 472 (approximately 1 out of every 5 Masters) have achieved the coveted Kaggle Grandmaster status.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Carl McBride Ellis |title=Kaggle in Numbers |url=https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlmcbrideellis/kaggle-in-numbers |publisher=Kaggle |date=2022-02-10 |access-date=2023-11-01 }}
</ref>

The other tiers in the progression system include: 
* 13 thousand Experts 
* 200 thousand Contributors
* 12 million Novices.

The progression system serves to motivate users to continuously improve their skills and contribute to the Kaggle community.
