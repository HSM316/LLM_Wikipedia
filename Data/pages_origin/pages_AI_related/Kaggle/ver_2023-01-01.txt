'''Kaggle''', a subsidiary of [[Google LLC]], is an online community of [[data science|data scientist]]s and [[machine learning]] practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. 

Kaggle was first launched in 2010 by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers a public [[Data science competition platform|data platform]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Google Previews Log Analytics Feature in Its Cloud Logging Service |url=https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/10/google-log-analytics-preview/ |access-date=2022-10-13 |website=InfoQ |language=en}}</ref> a cloud-based workbench for data science, and Artificial Intelligence education. Its key personnel were Anthony Goldbloom and [[Jeremy Howard (entrepreneur)|Jeremy Howard]]. [[Nicholas Gruen]] was the founding chair succeeded by [[Max Levchin]]. Equity was raised in 2011 valuing the company at $25.2 million. On 8 March 2017, Google announced that they were acquiring Kaggle.<ref name="TechCrunch_Lardinois">{{cite web

==Kaggle community==
In June 2017, Kaggle claimed it surpassed 1 million registered users<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/06/06/weve-passed-1-million-members/|title=We've passed 1 million members|date=2017-06-06|work=Kaggle Winner's Blog|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}</ref> and as of 2021 over 8 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/unique-kaggle-users|title = Unique Kaggle Users}}</ref> The users come from 194 countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html|title=Scientists See Advances in Deep Learning, a Part of Artificial Intelligence|last=Markoff|first=John|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}</ref>

By March 2017, the [[Two Sigma Investments]] fund was running a competition on Kaggle to code a trading algorithm.<ref name="ft-novel">{{cite news |last=Wigglesworth |first=Robin |date=March 8, 2017 |title=Hedge funds adopt novel methods to hunt down new tech talent |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1fd47a60-03e5-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12 | work=[[The Financial Times]] |location=United Kingdom |access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref>

==Overview==
# The competition host prepares the data and a description of the problem; the host may choose whether it's going to be rewarded with money or by unpaid.
# Participants experiment with different techniques and compete against each other to produce the best models. Work is shared publicly through Kaggle Kernels to achieve a better benchmark and to inspire new ideas. Submissions can be made through Kaggle Kernels, through manual upload or using the Kaggle [[Application programming interface|API]]. For most competitions, submissions are scored immediately (based on their predictive accuracy relative to a hidden solution file) and summarized on a live leaderboard.
# After the deadline passes, the competition host pays the prize money in exchange for "a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license [...] to use the winning Entry", i.e. the algorithm, software and related [[intellectual property]] developed, which is "non-exclusive unless otherwise specified".<ref>{{cite web|title=Terms and Conditions - Kaggle|author=Kaggle|url=https://www.kaggle.com/terms}}</ref> 

Alongside its public competitions, Kaggle also offers private competitions limited to Kaggle's top participants. Kaggle offers a free tool for data science teachers to run academic machine-learning competitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kaggle in Class|author=Kaggle|url=http://inclass.kaggle.com/|access-date=2011-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616013541/http://inclass.kaggle.com/|archive-date=2011-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview leading data science companies like [[Facebook]], [[Winton Group|Winton Capital]], and [[Walmart]].

==Competitions==

Hundreds of [[machine-learning]] competitions were run on Kaggle since the company was founded. Competitions have ranged from improving gesture recognition for [[Microsoft Kinect]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Kaggle launches competition to help Microsoft Kinect learn new gestures|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/12/kaggle-competition-microsoft-kinect-learn-new-gestures/|access-date=13 December 2011|newspaper=VentureBeat|date=December 12, 2011}}</ref> to making a [[soccer|football]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] for [[Manchester City]] to improving the search for the [[Higgs boson]] at [[CERN]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The machine learning community takes on the Higgs|url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/july-2014/the-machine-learning-community-takes-on-the-higgs/|access-date=14 January 2015|newspaper=Symmetry Magazine|date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>

Competitions have resulted in many successful projects including furthering the state of the art in [[HIV]] research,<ref>{{cite news|last=Carpenter|first=Jennifer|title=May the Best Analyst Win|url=https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.331.6018.698|access-date=1 April 2011|newspaper=Science Magazine|date=February 2011}}</ref> [[chess]] ratings<ref>{{cite news|last=Sonas|first=Jeff|title=The Deloitte/FIDE Chess Rating Challenge|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=7020|access-date=3 May 2011|newspaper=Chessbase|date=20 February 2011}}</ref> and [[traffic]] forecasting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Foo|first=Fran|title=Smartphones to predict NSW travel times?|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/smartphone-used-to-predict-nsw-travel-times/story-e6frgakx-1226034533295|access-date=3 May 2011|newspaper=The Australian|date=April 6, 2011}}</ref> [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and George Dahl used deep [[neural networks]] to win a competition hosted by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]. And Vlad Mnih (one of Hinton's students) used deep neural networks to win a competition hosted by Adzuna. This resulted in the technique being taken up by others in the Kaggle community. Tianqi Chen from the University of Washington also used Kaggle to show the power of [[Xgboost|XGBoost]], which has since taken over from [[Random forest|Random Forest]] as one of the main methods used to win Kaggle competitions. 

Several academic papers have been published on the basis of findings made in Kaggle competitions.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v42/ |title= NIPS 2014 Workshop on High-energy Physics and Machine Learning | book-title= JMLR W&CP | volume=42}}</ref>  A key to this is the effect of the live leaderboard, which encourages participants to continue innovating beyond existing best practices.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Value of Feedback in Forecasting Competitions|last1=Athanasopoulos|first1=George|last2=Hyndman|first2=Rob|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|year=2011|volume=27|pages=845–849|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V92-52S72B8-1-1&_cdi=5886&_user=559483&_pii=S0169207011000495&_origin=&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2011&_sk=999729996&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzb-zSkWl&_valck=1&md5=7c0b261207c4204b14d21a95adc9d6bb&ie=/sdarticle.pdf|access-date=2022-03-04|archive-date=2019-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216230244/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V92-52S72B8-1-1&_cdi=5886&_user=559483&_pii=S0169207011000495&_origin=&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2011&_sk=999729996&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzb-zSkWl&_valck=1&md5=7c0b261207c4204b14d21a95adc9d6bb&ie=%2Fsdarticle.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> The winning methods are frequently written up on the Kaggle blog, [https://medium.com/kaggle-blog ''Kaggle Winner's Blog''].

==Financials==

In March 2017, [[Fei-Fei Li]], Chief Scientist at Google, announced that [[Google]] was acquiring Kaggle during her keynote at Google Next.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/welcome-Kaggle-to-Google-Cloud.html|title=Welcome Kaggle to Google Cloud|work=Google Cloud Platform Blog|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}</ref>
