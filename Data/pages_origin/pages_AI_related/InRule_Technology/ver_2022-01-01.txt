On October 29, 2012, InRule Technology launched InRule for Microsoft Dynamics CRM.<ref>Boucher Ferguson, Renee.

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Community, 2013</ref>

With the availability of InRule 4.6 in 2014, the company introduced deployment of InRule through REST services and allowed REST services to be called from InRule.<ref>Taylor, James. James Taylor on Everything Decision Management. [http://jtonedm.com/2014/06/25/first-look-inrule-4-6-update/]. 2014</ref> This enables access to data exposed as a REST service and to package up a rule service for RESTful access. The product launch reflected the move of the company’s core audience to use a broader array of technologies despite an earlier focus on .NET.

In 2017, InRule introduced InRule for the Salesforce Platform, as well as a technology partnership with Work-Relay, a Business Process Management (BPM) application built on the Salesforce Platform. <ref>https://www.work-relay.com/news/business-process-management-bpm-leader-work-relay-announces-partnership-inrule-technology/</ref> One year earlier the company  introduced InRule for JavaScript,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wagner|first=Renee|date=2016-04-19|title=InRule Technology® Achieves Industry Firsts with Release of InRule® 5|url=https://www.newswire.com/news/inrule-technology-reg-achieves-industry-firsts-with-release-of-inrule-reg-5|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Newswire.com}}</ref> allowing enterprises to run rules on the client-side, server-side or both. 

The software architecture includes multiple components, including irAuthor, the primary authoring tool for creating and maintaining rules; irVerify, a real-time test environment to run and debug rule applications; and irSDK, a set of APIs that allows developers to integrate inRule into their applications. Additionally, irSOA allows users to access the InRule rule engine as a service.<ref name="SIMON">Holloway, Simon.
