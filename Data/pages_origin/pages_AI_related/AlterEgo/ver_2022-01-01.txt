{{About|The AlterEgo Silent Speech Device [[MIT Media Lab]]}}


'''AlterEgo''' is a wearable silent speech output-input device developed by [[MIT Media Lab]].<ref name=Futurism>{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/alterego-talk-computer-without-words/ |title=This Crazy Gadget Helps You "Talk" To Your Computer Without Words|last1=Ossola|first1=Alexandra|date=April 5, 2018|work=Futurism|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> The device is attached around the head, neck, and jawline and translates your brain speech center impulse input into words on a computer, without vocalization.

==Description==
The device consists of 7 small electrodes that attach at various points around the jaw-line and mouth to receive the electrical inputs to the muscles used for speech. It looks similar to a sling for the head, neck and jaw.

==Background==
Scientists [[Arnav Kapur]] of Fluid Interfaces group at MIT Media Lab with [[Shreyas Kapur]] and [[Pattie Maes]] designed the prototype and presented the work at the Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces in March 2018, in [[Tokyo]]. They reported that, when testing the accuracy of a classifier trained on data where users were instructed to "read the number to themselves, without producing a sound and moving their lips," they were able to classify the digit (between 0 to 9, i.e., ten classes), with 92 percent accuracy rate.<ref>[https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/2018/03/23/p43-kapur_BRjFwE6.pdf AlterEgo: A Personalized Wearable Silent Speech Interface]</ref>
