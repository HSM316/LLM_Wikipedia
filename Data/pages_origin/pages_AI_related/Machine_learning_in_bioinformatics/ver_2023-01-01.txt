== Tasks ==
Machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics can be used for prediction, classification, and feature selection. Methods to achieve this task are varied and span many disciplines; most well known among them are machine learning and statistics. Classification and prediction tasks aim at building models that describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction. The differences between them are the following:

* Classification/recognition outputs a categorical class, while prediction outputs a numerical valued feature.
* The type of algorithm, or process used to build the predictive models from data using analogies, rules, neural networks, probabilities, and/or statistics.

Due to the exponential growth of information technologies and applicable models, including artificial intelligence and data mining, in addition to the access ever-more comprehensive data sets, new and better information analysis techniques have been created, based on their ability to learn. Such models allow reach beyond description and provide insights in the form of testable models.

=== Feature engineering ===
The way that features, often vectors in a many-dimensional space, are extracted from the domain data is an important component of learning systems.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |vauthors= Soueidan H, Nikolski M|date=2019|title= Machine learning for metagenomics: methods and tools|url= https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06621.pdf|journal=Metagenomics|volume= 1|doi= 10.1515/metgen-2016-0001 |arxiv=1510.06621|s2cid=17418188}}</ref> In genomics, a typical representation of a sequence is a vector of [[k-mer]]s frequencies, which is a vector of dimension <math>4^k</math> whose entries count the appearance of each subsequence of length <math>k</math> in a given sequence. Since for a value as small as <math>k=12</math> the dimensionality of these vectors is huge (e.g. in this case the dimension is <math>4^{12} \approx 16\times 10^6</math>), techniques such as [[principal component analysis]] are used to project the data to a lower dimensional space, thus selecting a smaller set of features from the sequences.<ref name=":0" />{{Additional citation needed|date=June 2021}}

=== Classification ===

In this type of machine learning task, the output is a discrete variable. One example of this type of task in bioinformatics is labeling new genomic data (such as genomes of unculturable bacteria) based on a model of already labeled data.<ref name=":0" />

==== Hidden Markov models ====
[[Hidden Markov models]] (HMMs) are a class of [[statistical models]] for sequential data (often related to systems evolving over time). An HMM is composed of two mathematical objects: an observed state‐dependent process <math>X_1,X_2,\ldots ,X_M</math>, and an unobserved (hidden) state process <math>S_1,S_2,\ldots ,S_T</math>. In an HMM, the state process is not directly observed – it is a 'hidden' (or 'latent') variable – but observations are made of a state‐dependent process (or observation process) that is driven by the underlying state process (and which can thus be regarded as a noisy measurement of the system states of interest).<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Rabiner L, Juang B |date=January 1986|title=An introduction to hidden Markov models|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1165342|journal=IEEE ASSP Magazine|volume=3|issue=1|pages=4–16|doi=10.1109/MASSP.1986.1165342|s2cid=11358505|issn=1558-1284}}</ref> HMMs can be formulated in continuous time.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Jackson CH, Sharples LD, Thompson SG, Duffy SW, Couto E|date=July 2003|title=Multistate Markov models for disease progression with classification error|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D (The Statistician)|volume=52|issue=2|pages=193–209|doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Amoros R, King R, Toyoda H, Kumada T, Johnson PJ, Bird TG|date=May 30, 2019|title=A continuous-time hidden Markov model for cancer surveillance using serum biomarkers with application to hepatocellular carcinoma|journal=Metron|volume=77|issue=2|pages=67–86|doi=10.1007/s40300-019-00151-8|pmc=6820468|pmid=31708595}}</ref>

==== Convolutional neural networks ====
[[Convolutional neural network]]s (CNN) are a class of [[deep neural network]] whose architecture is based on shared weights of convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features, providing translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps.<ref name=":CNN-0">{{cite journal| vauthors = Zhang W |date=1988|title=Shift-invariant pattern recognition neural network and its optical architecture|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nN_5odSG_QVae54EsQN_qSz-0ZsX6wA0/view?usp=sharing|journal=Proceedings of Annual Conference of the Japan Society of Applied Physics}}</ref><ref name=":CNN-1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang W, Itoh K, Tanida J, Ichioka Y | title = Parallel distributed processing model with local space-invariant interconnections and its optical architecture | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 29 | issue = 32 | pages = 4790–7 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 20577468 | doi = 10.1364/AO.29.004790 | bibcode = 1990ApOpt..29.4790Z }}</ref> CNNs take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble patterns of increasing complexity using smaller and simpler patterns discovered via their filters.

Individual [[cortical neuron]]s respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the [[visual field]] known as the [[receptive field]].

CNN uses relatively little pre-processing compared to other [[Image classification|image classification algorithms]]. This means that the network learns to optimize the [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] (or kernels) through automated learning, whereas in traditional algorithms these filters are [[Feature engineering|hand-engineered]]. This independence from prior knowledge and human intervention in feature extraction is a major advantage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==== Phylogenetic convolutional neural networks ====
A phylogenetic convolutional neural network (Ph-CNN) is a novel [[convolutional neural network]] architecture proposed by Fioranti et al. to classify [[metagenomics]] data.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fioravanti D, Giarratano Y, Maggio V, Agostinelli C, Chierici M, Jurman G, Furlanello C | title = Phylogenetic convolutional neural networks in metagenomics | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 49 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29536822 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-018-2033-5 | pmc = 5850953 }}</ref> In this approach, phylogenetic data is endowed with patristic distance (the sum of the lengths of all branches connecting two [[operational taxonomic unit]]s [OTU]) to select k-neighborhoods for each OTU, and each OTU and its neighbors are processed with convolutional filters.

==== Random forest ====
[[File: Some bioinformatic applications of Random Forest.jpg|thumbnail|Some bioinformatic applications{{Which|date=June 2021}} of Random Forest.|220x220px]]
[[Random forest]]s (RF) classify by constructing an ensemble of [[decision trees]], and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Ho TK |title=Random Decision Forests | conference =Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, Montreal, QC, 14–16 August 1995. |date=1995 |pages=278–282}}</ref> This is a modification of [[bootstrap aggregating]] (which aggregates a large collection of decision trees) and can be used for [[classification]] or [[regression analysis|regression]].<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Dietterich T |title=An Experimental Comparison of Three Methodsfor Constructing Ensembles of Decision Trees:Bagging, Boosting, and Randomization |date=2000 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |pages=139–157}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Breiman L |title=Random Forest |date=2001 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publisers |location=Machine Learning |pages=5–32 |edition=45}}</ref>

As random forests give an internal estimate of generalization error, cross-validation is unnecessary. In addition, they produce proximities, which can be used to impute missing values, and which enable novel data visualizations.<ref name = "Zhang_2012">{{cite book| vauthors = Zhang C, Ma Y |title=Ensemble machine learning: methods and applications |date=2012 |publisher=Springer New York Dordrecht Heidelberg London |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4419-9325-0 |pages=157–175}}</ref>

Computationally, random forests are appealing because they naturally handle both regression and (multiclass) classification, are relatively fast to train and to predict, depend only on one or two tuning parameters, have a built-in estimate of the generalization error, can be used directly for high-dimensional problems, and can easily be implemented in parallel. Statistically, random forests are appealing for additional features, such as measures of variable importance, differential class weighting, missing value imputation, visualization, outlier detection, and unsupervised learning.<ref name = "Zhang_2012" />

=== Clustering ===
[[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] - the partitioning of a data set into disjoint subsets, so that the data in each subset are as close as possible to each other and as distant as possible from data in any other subset, according to some defined [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] or [[Similarity measure|similarity]] function - is a common technique for statistical data analysis.

Clustering is central to much data-driven bioinformatics research and serves as a powerful computational method whereby means of hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based, and self-organizing maps classification, has long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. Particularly, clustering helps to analyze unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts, images, and so on. Clustering is also used to gain insights into biological processes at the [[genomic]] level, e.g. gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells, [[gene regulation]], and metabolic processes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Karim MR, Beyan O, Zappa A, Costa IG, Rebholz-Schuhmann D, Cochez M, Decker S | title = Deep learning-based clustering approaches for bioinformatics | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 393–415 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 32008043 | pmc = 7820885 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbz170 }}</ref>

==== Clustering algorithms used in bioinformatics ====
Data clustering algorithms can be hierarchical or partitional. Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters, whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters at once. Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).

Agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them in successively larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters. [[Hierarchical clustering]] is calculated using metrics on [[Euclidean spaces]], the most commonly used is the [[Euclidean distance]] computed by finding the square of the difference between each variable, adding all the squares, and finding the square root of the said sum. An example of a [[hierarchical clustering]] algorithm is [[BIRCH]], which is particularly good on bioinformatics for its nearly linear [[time complexity]] given generally large datasets.<ref name="Variations on the Clustering Algori">{{cite journal |title=Variations on the Clustering Algorithm BIRCH |journal=Big Data Research |date=March 1, 2018 |volume=11 |pages=44–53 |doi=10.1016/j.bdr.2017.09.002| vauthors = Lorbeer B, Kosareva A, Deva B, Softić D, Ruppel P, Küpper A |doi-access=free }}</ref> Partitioning algorithms are based on specifying an initial number of groups, and iteratively reallocating objects among groups to convergence. This algorithm typically determines all clusters at once. Most applications adopt one of two popular heuristic methods: [[k-means]] algorithm or [[k-medoids]]. Other algorithms do not require an initial number of groups, such as [[affinity propagation]]. In a genomic setting this algorithm has been used both to cluster biosynthetic gene clusters in gene cluster families(GCF) and to cluster said GCFs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Navarro-Muñoz JC, Selem-Mojica N, Mullowney MW, Kautsar SA, Tryon JH, Parkinson EI, De Los Santos EL, Yeong M, Cruz-Morales P, Abubucker S, Roeters A, Lokhorst W, Fernandez-Guerra A, Cappelini LT, Goering AW, Thomson RJ, Metcalf WW, Kelleher NL, Barona-Gomez F, Medema MH | display-authors = 6 | title = A computational framework to explore large-scale biosynthetic diversity | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–68 | date = January 2020 | pmid =  31768033| pmc =  6917865| doi = 10.1038/s41589-019-0400-9 }}</ref>

=== Workflow ===

Typically, a workflow for applying machine learning to biological data goes through four steps:<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> 
* ''Recording,'' including capture and storage. In this step, different information sources may be merged into a single set.
* ''Preprocessing,'' including cleaning and restructuring into a ready-to-analyze form. In this step, uncorrected data are eliminated or corrected, while missing data maybe imputed and relevant variables chosen.
* ''Analysis,'' evaluating data using either supervised or unsupervised algorithms. The algorithm is typically trained on a subset of data, optimizing parameters, and evaluated on a separate test subset.
* ''Visualization and interpretation,'' where knowledge is represented effectively using different methods to assess the significance and importance of the findings.

=== Data errors ===
* Duplicate data is a significant issue in bioinformatics. Publicly available data may be of uncertain quality.<ref name="Shastry2020" >{{cite book | vauthors = Shastry KA, Sanjay HA |title=Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning Principles for Bioinformatics Techniques, Tools, and Applications |publisher=Springer Singapore |isbn=978-981-15-2444-8 |pages=25–39 |url=https://link-springer-com.pbidi.unam.mx:2443/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-2445-5_3 |chapter=Machine Learning for Bioinformatics|series=Algorithms for Intelligent Systems |year=2020 |doi=10.1007/978-981-15-2445-5_3 |s2cid=214350490 }}</ref>

=== Genomics ===
[[File:Growth of GenBank.png|thumb|The exponential growth of GenBank, a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)]]
While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty of sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics/|title=GenBank and WGS Statistics|website=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref> However, while [[raw data]] is becoming increasingly available and accessible, biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathé C, Sagot MF, Schiex T, Rouzé P | title = Current methods of gene prediction, their strengths and weaknesses | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 19 | pages = 4103–17 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12364589 | pmc = 140543 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkf543 }}</ref> This makes for an increasing need for developing [[computational genomics]] tools, including machine learning systems, that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence (i.e. [[gene prediction]]).<ref name=":1" />

Gene prediction is commonly performed through both ''extrinsic searches'' and ''intrinsic searches''.<ref name=":1" /> For the extrinsic search, the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated and identifying the target sequence's genes by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to known gene sequences. However, not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone, due to limits in the size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences. Therefore, an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone.<ref name=":1" />

Machine learning has also been used for the problem of [[multiple sequence alignment]] which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements.<ref name="rearrang">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pratas D, Silva RM, Pinho AJ, Ferreira PJ | title = An alignment-free method to find and visualise rearrangements between pairs of DNA sequences | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 10203 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25984837 | pmc = 4434998 | doi = 10.1038/srep10203 | number = 10203 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...510203P }}</ref>

[[Protein]]s, strings of [[amino acid]]s, gain much of their function from [[protein folding]], where they conform into a three-dimensional structure, including the [[Protein primary structure|primary structure]], the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] ([[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet]]s), the [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], and the [[Protein quaternary structure|quartenary structure]].

Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as tertiary and quartenary structures are determined based on the secondary structure.<ref name=":2" /> Solving the true structure of a protein is expensive and time-intensive, furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> Prior to machine learning, researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually. This trend began in 1951 when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L, Corey RB, Branson HR | title = The structure of proteins; two hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 205–11 | date = April 1951 | pmid = 14816373 | pmc = 1063337 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.37.4.205 | bibcode = 1951PNAS...37..205P | doi-access = free }}</ref> Automatic feature learning reaches an accuracy of 82-84%.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The current state-of-the-art in secondary structure prediction uses a system called DeepCNF (deep convolutional neural fields) which relies on the machine learning model of [[artificial neural network]]s to achieve an accuracy of approximately 84% when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes (helix, sheet, or coil).<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang S, Peng J, Ma J, Xu J | title = Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Fields | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 18962 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26752681 | pmc = 4707437 | doi = 10.1038/srep18962 | arxiv = 1512.00843 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...618962W }}</ref> {{Update inline|date=June 2021}} The theoretical limit for three-state protein secondary structure is 88–90%.<ref name=":2" />

=== Metagenomics ===
[[Metagenomics]] is the study of microbial communities from environmental DNA samples.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riesenfeld CS, Schloss PD, Handelsman J | title = Metagenomics: genomic analysis of microbial communities | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 525–52 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15568985 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.091216 }}</ref> Currently, limitations and challenges predominate in the implementation of machine learning tools due to the amount of data in environmental samples.<ref>{{cite arXiv | vauthors = Soueidan H, Nikolski M |title=Machine learning for metagenomics: methods and tools |date=March 8, 2016 |class=q-bio.GN |eprint=1510.06621}}</ref> Supercomputers and web servers have made access to these tools easier.<ref name = "Lin_2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin Y, Wang G, Yu J, Sung JJ | title = Artificial intelligence and metagenomics in intestinal diseases | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 841–847 | date = April 2021 | pmid = 33880764 | doi = 10.1111/jgh.15501 | s2cid = 233312307 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The high dimensionality of microbiome datasets is a major challenge in studying the microbiome; this significantly limits the power of current approaches for identifying true differences and increases the chance of false discoveries.<ref name = "Dang_2020">{{cite bioRxiv | vauthors = Dang T, Kishino H | title = Detecting significant components of microbiomes by random forest with forward variable selection and phylogenetics | date = January 2020 | biorxiv = 10.1101/2020.10.29.361360 }}</ref>

[[File:Metagenomics_ML.jpg |thumb|The implementation of machine learning approaches in metagenomics help us to obtain more information about the importance of the microbiome in different scenario{{Weasel inline|date=June 2021}}]]

Despite their importance, machine learning tools related to metagenomics have focused on the study of gut microbiota and the relationship with digestive diseases, such as [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), ''[[Clostridioides difficile]]'' infection (CDI), [[colorectal cancer]] and [[diabetes]], seeking better diagnosis and treatments.<ref name = "Lin_2021" /> Many algorithms were developed to classify microbial communities according to the health condition of the host, regardless of the type of sequence data, e.g. [[16S rRNA]] or [[whole-genome sequencing]] (WGS), using methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator classifier, [[random forest]], supervised classification model, and gradient boosted tree model. [[Neural networks]], such as [[recurrent neural network]]s (RNN), [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNN), and [[Hopfield neural network]]s have been added.<ref name = "Lin_2021" /> For example, in 2018, Fioravanti et al. developed an algorithm called Ph-CNN to classify data samples from healthy patients and patients with IBD symptoms (to distinguish healthy and sick patients) by using phylogenetic trees and convolutional neural networks.<ref name = "Fioravanti2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fioravanti D, Giarratano Y, Maggio V, Agostinelli C, Chierici M, Jurman G, Furlanello C | title = Phylogenetic convolutional neural networks in metagenomics | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 19 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 49 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29536822 | pmc = 5850953 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-018-2033-5 }}</ref>

In addition, [[random forest]] (RF) methods and implemented importance measures help in the identification of microbiome species that can be used to distinguish diseased and non-diseased samples. However, the performance of a decision tree and the diversity of decision trees in the ensemble significantly influence the performance of RF algorithms. The generalization error for RF measures how accurate the individual classifiers are and their interdependence. Therefore, the high dimensionality problems of microbiome datasets pose challenges. Effective approaches require many possible variable combinations, which exponentially increases the computational burden as the number of features increases.<ref name = "Dang_2020" />

For microbiome analysis in 2020 Dang & Kishino<ref name="Dang_2020" /> developed a novel analysis pipeline. The core of the pipeline is an RF classifier coupled with forwarding [[variable selection]] (RF-FVS), which selects a minimum-size core set of microbial species or functional signatures that maximize the predictive classifier performance. The framework combines:

* identifying a few significant features by a massively parallel forward [[variable selection]] procedure
* mapping the selected species on a [[phylogenetic tree]], and
* predicting functional profiles by functional gene enrichment analysis from metagenomic [[16S rRNA]] data.

They demonstrated performance by analyzing two published datasets from large-scale case-control studies:

* 16S rRNA gene amplicon data for ''C. difficile'' infection (CDI) and 
* shotgun metagenomics data for human colorectal cancer (CRC).

The proposed approach improved the accuracy from 81% to 99.01% for CDI and from 75.14% to 90.17% for CRC.

The use of machine learning in environmental samples has been less explored, maybe because of data complexity, especially from WGS. Some works show that it is possible to apply these tools in environmental samples. In 2021 Dhungel et al.,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dhungel E, Mreyoud Y, Gwak HJ, Rajeh A, Rho M, Ahn TH | title = MegaR: an interactive R package for rapid sample classification and phenotype prediction using metagenome profiles and machine learning | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 33461494 | pmc = 7814621 | doi = 10.1186/s12859-020-03933-4 }}</ref> designed an R package called MegaR. This package allows working with 16S rRNA and whole metagenomic sequences to make taxonomic profiles and classification models by machine learning models. MegaR includes a comfortable visualization environment to improve the user experience. Machine learning in environmental metagenomics can help to answer questions related to the interactions between microbial communities and ecosystems, e.g. the work of Xun et al., in 2021<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xun W, Liu Y, Li W, Ren Y, Xiong W, Xu Z, Zhang N, Miao Y, Shen Q, Zhang R | display-authors = 6 | title = Specialized metabolic functions of keystone taxa sustain soil microbiome stability | journal = Microbiome | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 35 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 33517892 | pmc = 7849160 | doi = 10.1186/s40168-020-00985-9 }}</ref> where the use of different machine learning methods offered insights on the relationship among the soil, microbiome biodiversity, and ecosystem stability.

=== Microarrays ===
[[Microarray]]s, a type of [[lab-on-a-chip]], are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid in analysis, and has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/>
[[File:DNA-microarray analysis.jpg|thumb|A DNA-microarray analysis of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which differences in gene expression patterns]]
This technology is especially useful for monitoring gene expression, aiding in diagnosing cancer by examining which genes are expressed.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pirooznia M, Yang JY, Yang MQ, Deng Y | title = A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 9 Suppl 1 | issue = 1 | pages = S13 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18366602 | pmc = 2386055 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-9-S1-S13 }}</ref> One of the main tasks is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, winnowing the large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification is challenging. Machine learning presents a potential solution as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are [[radial basis function network]]s, [[deep learning]], [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian classification]], [[decision tree]]s, and [[random forest]].<ref name=":4" />

=== Systems biology ===
Systems biology focuses on the study of emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system. Such components can include DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/2362/machine-learning-in-molecular-systems-biology|title=Machine Learning in Molecular Systems Biology|website=Frontiers|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>

Machine learning has been used to aid in modeling these interactions in domains such as genetic networks, signal transduction networks, and metabolic pathways.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> [[Graphical model|Probabilistic graphical models]], a machine learning technique for determining the relationship between different variables, are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> In addition, machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying [[DNA binding site|transcription factor binding sites]] using [[Markov chain|Markov chain optimization]].<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/> [[Genetic algorithm]]s, machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution, have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/>

Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction, high throughput microarray data analysis, analysis of genome-wide association studies to better understand markers of disease, protein function prediction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = d'Alché-Buc F, Wehenkel L | title = Machine learning in systems biology | journal = BMC Proceedings | volume = 2 Suppl 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S1 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19091048 | pmc = 2654969 | doi = 10.1186/1753-6561-2-S4-S1 }}</ref>

=== Evolution ===
This domain, particularly [[phylogenetic tree]] reconstruction, uses the features of machine learning techniques. Phylogenetic trees are schematic representations of the evolution of organisms. Initially, they were constructed using features such as morphological and metabolic features. Later, due to the availability of genome sequences, the construction of the phylogenetic tree algorithm used the concept based on genome comparison. With the help of optimization techniques, a comparison was done by means of multiple sequence alignment.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Bhattacharya M | veditors = Srinivasa MG, Siddesh GM, MAnisekhar SR |title=Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning Principles for Bioinformatics Techniques, Tools, and Applications |publisher=Springer Singapore |date=2020 |pages=164–188 |chapter= Unsupervised Techniques in Genomics |isbn=978-981-15-2445-5}}</ref>

=== Stroke diagnosis ===
Machine learning methods for the analysis of [[neuroimaging]] data are used to help diagnose [[stroke]].

Three-dimensional [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Support-vector machine|SVM]] methods are often used.<ref name="stroke2"/>

=== Text mining ===
The increase in biological publications increased the difficulty in searching and compiling relevant available information on a given topic. This task is known as [[knowledge extraction]]. It is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge.<ref name="Larrañaga2006"/><ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krallinger M, Erhardt RA, Valencia A | title = Text-mining approaches in molecular biology and biomedicine | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–45 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15808823 | doi = 10.1016/S1359-6446(05)03376-3 }}</ref> Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as [[natural language processing]] to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. [[Text Nailing]], an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.

This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals.<ref name=":5" /> Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to the automatic annotation of gene and protein function, determination of the [[Protein targeting|protein subcellular localization]], [[Gene expression|DNA-expression array]] analysis, large-scale [[List of protein interactions|protein interaction]] analysis, and molecule interaction analysis.<ref name=":5" />

Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data.<ref name="sing">{{cite book| vauthors = Pratas D, Hosseini M, Silva R, Pinho A, Ferreira P |title=Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis|chapter=Visualization of Distinct DNA Regions of the Modern Human Relatively to a Neanderthal Genome|journal=Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis.

By representing them in [[euclidean space]], BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion.<ref name="Kautsar_etal_2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kautsar SA, van der Hooft JJ, de Ridder D, Medema MH | title = BiG-SLiCE: A highly scalable tool maps the diversity of 1.2 million biosynthetic gene clusters | journal = GigaScience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | page = giaa154 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 33438731 | pmc = 7804863 | doi = 10.1093/gigascience/giaa154 }}</ref> from genomic and metagenomic data of diverse organisms.

[[File:BiG-SLiCE workflow.png|thumb|An overview of BiG-SLiCE's GCF analysis workflow]]

The BiG-SLiCE workflow starts at [[Vectorization (mathematics)|vectorization]] ([[feature extraction]]), converting input BGCs provided from dataset of cluster GenBank files from antiSMASH and MIBiG into vectors of numerical features based on the absence/presence and bitscores of hits obtained from querying BGC gene sequences from a library curated of profile [[Hidden Markov model|Hidden Markov Model]]<ref name="antiSMASH: rapid identification, an">{{cite journal | vauthors = Medema MH, Blin K, Cimermancic P, de Jager V, Zakrzewski P, Fischbach MA, Weber T, Takano E, Breitling R | display-authors = 6 | title = antiSMASH: rapid identification, annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genome sequences | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W339-46 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21672958 | pmc = 3125804 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr466 }}</ref>(pHMMs) of biosynthetic domains of BGCs. Those features are then processed by a super-linear clustering algorithm based on [[BIRCH]] clustering,<ref name="Variations on the Clustering Algori"/> resulting in [[centroid]] feature vectors representing the GCF models. All BGCs in the dataset are queried back against those models, outputting a list of GCF membership values for each BGC. Then a global cluster mapping is done using [[k-means]] to group all GCF centroid features in GCF bins. After that another round of membership assignment is performed to match the full set of BGC features into the resulting GCF bins. In the end, it produces archives, which then can be used to perform further analysis (via external scripts) or to visualize the result in a user-interactive application.

Satria et al.<ref name="Kautsar_etal_2021" /> demonstrated the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across [[taxonomy]] to identify the uncharted biosynthetic potential of 1.2 million biosynthetic gene clusters. This opens up new possibilities to accelerate [[natural product]] discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes are sequenced from understudied [[taxa]], more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry.<ref name="Kautsar_etal_2021" />

==== BiG-MAP ====
Since BGCs are an important source of metabolite production, current tools for identifying BGCs focus their efforts on mining genomes to identify their genomic landscape, neglecting relevant information about their abundance and expression levels which in fact, play an important ecological role in triggering phenotype dependent-metabolite concentration. That is why in 2020 BiG-MAP (Biosynthetic Gene cluster Meta’omics Abundance Profiler),<ref name="BiG-MAP: an automated pipeline to p"/> an automated pipeline that helps to determine the abundance (metagenomic data) and expression (metatranscriptomic data) of BGCs across microbial communities. It shotguns sequencing reads to gene clusters that have been predicted by antiSMASH or gutSMASH.

[[File:BiG-MAP.png|thumb|BiG-MAP workflow]]

BiG-MAP splits its workflow in four main modules.

* BiG-MAP.family: redundancy filtering on the gene cluster collection in order to reduce computing time and avoid ambiguous mapping. Using a [[MinHash]]-based algorithm, MASH,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ondov BD, Treangen TJ, Melsted P, Mallonee AB, Bergman NH, Koren S, Phillippy AM | title = Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 132 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27323842 | pmc = 4915045 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x }}</ref> BiG-MAP estimates distance among protein sequences which then is used to select a representative gene cluster with the aid of [[k-medoids]] clustering. Finally, the selected gene clusters are clustered into GCFs using BiG-SCAPE,<ref name="A computational framework to explor" /> considering account architectural similarity, thus relating more distantly related gene clusters which produce the same chemical product in different organisms
* BiG-MAP.download: optional module that uses a list of Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database; 
* BiG-MAP.map: reads the set of representative GCFs obtained from the first module. Maps reads to GCFs separately and, it reports combined abundance or expression levels per family. Reads are mapped to the representative of the GCFs using the short-read aligner Bowtie2,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langmead B, Salzberg SL | title = Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–9 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22388286 | pmc = 3322381 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1923 }}</ref> which are then converted into Reads Per Kilobase Million (RPKM) to be averaged over the GCFs size
* BiG-MAP.analyse: profiles abundance. RPKM values are normalized using Cumulative Sum Scaling<ref>{{cite web |title=CSS - Metagenomics |url=http://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/16s/norm/css |website=metagenomics.wiki}}</ref> (CSS) to account for sparsity. Differential expressions analyses use zero-inflated [[Gaussian distribution]] mixture models (ZIG-models) or [[Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance|Kruskal-Wallis]]. The pipeline displays the results s plots that show gene cluster abundance/expression (heatmaps), log fold change (bar plot), coverage values, and housekeeping gene expression values for metatranscriptomic data (heatmap).

=== Decodification of RiPPs chemical structures ===

The increase of experimentally characterized [[ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides]] (RiPPs), together with the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, selected from databases such as BAGEL, BACTIBASE, MIBIG, and THIOBASE, provide the opportunity to develop machine learning tools to decode the chemical structure and classify them.

In 2017, researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi, India, developed RiPPMiner<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal P, Khater S, Gupta M, Sain N, Mohanty D | title = RiPPMiner: a bioinformatics resource for deciphering chemical structures of RiPPs based on prediction of cleavage and cross-links | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = W1 | pages = W80–W88 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28499008 | pmc = 5570163 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx408 }}</ref> software, a bioinformatics resource for decoding RiPP chemical structures by genome mining. The RiPPMiner web server consists of a query interface and the RiPPDB database. RiPPMiner defines 12 subclasses of RiPPs, predicting the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross-link of the RiPP chemical structure.

==== Identification of RiPPs and prediction of RiPP Class ====
[[File:Diagrama del algoritmo de RiPPMiner.png|thumbnail|Diagram showing the operation of the RiPPMiner algorithm with respect to class prediction, clevage and cross-links.]]
RiPPs analysis tools such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM use HMM<ref name="antiSMASH: rapid identification, an"/> of modifying enzymes present in biosynthetic gene clusters in RiPP to predict the RiPP subclass. Unlike these tools, RiPPMiner uses a [[machine learning]] model, trained with 513 RiPPs, that uses the amino acid sequence of the RiPP gene uniquely to identify and subclass them. RiPPMiner differentiates RiPPs from other proteins and peptides using a [[support-vector machine]] model trained on 293 experimentally characterized RiPPs as a positive data set, and 8140 genomes encoded non-RiPPs polypeptides as negative data set. The negative data set included SWISSProt entries similar in length to RiPPs, e.g., 30s ribosomal proteins, matrix proteins, [[Cytochrome b|cytochrome B]] proteins, etc. The support vectors consist of amino acid composition and dipeptide frequencies.

Benchmarking on an independent dataset (not included in training) using a two-fold cross-validation approach indicated sensitivity, specificity, precision and MCC values of 0.93, 0.90, 0.90, and 0.85, respectively. This indicates the model's predictive power for distinguishing between RiPPs and non-RiPPs. For prediction of RiPP class or sub-class, a Multi-Class SVM was trained using the amino acid composition and dipeptide frequencies as feature vectors. During the training of the Multi-Class SVM, available RiPP precursor sequences belonging to a given class (e.g. lasso peptide) were used as a positive set, while RiPPs belonging to all other classes were used as negative set.

==== Prediction of cleavage site ====
[[File:Estructura química de lantipéptido por RiPPMiner.png|thumbnail|Chemical structure prediction by RiPPMiner.]]
Out of the four major RiPP classes that had more than 50 experimentally characterized RiPPs in RiPPDB, SVM models for prediction of cleavage sites were developed for lanthipeptides, cyanobactins, and lasso peptides. In order to develop SVM for prediction of cleavage site for lanthipeptides, 12 mer peptide sequences centered on the cleavage sites were extracted from a set of 115 lanthipeptide precursor sequences with known cleavage pattern. This resulted in a positive dataset of 103 unique 12 mer peptides harboring the cleavage site at the center, while the other 12 constituted the negative dataset. Feature vectors for each of these mers consisted of the concatenation of 20-dimensional vectors corresponding to each of the 20 amino acids. An SVM model for prediction of cleavage site was developed and benchmarked using 2-fold cross-validation, where half of the data were used in training and the other half in testing. SVM models were developed for the prediction of the cleavage sites in cyanobactin and lasso peptides. Based on analysis of the ROC curves, a suitable score cutoff was chosen for the prediction of cleavage sites in lanthipeptides and lasso peptides.

==== Prediction of cross-links ====
The algorithm for the prediction of cross-links and deciphering the complete chemical structure of RiPP has been implemented for lanthipeptides, lasso peptides, cyanobactins, and thiopeptides. The prediction of lanthionine linkages in lanthipeptides was carried out using machine learning. A dataset of 93 lanthipeptides whose chemical structures was known was taken from RiPPDB. For each lanthipeptide in this set, the sequence of the core peptide was scanned for strings or sub-sequences of the type Ser/Thr-(X)n-Cys or Cys-(X)n-Ser/Thr to enumerate all theoretically possible cyclization patterns. Out of these sequence strings, the strings corresponding to Ser/Thr-Cys or Cys-Ser/Thr pairs which were linked by lanthionine bridges were included in the positive set, while all other strings were included in the negative set.

=== Mass spectral similarity scoring ===

Many tandem mass spectrometry '''('''MS/MS''')''' based metabolomics studies, such as library matching and molecular networking, use spectral similarity as a proxy for structural similarity. Spec2vec<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huber F, Ridder L, Verhoeven S, Spaaks JH, Diblen F, Rogers S, van der Hooft JJ | title = Spec2Vec: Improved mass spectral similarity scoring through learning of structural relationships | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = e1008724 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33591968 | pmc = 7909622 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008724 | bibcode = 2021PLSCB..17E8724H }}</ref> algorithm provides a new way of spectral similarity score, based on [[Word2vec|Word2Vec]]. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data, in order to assess spectral similarities between molecules and to classify unknown molecules through these comparisons.

For systemic annotation, some metabolomics studies rely on fitting measured fragmentation mass spectra to library spectra or contrasting spectra via network analysis. Scoring functions are used to determine the similarity between pairs of fragment spectra as part of these processes. So far, no research has suggested scores that are significantly different from the commonly utilized [[Cosine similarity|cosine-based similarity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huber F, Ridder L, Verhoeven S, Spaaks JH, Diblen F, Rogers S, van der Hooft JJ | title = Spec2Vec: Improved mass spectral similarity scoring through learning of structural relationships | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = e1008724 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33591968 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008724 | pmc = 7909622 | bibcode = 2021PLSCB..17E8724H }}</ref>
