==About==
3D Slicer is a free open source software (BSD-style license) that is a flexible, modular platform for image analysis and visualization. 3D Slicer is extended to enable development of both interactive and [[batch processing]] tools for a variety of applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slicer.org/|title=3D Slicer|website=www.slicer.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>

3D Slicer provides [[image registration]], processing of [[Diffusion MRI|DTI (diffusion tractography)]], an interface to external devices for image guidance support, and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]-enabled [[volume rendering]], among other capabilities. 3D Slicer has a modular organization that allows the addition of new functionality and provides a number of generic features not available in competing tools.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The interactive visualization capabilities of 3D Slicer include the ability to display arbitrarily oriented image slices, build surface models from image labels, and hardware accelerated volume rendering.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} 3D Slicer also supports a rich set of annotation features ([[Fiduciary marker|fiducials]] and measurement widgets, customized color maps).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

Slicer started as a master’s [[thesis]] project between the Surgical Planning Laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hirayasu | first1 = Y | last2 = Shenton | first2 = ME | last3 = Salisbury | first3 = DF | last4 = Dickey | first4 = CC | last5 = Fischer | first5 = IA | last6 = Mazzoni | first6 = P | last7 = Kisler | first7 = T | last8 = Arakaki | first8 = H | last9 = Kwon | first9 = JS | last10 = Anderson | first10 = JE | last11 = Yurgelun-Todd | first11 = D | last12 = Tohen | first12 = M | last13 = McCarley | first13 = RW | title = Lower left temporal lobe MRI volumes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia compared with psychotic patients with first-episode affective disorder and normal subjects | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 155 | issue = 10 | pages = 1384–91 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9766770 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.155.10.1384 }}</ref> 3D Slicer version 2 has been downloaded several thousand times. In 2007 a completely revamped version 3 of Slicer was released. The next major refactoring of Slicer was initiated in 2009, which transitioned the [[GUI]] of Slicer from using KWWidgets to [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]. Qt-enabled Slicer version 4 was released in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fedorov|last2=Beichel|last3=Kalpathy-Cramer|last4=Finet|last5=Fillion-Robin|last6=Pujol|last7=Bauer|last8=Jennings|last9=Fennessy|last10=Sonka|last11=Buatti|last12=Aylward|last13=Miller|last14=Pieper|last15=Kikinis|title=3D Slicer as an image computing platform for the Quantitative Imaging Network|journal=Magnetic Resonance Imaging|volume=30|issue=9|pages=1323–41|year=2012|pmid=22770690|doi=10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001|pmc=3466397}}</ref>

Slicer software has enabled a variety of research [[Academic publishing|publications]], all aimed at improving image analysis.

This significant software project has been enabled by the participation of several large-scale [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] funded efforts, including the NA-MIC, NAC, [[Biomedical Informatics Research Network|BIRN]], CIMIT, Harvard Catalyst and NCIGT communities. The funding support comes from several federal funding sources, including [[National Center for Research Resources|NCRR]], [[National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering|NIBIB]], NIH Roadmap, [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]].

==Users==

Slicer's platform provides functionalities for segmentation, registration and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] visualization of [[multimodal distribution|multimodal]] image data, as well as advanced image analysis [[algorithms]] for [[diffusion tensor]] imaging, functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[image-guided radiation therapy]]. Standard [[image file formats]] are supported, and the application integrates interface capabilities to biomedical research software.

Slicer has been used in a variety of [[clinical research]]. In image-guided therapy research, Slicer is frequently used to construct and visualize collections of MRI data that are available pre- and intra-operatively to allow for the acquiring of spatial [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] for instrument tracking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hata | first1 = N | last2 = Piper | first2 = S | last3 = Jolesz | first3 = FA | last4 = Tempany | first4 = CM | last5 = Black | first5 = PM | last6 = Morikawa | first6 = S | last7 = Iseki | first7 = H | last8 = Hashizume | first8 = M | last9 = Kikinis | first9 = R  | title = Application of open source image guided therapy software in MR-guided therapies | journal = Medical Image Computing and Computer-assisted Intervention : MICCAI ...

In addition to producing 3D models from conventional MRI images, Slicer has also been used to present information derived from fMRI (using MRI to assess blood flow in the brain related to [[Nervous system|neural]] or [[spinal cord]] activity),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Archip | first1 = N | last2 = Clatz | first2 = O | last3 = Whalen | first3 = S | last4 = Kacher | first4 = D | last5 = Fedorov | first5 = A | last6 = Kot | first6 = A | last7 = Chrisochoides | first7 = N | last8 = Jolesz | first8 = F | last9 = Golby | first9 = A | last10 = Black | first10 = PM | last11 = Warfield | first11 = SK | title = Non-rigid alignment of pre-operative MRI, fMRI, and DT-MRI with intra-operative MRI for enhanced visualization and navigation in image-guided neurosurgery | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 609–24 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17289403 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.060 | pmc=3358788}}</ref> DTI (using MRI to measure the restricted diffusion of water in imaged tissue),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ziyan | first1 = U | last2 = Tuch | first2 = D | last3 = Westin | first3 = CF | title = Segmentation of thalamic nuclei from DTI using spectral clustering | journal = Medical Image Computing and Computer-assisted Intervention : MICCAI ...

The results of such analysis can be integrated with the results from analysis of [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic]] MRI, MR [[Angiography|angiograms]] and fMRI. Other uses of Slicer include [[paleontology]]<ref>http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/03/3d-slicer-tutorial-part-vi.html</ref> and neurosurgery planning.<ref>http://picasaweb.google.com/107065747472066371420</ref>

==Developers==

The Slicer Developer Orientation offers resources for developers new to the platform. Slicer development is coordinated on the slicer-devel mailing list, and a summary of development statistics is available on Ohloh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stef2cnrs.wordpress.com/category/marching-cubes/|title=marching cubes {{!}} biomedical optics|website=stef2cnrs.wordpress.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>

3D Slicer is built on [[VTK]], a pipeline-based graphical library that is widely used in scientific visualization and [[Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit|ITK]], a framework widely used for the development of [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]] and [[image registration]]. In version 4, the core application is implemented in [[C++]], and the API is available through a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] wrapper to facilitate rapid, iterative development and visualization in the included Python console. The user interface is implemented in Qt, and may be extended using either C++ or Python.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Detection and Quantification of Small Changes in MRI Volumes|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}</ref>

Slicer supports several types of modular development. Fully interactive, custom interfaces may be written in C++ or Python. Command-line programs in any language may be wrapped using a light-weight [[XML]] specification, from which a graphical interface is automatically generated.

For modules that are not distributed in the Slicer core application, a system is available to automatically build and distribute for selective download from within Slicer. This mechanism facilitates the incorporation of code with different license requirements from the permissive BSD-style license used for the Slicer core.

The Slicer build process utilizes [[CMake]] to automatically build prerequisite and optional libraries (excluding Qt). The core development cycle incorporates automatic testing, as well as incremental and nightly builds on all platforms, monitored using an online dashboard.
