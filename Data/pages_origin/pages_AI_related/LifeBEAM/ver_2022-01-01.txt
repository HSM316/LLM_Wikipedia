'''LifeBEAM''', founded in 2011, is an artificial-intelligence [[wearables]] technology company.<ref name="ZDNet" /><ref name="WSJ" />  The technology was originally developed for monitoring pilots, astronauts and special forces through sensors in their helmets. It was then expanded to consumer fitness products, including artificially intelligent wearables, such as Vi.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name="Shamah" />

==History==

The company was founded by air force former pilots, Omri Yoffe<ref name="ZDNet" /> and Zvika Orron,
<ref name="Bio" /> looking for a way to improve pilot monitoring during the physical challenges of flying.<ref name="ZDNet" /> Its first products tracked the heart rate and blood flow of air force pilots and astronauts, by embedding sensors in their helmets, as they pulled multiple [[G-Force|Gs]].<ref name="WSJ" /> Yoffe says the founders saw the need for the product because pilots sometimes died when they didn't have proper biometric data.<ref name="run" /> Optical head sensors were chosen to not interfere with pilot performance.<ref name="Bio" /> The Israeli Air Force helped test the technology.<ref name="AF" />

The U.S. Air Force and NASA have used the products.<ref name="ZDNet" />  The technology was adapted and licensed for wearables by [[Samsung]] and [[Under Armour]], among others,<ref name="VB" /> before introducing consumer products.<ref name="WSJ" />

The company has research and development centers in Los Angeles, Israel and Asia.<ref name="ZDNet" />

It raised $16 million in March, 2016, bringing its total investment to $19 million.<ref name="WSJ" /><ref name="VB" />

===Artificially intelligent wearables===

====Vi====

In June, 2016, the company released the prototype of Vi, a wearable [[artificial intelligence|AI]] earphone personal training device that combines voice instructions with bio-sensors.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/01/lifebeam-ai-coaching-headphones/|title=Smart headphones put an AI fitness coach in your ear|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/first-look-lifebeams-artificially-intelligent-headphones-for-that-her-like-workout/|title=First look: LifeBEAM’s artificially intelligent headphones offer a "Her" workout|last=Buhr|first=Sarah|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3077549/hardware/hands-on-with-vi-the-fitness-coach-in-your-ear.html|title=Hands-on with Vi, the fitness coach in your ear|website=Macworld|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/06/01/lifebeam-launches-kickstarter-for-a-i-personal-trainer-vi/|title=LifeBeam launches Kickstarter for AI personal trainer Vi|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> The voice-activated digital assistant is similar to Apple's [[Siri]] with the fitness tracking features of [[Fitbit]].<ref name=":0" /> The earbuds have sensors that track heart rate, heart rate variability and motion while running.

It also chooses [[Spotify]] or Apple Music tracks that match the beats per minute of the recommended pace.<ref name=":0" /> The product is scheduled for consumer release in December, 2016.<ref name=":0" />

A Kickstarter campaign for Vi ended in July 2016 with $1.68 million, making it the highest funded campaign to date for a wearable.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jose|first1=Prateek|title=Lifebeam Vi Wraps Kickstarter As The Most Well-Funded Fitness Wearable Ever|url=https://www.snapmunk.com/lifebeam-vi-becomes-most-well-funded-fitness-wearable-on-kickstarter/|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=Snapmunnk|date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

===Technology partnerships===

LifeBEAM technology is embedded in the Samsung Simband platform for smart watches, Samsung's competitive platform to the [[Apple Watch]]. LifeBEAM's algorithms are used in Simband sensors, measuring heart rate, calories and steps.<ref name="Times" /> The platform became available in late 2014.<ref name="Mashable" />

The technology powers the heart rate monitoring feature in Under Armour's Wireless Headphones,<ref name="FS" /> released at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] in January 2016.<ref name="CNET2" /> It also powers the 2XU Smart Hat, first reviewed in January 2016.<ref name="Shape" />

===Helmet===

In 2013, LifeBEAM used crowdsourced funding platform IndieGogo to fund a sensor-rich bicycle helmet. The helmet uses an optical sensor instead of an ECG chest strap to measure an athlete's heart rate.<ref name="Bio" /> The data collected from the optical sensor is transmitted to a mobile phone or device using [[Bluetooth]] or [[ANT+]] so that athletes can keep track of their heart rate in real time.<ref name="Bio" />

The LifeBEAM Smart Helmet has been reviewed in publications such as Gear Patrol,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Jeremy|title=LifeBeam Smart Helmet review |url=http://gearpatrol.com/2014/07/03/tested-lazer-lifebeam/|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Gear Patrol|date=3 July 2014}}</ref> Cycling Tips,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Matt|first1=de Neef|title=LifeBeam Smart Helmet review|url=http://cyclingtips.com/2015/01/lifebeam-smart-helmet-review/|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Cycling Tips|date=15 January 2015}}</ref> and Cycling Tech Review,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Whiten|first1=Simon|title=LifeBEAM Helmet Review|url=http://cycletechreview.com/2015/reviews/lifebeam-helmet-review/|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Cycle Tech Review|date=26 February 2016}}</ref> and Gear Junkie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCoy|first1=Sean|title=‘Smart’ Hat, Helmet Monitor Heart Rate|url=https://gearjunkie.com/lifebeam-hat-helmet-heart-rate-monitor|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Gear Junkie|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

The company further commercialized the product with the release of co-branded products with Lazer Helmets.<ref name="Ware" /> The first edition was released in May 2014 <ref name="bike1" /> and the second edition, the Lazer LifeBEAM 2.0, in December 2015.<ref name="bike2" />

===Sports cap===

The company offers a sports cap, the LifeBEAM Hat, released in November 2014, that provides biorhythm collection for runners by measuring heart rate, cadence and calories burned.<ref name="time" /><ref name="CNET" />

The LifeBEAM Hat has been reviewed in publications such as [[CNET]],<ref name="CNET" /> [[Time Magazine]]<ref name="time" /> and Tom's Guide.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palladino|first1=Valentina|title=LifeBEAM Smart Hat Takes Fitness Tracking Head-On|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lifebeam-fitness-tracker-hat,news-19859.html|accessdate=3 May 2016|publisher=Tom's Guide|date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

==Aerospace products==

LifeBEAM technology is integrated into a helmet for pilots developed by [[Elbit]] that measures blood flow (including oxygen saturation) across a pilot's forehead, warning of impending G-LOC or hypoxiam, and switching to auto-pilot if the pilot loses consciousness or goes into [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref name="iPost" />

The optical technology is integrated into Elbit's smart helmets for F-16 pilots, released in June 2015, measuring blood flow (perfusion), pulse rate, and SpO2. Algorithms integrate the pilot's physiology, aircraft physics (G-forces, velocity, altitude & positioning) and the pilot's head & body posture to sense life-threatening problems and notify the air and ground crew.<ref name="TT" />
