'''Spectacles''' are [[smartglasses]] dedicated to recording video for the [[Snapchat]] service. They feature a camera lens and are capable of recording short video segments and syncing with a smartphone to upload to the user's online account. They were developed and manufactured by [[Snap Inc.]], and announced on September 23, 2016. The smartglasses were released on November 10, 2016. They are made for Snap's [[Image sharing|image messaging]] and [[multimedia]] platform, [[Snapchat]], and were initially distributed exclusively through Snap's [[Pop-up retail|pop-up]] [[vending machine]], Snapbot. On February 20, 2017, Snap Spectacles became available for purchase online.<ref name="spectacles online">{{cite news |accessdate=February 20, 2017 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/finally-snap-snapchat-spectacles-are-sold-online/ |title=Finally!

On April 26, 2018, a second-generation of the Spectacles launched in 17 countries. This version included both software and hardware updates including water resistance functionality and increased storage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5254678/snapchat-spectacles-2-release/|title=Snapchat's New Spectacles Can Do One Important Thing the Old Version Couldn't|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/26/snapchat-new-spectacles-launch|title=Snapchat hopes for second time lucky with new Spectacles launch|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2018-04-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref>

On September 5, 2018, two improved second-generation Spectacles were released. The two new versions, dubbed Nico and Veronica, included major design changes that reflect more typical sunglasses styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spectacles.com|title=Spectacles by Snap Inc. • A new way to look.|website=www.spectacles.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref>

On August 13, 2019, Snap announced its Spectacles 3, which featured a new minimalistic frame and two cameras to replicate stereoscopic vision.

== History ==
In December 2014 [[Snap Inc.]], then Snapchat Inc., acquired Vergence Labs <ref name=BusinessInsiderUntoldStory /> the developers of the [[Epiphany Eyewear]] [[smartglasses]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-acquires-vergence-labs-2014-12|title=It Looks Like Snapchat Paid $15 Million To Buy A Google Glass-Like Startup|last1=Yarow|first1=Jay|date=16 December 2015|work=[[Business Insider]]|last2=Shontell|first2=Alyson|last3=Cook|first3=James|access-date=14 November 2016}}</ref> Vergence Labs was founded by entrepreneur [[Erick Miller]] in 2011 before Google Glass was announced. Miller worked on the idea as a graduate student at UCLA and poured his life savings into building the product.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/epiphany-glasses-2014-3|title=There's A Much Cooler, Cheaper Alternative To Google Glass That's Backed By Quora's Founder|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|date=12 March 2014|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=12 March 2014}}</ref> Snapchat was impressed with the [[Epiphany Eyewear]] product and the great team assembled by Miller, and acquired Vergence to develop a similar eyewear product.<ref name="TechnologyInATent">{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3lWFnJekYU|title=PITME "Technology in a Tent" Interview with Erick Miller & Peter Brook, Vergence Labs|date=2 August 2013|publisher=PITME|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="BusinessInsiderUntoldStory">{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/untold-story-vergence-labs-snapchat-acquired-spectacles-2016-11|title=How Snapchat secretly bought a struggling startup, then bet the future on it|last=Heath|first=Alex|date=23 November 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>

[[Epiphany Eyewear]] which recorded wide-angle point-of-view videos, had been positioned as Vergence's first step toward eventually building full featured augmented reality glasses which, according to Miller, would someday "give people what would previously be called superpowers".<ref name=TechnologyInATent />  However, due to Vergence's small engineering team (consisting of founder ceo [[Erick Miller]], co-founder Jon Rodriguez, software engineer Peter Brook, and designer / mechanical engineer David Meisenholder), the company had to scale back its ambitions in order to ship it's simpler first product, Epiphany Eyewear, which the team was able to successfully ship despite their extremely limited funding and team size.<ref name=BusinessInsiderUntoldStory />  The successful development and launch of their product led to the company being noticed by Snapchat, which quietly acquired them, bringing them in-house to develop a similar but much more refined eyewear product for Snapchat.

In October 2015, a leaked online video showed an early version of the new glasses, dubbed "Spectacles."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://elitedaily.com/social-news/snapchat-leaked-video-secret-new-glasses/1622044/|title=Snapchat's Leaked Video Shows Off Their Secret New Glasses|date=5 October 2015|newspaper=Elite Daily|language=en-US|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> In mid 2016, news outlets reported that Snapchat was hiring engineers from [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]] and [[Qualcomm]]. Reporters speculated that the hires were to build the new glasses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/03/11/snapchat-glasses-recent-hires-suggest-it-might-actually-happen/|title=Snapchat glasses?

In May 2017, a Snapchat patent became public which included an illustration of a hypothetical future version of Spectacles with augmented reality capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15559728/snapchat-augmented-reality-glasses-facade-database-patent|title=A Snapchat patent application would map the world in an augmented reality database|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>

In late 2017, Snapchat wrote off $40m worth of unsold Spectacles inventory and unused parts. As of May 2018, the company sold 220,000 pairs, which was less than initially expected.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2eccfb56-5da2-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04|title=Review: Snap's Spectacles 2.0|last=Bradshaw|first=Tim|date=May 23, 2018|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-08|url-access=subscription }}</ref> In April 2018, the company launched Spectacles 2.0, which included additional colors, lighter frames, the option of mirrored lenses, and the removal of the bright yellow ring around the camera window.<ref name=":1" />

In June 2018, Snap released an update for Spectacles allowing users to export videos from the glasses in square or widescreen format.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/snap-spectacles-users-now-have-new-formats-for-exporting-their-photos-and-videos/|title=Snap Spectacles Users Now Have New Formats For Exporting Their Photos and Videos|last=Cohen|first=David|date=22 June 2018|work=[[Adweek]]|access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref>

In November 2018, it was reported that the company would release a new version of Spectacles by year end 2018 that included two cameras.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/11/20/snap-spectacles-return/|title=Snap's Bringing Spectacles Back Despite Weak Sales of the Original|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> The Snap Spectacles 3, which did feature two HD cameras on-device, were ultimately announced in August 2019.<ref name=":3" />

The original version of the glasses included a camera lens with a 115° [[field of view]] (110° on V2){{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} and records in a circular format that adapts to a smartphone's screen size and orientation.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/24/13042640/snapchat-spectacles-how-to-use|title=Here's how Snapchat's new Spectacles will work|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=16 November 2016|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=16 November 2016|via=[[Vox Media]]}}</ref> The smartglasses record when the user presses a button on the top left of its frame, for a maximum of 30 seconds (in 10 second intervals).<ref name=":2" /> They sync with its designated smartphone via [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/23/snapchat-spectacles/|title=Snapchat to release $130 camera-equipped Spectacles this fall|last=Moon|first=Mariella|date=23 September 2016|work=[[Engadget]]|access-date=16 November 2016|via=[[AOL]]}}</ref> The camera also houses a ring of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights that indicates battery level and when they are recording.

[[File:The Spectacles circular video format.png|thumb|The Spectacles circular video format]]
Spectacles glasses capture video in a circular format, as shown in the thumbnail to the right.  Snap Inc claims this is to more closely approximate the field of view of the human eye.

The glasses are exclusive to Snap Inc's service, [[Snapchat]]. They are paired by looking at the user's account Snapcode and pressing the button on the glasses frame, as well as connecting to them via Bluetooth (for iOS devices).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-spectacles-how-to-pair-with-your-phone-2016-11/#now-that-youre-connected-youre-ready-to-start-shooting-video-happy-snapping-11|title=Here's how to pair Snapchat Spectacles with your phone|last=Hartmans|first=Avery|date=16 November 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.humavox.com/blog/wearable-month-snapchats-spectacles/|title=Wearable of the Month: Snapchat's Spectacles|date=29 September 2016|work=[[Humavox]]}}</ref> The videos taken on the glasses are stored internally within the camera and can be viewed and individually uploaded in the "Memories" section of Snapchat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-spectacles-glasses-review-2016-11|title=REVIEW: Snapchat's Spectacles live up to the hype, but have a ways to go|last=Hartmans|first=Avery|date=16 November 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref>
