A '''legal expert system''' is a domain-specific [[expert system]] that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to emulate the decision-making abilities of a human expert in the field of law.<ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems">{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Susskind|title=Expert Systems in Law: A Jurisprudential Approach to Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning|journal=Modern Law Review|year=1986|volume=49|issue=2|pages=168–194|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1986.tb01683.x|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{rp|172}} Legal expert systems employ a [[expert system#The rule base or knowledge base|rule base or knowledge base]] and an [[inference engine]] to accumulate, reference and produce expert knowledge on specific subjects within the legal domain.

== Purpose ==

It has been suggested that legal expert systems could help to manage the rapid expansion of legal information and decisions that began to intensify in the late 1960s.<ref name="Schweighofer, Legal Expert System">{{cite journal|last1=Schweighofer|first1=Erich|first2=Werner|last2 =Winiwarter |title=Legal Expert System KONTERM - Automatic Representation of Document Structure and Contents|journal=DDEXA '93 Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications|volume=720|year=1993|pages=486–497|citeseerx = 10.1.1.22.4751 |doi=10.1007/3-540-57234-1_49|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-57234-3}}</ref>   Many of the first legal expert systems were created in the 1970s<ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" />{{rp|179}}  and 1980s.<ref name="Berman and Hafner">{{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Donald H.|first2=Carole D.|last2 =Hafner |title=The Potential of Artificial Intelligence to Help Solve the Crisis in Our Legal System|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=1989|volume=32|issue=8|pages=928–938|doi=10.1145/65971.65972|s2cid=16311713}}</ref>{{rp|928}}

Lawyers were originally identified as primary target users of legal expert systems.<ref name="Thomasset and Paquin">{{cite journal|last1=Thomasset|first1=Claude|first2=Louis-Claude|last2=Paquin|title=Expert Systems in Law and the Representation of Legal Knowledge: Can we isolate it from the Why and the Who?|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress on: Logica, Informatica, Diritto: Legal Experts Systems|year=1989|volume=1|url=http://multimedia.uqam.ca/profs/lcp/CV/publi_pdf/Florence_89.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{rp|3}}   Potential motivations for this work included:

* speedier delivery of legal advice;
* reduced time spent in repetitive, labour intensive legal tasks;
* development of knowledge management techniques that were not dependent on staff;
* reduced overhead and labour costs and higher profitability for law firms; and
* reduced fees for clients.<ref name="Stevens and Barot">{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Charles|first2=Vishal|last2=Barot|first3=Jenny|last3=Carter|title=The Next Generation of Legal Expert Systems - New Dawn or False Dawn?|journal=SGAI Conference Proceedings|year=2010|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2086/4600/NextGenLegalES_version10_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf?sequence=2|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>{{rp|439}}

Some early development work was oriented toward the creation of automated judges.<ref name="Schafer ZombAI">{{cite journal|last=Schafer|first=Burkhard|title=ZombAIs: Legal Expert Systems as Representatives "Beyond the Grave"|journal=SCRIPTed|year=2010|volume=7|issue=2|url=https://script-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-2-Schafer.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>{{rp|386}}

Later work on legal expert systems has identified potential benefits to non-lawyers as a means to increase access to legal knowledge.<ref name="Thomasset and Paquin" />{{rp|4}}

Legal expert systems can also support administrative processes, facilitating decision making processes, [[Automation|automating]] rule-based analyses<ref name="Lodder and Zeleznikow">{{cite journal|last1=Lodder|first1=Arno|first2=John|last2=Zeleznikow |title=Developing an Online Dispute Resolution Environment: Dialogue Tools and Negotiation Support Systems in a Three-Step Model|journal=Harvard Negotiation Law Review|year=2005|volume=10|pages=293|ssrn=1008802}}</ref>  and exchanging information directly with citizen-users.<ref name="Svensson, Legal">{{cite book|last=Svensson|first=Jörgen S.|title=Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology|year=2005|publisher=Irma International|pages=1|url=http://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/14520/|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>

== Types ==

=== Architectural variations ===
[[Rule-based system|Rule-based]] expert systems rely on a model of [[deductive reasoning]] that utilizes "if A, then B" rules. In a rule-based legal expert system, information is represented in the form of deductive rules within the knowledge base.<ref name=Aikenhead>{{cite journal|last=Aikenhead|first=M.|title=Legal Knowledge-Based Systems: some observations on the future|journal=Web JCLI|year=1995|volume=2|url=http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles2/aiken2.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>

[[Case-based reasoning]] models, which store and manipulate examples or cases, hold the potential to emulate an [[analogical reasoning]] process thought to be well-suited for the legal domain.<ref name=Aikenhead /> This model effectively draws on known experiences our outcomes for similar problems.<ref name="Pal and Campbell">{{cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=Kamalendu|first2=John A.|last2=Campbell |title=An Application of Rule-Based and Case-Based Reasoning within a Single Legal Knowledge-Based System|journal=The DATA BASE for Advances in Information System|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4|pages=48–63|doi=10.1145/277339.277344|s2cid=907593}}</ref>{{rp|5}}

A [[neural net]] relies on a computer model that mimics that structure of a human brain, and operates in a very similar way to the case-based reasoning model.<ref name=Aikenhead />  This expert system model is capable of recognizing and classifying patterns within the realm of legal knowledge and dealing with imprecise inputs.<ref name="Main and Dillon">
{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Julie|title=in Soft Computing in Case Based Reasoning|year=2001|publisher=(Ltd)|location=London|chapter-url=http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csckshiu/pdf/shiu01scbrb2.pdf|first2=Sankar K.|last2=Pal | edition=4th|chapter=A Tutorial on Case-Based Reasoning|first3=Tharam|last3=Dillon|first4=Simon|last4=Shiu|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>{{rp|18}}

[[Fuzzy logic]] models attempt to create 'fuzzy' concepts or objects that can then be converted into quantitative terms or rules that are indexed and retrieved by the system.<ref name="Main and Dillon" />{{rp|18–19}} In the legal domain, fuzzy logic can be used for rule-based and case-based reasoning models.

=== Theoretical variations ===
While some legal expert system architects have adopted a very practical approach, employing scientific modes of reasoning within a given set of rules or cases, others have opted for a broader philosophical approach inspired by jurisprudential reasoning modes emanating from established legal theoreticians.<ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" /> {{rp|183}}

=== Functional variations ===
Some legal expert systems aim to arrive at a particular conclusion in law, while others are designed to predict a particular outcome. An example of a predictive system is one that predicts the outcome of judicial decisions, the value of a case, or the outcome of litigation.<ref name="Berman and Hafner" />{{rp|932}}

== Reception ==
Many forms of legal expert systems have become widely used and accepted by both the legal community and the users of legal services.<ref>Ambrogi, Robert. "Latest legal victory has LegalZoom poised for growth." ABA Journal. American Bar Association, 1 Aug. 2014. Web. 17 June 2017. <http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/latest_legal_victory_has_legalzoom_poised_for_growth>.</ref>

== Challenges ==

=== Domain-related problems ===
The inherent complexity of law as a discipline raises immediate challenges for legal expert system [[knowledge engineers]]. Legal matters often involve interrelated facts and issues, which further compound the complexity.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|4}}<ref name="Schafer ZombAI" />{{rp|386}}

Factual uncertainty may also arise when there are disputed versions of factual representations that must be input into an expert system to begin the reasoning process.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|4}}

=== Computerized problem solving ===
The limitations of most computerized problem solving techniques inhibit the success of many expert systems in the legal domain. Expert systems typically rely on deductive reasoning models that have difficulty according degrees of weight to certain principles of law or importance to previously decided cases that may or may not influence a decision in an immediate case or context.<ref name=Aikenhead />

=== Representation of legal knowledge ===
Expert legal knowledge can be difficult to represent or formalize within the structure of an expert system. For knowledge engineers, challenges include:
* [[Open texture]]: Law is rarely applied in an exact way to specific facts, and exact outcomes are rarely a certainty. Statutes may be interpreted according to different linguistic interpretations, reliance on precedent cases or other contextual factors including a particular judge's conception of fairness.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|4}}
* The balancing of reasons: Many arguments involve considerations or reasons that are not easily represented in a logical way. For instance, many constitutional legal issues are said to balance independently well-established considerations for state interests against individual rights.<ref name=Franklin>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=James|title='How much of commonsense and legal reasoning is formalizable? A review of conceptual obstacles|journal=Law, Probability and Risk|year=2012|pages=11–12|url=https://academic.oup.com/lpr/article-pdf/11/2-3/225/2713839/mgs007.pdf}}</ref>  Such balancing may draw on extra-legal considerations that would be difficult to represent logically in an expert system.
* Indeterminacy of legal reasoning: In the adversarial arena of law, it is common to have two strong arguments on a single point. Determining the 'right' answer may depend on a majority vote among expert judges, as in the case of an appeal.<ref name="Schafer ZombAI" />{{rp|386–387}}

=== Time and cost effectiveness ===
Creating a functioning expert system requires significant investments in [[software architecture]], [[Subject-matter expert|subject matter expertise]] and [[knowledge engineering]]. Faced with these challenges, many system architects restrict the domain in terms of subject matter and jurisdiction. The consequence of this approach is the creation of narrowly focused and geographically restricted legal expert systems that are difficult to justify on a cost-benefit basis.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|5}}

Current applications of AI in the legal field utilize machines to review documents, particularly when a high level of completeness and confidence in the quality of document analysis is depended upon, such as in instances of litigation and where due diligence play a role.<ref name=autogenerated1>Donahue L, A Primer on Using Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Profession https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/a-primer-on-using-artificial-intelligence-in-the-legal-profession.</ref> Among the numerically most quantifiable advantages of AI in the legal field are the time and money saving impact by freeing lawyers from having to spend inordinate amounts of their valuable time on routine tasks, aiding in setting free lawyers’ creative energy by reducing stress.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> This in turn increases the rate of case load reduction by accomplishing better results in less time, which unlocks potential additional revenue per unit of time spend on a case.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The cost of setting up and maintaining AI systems in law is more than offset by the attained savings through increased efficacy; unbalanced cost can be assigned to clients.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

=== Lack of correctness in results  or decisions ===
Legal expert systems may lead non-expert users to incorrect or inaccurate results and decisions. This problem could be compounded by the fact that users may rely heavily on the correctness or trustworthiness of results or decisions generated by these systems.<ref name="Groothuis and Svensson">{{cite conference

Thorne|title=Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1997|volume=90|issue=5}}</ref>{{rp|837}}

== Controversies ==
There may be a lack of consensus over what distinguishes a legal expert system from a [[knowledge-based system]] (also called an intelligent knowledge-based system). While legal expert systems are held to function at the level of a human legal expert, knowledge-based systems may depend on the ongoing assistance of a human expert.  True legal expert systems typically focus on a narrow domain of expertise as opposed to a wider and less specific domain as in the case of most knowledge-based systems.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|1}}

Legal expert systems represent potentially disruptive technologies for the traditional, bespoke delivery of legal services. Accordingly, established legal practitioners may consider them a threat to historical business practices.<ref name="Stevens and Barot" />{{rp|2}}

Arguments have been made that a failure to take into consideration various theoretical approaches to legal decision making will produce expert systems that fail to reflect the true nature of decision making.<ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" />{{rp|190}}  Meanwhile, some legal expert system architects contend that because many lawyers have proficient legal reasoning skills without a sound base in legal theory, the same should hold true for legal expert systems.<ref name=Popple />{{rp|pp.6–7}}

Because legal expert systems apply precision and scientific rigor to the act of legal decision-making, they may be seen as a challenge to the more disorganized and less precise dynamics of traditional jurisprudential modes of legal reasoning.<ref name=McCarty />{{rp|839}} Some commentators also contend that the true nature of legal practice does not necessarily depend on analyses of legal rules or principles; decisions are based instead on an expectation of what a human adjudicator would decide for a given case.<ref name="Berman and Hafner" />{{rp|930}}
