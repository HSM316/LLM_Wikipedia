'''Joint compatibility branch and bound''' (JCBB) is an [[algorithm]] in [[computer vision]] and [[robotics]] commonly used for [[data association]] in [[simultaneous localization and mapping]]. JCBB measures the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings and is hence known to robust<!--Known to robust?--> in complex environments.<ref name=Neira2001>{{citation
