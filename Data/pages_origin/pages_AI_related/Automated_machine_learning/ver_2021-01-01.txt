'''Automated machine learning''' ('''AutoML''') is the process of [[automation|automating]] the process of applying [[machine learning]] to real-world problems. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an [[artificial intelligence]]-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning.<ref name="autoweka1">{{cite conference|year=2013|title=Auto-WEKA: Combined Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization of Classification Algorithms|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487629|conference=KDD '13 Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining|pages=847–855|vauthors=Thornton C, Hutter F, Hoos HH, Leyton-Brown K}}</ref><ref name="AutoML2014ICML"/> The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring becoming an expert in the field first. 

Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models. 

== Comparison to the standard approach ==
In a typical machine learning application, practitioners have a set of input data points to train on. The raw data may not be in a form that all algorithms can be applied to it. To make the data amenable for machine learning, an expert may have to apply appropriate [[data pre-processing]], [[feature engineering]], [[feature extraction]], and [[feature selection]] methods. After these steps, practitioners must then perform [[algorithm selection]] and [[hyperparameter optimization]] to maximize the predictive performance of their model. All of these steps induce challenges, accumulating to a significant hurdle to get started with machine learning.

AutoML dramatically simplifies these steps for non-experts.

==Targets of automation==
Automated machine learning can target various stages of the machine learning process.<ref name="AutoML2014ICML">{{Cite web|title=AutoML 2014 @ ICML|vauthors=Hutter F, Caruana R, Bardenet R, Bilenko M, Guyon I, Kegl B, and Larochelle H|work=AutoML 2014 Workshop @ ICML|access-date=2018-03-28|url=http://icml2014.automl.org}}</ref>  Steps to automate are:
*[[Data preparation]] and ingestion (from raw data and miscellaneous formats)
** Column [[Statistical data type|type]] detection; e.g., boolean, discrete numerical, continuous numerical, or text
** Column intent detection; e.g., target/label, [[Stratified sampling|stratification]] field, numerical feature, categorical text feature, or free text feature
** Task detection; e.g., [[binary classification]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], or [[learning to rank|ranking]]
*[[Feature engineering]]
**[[Feature selection]]
** [[Feature extraction]]
** [[Meta learning (computer science)|Meta learning]] and [[transfer learning]]
** Detection and handling of skewed data and/or missing values
*[[Model selection]]
* [[Hyperparameter optimization|Hyperparameter Optimization]] of the learning algorithm and featurization
* Pipeline selection under time, memory, and complexity constraints
* Selection of evaluation metrics and validation procedures
* Problem checking
** [[Leakage (machine learning)|Leakage]] detection
** Misconfiguration detection
* Analysis of results obtained
* User interfaces and visualizations for automated machine learning
