'''Automated machine learning''' ('''AutoML''') is the process of [[automation|automating]] the tasks of applying [[machine learning]] to real-world problems. AutoML potentially includes every stage from beginning with a raw dataset to building a machine learning model ready for deployment. AutoML was proposed as an [[artificial intelligence]]-based solution to the growing challenge of applying machine learning.<ref name="autoweka1">{{cite conference|year=2013|title=Auto-WEKA: Combined Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization of Classification Algorithms|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487629|conference=KDD '13 Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining|pages=847–855|vauthors=Thornton C, Hutter F, Hoos HH, Leyton-Brown K}}</ref><ref name="AutoML2014ICML"/> The high degree of automation in AutoML aims to allow non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning. Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}. Common techniques used in AutoML include [[hyperparameter optimization]], [[meta-learning (computer science)|meta-learning]] and [[neural architecture search]].

== Comparison to the standard approach ==
In a typical machine learning application, practitioners have a set of input data points to be used for training. The raw data may not be in a form that all algorithms can be applied to. To make the data amenable for machine learning, an expert may have to apply appropriate [[data pre-processing]], [[feature engineering]], [[feature extraction]], and [[feature selection]] methods. After these steps, practitioners must then perform [[algorithm selection]] and [[hyperparameter optimization]] to maximize the predictive performance of their model. If deep learning is used, the architecture of the neural network must also be chosen by the machine learning expert. 

Each of these steps may be challenging, resulting in significant hurdles to using machine learning. AutoML aims to simplify these steps for non-experts, and to make it easier for them to use machine learning techniques correctly and effectively.

AutoML plays an important role within the broader approach of automating [[data science]], which also includes challenging tasks such as data engineering, data exploration and model interpretation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Bie |first1=Tijl |last2=De Raedt |first2=Luc |last3=Hernández-Orallo |first3=José |last4=Hoos |first4=Holger H. |last5=Smyth |first5=Padhraic |last6=Williams |first6=Christopher K.

==Targets of automation==
Automated machine learning can target various stages of the machine learning process.<ref name="AutoML2014ICML">{{Cite web|title=AutoML 2014 @ ICML|vauthors=Hutter F, Caruana R, Bardenet R, Bilenko M, Guyon I, Kegl B, and Larochelle H|work=AutoML 2014 Workshop @ ICML|access-date=2018-03-28|url=http://icml2014.automl.org}}</ref>  Steps to automate are:
* [[Data preparation]] and ingestion (from raw data and miscellaneous formats)
** Column [[Statistical data type|type]] detection; e.g., boolean, discrete numerical, continuous numerical, or text
** Column intent detection; e.g., target/label, [[Stratified sampling|stratification]] field, numerical feature, categorical text feature, or free text feature
** Task detection; e.g., [[binary classification]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], or [[learning to rank|ranking]]
* [[Feature engineering]]
** [[Feature selection]]
** [[Feature extraction]]
** [[Meta-learning (computer science)|Meta-learning]] and [[transfer learning]]
** Detection and handling of skewed data and/or missing values
* [[Model selection]] - choosing which machine learning algorithm to use, often including multiple competing software implementations
* [[Ensemble learning|Ensembling]] - a form of consensus where using multiple models often gives better results than any single model<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Erickson|first1=Nick|last2=Mueller|first2=Jonas|last3=Shirkov|first3=Alexander|last4=Zhang|first4=Hang|last5=Larroy|first5=Pedro|last6=Li|first6=Mu|last7=Smola|first7=Alexander|date=2020-03-13|title=AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data|class=stat.ML|eprint=2003.06505}}</ref>
* [[Hyperparameter optimization]] of the learning algorithm and featurization
* Pipeline selection under time, memory, and complexity constraints
* Selection of evaluation metrics and validation procedures
* Problem checking
** [[Leakage (machine learning)|Leakage]] detection
** Misconfiguration detection
* Analysis of obtained results 
* Creating user interfaces and visualizations
