'''''Magpasikat''''' ({{literal translation|Show-Off}}) is the annual [[talent competition]] segment of the [[Philippine television]] [[variety show]] ''[[It's Showtime (Philippine TV program)|It's Showtime]]'', where the [[List of It's Showtime cast members|hosts and other cast members]] compete against each other. A week-long anniversary special, it is usually held either a week before the show's anniversary date, October 24, or during the week itself (although the 2021 to 2023 editions were held in November).<ref name=first11>{{Cite web|date=November 26, 2021|title=Look back on the spectacular, awe-inspiring Magpasikat performances through the years!|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/itsshowtime/articles-news/look-back-on-the-spectacular-awe-inspiring-magpasikat-performances-through-the-years-16189|access-date=August 31, 2023|website=ABS-CBN Entertainment|language=en}}</ref>

The duo [[Jugs Jugueta]] and [[Teddy Corpuz]] hold the most number of ''Magpasikat'' wins with six, followed by [[Karylle]] with five wins, and [[Jhong Hilario]] and [[Kim Chiu]] with four wins.<ref name=first13wins>{{Cite web|date=November 11, 2023|title=Winning Magpasikat entries that amused, moved, and inspired us through the years|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/itsshowtime/articles-news/winning-magpasikat-entries-that-amused-moved-and-inspired-us-through-the-years-21011|access-date=November 13, 2023|website=[[ABS-CBN Entertainment]]|language=en}}</ref>

== Background ==
''Magpasikat'' was first held on October 23, 2010, as an anniversary special. Since then, it has become a week-long annual tradition. However, the 2020 and 2021 editions were held in one day due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name="Mag2020">{{Cite web|date=October 26, 2020|title=Magpasikat 2020: 'Showtime' marking 11th year with these performances|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/10/27/20/magpasikat-2020-showtime-marking-11th-year-with-these-performances|access-date=November 22, 2020|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en}}</ref>

''Magpasikat'' was also the name of a placeholder show that replaced ''Showtime'' in January 2010, when the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] suspended the latter due to an errant remark made by guest judge [[Rosanna Roces]] towards teachers. The show had the same format as Showtime, except for the competing groups being composed of celebrities, and only aired for a few days until the suspension was blocked following a temporary restraining order.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/24361/MTRCB-suspends--Showtime--for-20-days-for-Rosanna-Roces's-statements-against-teachers|last=Santiago|first=Erwin|title=MTRCB suspends ''Showtime'' for 20 days for Rosanna Roces's statements against teachers|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|date=January 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=January 14, 2010|title=After 'Showtime,' MTRCB now mulls suspension of 'Magpasikat'|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/14/10/after-showtime-mtrcb-now-mulls-suspension-magpasikat|access-date=November 13, 2023|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en}}</ref>

== Format ==
Except on certain occasions, the [[List of It's Showtime cast members|''It's Showtime'' cast members and staff]] are usually divided into five teams by drawing lots. The same method is also used to decide the order of performances. The first team would perform on Monday, the second team on Tuesday, and so on until Friday, with the results being announced by the voice of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother|Big Brother]]'', panel of judges or the [[ABS-CBN]] [[chief operating officer|COO]] for broadcast [[Cory Vidanes]] on Saturday. The performances are evaluated by a special panel of ''hurados'' (judges). The team with the highest average score will receive the highest cash prize for their chosen beneficiary. The second- to fifth-placing teams will also receive consolation prizes.<ref name=first11/><ref name=first13wins/>

! Team Anne-Tyang Amy<br><small>with ''BidaMan''<br>(October 22, Tuesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Anne Curtis and Amy Perez's performance was an ode to ''It’s Showtime''’s tumultuous success in the past decade, as it represents their journey as a blossoming variety show, the challenges and setbacks they went through, how they stood up and moved on together from their downfalls, and being stronger than ever as they mark the newest chapter of their lives personally and professionally together, just like a tree. It opened with Tyang Amy, who was wearing a glittery brown body suit depicting roots, amazingly showing off her acrobatic skills, including a difficult headstand, while the children’s choir were singing [[The Chainsmokers]] and [[Coldplay]]’s "[[Something Just Like This]]". Next, the ''BidaMan'' finalists danced to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]’s "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]" half-naked. A few of them performed stunts when they stuck themselves onto the large metal scaffold while it was being flipped by the other ''BidaMan'' members. Curtis then astounded the audience as she seamlessly did death-defying [[wheel gymnastics]] alongside ''BidaMan'' grand winner [[Jin Macapagal]] and a professional Australian gymnast. Their performance ended with Anne sitting inside a spinning spherical framework while belting out “[[Forever Young (Alphaville song)|Forever Young]]”, with Tyang Amy and other team members hanging beneath it, as it was being lifted.

! Team Karylle-Ryan<br><small>with ''TNT'' singers<br>(October 23, Wednesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Karylle and Ryan Bang, along with the ''[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]'' singers, gave a futuristic musical presentation that incorporates a mix of various music genres, from theatrical and ballad to pop and rap. It commenced with a narration of Bang's “sob story”, from being “friend-zoned” by his celebrity crushes and being brokenhearted numerous times to his yearning to be with his dad again—via a short [[K-drama]]-inspired video. A short skit by Karylle and Bang ensued, wherein the former talked about their love-hate relationship as friends by belting out her original composition for him. The audience is then visually transported into a 2029 Korean adaptation of ''It's Showtime'', where the ''Tawag ng Tanghalan'' alumni, joined by Korean dancer [[Dasuri Choi]], perform hit [[K-pop]] songs including [[Blackpink]]'s "[[Kill This Love (song)|Kill This Love]]" and "[[Ddu-Du Ddu-Du]]", and [[BTS]]' "[[Boy with Luv]]". Bang's shining moment came when he emerged to the stage dressed like a true [[K-pop idol]] and danced to BTS’ "[[Idol (BTS song)|Idol]]". He then delivered a speech in Korean and gave a Tagalog rap performance that narrated his unforgettable experiences in the Philippines. Team Karylle-Ryan's number concluded with the inspiring original composition "Pabuhat".

! Team Jhong-Jugs-Teddy<br><small>with Jackie, Ion, and Sanrio<br>(October 24, Thursday)</small>
| align="justify" | Jhong Hilario, Jugs Jugueta, and Teddy Corpuz's team took a trip down memory lane through their impressive and colorful throwback-themed production number. Their presentation paid tribute to the '80s era through the concept, costumes, props, and acts they incorporated into it and also brought back some of the fondest moments they shared on the noontime program. The performance started with a pre-recorded comedy skit that introduced a live performance on-stage titled “80’s Showtime”, wherein everything they uttered and sang sounded gibberish, reminiscent of their 2014 ''Magpasikat'' performance with Karylle. Hilario, along with Sanrio, Ion, and Jackie, were the performers of this ''Kaloka-like''-inspired segment as they impersonated '80s icons [[Michael Jackson]], [[Boy George]], [[Randy Santiago]], and [[Madonna]], respectively. This was followed by a live continuation of the comedy skit with former ''It's Showtime'' cast members dressed as popular '80s figures: Kim Atienza (as "[[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]"), Eric “Eruption” Tai (as [[Hulk Hogan]]), Billy Crawford (as [[Gabby Concepcion]]), and Coleen Garcia (as [[Sharon Cuneta]]). Then after, the reversed version of their bewildering opening number was then played on screen, showing that they actually were performing the hits of the aforementioned music icons. The group concluded their set by performing their rework on ''It’s Showtime''’s theme song and a mash-up of some of the '80s hits with surprise appearances by actress [[Carmi Martin]] and Randy Santiago.

! Team Vhong-Mariel<br><small>with Hashtags<br>(October 25, Friday)</small>
| align="justify" | Vhong Navarro, Mariel Rodriguez-Padilla, and the Hashtags brought the audience to the future with an astonishing and heart-fluttering production number. It showcased truly remarkable futuristic exhibitions that signified how technology had tremendously improved 30 years from now and enabled them to provide a post-modern way to spread happiness through “mandroids”, or humanoid robots. Rodriguez-Padilla played the leader of these "mandroids", who then introduced Mandroid VN-01, played by Navarro. A memorable part of the production number was when VN-01 "transformed" into a human who tried to entertain his ''It’s Showtime'' family, who were imagined to be in their senior years at that time. This was followed by a series of dance performances by Navarro, the Hashtags, Dawn Chang, and [[Pilipinas Got Talent (season 5)|Pilipinas Got Talent Season 5]] champion [[Power Duo]]. A pre-recorded video of an "elderly" Vhong was flashed on screen, delivering a poignant message to his ''It’s Showtime'' family as a life-size projected image of each cast member of the program appeared. The showcase ended when their older counterparts and the other members of the ensemble enclosed Navarro in a huge group hug that formed a heart.

The theme of self-love further took center stage as Vice spun in the air and belted out [[Lady Gaga]]’s "[[Hair (Lady Gaga song)|Hair]]". The performance showcased his inspirational "hair story", which aimed to share his foremost advocacy of supporting people who have [[alopecia areata]] and of imparting self-love towards everyone who has the said condition or is struggling to embrace their true selves. The visually captivating performance also featured Miss Q & A queens and veteran actress [[Dawn Zulueta]], who further brightened up the grandiose production consisting of aerial stunts, visual effects, and the special participation of alopecia patients.

! Team Karylle-Jhong-Ion
| align="justify" | Karylle, Jhong Hilario, and Ion Perez's production number showed how strong and resourceful Filipinos are when faced with challenges and problems in life. It showed how livelihoods were affected because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]], while still exhibiting the undying resilience of Filipinos. With the help of child stars [[List of It's Showtime cast members|Aaron “Yorme” Sunga]] and Scarlet Snow Belo in an introductory [[online class]] skit, their team gave a glimpse of the colorful culture as they depicted the lives of ordinary Filipinos: Mang Jhong, a cheerful [[jeepney]] driver; Aling Karylle, a talented [[Balut (food)|balut]] vendor; and Mang Ion, a romantic ice cream vendor. In a festive production number, Mang Jhong and Mang Ion danced to "Beep, Beep" and "Mamang Sorbetero", respectively, while Aling Karylle sang "Balut, Penoy". They also incorporated Filipino folk dances like [[cariñosa]], [[maglalatik]], and [[tinikling]] into their number. The mood then shifted to gloom as a montage of pandemic-related news flashed on the screens. The characters lamented on how the current situation has terribly affected them, but at the same time, they exhibited the undying resilience of us Filipinos, who are not only able to find something to still be happy about during these trying times, but are also able to find other ways to provide for their families. During the soliloquies, Alex Calleja, [[Vice Ganda]], and [[Mahal (actress)|Mahal]] had voice cameos as the jeepney, the ice cream cart, and a hatched duckling, respectively. [[KaladKaren]] then made a special appearance as the host of the fictional program "May Paraan", presenting how the three characters stood up from being toppled down by the pandemic and used their skills and resources in order to move forward in life. The presentation ended with an inspiring performance of the original composition "Aahon". [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]] also made a surprise appearance in a closing skit as the teacher of Scarlet and Yorme.

! Team Jugs-Teddy-Ryan
| align="justify" | Jugs Jugueta, Teddy Corpuz, and Ryan Bang imparted a very moving message that even though this pandemic has caused live performances to temporarily halt, music will never stop. They gave an epic concert treat as they mounted a "[[Battle of the Bands]]"-themed number dubbed "Project 11: Tuloy Ang Tugtugan". However, instead of having their respective bands on the show, the trio had themselves as bandmates by projecting pre-recorded videos of them in various appearances as they took on the different positions in a band. [[Anne Curtis]] made a special appearance as the emcee in a series of pre-recorded videos, introducing each band. The first to perform was "School of Jugs", who performed [[The Itchyworms]]’ "Gusto Ko Lamang Sa Buhay", followed by "Teddy University", who played [[Rocksteddy]]’s "Superhero" and the "Ryan Band" who amused with the song "Abang-abang". They then rocked the stage as they moved on to the epic band showdown, wherein the three of them sang an uplifting yet headbanging original composition along with pre-recorded appearances from Curtis and various music artists: [[Apl.de.ap]] of [[Black Eyed Peas]], Andrea Manzano of [[This Band (band)|This Band]], [[I Belong to the Zoo]], Zel Bautista of [[December Avenue (band)|December Avenue]], Jeff Bolivar of Soapdish, [[Kitchie Nadal]], [[Ebe Dancel]], and [[Raymund Marasigan]]. In the middle of the performance, Bang also played the flute.

The performance commenced with the trio continuously walking along a consistently changing backdrop while wearing [[personal protective equipment]]. They then introduced themselves one-by-one as the three inspiring teachers who showed admirable passion not just in their profession but towards their students as well. First was Vhong, who depicted Teacher Velcher Castillo, a high school teacher from Isabela who's known for giving away crayons to his students after receiving a heartbreaking note from one of them. Next was Jackie, who portrayed Teacher Iam, the dedicated pre-school teacher who's doing her best to conquer the challenges of this pandemic. And lastly, Tyang Amy, who pierced our hearts as Teacher Lovely, the teacher who does not only have to face the challenges of [[distance learning]], but also provide for the needs of her ill child. After rending our hearts with those true-to-life stories, the three emerged on the stage wearing shirts with "Sti11 2gether A2Z" emblazoned on them and performed a dance number. Several teachers from different parts of the country joined them virtually as pre-recorded videos of them dancing were shown

As Vice and his alter-ego Viceral pierced our souls with their rendition of [[Linkin Park]]’s "[[In the End]]" and [[Madonna]]’s "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", Kim, who was wearing an embellished cream dress, was seen dancing with full emotions on a huge sandbox. Cladded in a glittery all-black ensemble with a studded mesh face cover and long train with the word "grief" emblazoned on it, the former surely was the representation of negative emotions. On the next gap, Kim was seen dancing in a seemingly confined space, while Vice was singing the slowed-down version of [[Kylie Minogue]]’s "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]". She then went on to throw red paint on the transparent film. As they went inside two separate boxes, a pre-taped video of them separately submerged in the water flashed on the screen, signifying their reawakening. The two stepped out of their box with a costume change to white ensembles, representing renewed hope. The performance ended with Vice belting out [[Lady Gaga]]’s "[[Million Reasons]]" as Kim and the other dancers finished their interpretative dance.

! Team Karylle-Amy-Kim
| align="justify" | Karylle, Amy Perez, and Kim Chiu's team lit up the stage in gold to celebrate women in their performance. Their empowering presentation commenced with a montage of Pinays who made their marks in the field of sports – namely, first-ever Olympic gold medalist [[Hidilyn Diaz]], [[Nesthy Petecio]], [[Bong Coo]], [[Elma Muros-Posadas]], [[Mikee Cojuangco-Jaworski]], and [[Dyan Castillejo]] – featuring some of their victorious moments and their inspiring messages not only to the athletes like them, but also to all Filipino women. Female athletes were seen doing their routines on the stage where the huge letter standees that spelled “G-I-N-T” and a huge metal ring adjacent to it were erected. Tyang Amy entered and danced while on the ring as the tune of [[Rivermaya]]’s "Liwanag Sa Dilim" blared, while Kim astounded us with her dance interpretation of [[SB19]]’s "[[Go Up]]" along with other dancers. [[Anne Curtis]] also provided guest voice-over before Kim took the stage. Karylle then emerged to the stage in an immaculate white gown with cape as she sang her self-composed song titled "Kababaihan", which aims to pay homage to women athletes and show their support to them and all Pinays. As her performance approaches its end, her gown literally glowed into different colors, which resembled fireworks. After girl group [[4th Impact]] performed [[Sarah Geronimo]]’s "Tayo", Kim and Amy went back onstage to dance again, with Kim showcasing her skills in playing the drums, which also ended their performance.

! Team Vhong-Ogie
| align="justify" | Vhong Navarro and Ogie Alcasid impressed viewers with their [[Squid Game]]-inspired performance showcasing the importance of [[traditional Filipino games]] weaved into songs and dances. The performance commenced with a skit wherein they both played dual roles – Ogie as the mother and the son, while Vhong was the father and the other son. As they refused to listen to their parents’, their gadgets suddenly malfunctioned and their setup shook, and they were transported to a game field by a then-anonymous gamemaster, who told them, “kaka-computer n’yo ‘yan!” The [[gamemaster]] welcomed them to “SKID Games”, wherein they had to play a series of Pinoy street games and they were divided into two teams: Team Bibo headed by Vhong and Team Perfect by Ogie. Team Bibo was the first one to play, with Vhong and his Street Boys co-members playing [[Piko (Filipino game)|piko]] projected on the floor as they danced to [[Gary Valenciano]]’s "Awit at Laro". Team Perfect, on the other hand, was assigned to play [[hide-and-seek]], wherein he and his teammates [[Lara Maigue]], [[Jeremy Glinoga]], and ''[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]'' alumni [[Reiven Umali]] and [[Sam Mangubat]], as well as their surprise guest [[Regine Velasquez|Regine Velasquez-Alcasid]], sang a parody version of [[Moira Dela Torre]]’s "Tagu-taguan" as they moved around the makeshift walls. Both teams were then seen having fun playing “[[patintero]]” at the [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] rooftop, which was succeeded by the performance of [[El Gamma Penumbra]] as the gamemaster explained how playing games is parallel to life. [[Ebe Dancel]] surprisingly emerged onstage singing "Lipad" as Vhong and Ogie were seen floating mid-air while hanging on their respective kites. In the end, it was revealed that the game master was [[Jhong Hilario]], who, along with the “parents” reminded everyone, particularly the younger generations, how important it is to keep these street games alive amid the continuous changing times.

! Team Jugs-Teddy-Ion
| align="justify" | Jugs Jugueta, Teddy Corpuz, and Ion Perez turned their performance into a ''Madlang Pi-Poll'' segment, letting the audience decide what they would do. They created a short action-comedy film and sought the help of the madlang people as their characters went on odd and ridiculous adventures. And they're able to successfully do it the interactive way, just like how it's done in said ''It’s Showtime'' segment. As they perplexedly searched for their stolen eggs and birds, gamemaster [[Joey Marquez]], who they called "Tsong-Its", he dared them to take on various challenges by having to choose between two options with the help of the judges, hosts, and the virtual audiences. Their adventure started upon agreeing to pick and take the red ball. From wearing casual clothes in their opening skit, they channeled [[The Matrix]] as they were cladded in all-black ensembles and entered the stage while riding on a hoverboard, scooter, and motorcycle. They then had to submerge themselves in mud to regain the red egg and fight the wicked goons to get their green egg. The trio also had to sustain gunshots and overcome their fear of snake in order to take back their blue egg. After triumphantly retrieving their missing eggs, they performed the [[Parokya ni Edgar]] song "[[Don't Touch My Birdie]]" as online personalities Pamela Kaye and Glenn Krishnan, with ''It’s Showtime'' dancer Neri Lopera, emerged on the stage wearing angel wings and handed them one chicken each.

! Team Vice-Ryan-Jackie
| align="justify" | Vice Ganda, Ryan Bang, and Jackie Gonzaga reminded viewers to spend time with their loved ones and gave some of them who lost loved ones a chance to say goodbye. At the onset, Ryan and Jackie were seen arguing regarding their supposed rehearsal for their number. Vice Ganda stopped them and told them that they should exert their best in everything they do in order to also deliver a great performance to the viewers. Ryan and Jackie went on to groove to [[A-ha]]’s "[[Take On Me]]", with popular online personalities Pipay and Whamos taking turns with them as they go in and out of the makeshift wall with doors and windows they used as a backdrop. Vice then had entertained with his standup comedy opposite an [[XB Gensan]] member, and sang a duet version of "Take On Me" with [[Darren Espanto]]. [[YouTuber|Youtuber]] [[Ivana Alawi]] then made a surprise appearance as she played Vice's counterpart. The mood eventually shifted to solemn and gloom in the second part of their skit, wherein Jackie and Ryan were both able to showcase their dramatic chops, hinting that something bad happened to Vice. Jackie quickly went out of the studio and rushed to another to impress with an emotive interpretative dance to [[Fra Lippo Lippi (band)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]’s "Beauty and Madness" that made use of special effects. Singer [[Kyla (Filipino singer)|Kyla]] then emerged onstage singing [[Josh Groban]]’s "[[To Where You Are]]", while Ryan exhibited his skills in playing the piano. Vice Ganda, through a voice-over, revealed the theme of their performance, giving the audience time to grieve for lost loved ones amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines|health crisis]]. This was followed by Vice Ganda’s soulful rendition of [[Charlie Puth]] and [[Wiz Khalifa]]’s "[[See You Again]]" along with Tatalon Choir on the rooftop of ABS-CBN. A montage of several people was also shown as they wrote their farewell messages to their dearly departed family members and relatives on white balloons, which they eventually released to the skies as they surrounded Vice while he was singing.

=== ''Magpasikat'' 2022 ===
The thirteenth edition of ''Magpasikat'', subtitled ''"TRESElebrate"'', was held during the week commencing November 14, 2022. This year marked the return of the traditional week-long celebration, after the two previous editions were only held for a day due to the restrictions caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

! Team Anne-Jackie-Ion<br><small>(November 14, Monday)</small>
| align="justify" | Anne Curtis, Jackie Gonzaga, and Ion Perez delivered a truly heartwarming story entitled "Ang Nanay Ko Ay Dyosa" that pays tribute to all moms and their ever-shining love. With the special participation of [[Maalaala Mo Kaya]] host [[Charo Santos-Concio]] through her mellifluous voiceover, a montage was first shown which features snaps and clips of celebrity and ordinary moms with their children, including Anne's. The live presentation started off with Anne singing a lullaby version of [[Coldplay]]’s "[[A Sky Full of Stars]]" to her daughter, played by Queenzy Calma. They were in their silk sleepwear and were surrounded by plenty of glimmering lights, happily dancing and playing, when suddenly, a tornado came and took the little girl away. As she began looking for her, Anne was only able to retrieve the glowing star that she gave to her as a gift. In pursuit of finding her daughter, Anne went on a whimsical adventure. Her first stop was in Planet Neona guarded by Jackie, who mesmerized audinece with her breathtaking [[Aerial dance|aerial silk dance]] while cladded in a multicolor neon body suit and flower crown that symbolizes a butterfly. However, Anne wasn’t able to find her child there. She then proceeded to Planeta Deserta, which was manned by Ion who performed acrobatic moves on a steel scaffolding while appearing fierce in his all-black ensemble. Still unable to find her child, Anne went on to travel the rest of the galaxy. She ran and did acrobatic routines mid-air while suspended in harness, with the staircase scene wherein she let herself freely fall as one of the most noteworthy parts of the show. As she gained consciousness after her exhausting quest, she found herself in the darkest world in the universe where she was also able to retrieve the glowing star. Now cladded in a white gown, Anne made the whole room shimmer when she raised the star and finally found her daughter. This ensued to their heartwarming reunion, with Anne crying as she once again sang "A Sky Full of Stars". Ion, Jackie, and the other dancers went back onstage and danced along with them. It ended with the voice over reiterating Charo's opening spiel, ''"Dahil ang totoong ilaw ng anak ay ang kanyang ina. Kumikislap, kumikinang, kahali-halina, katulad ng isang dyosa"''.

! Team Jhong-Ryan<br><small>(November 15, Tuesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Jhong Hilario and Ryan Bang showcase not just how tightly bonded they are, but the beautiful and colorful culture and heritage of Philippines and South Korea through their diverse and star-studded performance. They commenced their cultural show by appearing onstage in traditional costumes of their respective countries, with Jhong in [[barong tagalog]] and Ryan in [[hanbok]]. They performed a skit where they virtually visit top tourist spots in the Philippines, wherein Jhong made Ryan experience some of the activities usually done in those places. Sibling child stars Mela and Stella Francisco emerged onstage as they danced to [[Bini (group)|BINI]]’s cover of "[[Da Coconut Nut]]" and played Pinoy street games (sipa, piko, and luksong baka) with Jhong and Ryan. [[Love team]] [[KD Estrada]] and [[Alexa Ilacad]] then appeared on stage for a number that showcased Filipino customs like ''[[bayanihan]]'' and ''[[Harana (serenade)|harana]]'', while actress [[Kaori Oinuma]] and ''It's Showtime'' co-host Cianne Dominguez also graced the show to represent [[MassKara Festival|MassKara]] and [[Panagbenga Festival|Panagbenga]] festivals, respectively. After their tour around the Philippines, it was Ryan’s turn to take Jhong around his homeland [[South Korea]]. Child star [[Chunsa Jung]] then stepped out the stage to dance to [[Seventeen (South Korean band)|Seventeen]]’s "[[Left & Right (Seventeen song)|Left & Right]]" and played the traditional Korean game "[[tuho]]". They then showcased [[taekwondo]] with singer-dancer [[Joao Constancia]] and entertained with a depiction of [[korean drama]] by incorporating Korean translations of notable lines from Filipino movies in their intense dialogues. They also treated the audience to a mini [[K-pop]] concert experience by having pop group [[TFN (boy band)|TFN]] perform their song "Amazon" live. Video messages from K-Pop stars [[Sandara Park]], [[Thunder (singer)|Thunder]] of [[MBLAQ]], [[Nancy McDonie]] of [[Momoland]], [[TAN (group)|TAN]], and [[Lapillus (group)|Lapillus]] are then shown as they expressed their well-wishes for the program's 13th anniversary and their admiration to Filipinos. The montage also included interviews with translator Sandra Jung, Philippine Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Maria Theresa Dizon-De Vega, and Filipino veterans who participated in the [[Korean War]]. Jhong then performed a Korean traditional dance with a group of female dancers while they were dressed in hanboks, and played the [[Buk (drum)|buk]], a Korean traditional drum. Ryan, on the other hand, performed [[Dance in the Philippines|Filipino folk dances]] together with a group of folk dancers. The presentation ended with everyone dancing to "Sarap ng Buhay", performed by music group [[Bayang Barrios|Bayang Barrios at ang Naliyagan]].

! Team Jugs-Teddy-Kim<br><small>(November 16, Wednesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Jugs Jugueta, Teddy Corpuz, and Kim Chiu delivered an [[Filipino music|OPM]] rock concert-themed production. They started off by showing a video shot at the rooftop of ABS-CBN, wherein the three tried to tickle us with their witty words of wisdom and reminded us how music keeps us company in everything that we go through in life. Aptly called "RockPasikat", the live production number commenced with Kim and a group of dancers hauntingly dancing to [[Classical music]] from singer [[Elaine Duran]]. She then let herself be pulled out from the enormous skirt she shared with the ensemble by gripping onto a harness and went on to perform aerial dance routines. Singer Janine Teñoso emerged onstage, belting out [[Sampaguita (singer)|Sampaguita]]’s "Nosi Balasi". She was joined afterwards by Jugs, who sang while jumping on a trampoline. This was followed by a performance of "Moon" from rapper Nik Makino and Teddy. Filipino rock icons then graced the stage, including [[Lougee Basabas]] of [[MOJOFLY]], Hannah Romawac of [[SessiOnroad]], [[Acel Bisa]] of [[Moonstar88]], and Aia De Leon of [[Imago (band)|Imago]] performing [[Kitchie Nadal]]’s "Bulong", alongside Six-Part Invention. They were succeeded by Argee Guerrero of [[I Belong to the Zoo]] and Jai Singson of Agsunta's duet of "Puso" by [[Sponge Cola]]. Jugs, Teddy, and Kim then went on to synchronically show off their amazing drumming skills while getting soak in water dripping from the ceiling. Despite getting drenched, the trio proceeded on singing an original composition by Teddy, as they returned inside the studio. [[Francis Reyes]] of [[The Dawn (band)|The Dawn]] provided the guitar solo, followed by [[Ian Tayao]] of Queso who gave the song a touch of [[Metal music|metal rock]] with his [[Death growl|growl]]. The mini-concert was then joined by more special guests: hitmaker [[Adie (Filipino singer)|Adie]], rapper Kritiko, ex-Kulay member [[Radha Cuadrado]], Color It Red vocalist Cooky Chua, and singer [[Jason Dy]]. Jugs, Teddy, and Kim once again took on the makeshift revolving stage, which the dancers turned for the three to execute their backward stage dive and to include the audience in the frame.

! Team Vice-Amy<br><small>(November 17, Thursday)</small>
| align="justify" | Vice Ganda and Amy Perez delivered a powerful message that they incorporated in every part of their breathtaking production. It started with a synchronized dance number courtesy of the talented A-Team dancers. A montage of people doing [[blue-collar jobs]] was then flashed on the screen, with Vice expressing through voiceover that they dedicate their presentation to those people who are mainly using their hands at work. Tyang Amy was the first one to appear onstage, showing off her dancing skills in a black embellished dress. Along with the dancers, they did routines that resembled sewing and measuring lengths, representing [[tailor]]s. After a quick costume change, Amy began to dance ballroom in her glittery red frock with their guest star [[Enchong Dee]]. After Tyang Amy's splendid dance number, Vice then dominated the stage in his black and gold avant-garde number. The segment, which represents [[Nail technician|manicurists]], began with someone putting glitters on Vice's studded gold fingernails and was then joined by the dancers in gold costumes, who were able to perfectly execute their coordinated hand routines and successfully created an illusion behind him as he sang "[[Unholy (Sam Smith and Kim Petras song)|Unholy]]" by [[Sam Smith]] and [[Kim Petras]]. Singer [[KZ Tandingan]] joined him onstage, also dressed in a black and gold outfit as well as gold nails on their fingers. They also paid tribute to construction workers by having some of the dancers act like them, which served as an introduction to Tyang Amy's second dance number, wherein she and the dancers executed a synchronized hand and hip-hop routines while in their heavy-duty suits. Vice returned to the stage, but this time in a black-and-white ensemble with an enormous headdress. He was accompanied by [[differently-abled]] dancers in wheelchairs. The rest of dancers rejoined them to perform another harmonious arm routines. As the upbeat music subsided, a deafening silence permeated the studio for 50 seconds as Jasmine Gabriel spoke to the audience through sign language. In a dance routine, everyone onstage went on to do sign languages that convey "put your hand on me", "applause", and "I love you". Tyang Amy and Enchong returned to the stage and continued dancing, as well as KZ who belted out a portion of their final song.

! Team Karylle-Ogie<br><small>(November 18, Friday)</small>
| align="justify" | Karylle and Ogie Alcasid brought an amusing and colorful retro-inspired musical titled "Dito Sa Puso Ko", which featured the timeless and legendary music of Ogie himself. The trio of [[Nonong Ballinan]], [[Jerald Napoles]], and [[Benj Manalo]] in multicolored ensembles enthusiastically welcomed the audience to "4ever Mall", the setting of this wonderful extravaganza that was totally popping in colors. It started off with a perky performance of "NakakaLokal" by Mandy, played by Karylle, along with the back-up dancers who were in vibrant retro outfits. Ogie then emerged onstage with a guitar, wearing a black and white costume, and an enormous wig that resembled his character Norman's glum and bland life after the love of his life ghosted him. The trio introduced him as a musician who lost his hope and found it difficult to rise up from his misfortune, so people started calling him "Norman The Loser". As they encouraged him to start finding his lost love, Norman serenaded everyone with his classic hit "Mahal Kita Walang Iba". That indeed captured the heart of the ever-animated Mandy, who spoke to him about happy ending and forever even though he got his heart broken a lot of times. Benj, Jerald, and Nonong tried to help by hollering his past flames, with [[Regine Velasquez|Regine Velasquez-Alcasid]] as the first one to heed the call. Cladded in a green dress, pink thigh-high boots, and white wig, she belted out "Hanggang Ngayon" as her character still harbors feelings towards Norman despite being “friend-zoned” by him. Just when she thought that the time had finally come for them, he told her that he loves her as a friend. The second girl to respond to their call was [[Jolina Magdangal|Jolina Magdangal-Escueta]], who was in a bright red and yellow dress and sang a lively version of "[[Nandito Ako (song)|Nandito Ako]]", as her way of reminding him that she's there for him "as a friend". As they summoned the woman who loved Norman for the third time, [[Melai Cantiveros|Melai Cantiveros-Francisco]] suddenly appeared behind the ''hurados'' who were sitting then among the live audiences. Norman and dancers performed blues and jazz versions of "Kailangan Ko’y Ikaw", which was followed by Melai's performance of the [[Magandang Buhay]] theme song along with Jolina and Regine. [[Bituin Escalante]] then emerged onstage in a funky get-up, and was introduced as the woman who loved him, too, but circumstances were against them. She and Norman sang a mash-up of "Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang" and "Pangako". After the duet, Mandy advised him that he must always give his all when it comes in love and proceeded to sing an original composition about letting yourself to fall in love. A woman's voice was then heard on 4ever Mall's [[PA system]], searching for Norman. It appeared to be [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]], whose character Zaza is Norman's long-lost love and Mandy's mother. In a grand twist of fate, Mandy was revealed to be their daughter. The three wicked stepsisters of Zaza, portrayed by ''Miss Q and A'' alumni led by comedian [[Brenda Mage]], then arrived and expressed how they object to their relationship, even after more than two decades of taking her away from him. But this time, Zaza is determined to give their relationship a second chance as she still loves, and performed “Sa Kanya”. With the help of the people from 4ever Mall who drove them away, they were able to get their happy ending. Norman reprised "Mahal Kita Walang Iba", but this time with his family. Benj, Jerald, and Nonong once again went back onstage to remind everyone that "forever" and "happy ending" cannot only be found between two people, but also among family, friends, community, and countrymen. The production capped off with the entire cast performing "Dito Sa Puso Ko", as he switched to a multicolored costume. They also reprised "NakakaLokal" as the cast members took their bows.

! Team Vhong-Jugs-Teddy<br /><small>(November 6, Monday)</small>
| align="justify" | Vhong Navarro, Jugs Jugueta, and Teddy Corpuz paid tribute to iconic Filipino comedians through their performance powered by [[artificial intelligence]]. Teddy, Jugs, and Vhong opened their performance by impersonating three iconic comedians: [[Redford White]], [[Babalu (comedian)|Babalu]], and [[Dolphy]], respectively. The three hosts performed the theme songs of their respective shows or films: Buddy en Sol for White, ''[[Oki Doki Doc]]'' for Babalu, and ''[[Home Along Da Riles]]'' for Dolphy. Following Vhong's performance as Dolphy, their performance appeared to 
"finish" with confetti filling the air, surprising the audience. Subsequently, a replay of their performance was shown with the three hosts'faces swapped with the comedians they impersonated using [[deepfake]] technology.

The trio continued to impersonate the comedians as their faces were swapped with the comedians' faces. In the final part of their performance, they sang an original composition while presenting a slideshow of various Filipino comedians. The roster included [[Apeng Daldal]], Ben Tisoy, [[Bentong (comedian)|Bentong]], [[Bernardo Bernardo]], [[Cachupoy]], [[Carding Castro|Carding]], [[Chicháy]], [[Chokoleit]], [[Dely Atay-Atayan]], [[Don Pepot]], [[Elizabeth Ramsey]], Gary Lising, [[Ike Lozada]], [[Joy Viado]], Mang Tomas, [[Palito]], [[Panchito Alba|Panchito]], [[Larry Silva|Pipoy]], Porkchop Duo, [[Richie D'Horsie]], Sammy Lagmay, [[Soxie Topacio]], [[Subas Herrero]], [[Tado (comedian)|Tado]], Tintoy, Noel “Ungga” Ayala, and [[Zorayda Sanchez]]. The hosts' faces were then transformed to resemble more comedians: [[Bert "Tawa" Marcelo]], [[Tiya Pusit|Myrna "Tiya Pusi" Villanueva]], [[Willie Nepomuceno]], and [[German Moreno|German "Kuya Germs" Moreno]] through Jugs; [[Mely Tagasa|Mely "Miss Tapia" Tagasa]], [[Blakdyak|Joseph "Blakdyak" Formaran]], and [[Chiquito (actor)|Augusto "Chiquito" Pangan]] through Vhong; and [[Dencio Padilla]], [[Yoyoy Villame]], and [[Rene Requiestas]] through Teddy. Actress-comedian [[Nova Villa]] then made a surprise special appearance. Finally, the AI-generated faces of all the featured comedians were shown on screen for the remainder of Team JTV's performance.

Team Vhong-Jugs-Teddy's performance marked the first time that [[generative artificial intelligence]] technology was used in a ''Magpasikat'' number. The performance utilized three high-end desktop computers each having an [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce 40 series|GeForce RTX 4080]] GPU and 64GB of RAM provided by computer retailer PC Express, and a fork of the roop deepfake software.<ref name="Suba">{{Cite web |last=Suba |first=BossMac |date=2023-11-16 |title=Upclose with the Technology Behind It's Showtime's Comedy Tribute |url=https://www.back2gaming.com/features/ai-upsclose-its-showtime-comedy-tribute/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240117073157/https://www.back2gaming.com/features/ai-upsclose-its-showtime-comedy-tribute/ |archive-date=2024-01-17 |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=Back2Gaming}}</ref>

! Team Karylle-Amy-MC-Lassy<br /><small>(November 7, Tuesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Karylle, Amy Perez, MC Calaquian, and Lassy Marquez emphasized the value of family through Team KALM's whimsical and heartwarming musical performance. The team opened their performance with the original composition entitled "All I Need is My Family," featuring singer [[Roselle Nava]] and her two children, along with singer Fana and her nephew Fabio. Karylle, Amy, Lassy, and MC joined them afterward, along with ''It's Showtime'' "Batang Cute-po" Argus Aspiras. The skit chronicled the story of a modern family composed of the four hosts and Argus, who played siblings. However, Argus had to be left behind by his brothers and sisters under the care of his imaginary friend "Lulu" as they went to work. Seeing how sad Argus was,"Lulu", a computer-generated character (who was, after the performance, revealed to be voiced by actor [[David Licauco]]), suggested for them to follow his siblings to work to see how they're doing through Argus’ imagination. They initially checked on MC, who works as a security guard at a bank, which turned into a magical forest. He then performed with boy band [[BGYO]] as they sang their song "The Light". Lulu and Argus went to Amy next, who serves as a nanny to an affluent family living in a mansion. She then [[Tap dance|tap-danced]] to [[Taylor Swift]]’s "[[Shake It Off]]" opposite famous impersonator and drag queen [[Taylor Sheesh]]. "Batang Cute-pos" Kulot and Jaze also appeared in a skit that followed the performance. The two best friends then flew to the faraway seas to visit Lassy, who works as a seafarer. The comedian pulled off a sultry dance with girl group [[Bini (group)|BINI]] as they performed their song "Strings". And lastly, they came to Karylle's workplace, which was at a hospital where she serves as a nurse. The hospital then transformed into a battleground, as they depicted how health workers have to combat not just fatigue, but also sickness. She represented it by performing [[Fifth Harmony]]’s "[[Boss (Fifth Harmony song)|Boss]]". This segment featured surprise appearance from actresses [[Iza Calzado]], [[Sunshine Dizon]], and [[Diana Zubiri]]. At the end of each performance, a voice-over emphasized that they were doing it all for Argus, no matter how hard they worked. Towards the end of the performance, the five of them reunited, and Argus expressed his understanding that their work was for his future. The four members of the group apologized to Argus for their work commitments. The show concluded with an encore performance of "All I Need is My Family", featuring all members of the ensemble cast.

! Team Anne-Ogie-Ryan<br /><small>(November 8, Wednesday)</small>
| align="justify" | Anne Curtis, Ogie Alcasid, and Ryan Bang's Team ARO conveyed an ever-relevant message of healing through their inspiring and astonishing spectacle. The production commenced with a montage of good news that the world has received recently, as well as screenshots of tweets about the theme "The World is Healing". The introductory clip concludes with the entire video being rewound, revealing a text displayed on a dark background that reads "or is it...?" Anne, Ryan, and Ogie then performed an original composition about "healing". Following that, Ryan took the stage for an interpretative dance on a rotating platform, accompanied by the song "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand By Me]]", that symbolizes his healing through loving. Subsequently, Ogie flawlessly did stunts mid-air while being held by a harness and even put himself upside down against a makeshift wall onstage. He was joined by vocalists [[Dingdong Avanzado]], [[Nyoy Volante]], and [[Jed Madela]] as they sing [[Eraserheads]]' "[[Huwag Kang Matakot]]". The segment signifies the healing his fears by trusting. Last, is Anne, performed a breathtaking aerial spiral act. She did this while "Batang Cute-po" Imogen Cantong performed her rendition of [[Coldplay]]’s "[[Fix You]]".  As she descended from the spiral, her younger sister and actress [[Jasmine Curtis-Smith]] surprised everyone with her entrance and took her turn to the spiral as Anne watched her from the revolving platform. Anne returned to the spiral again to join Jasmine and they ended the set by sharing a warm embrace. This seemingly depicted Anne’s healing from her challenges by believing and with the help of family. Finally, the performance culminates with an encore of their introductory song, eventually joined by the rest of their ensemble.

! Team Vice-Jackie-Cianne<br /><small>(November 9, Thursday)</small>
| align="justify" | Vice Ganda, Jackie Gonzaga, and Cianne Dominguez delivered a creative and dramatic depictions of their respective journeys in chasing their dreams and going on different paths as life goes on. Vice Ganda opened their number as he sings [[Coldplay]]’s “[[A Head Full of Dreams (song)|A Head Full of Dreams]]” while clad in a robotic costume, standing on a platform suspended mid-air. She then uttered a monologue about dreams, followed with a clip showcasing the three's younger selves, expressing aspirations for their future. This featured a young Jackie aspiring to become a flight attendant, with visuals of her being bathed by her mother in a bathtub. This leads to Jackie Gonzaga’s solo exhibition, accompanied by [[Sia]]'s "[[Bird Set Free]]". Dressed in an all-white ensemble, she performed a sultry dance while inside a water-filled bathtub with a group of dancers as she tries to escape from them. Jackie manages to attach herself to a harness that pulls her up to the ceiling of the studio where she performs her aerial dance. The second part showcased a young Cianne, dreaming of becoming a beauty queen. Dressed in a voluminous red gown, Cianne sang [[Christina Aguilera]]s "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]". She was then lifted mid-air via harness, along with the dancers in white dresses hanging by a gigantic [[dreamcatcher]] attached to the ceiling. The final performance was Vice's, as his younger self expressed a desire to become a lawyer. Accompanied by [[Jvke]]'s "[[Golden Hour (song)|Golden Hour]]", he is then seen standing inside a massive virtual reality box on the stage in a different costume, wherein he chronicled his journey in chasing his old ambition and eventually finding himself taking on a different path and becoming successful in it. In an emotional segment, the three of them returns to stage one-by-one in different costumes as they imagine themselves entering a portal where they’re able to meet their younger selves shown on separate screens. The trio then conveyed heartfelt messages to their younger selves before their mothers joined in, sharing their own touching messages. The presentation of Team VJC concluded with the entire ensemble, including their younger selves, performing "[[A Million Dreams]]" from "[[The Greatest Showman]]", with the surprise appearance of former ''It's Showtime'' co-hosts [[Billy Crawford]] and [[Coleen Garcia]], along with their child Amari.

! Team Jhong-Kim-Ion<br /><small>(November 10, Friday)</small>
| align="justify" | Jhong Hilario, Kim Chiu, and Ion Perez performed an exhilarating, edgy number that fuses contemporary dance and parkour to present the sad realities of mobile technology, a straightforward but relevant and bold attempt to open viewers’ eyes to the flaws and threats of phone and social media misuse. Team JKI commenced their performance with a montage of people communicating through various means: tin can telephone, rotary dial telephone, phone booth, cordless telephone, and cellphone. Voiceovers by Jhong, Kim, and Ion in their local dialects previewed the upcoming performance, summarizing its essence, followed by a visually striking wave of phones moving in unison. The narrative unfolds with Jhong ordering food for his children in a restaurant, where he witnesses a fight. The skit then "rewinds" to the night before the restaurant visit, where Jhong urges everyone to turn off their phones, leading to a disagreement with his wife, portrayed by Lea Carla "Luningning" Santos. An interpretative dance by the couple ensues, with each movement and breath painting the heartbreaking reality of how too much phone usage desensitizes human relationships. Back in the restaurant setting, Kim, playing a social media influencer, enters the scene holding her phone to talk to her followers. Interrupted by the fight, Kim recorded the incident with her phone. Marked by another rewind transition, she breaks into a theatrical dance, depicting a [[Vlog|food vlog]]. Her mother, played by actress [[Janice de Belen]], enters the scene and asks for money for her makeover. Kim is noticeably exhausted and disgruntled, seemingly struggling to set clear boundaries with her mom who keeps asking for money. “Hi, guys, it’s me your favorite girl,” she puts on a bubbly mask for her followers. The story fast-forwards to Ion as a server in the restaurant, who accidentally bumps into a customer,played by actor [[Bernard Palanca]]. Unfortunately, the customer is quick to show anger and provoke Ion. With the incident caught on camera by Kim, Ion receives a call from his sibling informing him that he's gone viral and is being [[Cancel culture|cancelled]] on social media. Various celebrities including [[Martin Nievera]], [[John Lapus|John "Sweet" Lapus]], [[Jennica Garcia]], and [[Jameson Blake]], made virtual cameo appearances playing [[netizen]]s reacting to the restaurant squabble. Ion depicts his frustration through dance, the choreography expressing how the intense online hate and judgment is taking a toll on his sanity. The trio reunites on stage, elevating the thrill of their whole performance with a death-defying parkour exhibition. They take their dance routine on a makeshift giant [[pachinko]] board where they're seen theatrically climbing, swinging, and dancing without harnesses. As they showcase their breathtaking wall climbing act, their voice-over plays in the background, with each of them saying their piece about how mobile technology affected them as individuals. Collectively, the team then presented an impactful question ''"Ikaw, gaano ka ka-responsable sa paggamit ng cellphone?" ''. From thrilling, the production to heartwarming as Jhong, Kim, and Ion pretend to be talking to their loved ones over the phone, expressing heartfelt messages to them. Jhong, Kim and Ion ended their performance with a simple yet impactful gesture of raising their lit-up mobile phones while surrounded by total darkness.

=== ''Magpasikat'' 2024 ===
The fifteenth edition of ''Magpasikat'', subtitled "<i>KinsEYYY</i>", was held from October 21 to 26, 2024. The competing teams were revealed on Monday, August 19. Five teams competed with each other: Team Vice-Karylle-Ryan (or Team ViRyLle), Team Ogie-Kim-MC-Lassy, Team Vhong-Ion-Darren-Amy (or Team VIDA), Team Anne-Jugs-Teddy (or Team AJT), and Team Jhong-Jackie-Cianne (or Team JJC). This edition marked Darren Espanto's debut on the competition after joining the show as a regular host in March 2024. However he has appeared as guest performer for Team Vice-Ryan-Jackie in the 2021 edition, and has been one of the ''hurados'' in the 2022 edition. This year's competition also marked the return of ''Magpasikat'' week being held in October after the past three editions were held in November; and was also the first ''Magpasikat'' to air on both [[All TV|ALLTV]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://balita.net.ph/2024/06/18/tahimik-lang-its-showtime-balik-channel-2-napapanood-na-rin-sa-alltv/|title=Tahimik lang: It’s Showtime balik-Channel 2, napapanood na rin sa ALLTV|author=Richard de Leon|website=balita.net.ph|date=2024-06-18|access-date=2024-06-18}}</ref> This year's judges were television and film director [[Rory Quintos]], actress and beauty queen [[Alice Dixson]], actor [[Donny Pangilinan]], actress [[Gabbi Garcia]], and former [[ABS-CBN]] president and ''[[Pilipinas Got Talent]]'' judge [[Freddie M. Garcia]].

The grand prize for this year's competition is {{Philippine peso|300,000}} for the champions' chosen beneficiary, while the prize for the second and third-placing groups are {{Philippine peso|200,000}} and {{Philippine peso|100,000}}, respectively. At the end of the week, Team Ogie-Kim-MC-Lassy emerged as winners. The team's victory marked Kim Chiu's fourth win overall, tying Jhong Hilario for the third most ''Magpasikat'' wins, and the first win for Ogie Alcasid and the comedy duo of MC "Muah" Calaquian and Lassy Marquez. Meanwhile, Team Jhong-Jackie-Cianne and Team Anne-Jugs-Teddy were declared as second and third placers, respectively. For the first time, the teams Vice-Karylle-Ryan and Vhong-Ion-Darren-Amy placing 4th and 5th placers respectively were not received any amount of prizes unlike last year's {{Philippine peso|50,000}} each.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=October 26, 2024 |title=Ogie Alcasid, Kim Chiu, MC, and Lassy are the winners of 'Magpasikat' 2024 |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/chikaminute/925005/ogie-alcasid-kim-chiu-mc-and-lassy-are-the-winners-of-magpasikat-2024/story/|access-date=October 28, 2024 |website=GMA Network}}</ref>
