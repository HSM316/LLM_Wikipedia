'''Rhetorical structure theory''' ('''RST''') is a theory of text organization that describes relations that hold between parts of text. It was originally developed by [[William C. Mann|William Mann]] and [[Sandra Thompson (linguist)|Sandra Thompson]] of the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) and defined in a 1988 paper.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=William C. |authorlink1=William C.

==Rhetorical relations==
Rhetorical relations or coherence relations or [[discourse relation]]s are [[paratactic]] (coordinate) or [[hypotactic]] (subordinate) relations that hold across two or more text spans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taboada |first=Maite |date=2009 |chapter=Implicit and explicit coherence relations |editor-last=Renkema |editor-first=Jan |title=Discourse, of course: an overview of research in discourse studies |location=Amsterdam; Philadelphia |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |pages=127–140 |isbn=9789027232588 |oclc=276996573 |doi=10.1075/z.148.13tab |chapterurl=https://www.sfu.ca/~mtaboada/docs/publications/Taboada_Implicit_Explicit.pdf}}</ref> It is widely accepted that notion of [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] is through text relations like this. RST using rhetorical relations provide a systematic way for an analyst to analyse the text. An analysis is usually built by reading the text and constructing a tree using the relations. The following example is a title and
summary, appearing at the top of an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine (Ramachandran and Anstis, 1986). The original text, broken into numbered units, is:<ref name="Taboada Mann 2006"/>

In the figure, numbers 1,2,3,4 show the corresponding units as explained above.
The fourth unit and the third unit form a relation "Means". The fourth unit is the essential part of this relation, so it is called the nucleus of the relation and third unit is called the satellite of the relation. Similarly second unit to third and fourth unit is forming relation "Condition". All units are also spans and spans may be composed of more than one unit.

==Nuclearity in discourse==
RST establishes two different types of units. Nuclei are considered as the most important parts of text whereas satellites contribute to the nuclei and are secondary. 
Nucleus contains basic information and satellite contains additional information about nucleus. The satellite is often incomprehensible without nucleus, whereas a text where a satellites have been deleted can be understood to a certain extent.

==Hierarchy in the analysis==
RST relations are applied recursively in a text, until all units in that text are constituents in an RST relation. The result of such analyses is that RST structure are typically represented as trees, with one top level relation that encompasses other relations at lower levels.

==Why RST?==
# From linguistic point of view, RST proposes a different view of text organization than most [[Linguistics|linguistic theories]].
# RST points to a tight relation between relations and [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in text
# From a computational point of view, it provides a characterization of text relations that has been implemented in different systems and for applications as [[text generation]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccl.pku.edu.cn/doubtfire/NLP/Text_Generation/RST/RST%20and%20Text%20Generation.htm |title=RST and text generation |website=ccl.pku.edu.cn |accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> and [[text summarization|summarization]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uzêda |first1=Vinícius Rodrigues |last2=Pardo |first2=Thiago Alexandre Salgueiro |last3=Nunes |first3=Maria das Graças Volpe |date=November 2008 |chapter=Evaluation of automatic text summarization methods based on rhetorical structure theory |title=Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications: Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 26–28 November 2008 |series=ISDA'08 |volume=2 |location=Piscataway, NJ |publisher=[[IEEE]] |pages=389–394 |doi=10.1109/ISDA.2008.289 |chapterurl=http://www.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/taspardo/ISDA2008-UzedaEtAl.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2017|isbn=978-0-7695-3382-7 |s2cid=16331006 }}</ref>
