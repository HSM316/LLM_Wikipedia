'''VisLab''' is an Italian company working on computer vision and environmental perception for vehicular applications. It was founded in the early 90s as a research laboratory of [[University of Parma]], Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione. It started its activities in 1990, with its  involvement  within the Eureka [[PROMETHEUS]] Project. Since then the research group  focused on vehicular applications.

VisLab, directed by [[Alberto Broggi]], undertakes  basic and applied research, including the perception of the surrounding environment in vehicular applications using cameras and fusion with other sensors.<ref name="vislabhome">[http://vislab.it Official website for VisLab]</ref> Its researchers contribute to fields such as [[Computer vision|artificial vision]], [[image processing]], [[machine learning]], [[neural networks]], [[robotics]], and [[sensor fusion]].<ref name="vislabhome" />

In 2009, eleven VisLab researchers started a spinoff company, named VisLab srl, to commercialize the results of their main researches. The [[University of Parma]] owned a share of 5%.In 2015, VisLab was acquired by Silicon Valley company [[Ambarella Inc.]], and about 30 researchers asked and then were hired by VisLab to staff their new Parma location.<ref>{{cite web | author = Giovanni Iozzia |url = https://quifinanza.it/editoriali/vislab-startup-tutta-italiana-che-vale-30-milioni-di-dollari/4025/ | title = Vislab: la startup tutta italiana che vale 30 milioni di dollari | language = Italian | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190815200201/https://quifinanza.it/editoriali/vislab-startup-tutta-italiana-che-vale-30-milioni-di-dollari/4025/ | archive-date = August 15, 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://video.repubblica.it/edizione/parma/vislab-a-parma-la-nuova-casa-dellauto-senza-conducente/296973/297591 | title = Vislab-Ambarella: a Parma la nuova casa dell'auto senza conducente | language = Italian | date = February 12, 2018 | via = [https://web.archive.org/web/20180215025553/https://parma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/02/12/foto/parma_la_nuova_casa_di_vislab_ambarella_nel_campus_universitario-188678059/1/ photogallery] |archive-url = https://archive.today/20190815200226/https://video.repubblica.it/edizione/parma/vislab-ambarella-a-parma-la-nuova-casa-dell-auto-senza-conducente/296973/297591| archive-date = August 15, 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.economyup.it/startup/2843_l-italiana-vislab-acquisita-per-30-milioni-di-dollari.htm | title = L'italiana VisLab acquisita per 30 milioni di dollari | language = Italian | date = July 6, 2015 | via = [https://archive.today/20190815200201/https://quifinanza.it/editoriali/vislab-startup-tutta-italiana-che-vale-30-milioni-di-dollari/4025/ quifinanza.it] | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190815201146/https://www.economyup.it/automotive/l-italiana-vislab-acquisita-per-30-milioni-di-dollari/ | archive-date = August 15, 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref>

==History==
In the early years, the research group formed by Broggi, [[Massimo Bertozzi]] and [[Alessandra Fascioli]] designed, realized, and tested an [[autonomous car]] known as ARGO. ARGO was a passenger car able to perceive the environment through the use of microcameras, analyze the surroundings, plan a trajectory, and drive itself on normal roads. It was tested in 1998 with a 2000+ km tour in Italy, dubbed MilleMiglia in Automatico. In this test the vehicle drove for more than 94% in automatic mode. It was the first test in the world to use off-the-shelf and low cost technology (a [[Pentium]] 200&nbsp;MHz PC and two low-cost video-phone cameras) in normal conditions of traffic, environment, and weather.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2005 a vehicle called [[TerraMax (vehicle)|TerraMax]] was able to successfully conclude the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]; VisLab's vision system was its primary means of perception.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2007 a new version of [[TerraMax (vehicle)|TerraMax]] qualified for the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]], which was not completed due to a fault.

In 2010 VisLab launched [[VIAC]], the [[VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge]], a 13,000&nbsp;km test run for autonomous vehicles, from Italy to China. This was the first autonomous driving test on an intercontinental route; it lasted three months.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

On 12 July 2013 VisLab tested the BRAiVE vehicle in downtown Parma. BRAiVE successfully negotiating two-way narrow rural roads, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, speed bumps, pedestrian areas, and tight roundabouts. VisLab engineers activated the vehicle in Parma University Campus and stopped it in Piazza della Pilotta (downtown [[Parma]]): a 20 minutes run in a real environment, together with real traffic at 11am on a working day, that required absolutely no human intervention.<ref name="PROUD2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.vislab.it/proud-en |title=PROUD2013 - Public ROad Urban Driverless Car Test 2013 |publisher=Vislab.it |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

On 31 March 2014 VisLab unveiled the new autonomous car, whose name is DEEVA, and which features more than 20 cameras, 4 lasers, GPS, KTM and IMU, and all sensors are hidden.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Location==
VisLab is located in the [[University of Parma]] main campus, south of [[Parma]], Italy.
