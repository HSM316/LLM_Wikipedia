'''Tango''' (named '''Project Tango''' while in testing) was an [[augmented reality]] [[computing platform]], developed and authored by the [[Advanced Technology and Projects]] (ATAP), a [[Skunkworks project|skunkworks]] division of [[Google]]. It used [[computer vision]] to enable [[mobile device]]s, such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], to detect their [[Pose (computer vision)|position]] relative to the world around them without using [[GPS]] or other external signals. This allowed application developers to create user experiences that include [[indoor positioning system|indoor navigation]], [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] mapping, physical space measurement, environmental recognition, [[augmented reality]], and windows into a [[Virtual reality|virtual world]].

The first product to emerge from ATAP,<ref>{{ citation |url=https://plus.sandbox.google.com/+GoogleATAP/posts/c3nZ3a12NKa|title=Announcement on ATAP Google+ site|date=30 January 2015}}</ref> Tango was developed by a team led by computer scientist [[Johnny Lee (computer scientist)|Johnny Lee]], a core contributor to [[Microsoft]]'s [[Kinect]].  In an interview in June 2015, Lee said, "We're developing the hardware and software technologies to help everything and everyone understand precisely where they are, anywhere."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2485294,00.asp |title=Future Phones Will Understand, See the World |date= 3 June 2015 |access-date=4 November 2015}}</ref>

Google produced two devices to demonstrate the Tango technology: the Peanut phone and the Yellowstone 7-inch tablet.  More than 3,000 of these devices had been sold as of June 2015,<ref>{{cite web |title=Slamdance: inside the weird virtual reality of Google's Project Tango |date=29 May 2015 |url=https://www.theverge.com/a/sundars-google/project-tango-google-io-2015}}</ref> chiefly to researchers and software developers interested in building applications for the platform. In the summer of 2015, [[Qualcomm]] and [[Intel]] both announced that they were developing Tango reference devices as models for device manufacturers who use their mobile [[chipsets]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2015/05/29|title=Qualcomm Powers Next Generation Project Tango Development Platform|date=2015-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/idf-2015-intel-ceo-developers-apps-data-internet-of-things/|title=IDF 2015: Intel teams with Google to bring RealSense to Project Tango|date=2015-08-18}}</ref>

At CES, in January 2016, Google announced a partnership with [[Lenovo]] to release a consumer smartphone during the summer of 2016 to feature Tango technology marketed at consumers, noting a less than $500 price-point and a small form factor below 6.5 inches. At the same time, both companies also announced an application incubator to get applications developed to be on the device on launch.

On 15 December 2017, Google announced that they would be ending support for Tango on March 1, 2018, in favor of [[ARCore]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16782556/project-tango-google-shutting-down-arcore-augmented-reality|title=Google's Project Tango is shutting down because ARCore is already here|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref>

== Overview ==
Tango was different from other contemporary 3D-sensing computer vision products, in that it was designed to run on a standalone mobile phone or tablet and was chiefly concerned with determining the device's [[Pose (computer vision)|position and orientation]] within the environment.

The software worked by integrating three types of functionality:
* [[Motion estimation|Motion-tracking]]: using [[Feature detection (computer vision)|visual features]] of the environment, in combination with [[accelerometer]] and [[gyroscope]] data, to closely track the device's movements in space
* Area learning: storing environment data in a map that can be re-used later, shared with other Tango devices, and enhanced with metadata such as notes, instructions, or points of interest
* [[Depth perception]]: detecting distances, sizes, and surfaces in the environment

Together, these generate data about the device in "[[six degrees of freedom]]" (3 [[axis of rotation|axes]] of [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] plus 3 axes of position) and detailed three-dimensional information about the environment.

Project Tango was also the first project to graduate from Google X in 2012 <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eweek.com/cloud/slideshows/10-bold-google-x-projects-aiming-for-tech-breakthroughs.html | title=10 Bold Google X Projects Aiming for Tech Breakthroughs}}</ref>

[[Application software|Applications]] on mobile devices use Tango's [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[application programming interface|APIs]] to access this data in real time.  In addition, an API was also provided for integrating Tango with the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]]; this enabled the conversion or creation of games that allow the user to interact and navigate in the game space by moving and rotating a Tango device in real space.  These APIs were documented on the Google developer website.<ref>https://developers.google.com/project-tango/ Google developer website.</ref>

== Applications ==
Tango enabled apps to track a device's position and orientation within a detailed 3D environment, and to recognize known environments.  This allowed the creations of applications such as in-store navigation, visual measurement and mapping utilities, presentation and design tools,<ref>{{cite conference|title=An augmented reality tool to detect design discrepancies: a comparison test with traditional methods|conference=International Conference on Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Graphics |date=2019|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-25999-0_9 }}</ref> and a variety of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] games.  At Augmented World Expo 2015,<ref>http://augmentedworldexpo.com/ Augmented World Expo 2015</ref> Johnny Lee demonstrated a construction game that builds a virtual structure in real space, an [[Augmented reality|AR]] showroom app that allows users to view a full-size virtual automobile and customize its features, a hybrid [[Nerf]] gun with mounted Tango screen for dodging and shooting AR monsters superimposed on reality, and a [[multiplayer]] [[Virtual reality|VR]] app that lets multiple players converse in a virtual space where their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] movements match their real-life movements.<ref>{{citation | title=AWE 2015, "Mobile 3D Tracking and Perception" | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9DtojcuTzA}}</ref>

Tango apps are distributed through [[Google Play|Play]].  Google has encouraged the development of more [[application software|apps]] with [[hackathon]]s, an app contest, and promotional discounts on the development tablet.<ref>{{citation |title=Google says these are the best apps for Project Tango| date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9658060/project-tango-app-contest-winners-announced-google}}</ref>

== Devices ==
As a platform for software developers and a model for device manufacturers, Google created two Tango devices.

=== The Peanut phone ===
"Peanut" was the first production Tango device, released in the first quarter of 2014. It was a small [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone with a Qualcomm MSM8974 quad-core processor and additional special hardware including a [[Fisheye lens|fisheye]] [[Video camera|motion camera]], "RGB-IR" camera for [[color image]] and [[infrared]] depth detection, and [[Movidius]] [[Vision processing unit]]s. A high-performance accelerometer and gyroscope were added after testing several competing models in the MARS lab at the [[University of Minnesota]].

Several hundred Peanut devices were distributed to early-access partners including university researchers in [[computer vision]] and [[robotics]], as well as application developers and [[startup company|technology startups]]. Google stopped supporting the Peanut device in September 2015, as by then the Tango software stack had evolved beyond the versions of Android that run on the device.

=== The Yellowstone tablet ===
[[File:Google ATAP's Project Tango tablet (15387052663).jpg|thumb|Google's Project Tango tablet, 2014]]
"Yellowstone" was a 7-inch tablet with full Tango functionality, released in June 2014, and sold as the Project Tango Tablet Development Kit.<ref>{{citation | url=https://plus.sandbox.google.com/+GoogleATAP/posts/8BrHey7cHGb| title=Product announcement on ATAP Google+ page|date=5 June 2014| access-date=4 November 2015}}</ref>  It featured a 2.3&nbsp;GHz quad-core Nvidia Tegra K1 processor, 128GB flash memory, 1920x1200-pixel touchscreen, 4MP color camera, [[fisheye lens|fisheye-lens]] (motion-tracking) camera, an IR projector with RGB-IR camera for integrated depth sensing, and [[4G LTE]] connectivity.<ref>{{citation | url=https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/hardware/index.html#technical-specs | title = Specs on official site | access-date=4 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/tango/hardware/tablet|title=Tango Tablet Development Kit User Guide {{!}} Tango {{!}} Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> As of May 27, 2017, the Tango tablet is considered officially unsupported by Google.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://plus.google.com/+ProjectTango/posts/RzK7Ey5V56Y|title=The launch of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro was a major milestone for Tango, marking ...|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en}}</ref>

==== Testing by NASA ====
In May 2014, two Peanut phones were delivered to the [[International Space Station]] to be part of a [[NASA]] project to develop autonomous robots that navigate in a variety of environments, including outer space. The soccer-ball-sized, 18-sided polyhedral [[SPHERES]] [[robots]] were developed at the NASA [[Ames Research Center]], adjacent to the Google campus in [[Mountain View, California]]. Andres Martinez, SPHERES manager at NASA, said "We are researching how effective [Tango's] vision-based navigation abilities are for performing [[robotic mapping|localization]] and navigation of a mobile free flyer on ISS.<ref>{{citation |title=Google's Project Tango headed to International Space Station |date=20 March 2014 | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2110660/googles-project-tango-headed-to-international-space-station.html}}</ref>

=== Intel RealSense smartphone ===
Announced at Intel's Developer Forum in August 2015,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/18/google-intel-realsense-tango/ | title=Google and Intel bring RealSense to phones with Project Tango dev kit}}</ref> and offered to public through a Developer Kit since January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/07/intel-realsense-tango-phone-preorder/ | title=Intel's RealSense phone with Project Tango up for pre-order}}</ref> It incorporated a RealSense ZR300 camera<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.techspot.com/news/63396-intel-realsense-smartphone-developer-kit-now-available-pre.html | title=Intel's RealSense smartphone developer kit now available to pre-order for $399| date=7 January 2016}}</ref> which had optical features required for Tango, such as the fisheye camera.<ref>[https://click.intel.com/media/ZR300-Product-Datasheet-Public-002.pdf Intel Realsense ZR300 Product Datasheet]</ref>
