''Oblivion'' takes place in 2077, on an Earth devastated by war with extraterrestrials that has caused humanity to relocate itself to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The film follows the story of Jack Harper, a technician who has been sent back to Earth to service drones used in the fight against remaining extraterrestrials (scavengers). After witnessing a spacecraft crash, from which he rescues a survivor, Harper is captured by scavengers (who are revealed to be humans) and fights against a new and evolving alien threat.

''Oblivion'' was released in [[IMAX]] by [[Universal Pictures]] on April 19, 2013<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joseph-kosinskis-tom-cruise-vehicle-oblivion-moves-april-2013/ |title=Joseph Kosinski's Tom Cruise Vehicle 'Oblivion' Moves To April 2013 |date=2012-03-15 |website=/FILM |language=EN-US |access-date=2019-07-31 |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513013518/https://www.slashfilm.com/joseph-kosinskis-tom-cruise-vehicle-oblivion-moves-april-2013/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and held its world premiere in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 26, 2013. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $286 million worldwide, on a production budget of $120 million.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
By March 14, 2077, Jack Harper and Victoria "Vika" Olsen are among the few humans left on Earth. Sixty years earlier, a race of alien scavengers destroyed the Moon and invaded Earth; humanity won the war, but nuclear weapons and the loss of the Moon left most of the planet uninhabitable. With Vika as his communications officer, Jack serves as "Tech 49", repairing the [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]] that hunt the remaining scavengers and guard the "hydrorig" generators converting seawater into [[fusion energy]]. Led by mission director Sally from aboard the "[[tetragrammaton|Tet]]" space station orbiting Earth, they will soon leave for humanity's new home on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Although their [[mindwipe|memories have been wiped]], Jack has recurring dreams of a life before the war with an unknown woman.

Exploring the ruins of the [[New York Public Library]], Jack narrowly escapes a scavenger ambush. After a hydrorig is destroyed, he discovers the scavengers are using the [[Empire State Building]]'s antenna to transmit coordinates to outer space. After disabling the transmitter, he visits his secret cabin filled with mementos from Earth's past. An unknown object crash-lands at the transmitted coordinates; in the wreckage, Jack finds five humans in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis chambers]], including the woman from his dreams. Drones kill the hibernating humans, but Jack protects the woman and brings her to his base. He and Vika revive the woman and learn her name is Julia, realizing she was in stasis aboard her ship ''Odyssey'' since before the war.

Jack and Julia return to the crash site and recover ''Odyssey''{{'s}} [[flight recorder]], but are captured by scavengers and taken to [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]]. Their leader, Malcolm Beech, reveals that the scavengers are humans, disguised to stay hidden from the drones. Another drone attacks and Beech releases Jack and Julia to discover the truth in the "radiation zone". Julia reveals she is Jack's wife, triggering his memories of proposing to her at the Empire State Building.

Vika sends a craft to retrieve Jack and Julia, but is heartbroken to see them reunited. She alerts Sally, who activates a drone that kills Vika before Julia destroys it. Jack and Julia escape in his craft and destroy the drones pursuing them, but are forced to eject over the radiation zone. Another technician, "Tech 52"&nbsp;— revealed to be a clone of Jack&nbsp;— arrives to repair the drones. Jack incapacitates him, but Julia is shot, and Jack flies to his clone's base for medical supplies, tricking a clone of Vika into believing he is ''her'' version of Jack. He takes Julia to his cabin, where she recuperates and they re-consummate their marriage.

They return to the scavenger base, and Beech explains that the Tet is an alien [[artificial intelligence]]. Determined to acquire Earth's resources and wipe out humanity, the Tet destroyed the Moon and invaded Earth with an army of drones and Jack's clones; humanity's victory and escape to Titan is a Tet fiction. Jack reprograms a captured drone to sabotage the Tet, but more drones attack the base, leaving Beech gravely injured and the captured drone damaged beyond repair.

Jack volunteers to deliver Julia to the Tet in order to infiltrate the Tet and detonate ''Odyssey''{{'s}} nuclear fuel cells. En route, Jack learns the truth from ''Odyssey''{{'s}} flight recorder: He is a clone of the commander of a [[NASA]] mission to explore Titan, with the original Vika as his co-pilot, Julia as a crew member, and Sally as their mission director on Earth. After their ship ''Odyssey'' was diverted to investigate the Tet, Jack jettisoned the sleep module, allowing Julia and the hibernating crew to eventually return to Earth, while he and Vika were captured and cloned.

In the present, Jack enters the Tet, finding thousands of clones of himself and Vika in stasis. Confronted by the Tet's projection of "Sally", Jack opens the stasis chamber to reveal that it contains the injured Beech instead of the promised Julia.  Back on Earth, Julia awakens from her sleep chamber to find herself at the cabin. As drones released by "Sally" race to kill Jack 49 and Beech, the two of them detonate their bomb, incinerating the Tet along with themselves. At the cabin, Julia observes the huge explosion in the sky and realizes that Jack 49 has sacrificed himself for her.

Three years later, Julia has given birth to her and Jack 49's daughter. They meet the surviving resistance members, accompanied by Jack 52, who has regained the original Jack's true memories, including his love for Julia.

Kosinski wanted to film a cinematic adaptation of the graphic novel ''Oblivion'', which he started to co-write with Arvid Nelson for [[Radical Comics]]. The novel, however, was never finished, as Kosinski now admits that "It was just a stage in the project [of film development]". He explained in an interview with ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' that "partnership with Radical Comics allowed me to continue working on the story by developing a series of images and continuing to refine the story more over a period of years. Then I basically used all that development as a pitch kit to the studio. So even though we really never released it as an illustrated novel the story is being told as a film, which was always the intention."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27355 | title=CCI: KOSINSKI ILLUMINATES "OBLIVION" | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 22, 2010 | author=Steve Sunu | access-date=November 15, 2012 | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063245/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27355 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/oblivion-based-on-the-non-existing-graphic-novel/ | title=Oblivion, Based On The Non-Existing Graphic Novel | publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]] | date=April 12, 2013 | access-date=April 12, 2013 | author=Rich Johnston | archive-date=April 14, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414230501/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/oblivion-based-on-the-non-existing-graphic-novel | url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Walt Disney Pictures]], which produced Kosinski's previous direction ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'', acquired the ''Oblivion'' film adaptation rights from Radical Comics and Kosinski after a heated auction in August 2010. The film was a directing vehicle for Kosinski with Barry Levine producing and Jesse Berger as executive producer. Other studios that made bids on the film were Paramount, Fox's Chernin Entertainment, and Universal.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/toldja-disney-acquires-joe-kosinskis-oblivion | title=Disney Acquires Joseph Kosinski's Graphic Novel 'Oblivion' | publisher=Deadline | date=August 4, 2010 | access-date=March 25, 2012 | author=Fleming, Mike | archive-date=January 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105211725/http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/toldja-disney-acquires-joe-kosinskis-oblivion/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Disney subsequently released the rights after realizing the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-rated]] film they envisioned, in line with their family-oriented reputation, would require too many story changes. [[Universal Pictures]], which had also bid for the original rights, then bought them from Kosinski and [[Radical Comics]] and authorized a PG-13 film version.<ref name="acquire">{{cite web | url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/05/tom-cruise-commits-to-100-million-universal-sci-fi-pic-oblivion-for-fall | title=Tom Cruise Commits To $100 Million Universal Sci-Fi Pic 'Oblivion' For Fall | publisher=Deadline | date=May 20, 2011 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | last=Fleming | first=Mike | archive-date=January 6, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201256/http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/tom-cruise-commits-to-100-million-universal-sci-fi-pic-oblivion-for-fall/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

The script for the film was originally written by Kosinski and [[William Monahan]] and underwent a first rewrite by [[Karl Gajdusek]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/karl-gajdusek-tapped-write-disney-168437 | title=Karl Gajdusek Tapped to Re-Write Disney's Horizons (Exclusive) | newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 16, 2011 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | author=Kit, Borys | archive-date=October 26, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026084531/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/karl-gajdusek-tapped-write-disney-168437 | url-status=live }}</ref> When the film passed into Universal's hands, a final rewrite was done by [[Michael Arndt]], under the pen name "Michael deBruyn".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/01/24/olga-kurylenko-and-andrea-riseborough-added-to-tom-cruise-sci-fi-project | title=Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough Added To Tom Cruise Sci-Fi Project | publisher=Hey U Guys | date=January 24, 2012 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | author=Roper, Dave | archive-date=March 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321121719/http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/01/24/olga-kurylenko-and-andrea-riseborough-added-to-tom-cruise-sci-fi-project/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Universal was particularly appreciative of the script, saying, "It's one of the most beautiful scripts we've ever come across."<ref name="info">{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/2012/04/27/cinemacon-2012-tom-cruise-dives-from-heaven-to-hell-in-oblivion-footage/ | title=CinemaCon 2012: Tom Cruise dives from heaven to hell in ''Oblivion'' footage | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=April 27, 2012 | access-date=May 8, 2012 | last=Breznican | first=Antony | archive-date=November 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126234627/http://www.ew.com/article/2012/04/27/cinemacon-2012-tom-cruise-dives-from-heaven-to-hell-in-oblivion-footage | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Bubble Ship operated by Cruise's main character, Jack 49, was inspired by the [[Bell 47]] helicopter (often colloquially referred to as a "bubble cockpit" helicopter), a utilitarian 1947 vehicle with a transparent round canopy that Kosinski saw in the lobby of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Manhattan]], and which he likened to a [[dragonfly]]. [[Daniel Simon]], who previously worked with Kosinski as the lead vehicle designer on ''Tron: Legacy'', was tasked with creating the Bubble Ship from this basis, incorporating elements evocative of an advanced fighter jet with the Bell 47 to create a light, functional vehicle that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, much as he observed with the ships in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name="HeroComplex"/>

"When Kubrick made ''2001'', rather than going to the hotshot concept designers of the day, he hired [[NASA]] engineers", said Simon. "I believe in [[form follows function]]. I'm not a fan of excessive decoration, of putting fins on something because it looks cool". Rather than employ digital models, Wild Factory, a Camarillo concept car company, built the Bubble Ship as a {{convert|25|foot|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|4000|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, mostly aluminum prop. Elements of the cockpit, such as the placement of the joystick and pedals, were customized for Cruise, who is a qualified pilot, and who had some input into the design. The craft was also made to be easy to disassemble and assemble, to facilitate transport to Iceland shooting locations, where it would be mounted on a [[gimbal]] for shots of it flying. The unmanned aerial drones that figure prominently in the plot were created to appear to be in the same design family as the Bubble Ship.<ref name="HeroComplex">Keegan, Rebecca.

===Casting===
[[Tom Cruise]] had expressed interest in the film for a long time, and officially committed to it on May 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/21/tom-cruise-joins-oblivion_n_865052.html | title=Tom Cruise Joins ''Oblivion'', Joseph Kosinski's Sci-Fi Film | work=The Huffington Post | date=May 21, 2011 | access-date=May 8, 2012 | archive-date=June 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621125000/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/21/tom-cruise-joins-oblivion_n_865052.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

In preparation for the role, Kurylenko watched astronaut training videos as well as classic science fiction and romance films (such as ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'').<ref>{{cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=Olga Kurylenko talks 'Oblivion', 'To The Wonder', and 'Erased'|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/04/olga-kurylenko-oblivion-interview|publisher=[[IFC Films|IFC.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2013|date=April 22, 2013|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042417/http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/04/olga-kurylenko-oblivion-interview|url-status=live}}</ref> "What's funny is I actually watched ''Solaris''; Joseph never brought it up", said Kurylenko.

As well as showcasing Iceland's volcanic landscapes, the film's director Joseph Kosinski sought to take advantage of the round-the-clock light, in particular the 6pm to 1am waning light known as "[[Golden hour (photography)|magic hour]]", to "bring sci-fi out into the daylight", in contrast with films such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', which spent their time in dark hulls or benighted planets.<ref name="HeroComplex" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/oblivion-cruise-kosinski-set-for-hero-complex-imax-screening/|title='Oblivion': Cruise, Kosinski set for Hero Complex Imax screening|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 2, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2013|archive-date=April 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406045357/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/oblivion-cruise-kosinski-set-for-hero-complex-imax-screening/|url-status=live}}</ref>

For the Sky Tower set (built on a soundstage in Baton Rouge), Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda worked closely with visual special-effects house [[Pixomondo]] to establish both environment and lighting by the use of 21 front-screen projectors aimed at a huge wraparound backdrop to form one continuous image, rather than [[Chroma key|blue screen]] backdrops.<ref name="vfrei">Vincent Frei, [http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=4213 "OBLIVION: Bjørn Mayer – VFX Supervisor – Pixomondo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422050133/http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=4213 |date=April 22, 2013 }}, ''Art of VFX'', April 16, 2013.</ref> The backdrop consisted of a single seamless piece of painted white [[muslin]], {{convert|500|by|42|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which was wrapped around the set for 270-degree coverage.<ref name="JFauer" /> This enabled the full environment to be captured in camera, and assisted in lighting up to 90 percent of the set.<ref name="CMiranda" />

Had blue screen been used on the "glass house" Sky Tower, the glass would have disappeared into the blue lighting, and would have had to be reproduced digitally in post-production.<ref name="JFauer" /> The actors enjoyed working in the environment, as they could look outside and actually see the sunrise or sunset imagery.<ref name="JFauer" /> This new technique allowed them to cut down on both the effects shots, which ended up at around 800 in total, and the expenses. Even the "control table" which Victoria operates was filmed then displayed on a large screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski-on-sci-fi-filmmaking/|title=Interview: 'Oblivion' Director Joseph Kosinski on Sci-Fi Filmmaking|work=FirstShowing|access-date=September 9, 2016|archive-date=June 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610044640/http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski-on-sci-fi-filmmaking/|url-status=live}}</ref>

To obtain the necessary footage to create the illusion that the Sky Tower set was sitting high above the clouds, Pixomondo sent a crew to film the view from the peak of [[Haleakalā]] in [[Hawaii]] for four days with three Red Epic cameras mounted side by side on a single rig.<ref name="vfrei" /> Pixomondo's Stuttgart office then stitched together the data from the three cameras to form a single gigantic video stream (with each still image consisting of 26 megapixels) and produced a variety of different time-of-day clips to be projected on the set.<ref name="vfrei" />

===Music===
On June 28, 2012, it was announced that French electronic band [[M83 (band)|M83]] would compose the soundtrack for ''Oblivion''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Exclusive: M83 Scoring Joseph Kosinski's Sci-Fi Film 'Oblivion' Starring Tom Cruise|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-m83-scoring-joseph-kosinskis-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise-20120628#|publisher=[[The Playlist]]|access-date=April 24, 2013|date=June 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426155552/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-m83-scoring-joseph-kosinskis-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise-20120628|archive-date=April 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On why he chose M83 to score the film, director Joseph Kosinski said, "I went back and I found my first treatment for ''Oblivion'' from 2005 and it had listed in the treatment a soundtrack of M83. Obviously, the ''Tron: Legacy'' collaboration with [[Daft Punk]] worked out as good as I would have ever hoped, [so] I wanted to do something similar in that I'm pulling an artist from outside the movie business to create an original sound for this film." Kosinski continued, "Daft Punk's music wouldn't make sense for this movie. It had to be an artist whose music fit the themes and story I was trying to tell. And M83's music I felt was fresh and original, and big and epic, but at the same time emotional and this is a very emotional film and it felt like a good fit."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Exclusive: Joseph Kosinski Talks OBLIVION, Working with Tom Cruise, Getting M83 to Compose the Score, the Film's Unique Design, the IMAX Release & More|url=https://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-m83-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=April 24, 2013|date=December 30, 2012|archive-date=April 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421132526/http://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-m83-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>

To guide Anthony Gonzalez of M83 through the scoring process, director Kosinski brought in [[Joseph Trapanese]], who co-wrote the score alongside Gonzalez. Kosinski states, "Together they have created the score that I have dreamed about since I first put this story down on paper eight years ago."<ref>[https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=101262 "Listen to a Track From the ''Oblivion Score''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003925/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=101262 |date=May 2, 2014 }}.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez said, "I started to write the soundtrack just reading the script, and then when you get the picture in, it's different, and you kind of switch to another vibe and change stuff and start experimenting a lot with the music." Gonzalez added, "I worked with Joseph a lot, and he's very particular about the music in his movies, so we spent a lot of time talking about music and working the arrangements together."<ref>{{cite web|last=Baltin|first=Steve|title=M83 Enter 'Oblivion' With Tom Cruise: At Grammys, French group talk soundtrack debut|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m83-enter-oblivion-with-tom-cruise-20130213|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=April 24, 2013|date=February 13, 2013|archive-date=March 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308001343/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m83-enter-oblivion-with-tom-cruise-20130213|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Marketing===
Details about ''Oblivion'' were kept secret, though the studio was said to have been "very excited" about the film. Promotions began in April 2012, with a part of the footage being screened at the [[CinemaCon|2012 CinemaCon]] even though filming had begun just one month before the event. The footage was described as "a combination of early concept art, rough animation, and unfinished [[dailies]]", showcasing a glimpse of the film's landscapes.<ref name="info" />

===Theatrical release===
''Oblivion'' was first presented in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 26, 2013, [[Dublin]] on April 3, and in [[Hollywood]] on April 10 at the [[Dolby Theatre]] where Cruise himself announced before the screening that the film was actually the first feature to be mixed completely "from start to finish" in the latest state-of-the-art [[Dolby Atmos]] surround sound.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[RTÉ]] |url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2013/0403/cruiset.html |title=Cruise in Dublin for movie and Irish roots |date=April 3, 2013 |access-date=April 20, 2013 |archive-date=April 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406025538/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2013/0403/cruiset.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated "''Oblivion'' is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action".<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Oblivion review - The Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/oblivion/review/435551|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414102120/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/oblivion/review/435551|url-status=live}}</ref> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "Insofar as ''Oblivion'' is first and foremost a visual experience, a movie to be seen rather than a puzzle to be deciphered, its chief pleasures are essentially spoiler-proof."<ref>{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Justin|title=Oblivion review - Variety|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-oblivion-1200339595/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415081501/http://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-oblivion-1200339595/|url-status=live}}</ref> Kevin Harley of ''[[Total Film]]'' gave the film three stars and said "It isn't a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] or reimagining, refreshingly, but ''Oblivion'' plays like a stylised remix of superior sci-fi ground-breakers".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harley|first=Kevin|title=Oblivion review - Total Film|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/oblivion|publisher=[[Total Film]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413115125/http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/oblivion|url-status=live}}</ref> Andrew O'Hehir of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' praised it as a "sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me – and many other people, I suspect – to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oblivion_2013/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Oblivion|work=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 9, 2016|archive-date=May 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530051441/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oblivion_2013/reviews/?type=top_critics|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tasha Robinson from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' states that an "unsettling sense of not-quite-right coats all of the film's steely surfaces, and Kosinski and his co-writers give audiences plenty of time to absorb the unease and gear up for the action".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Some reviewers noted the filmmakers' ambition. [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' calls the film "imperfect but some of its imperfections result from being overly ambitious".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Bill Goodykoontz from the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' states that the film "may not live up fully to its grand ambitions, but it isn't for lack of trying".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Jake Coyle of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' states that "[f]or those who enjoy the simple thrill of handsomely stylized image-making, ''Oblivion'' is mostly mesmerizing."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Alan Scherstuhl from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' states that "Kosinski proves himself talented in ways his ''Tron: Legacy'' didn't suggest."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Kenneth Turan]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "[m]ore adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, ''Oblivion'' makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn't let you go."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Michael O'Sullivan of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' states that "[i]f you're able to forgive and forget, ''Oblivion'' isn't a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Steven Rea]] of the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' states that "[Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' states that the film "gives us stars in the cast, stars in our eyes and it even tweaks a brain cell or three".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Colin Covert from the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' states that the "film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors – Kubrick, Lucas, the Wachowskis, and Pixar could be listed as creative consultants – but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi, not an opportunistic mash-up".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Cary Darling of the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' states that the film is "stitched together from spare bits of other, often better films, stumbl[ing] awkwardly in story and plot, shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet... ''Oblivion'' is so beautiful to look at."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' stated that "[i]n space, Jack [Harper] hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' states that the film "[f]eels ever more grounded and stuck."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Richard Roeper]] of Richard Roeper.com called it the "sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Tom Charity of [[CNN.com]] called it "[g]lossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[J. R. Jones]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' states that the "story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Rick Groen of Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called it "an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Tom Long of the ''[[Detroit News]]'' states that "Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end)." Long states that "a great deal is derivative, but it's fast-moving derivative".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' states that the movie "combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' states that "Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot. It's a dazzler, but the story lacks the impact of the futuristic look."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Joe Morgenstern]] of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states that the "mystery posed by ''Oblivion'' as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily and worked out so murkily".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the "agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden, but now it's just, well, dispiriting".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Rafer Guzman of ''[[Newsday]]'' states that "[p]laying spot-the-influence is the most fun you'll have during this expensive-looking, slow-moving plod through familiar territory."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Joe Williams of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' states that "[i]nstead of developing characters, Kosinski pours most of his imagination into the annihilated landscapes and futuristic gadgetry."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' states that "[w]hen you go to a futuristic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic barn dance starring Tom Cruise and his space guns, you expect a little zap with your thoughtful pauses."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calls it "arid and antiseptic, untouched by human hands".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Rene Rodriguez of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' states that the "filmmakers don't even have the courage to see the story to its proper end, opting for a ridiculous finale that feels vaguely insulting".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Soren Anderson from the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' states that "[y]ou start wondering whether director Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn have any original ideas of their own. And then you realize they don't."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Randy Myers of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' states that the "mix of gee-whiz gadgetry and the day-to-day routineness of Jack and Victoria's lives is interesting enough, but the film is too glacially paced for it to work".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' states that "[a]ll the eye candy in the world can't mask the sensation that you've seen this all before...and done better. Too bad the movie's script wasn't given the same attention as its sleek, brave-new-world look."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>
