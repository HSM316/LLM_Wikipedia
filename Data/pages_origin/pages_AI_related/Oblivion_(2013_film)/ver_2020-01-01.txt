'''''Oblivion''''' is a 2013 American [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[action-adventure film]] co-produced and directed by [[Joseph Kosinski]], and produced by [[Peter Chernin]] with screenplay by [[Karl Gajdusek]] and [[Michael Arndt|Michael deBruyn]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] in the main role alongside [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] in supporting roles.

''Oblivion'' takes place in 2077, on an Earth devastated by war with extraterrestrials that has caused humanity to relocate itself to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The film follows the story of Jack Harper, a technician who has been sent back to Earth to service drones used in the fight against remaining extraterrestrials (scavengers). After witnessing a spacecraft crash, from which he is able to rescue a survivor, Harper is captured by scavengers and fights against a new and evolving alien threat.

''Oblivion'' was released in [[IMAX]] by [[Universal Pictures]] on April 19, 2013<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/joseph-kosinskis-tom-cruise-vehicle-oblivion-moves-april-2013/ |title=Joseph Kosinski's Tom Cruise Vehicle 'Oblivion' Moves To April 2013 |date=2012-03-15 |website=/FILM |language=EN-US |access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> and held its world premiere in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 26, 2013. Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics and audience alike, who negatively criticized the screenwriting and story and lack of concept being used in front of production values and visual effects which were praised with the performances of Cruise and Freeman.

Despite mixed reviews, the film was a modest box office success with domestic box office gross of US$89 million, and international box office of US$199 million, on a production budget of US$120 million.

==Plot==
On March 14, 2077, 60 years after a war with extraterrestrials has devastated Earth, technician ("tech 49") Jack Harper repairs [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]] that attack alien scavengers and guard offshore [[fusion energy|fusion]] generators called "hydrorigs". He works with housemate and communications partner Victoria "Vika" Olsen; the pair are led by mission director Sally aboard the Tet, a giant space station orbiting Earth aiding humanity's colonization of Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Although his [[Mindwipe|memory has been wiped]], Jack has recurring dreams and visions of an unknown dark-haired woman.

Jack discovers that the scavengers have been using the [[Empire State Building]]'s antenna to transmit coordinates to outer space. Later, while resting at a secret lakeside house, he sees an unknown spacecraft, the ''Odyssey''<nowiki/>, crash-land on Earth. He investigates, noting the ship looks to be pre-war, finding humans in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis chambers]], one of which is the woman from his dreams. A drone arrives to destroy the chambers; however, Jack protects her chamber and brings the woman back to revive her, learning that her name is Julia. Jack and Julia return to the crash site to recover ''Odyssey''<nowiki/>'s [[flight recorder]] but are captured by the scavengers.

The two are taken to their headquarters at the [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]], where the scavengers are revealed to be human survivors. Their leader, Malcolm Beech, wants Jack to reprogram their captured drone to carry nuclear fuel cells to blow up the Tet. Though Jack refuses, Beech releases them to seek the truth beyond the boundaries of the forbidden radiation zone. When they reach the Empire State Building, Julia reveals that she is his wife, causing Jack to remember him proposing to her there.

When the two return to Jack's tower, Vika refuses them entry and reports her findings to Sally, saying they are "no longer an effective team." Sally acknowledges this, activating a drone that kills Vika before Julia shoots it down. Jack and Julia escape in his ship but are shot down by other pursuing drones. The two eject into the radiation zone, discovering another ship with a technician—a clone of himself who goes by "Tech 52". Jack fights and successfully incapacitates his clone, though Julia is accidentally shot in the commotion. Flying to Tech 52's tower, he discovers another Vika clone whom he briefly converses with before flying back with medical supplies to treat Julia. He then takes Julia to the lake house where the two rest before traveling back to the scavenger base.

At the scavenger base, Beech reveals to Jack and Julia that the Tet is an alien [[artificial intelligence]] that destroyed the Moon before invading Earth with thousands of Jack clones and drones, seeking to acquire all of Earth's natural resources and wipe out humanity in the process. As Jack repairs the captured drone, the base is attacked by other drones, gravely injuring Beech and damaging the captured drone beyond repair.

Jack flies to the Tet directly to deliver Julia, in her stasis chamber, to it. On the way to the Tet, Jack listens to the ''Odyssey''<nowiki/>'s flight recorder, learning the truth about him and his mission: he was the mission's commander while Vika was his co-pilot, Sally being their mission director on Earth. When the Tet was discovered, their ship was diverted from its original mission of exploring [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] to gather information on it. When the Tet started to draw in their ship despite an emergency engine burn to back away, Jack jettisoned ''Odyssey''<nowiki/>'s sleep module containing the rest of the mission's crew (including Julia) so that it would return to Earth orbit automatically, leaving himself and Vika in the command module to be drawn into and thus captured by the Tet.

Back in the present, Jack reaches the center of the Tet, and discovers thousands of chambers containing clones of himself and Vika in stasis. He then opens the chamber which contains not Julia but rather Beech and a bomb made from the Odyssey's fuel cell which they then detonate, killing themselves and destroying the Tet. On Earth, Julia awakens at the lake house. Three years later, she and her daughter meet the resistance members and "Tech 52" Jack.

Kosinski wanted to film a cinematic adaptation of the graphic novel ''Oblivion'', which he started to co-write with Arvid Nelson for [[Radical Comics]]. The novel, however, was never finished, as Kosinski now admits that "It was just a stage in the project [of film development]". He explained in an interview with ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' that "partnership with Radical Comics allowed me to continue working on the story by developing a series of images and continuing to refine the story more over a period of years. Then I basically used all that development as a pitch kit to the studio. So even though we really never released it as an illustrated novel the story is being told as a film, which was always the intention."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27355 | title=CCI: KOSINSKI ILLUMINATES "OBLIVION" | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 22, 2010| author=Steve Sunu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/oblivion-based-on-the-non-existing-graphic-novel/ | title=Oblivion, Based On The Non-Existing Graphic Novel| publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]| date=April 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 12, 2013 | author=Rich Johnston}}</ref>

[[Walt Disney Pictures]], which produced Kosinski's previous direction ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'', acquired the ''Oblivion'' film adaptation rights from Radical Comics and Kosinski after a heated auction in August 2010. The film was a directing vehicle for Kosinski with Barry Levine producing and Jesse Berger as executive producer. Other studios that made bids on the film were Paramount, Fox's Chernin Entertainment and Universal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/toldja-disney-acquires-joe-kosinskis-oblivion | title=Disney Acquires Joseph Kosinski's Graphic Novel 'Oblivion' | publisher=Deadline | date=August 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 25, 2012 | author=Fleming, Mike}}</ref> Disney subsequently released the rights after realizing the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-rated]] film they envisioned, in line with their family-oriented reputation, would require too many story changes. [[Universal Pictures]], which had also bid for the original rights, then bought them from Kosinski and [[Radical Comics]] and authorized a PG-13 film version.<ref name="acquire">{{cite web | url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/tom-cruise-commits-to-100-million-universal-sci-fi-pic-oblivion-for-fall | title=Tom Cruise Commits To $100 Million Universal Sci-Fi Pic 'Oblivion' For Fall | publisher=Deadline | date=May 20, 2011 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | last=Fleming |first=Mike}}</ref>

The script for the film was originally written by Kosinski and [[William Monahan]] and underwent a first rewrite by [[Karl Gajdusek]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/karl-gajdusek-tapped-write-disney-168437 | title=Karl Gajdusek Tapped to Re-Write Disney's Horizons (Exclusive)|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 16, 2011 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | author=Kit, Borys}}</ref> When the film passed into Universal's hands, a final rewrite was done by [[Michael Arndt]], under the pen name "Michael deBruyn".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/01/24/olga-kurylenko-and-andrea-riseborough-added-to-tom-cruise-sci-fi-project | title=Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough Added To Tom Cruise Sci-Fi Project | publisher=Hey U Guys | date=January 24, 2012 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | author=Roper, Dave}}</ref> Universal was particularly appreciative of the script, saying, "It's one of the most beautiful scripts we've ever come across."<ref name="info">{{cite web | url= https://ew.com/article/2012/04/27/cinemacon-2012-tom-cruise-dives-from-heaven-to-hell-in-oblivion-footage/ | title=CinemaCon 2012: Tom Cruise dives from heaven to hell in ''Oblivion'' footage | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=May 8, 2012 | last=Breznican |first= Antony}}</ref>

The Bubble Ship operated by Cruise's main character, Jack 49, was inspired by the [[Bell 47]] helicopter (often colloquially referred to as a "bubble cockpit" helicopter), a utilitarian 1947 vehicle with a transparent round canopy that Kosinski saw in the lobby of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Manhattan]], and which he likened to a [[dragonfly]]. [[Daniel Simon]], who previously worked with Kosinski as the lead vehicle designer on ''Tron: Legacy'', was tasked with creating the Bubble Ship from this basis, incorporating elements evocative of an advanced fighter jet with the Bell 47 to create a light, functional vehicle that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, much as he observed with the ships in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name="HeroComplex"/>

"When Kubrick made ''2001'', rather than going to the hotshot concept designers of the day, he hired [[NASA]] engineers," said Simon. "I believe in form follows function. I'm not a fan of excessive decoration, of putting fins on something because it looks cool." Rather than employ digital models, Wild Factory, a Camarillo concept car company, built the Bubble Ship as a {{convert|25|foot|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|4000|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, mostly aluminum prop. Elements of the cockpit, such as the placement of the joystick and pedals, were customized for Cruise, who is a qualified pilot, and who had some input into the design. The craft was also made to be easy to disassemble and assemble, in order to facilitate transport to the Iceland shooting locations, where it would be mounted on a [[gimbal]] for shots of it flying. The unmanned aerial drones that figure prominently in the plot were created to appear to be in the same design family as the Bubble Ship.<ref name="HeroComplex">Keegan, Rebecca.

===Casting===
[[Tom Cruise]] had expressed interest in the film for a long time, and officially committed to it on May 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/21/tom-cruise-joins-oblivion_n_865052.html | title=Tom Cruise Joins ''Oblivion'', Joseph Kosinski's Sci-Fi Film | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=May 21, 2011 | accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>

For casting the lead role of Julia opposite Cruise, the producers considered five actresses: [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Brit Marling]], [[Noomi Rapace]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]], and all five auditioned on August 27, 2011.<ref name="casting">{{cite web | url= http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Joe-Kosinski-s-Oblivion-Renamed-Horizons-Again-Five-Hot-Actresses-Testing-For-Roles-26432.html | title=Joe Kosinski's Oblivion Renamed Horizons Again, Five Hot Actresses Testing For Roles | publisher=Cinema Blend | date=August 25, 2011 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | last=Rich |first= Katey}}</ref> It was subsequently announced that Chastain would play one of the film's two female leads. In January 2012 Chastain entered into talks for a part in the [[Kathryn Bigelow]] film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' and subsequently dropped out of ''Oblivion'' contention. It was later announced that the role had been given to Kurylenko.<ref name="lead">{{cite web | url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Jessica-Chastain-Out-Andrea-Riseborough-Olga-Kurylenko-Joseph-Kosinski-Next-Science-Fiction-Film-28946.html | title=Jessica Chastain Out, Andrea Riseborough And Olga Kurylenko In For Joseph Kosinski's Next Science Fiction Film | publisher=Cinema Blend | date=January 19, 2012 | accessdate=March 21, 2012 | last=Eisenberg |first= Eric}}</ref>

In preparation for the role, Kurylenko watched astronaut training videos as well as classic science fiction and romance films (such as ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'').<ref>{{cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=Olga Kurylenko talks "Oblivion," "To The Wonder," and "Erased"|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/04/olga-kurylenko-oblivion-interview|publisher=[[IFC Films|IFC.com]]|accessdate=April 25, 2013|date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> "What's funny is I actually watched ''Solaris''; Joseph never brought it up," said Kurylenko. "I come from [[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovsky]]-land, and at that point I hadn't watched it for many years. I watched [[Solaris (2002 film)|the new one]] as well, with [[George Clooney]] and [[Natascha McElhone]].

For the other leading role, Victoria, the producers initially considered [[Hayley Atwell]], [[Diane Kruger]] and [[Kate Beckinsale]]. The three actresses traveled to [[Pittsburgh]] to screen-test with Cruise, who was filming ''[[Jack Reacher (film)|Jack Reacher]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://movies.ign.com/articles/121/1210765p1.html | title=Cruise's Oblivion Eyes Leading Lady | publisher= Newscorp | work= [[IGN]] | date=October 26, 2011 | accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> The role finally went to [[Andrea Riseborough]].

As well as showcasing Iceland's volcanic landscapes, the film's director Joseph Kosinski sought to take advantage of the round-the-clock light, in particular the 6pm to 1am waning light known as "[[Golden hour (photography)|magic hour]]", to "bring sci-fi out into the daylight", in contrast with films such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', which spent their time in dark hulls or benighted planets.<ref name="HeroComplex" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/oblivion-cruise-kosinski-set-for-hero-complex-imax-screening/|title='Oblivion': Cruise, Kosinski set for Hero Complex Imax screening|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=April 14, 2013}}</ref>

The single most difficult scene to film was when Harper takes a break to admire the view and waters a flower. It was filmed by having Cruise sit next to an {{convert|800|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} drop at the top of Iceland's Jarlhettur on the root of [[Langjökull]], which is accessible only by helicopter.<ref>Ethan Sacks, [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tom-cruise-dangerous-stunt-oblivion-article-1.1318620 "Tom Cruise’s most dangerous stunt in ‘Oblivion’?

For the Sky Tower set (built on a soundstage in Baton Rouge), Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda worked closely with visual special-effects house [[Pixomondo]] to establish both environment and lighting by the use of 21 front-screen projectors aimed at a huge wraparound backdrop to form one continuous image, rather than [[Chroma key|blue screen]] backdrops.<ref name="vfrei">Vincent Frei, [http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=4213 "OBLIVION: Bjørn Mayer – VFX Supervisor – Pixomondo"], ''Art of VFX'', April 16, 2013.</ref> The backdrop consisted of a single seamless piece of painted white [[muslin]], {{convert|500|by|42|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which was wrapped around the set for 270-degree coverage.<ref name="JFauer" />  This enabled the full environment to be captured in camera, and assisted in lighting up to 90 percent of the set.<ref name="CMiranda" />

Had blue screen been used on the "glass house" Sky Tower, the glass would have disappeared into the blue lighting, and would have had to be reproduced digitally in post-production.<ref name="JFauer" />  The actors enjoyed working in the environment, as they could look outside and actually see sunrise or sunset imagery.<ref name="JFauer" /> This new technique allowed them to cut down on both the effects shots, which ended up at around 800 in total, and the expenses. Even the "control table" which Victoria operates was filmed then displayed on a large screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski-on-sci-fi-filmmaking/|title=Interview: 'Oblivion' Director Joseph Kosinski on Sci-Fi Filmmaking|work=firstshowing.net|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

To obtain the necessary footage to create the illusion that the Sky Tower set was sitting high above the clouds, Pixomondo sent a crew to film the view from the peak of [[Haleakalā]] in [[Hawaii]] for four days with three Red Epic cameras mounted side-by-side on a single rig.<ref name="vfrei" />  Pixomondo's Stuttgart office then stitched together the data from the three cameras to form a single gigantic video stream (with each still image consisting of 26 megapixels), and produced a variety of different time-of-day clips to be projected on the set.<ref name="vfrei" />

===Music===
On June 28, 2012, it was announced that French electronic band [[M83 (band)|M83]] would compose the soundtrack for ''Oblivion''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Exclusive: M83 Scoring Joseph Kosinski's Sci-Fi Film 'Oblivion' Starring Tom Cruise|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-m83-scoring-joseph-kosinskis-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise-20120628#|publisher=[[The Playlist]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013|date=June 28, 2012}}</ref> On why he chose M83 to score the film, director Joseph Kosinski said, "I went back and I found my first treatment for ''Oblivion'' from 2005 and it had listed in the treatment a soundtrack of M83. Obviously the ''Tron: Legacy'' collaboration with [[Daft Punk]] worked out as good as I would have ever hoped, [so] I wanted to do something similar in that I'm pulling an artist from outside the movie business to create an original sound for this film." Kosinski continued, "Daft Punk's music wouldn't make sense for this movie. It had to be an artist whose music fit the themes and story I was trying to tell. And M83's music I felt was fresh and original, and big and epic, but at the same time emotional and this is a very emotional film and it felt like a good fit."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Exclusive: Joseph Kosinski Talks OBLIVION, Working with Tom Cruise, Getting M83 to Compose the Score, the Film's Unique Design, the IMAX Release & More|url=http://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-m83-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=April 24, 2013|date=December 30, 2012}}</ref>

To guide Anthony Gonzalez of M83 through the scoring process, director Kosinski brought in [[Joseph Trapanese]], who co-wrote the score alongside Gonzalez. Kosinski states, "Together they have created the score that I have dreamed about since I first put this story down on paper eight years ago."<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=101262 "Listen to a Track From the ''Oblivion Score''"]. [[ComingSoon.net]].

Retrieved May 22, 2013.</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez said, "I started to write the soundtrack just reading the script, and then when you get the picture in, it's different, and you kind of switch to another vibe and change stuff and start experimenting a lot with the music." Gonzalez added, "I worked with Joseph a lot, and he's very particular about the music in his movies, so we spent a lot of time talking about music and working the arrangements together."<ref>{{cite web|last=Baltin|first=Steve|title=M83 Enter 'Oblivion' With Tom Cruise: At Grammys, French group talk soundtrack debut|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m83-enter-oblivion-with-tom-cruise-20130213|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013|date=February 13, 2013}}</ref>

==Distribution==
===Marketing===
Details about ''Oblivion'' were kept secret, though the studio was said to have been "very excited" about the film. Promotions began April 2012, with a part of the footage being screened at the [[CinemaCon|2012 CinemaCon]] despite the fact that filming had begun just one month prior to the event. The footage was described as "a combination of early concept art, rough animation, and unfinished [[dailies]]," showcasing a glimpse of the film's landscapes.<ref name="info" />

===Theatrical release===
''Oblivion'' was first presented in [[Buenos Aires]] on March 26, 2013, [[Dublin]] on April 3, and in [[Hollywood]] on April 10 at the [[Dolby Theatre]] where Cruise himself announced before the screening that the film was actually the first feature to be mixed completely "from start to finish" in the latest state-of-the-art [[Dolby Atmos]] surround sound.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[RTÉ]] |url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2013/0403/cruiset.html |title=Cruise in Dublin for movie and Irish roots |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}</ref>

Tasha Robinson from ''[[The A.V.

[[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' calls the film "...imperfect but some of its imperfections result from being overly ambitious."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Bill Goodykoontz from the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' states that the film "...may not live up fully to its grand ambitions, but it isn't for lack of trying."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Jake Coyle of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' states that "...[f]or those who enjoy the simple thrill of handsomely stylized image-making, ''Oblivion'' is mostly mesmerizing."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Alan Scherstuhl from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' states that "...&nbsp;Kosinski proves himself talented in ways his ''Tron: Legacy'' didn't suggest."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Kenneth Turan]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "[m]ore adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, ''Oblivion'' makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn't let you go."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Michael O'Sullivan of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' states that "...[i]f you're able to forgive and forget, ''Oblivion'' isn't a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Steven Rea]] of the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' states that "[Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' states that the film "...gives us stars in the cast, stars in our eyes and it even tweaks a brain cell or three."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Colin Covert from the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' states that the "....film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors - Kubrick, Lucas, the Wachowskis and Pixar could be listed as creative consultants - but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi, not an opportunistic mash-up."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Cary Darling of the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' states that the film is "stitched together from spare bits of other, often better films, stumbl[ing] awkwardly in story and plot, shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet... ''Oblivion'' is so beautiful to look at."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' stated that "[i]n space, Jack [Harper] hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' states that the film "[f]eels ever more grounded and stuck."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Richard Roeper]] of Richard Roeper.com called it the "...sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Tom Charity of [[CNN.com]] called it "[g]lossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[J.

Tom Long of the ''[[Detroit News]]'' states that "Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end)." Long states that "...a great deal is derivative, but it's fast-moving derivative."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' states that the movie "...combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' states that "...Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot.
