'''''Oblivion''''' is a 2013 American [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[action-adventure film]] produced and directed by [[Joseph Kosinski]] from a screenplay by [[Karl Gajdusek]] and [[Michael deBruyn]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] in the main role alongside [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], and [[Melissa Leo]] in supporting roles. Based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel of the same name, the film pays homage to 1970s sci-fi, and is a "love story" set in 2077 on an Earth desolated by an alien war; a maintenance technician on the verge of completing his mission finds a woman who survived from a space ship crash, leading him to question his purpose and discover the truth about the war.{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comicsbeat.com/that-oblivion-graphic-novel-will-probably-never-be-published/ |title=That Oblivion "graphic novel" will probably never be PUBLISHED |last=MACDONALD |first=HEIDI |date=2013-04-01 |website=The BEAT |language=EN-US |access-date=2019-07-31 |archive-date=May 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513013504/https://www.comicsbeat.com/that-oblivion-graphic-novel-will-probably-never-be-published/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/cci-kosinski-illuminates-oblivion/ |title=CCI: Kosinski Illuminates "Oblivion" {{!}} CBR |website=WWW.CBR.COM |date=July 22, 2010 |access-date=2019-07-31 |archive-date=July 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731210403/https://www.cbr.com/cci-kosinski-illuminates-oblivion/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-disney-tron-legacy-sean-bailey/ |title=Disney Locks Down OBLIVION for TRON: LEGACY Director Joseph KOSINSKI |last=GOLDBERG |first=MATT |date=2010-08-04 |website=COLLIER |language=EN-US |access-date=2019-07-31 |archive-date=January 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105142743/https://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-disney-tron-legacy-sean-bailey/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/film-interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski/ |title=/Film Interview: 'Oblivion' Director Joseph KOSINSKI |date=2013-04-19 |website=/FILM |language=EN-US |access-date=2019-07-31 |archive-date=July 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731210404/https://www.slashfilm.com/film-interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://podtail.com/podcast/gibop/oblivion-2013/ Director Joseph Kosinski and actor Tom Cruise talk about Oblivion (2013).]</ref>}}

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, it is desireable to keep the plot summary between 400 and 700 words. This is only a guideline, it is not a policy or rule.-->
In 2017, scavenger aliens destroyed the [[Moon]] and invaded [[Earth]]; although humans won the war, the use of nuclear weapons left the Earth uninhabitable. 

In 2077, repair technician Jack and communications officer Victoria appear to be the last people left on Earth. Jack repairs [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]] that hunt the remaining scavengers and guard hydrothermal platforms that convert seawater into [[fusion energy]]. The work is reported to Sally, the commander aboard the "Tet", a space station orbiting Earth. Within two weeks, the group will be departing for Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] to join colonists there. Though Jack and Victoria's memories have been wiped, Jack dreams of a pre-war life with an unknown woman.

Jack escapes a scavenger trap while searching for a disabled drone inside the [[New York Public Library]] ruins. Later, in the night, a hydrothermal platform is destroyed. Jack discovers that the scavengers are radioing coordinates from the [[Empire State Building|Empire State Building's]] antenna and sending the transmission into space. He occasionally visits a secluded lake filled with vegetation and a lakeside cabin he built filled with mementos of Earth's past.

An object falls from the sky to the coordinates. Jack finds five humans in sleep pods, including the woman from his dreams. A drone destroys four pods, but Jack prevents it from killing the woman and takes her to his and Victoria's aerial base. The woman, Julia, is a NASA astronaut who has been in [[Suspended animation in fiction|suspended animation]] aboard the Odyssey spaceship for the past 60 years.

Jack and Julia retrieve the Odyssey's [[flight recorder]] but are captured by scavengers and taken to the [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]]. The leader, Malcolm, reveals that the scavengers are disguised human survivors hiding from the drones. He frees Jack and Julia and insists on visiting the desert area that Jack knows as the deadly Radiation Zone so that they can discover the truth for themselves. Julia helps Jack recall that she is his wife.

Victoria sends a jet to retrieve Jack and Julia. Seeing their closeness, she reports to Sally that she and Jack are no longer "an effective team". Sally dispatches a drone that kills Victoria. Jack and Julia flee in the jet and destroy the drones chasing them, but they crash in the desert dubbed as "Radiation Zone", where they discover another clone of Jack arriving to fix disabled drones. Jack incapacitates him, but Julia is shot during their fight. Jack impersonates the clone to return to its base for medical supplies, where he encounters a clone of Victoria. Jack takes Julia to his cabin, where she recovers.

Back at Raven Rock, Malcolm tells them the Tet is an alien [[machine intelligence]] ship that is extracting the planet's resources. The moon's destruction caused catastrophic disasters on Earth, followed by an invasion from thousands of Jack clones. The Titan colony and humanity's victory are fictional. The survivors brought down the Odyssey spaceship for its [[nuclear reactor]] to craft a bomb. Jack reprograms a captured drone to deliver the bomb to Tet, but other drones attack the base, destroying the captured drone and gravely injuring Malcolm. Jack and Julia volunteer to deliver the bomb to the Tet manually.

En-route to Tet, Jack learns that he was a clone of the NASA mission commander, Jack Harper, who was on a mission to explore Titan. Victoria was his co-pilot, his wife Julia a crew member, and Sally the Earth mission director. After the mission was interrupted by the Tet's arrival, Jack separated the control capsule to save the crew members in their stasis pods. He and Victoria were captured and cloned.

Jack enters Tet and offers Julia to the Tet's projection of Sally, but Malcolm instead emerges from the pod; the Tet would only let Jack on board if it sensed another life-form in the pod, and they set off the bomb, destroying the Tet. Julia awakens in her pod by the cabin.

Three years later, Julia and her and Jack's daughter are living in the cabin. Survivors arrive with the help of the clone that Jack previously subdued in the desert. The clone has also recovered the original Jack's memories.

==Cast==
* [[Tom Cruise]] as Jack Harper—Tech 49, a technician who works to repair drones on Earth and questions his mission. Originally, he was the American commander of a mission en route to Titan who was captured by the Tet and cloned to fight humanity. Cruise also plays Jack Harper—Tech 52, a clone who seeks out Julia after the destruction of the Tet.
* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Malcolm Beech, an American veteran soldier and leader of a large community of scavengers, the human survivors of the alien Tet's attacks.
* [[Olga Kurylenko]] as Julia Rusakova Harper, Jack's wife and a Russian crew member on the ''Odyssey'', who was sent back towards Earth by her husband to protect her from the initial contact with the Tet.
* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Victoria "Vika" Olsen, Jack's communications partner and housemate. Originally, she was the British co-pilot of Jack's mission to Titan who was captured and cloned to assist in the Tet's war on humanity. Riseborough also plays a clone of Vika who Jack misleads to obtain medical supplies.
* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Sergeant Sykes, the main military commander of Beech's community of scavengers who is skeptical of Jack at first.
* [[Melissa Leo]] as the Tet, an alien artificial intelligence seeking to acquire Earth's natural resources and wipe out humanity. Leo also plays Sally, the mission director of Jack and Julia's mission to Titan; her likeness was copied by the Tet to serve as its visual and auditory representation.
* [[Zoë Bell]] as Kara, a soldier and member of the scavengers.

[[Joseph Kosinski]] started the movie process by beginning work on a graphic novel called ''Oblivion'' featuring his story. While the completion of this would be teased to the public and the concept was used to pitch the movie, it was never finished and Kosinski claims he never intended to, stating it was "just a stage in the project [of film development]". Arvid Nelson was billed as co-writer and [[Radical Comics]] was attached as publisher. The novel was never finished; Kosinski explaining: "the partnership with Radical Comics allowed me to continue working on the story by developing a series of images and continuing to refine the story more over a period of years. Then I basically used all that development as a pitch kit to the studio. So even though we really never released it as an illustrated novel the story is being told as a film, which was always the intention."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27355 | title=CCI: KOSINSKI ILLUMINATES "OBLIVION" | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 22, 2010 | author=Steve Sunu | access-date=November 15, 2012 | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063245/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27355 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/oblivion-based-on-the-non-existing-graphic-novel/ | title=Oblivion, Based On The Non-Existing Graphic Novel | publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]] | date=April 12, 2013 | access-date=April 12, 2013 | author=Rich Johnston | archive-date=April 14, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414230501/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/oblivion-based-on-the-non-existing-graphic-novel | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/joseph-kosinski-oblivion/ | title=Joseph Kosinski on Oblivion | date=March 31, 2013 }}</ref>

[[Walt Disney Pictures]], which produced Kosinski's previous film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010), acquired the ''Oblivion'' film adaptation rights from Radical Comics and Kosinski after a heated auction in August 2010. The film was a directing vehicle for Kosinski, with Barry Levine producing, and Jesse Berger executive producing. Other studios that made bids on the film were [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/toldja-disney-acquires-joe-kosinskis-oblivion | title=Disney Acquires Joseph Kosinski's Graphic Novel 'Oblivion' | publisher=Deadline | date=August 4, 2010 | access-date=March 25, 2012 | author=Fleming, Mike | archive-date=January 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105211725/http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/toldja-disney-acquires-joe-kosinskis-oblivion/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Disney subsequently released the rights after realizing the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-rated]] film they envisioned, in line with their family-oriented reputation, would require too many story changes. Universal, which had also bid for the original rights, then bought them from Kosinski and Radical and authorized a PG-13 film version.<ref name="acquire">{{cite web | url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/05/tom-cruise-commits-to-100-million-universal-sci-fi-pic-oblivion-for-fall | title=Tom Cruise Commits To $100 Million Universal Sci-Fi Pic 'Oblivion' For Fall | publisher=Deadline | date=May 20, 2011 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | last=Fleming | first=Mike | archive-date=January 6, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201256/http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/tom-cruise-commits-to-100-million-universal-sci-fi-pic-oblivion-for-fall/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

The film's script was originally written by Kosinski and [[William Monahan]] and underwent a first rewrite by [[Karl Gajdusek]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/karl-gajdusek-tapped-write-disney-168437 | title=Karl Gajdusek Tapped to Re-Write Disney's Horizons (Exclusive) | newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 16, 2011 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | author=Kit, Borys | archive-date=October 26, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026084531/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/karl-gajdusek-tapped-write-disney-168437 | url-status=live }}</ref> When the film passed into Universal's hands, a final rewrite was done by [[Michael Arndt]], under the pen name "Michael deBruyn".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/01/24/olga-kurylenko-and-andrea-riseborough-added-to-tom-cruise-sci-fi-project | title=Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough Added To Tom Cruise Sci-Fi Project | publisher=Hey U Guys | date=January 24, 2012 | access-date=March 21, 2012 | author=Roper, Dave | archive-date=March 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321121719/http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2012/01/24/olga-kurylenko-and-andrea-riseborough-added-to-tom-cruise-sci-fi-project/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Universal was particularly appreciative of the script, saying, "It's one of the most beautiful scripts we've ever come across."<ref name="info">{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/2012/04/27/cinemacon-2012-tom-cruise-dives-from-heaven-to-hell-in-oblivion-footage/ | title=CinemaCon 2012: Tom Cruise dives from heaven to hell in ''Oblivion'' footage | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=April 27, 2012 | access-date=May 8, 2012 | last=Breznican | first=Antony | archive-date=November 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126234627/http://www.ew.com/article/2012/04/27/cinemacon-2012-tom-cruise-dives-from-heaven-to-hell-in-oblivion-footage | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Bubble Ship operated by Cruise's main character, Jack 49, was inspired by the [[Bell 47]] helicopter (often colloquially referred to as a "bubble cockpit" helicopter), a utilitarian 1947 vehicle with a transparent round canopy that Kosinski saw in the lobby of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Manhattan]], and which he likened to a [[dragonfly]]. [[Daniel Simon]], who previously worked with Kosinski as the lead vehicle designer on ''Tron: Legacy'', was tasked with creating the Bubble Ship from this basis, incorporating elements evocative of an advanced fighter jet with the Bell 47 to create a light, functional vehicle that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, much as he observed with the ships in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968).<ref name="HeroComplex"/>

"When Kubrick made ''2001'', rather than going to the hotshot concept designers of the day, he hired [[NASA]] engineers", said Simon. "I believe in [[form follows function]]. I'm not a fan of excessive decoration, of putting fins on something because it looks cool". Rather than employ digital models, Wild Factory, a Camarillo concept car company, built the Bubble Ship as a {{convert|25|foot|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|4000|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, mostly aluminum prop. Elements of the cockpit, such as the placement of the joystick and pedals, were customized for Cruise, who is a qualified pilot, and who had some input into the design. The craft was also made to be easy to disassemble and assemble, to facilitate transport to Iceland shooting locations, where it would be mounted on a [[gimbal]] for shots of it flying. The unmanned aerial drones that were featured prominently in the plot were created to appear to be in the same design family as the Bubble Ship.<ref name="HeroComplex">Keegan, Rebecca.

For the Sky Tower set (built on a soundstage in Baton Rouge), Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda worked closely with visual special-effects house [[Pixomondo]] to establish both environment and lighting by the use of 21 front-screen projectors aimed at a huge wraparound backdrop to form one continuous image, rather than [[Chroma key|blue screen]] backdrops.<ref name="vfrei">Vincent Frei, [http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=4213 "OBLIVION: Bjørn Mayer – VFX Supervisor – Pixomondo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422050133/http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=4213 |date=April 22, 2013 }}, ''Art of VFX'', April 16, 2013.</ref> The backdrop consisted of a single seamless piece of painted white [[muslin]], {{convert|500|by|42|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which was wrapped around the set for 270-degree coverage.<ref name="JFauer" /> This enabled the full environment to be captured in camera, and assisted in lighting up to 90 percent of the set.<ref name="CMiranda" />

Had blue screen been used on the "glass house" Sky Tower, the glass would have disappeared into the blue lighting, and would have had to be reproduced digitally in post-production.<ref name="JFauer" /> The actors enjoyed working in the environment, as they could look outside and actually see the sunrise or sunset imagery.<ref name="JFauer" /> This new technique allowed them to cut down on both the effects shots, which ended up at around 800 in total, and the expenses. Even the "control table" which Victoria operates was filmed then displayed on a large screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski-on-sci-fi-filmmaking/|title=Interview: 'Oblivion' Director Joseph Kosinski on Sci-Fi Filmmaking|work=FirstShowing|date=April 29, 2013 |access-date=September 9, 2016|archive-date=June 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610044640/http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/interview-oblivion-director-joseph-kosinski-on-sci-fi-filmmaking/|url-status=live}}</ref>

To obtain the necessary footage to create the illusion that the Sky Tower set was sitting high above the clouds, Pixomondo sent a crew to film the view from the peak of [[Haleakalā]] in [[Hawaii]] for four days with three Red Epic cameras mounted side by side on a single rig.<ref name="vfrei" /> Pixomondo's Stuttgart office then stitched together the data from the three cameras to form a single gigantic video stream (with each still image consisting of 26 megapixels) and produced a variety of different time-of-day clips to be projected on the set.<ref name="vfrei" />

On June 28, 2012, it was announced that French electronic act [[M83 (band)|M83]], consisting solely of Anthony Gonzalez at the time, would compose the soundtrack for ''Oblivion''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Exclusive: M83 Scoring Joseph Kosinski's Sci-Fi Film 'Oblivion' Starring Tom Cruise|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-m83-scoring-joseph-kosinskis-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise-20120628#|publisher=[[The Playlist]]|access-date=April 24, 2013|date=June 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426155552/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-m83-scoring-joseph-kosinskis-oblivion-starring-tom-cruise-20120628|archive-date=April 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On why he chose M83 to score the film, director Joseph Kosinski said, "I went back and I found my first treatment for ''Oblivion'' from 2005 and it had listed in the treatment a soundtrack of M83. Obviously, the ''Tron: Legacy'' collaboration with [[Daft Punk]] worked out as good as I would have ever hoped, [so] I wanted to do something similar in that I'm pulling an artist from outside the movie business to create an original sound for this film." Kosinski continued, "Daft Punk's music wouldn't make sense for this movie. It had to be an artist whose music fit the themes and story I was trying to tell. And M83's music I felt was fresh and original, and big and epic, but at the same time emotional and this is a very emotional film and it felt like a good fit."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Exclusive: Joseph Kosinski Talks OBLIVION, Working with Tom Cruise, Getting M83 to Compose the Score, the Film's Unique Design, the IMAX Release & More|url=https://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-m83-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=April 24, 2013|date=December 30, 2012|archive-date=April 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421132526/http://collider.com/joseph-kosinski-oblivion-m83-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gonzalez said, "I started to write the soundtrack just reading the script, and then when you get the picture in, it's different, and you kind of switch to another vibe and change stuff and start experimenting a lot with the music."

Details about ''Oblivion'' were kept secret, though the studio was said to have been "very excited" about the film. Promotions began in April 2012, with a part of the footage being screened at the [[CinemaCon|2012 CinemaCon]] even though filming had begun just one month before the event.

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated "''Oblivion'' is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action".<ref>{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Oblivion review - The Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/oblivion/review/435551|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414102120/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/oblivion/review/435551|url-status=live}}</ref> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "Insofar as ''Oblivion'' is first and foremost a visual experience, a movie to be seen rather than a puzzle to be deciphered, its chief pleasures are essentially spoiler-proof."<ref>{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Justin|title=Oblivion review - Variety|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-oblivion-1200339595/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415081501/http://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-oblivion-1200339595/|url-status=live}}</ref> Kevin Harley of ''[[Total Film]]'' gave the film three stars and said "It isn't a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] or reimagining, refreshingly, but ''Oblivion'' plays like a stylised remix of superior sci-fi ground-breakers".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harley|first=Kevin|title=Oblivion review - Total Film|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/oblivion|publisher=[[Total Film]]|date=April 10, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-date=April 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413115125/http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/oblivion|url-status=live}}</ref> Andrew O'Hehir of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' praised it as a "sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me – and many other people, I suspect – to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oblivion_2013/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Oblivion|work=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 9, 2016|archive-date=May 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530051441/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oblivion_2013/reviews/?type=top_critics|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tasha Robinson from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' states that an "unsettling sense of not-quite-right coats all of the film's steely surfaces, and Kosinski and his co-writers give audiences plenty of time to absorb the unease and gear up for the action".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Some reviewers noted the filmmakers' ambition. [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' calls the film "imperfect but some of its imperfections result from being overly ambitious".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Bill Goodykoontz from the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' states that the film "may not live up fully to its grand ambitions, but it isn't for lack of trying".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Jake Coyle of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' states that "[f]or those who enjoy the simple thrill of handsomely stylized image-making, ''Oblivion'' is mostly mesmerizing."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Alan Scherstuhl from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' states that "Kosinski proves himself talented in ways his ''Tron: Legacy'' didn't suggest."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Kenneth Turan]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "[m]ore adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole, ''Oblivion'' makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didn't let you go."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' states that "[i]f you're able to forgive and forget, ''Oblivion'' isn't a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Steven Rea]] of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' states that "[Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' states that the film "gives us stars in the cast, stars in our eyes and it even tweaks a brain cell or three".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Colin Covert from the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' states that the "film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors – [[Kubrick]], [[George Lucas|Lucas]], [[the Wachowskis]], and [[Pixar]] could be listed as creative consultants – but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi, not an opportunistic mash-up".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Cary Darling of the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' states that the film is "stitched together from spare bits of other, often better films, stumbl[ing] awkwardly in story and plot, shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet... ''Oblivion'' is so beautiful to look at."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that "[i]n space, Jack [Harper] hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' states that the film "[f]eels ever more grounded and stuck."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Richard Roeper]] of Richard Roeper.com called it the "sci-fi movie equivalent of a pretty damn good cover band".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Tom Charity of [[CNN.com]] called it "[g]lossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[J. R. Jones]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' states that the "story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes but, as with so many other Cruise productions, the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Rick Groen of Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called it "an okay blockbuster, a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Tom Long of the ''[[Detroit News]]'' states that "Kosinski offers plenty of action here, and he lets the plot reveals bleed out slowly (explanations keep coming right to the end)." Long states that "a great deal is derivative, but it's fast-moving derivative".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' states that the movie "combines a lot of different films, yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' states that "Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot. It's a dazzler, but the story lacks the impact of the futuristic look."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' states that the "mystery posed by ''Oblivion'' as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily and worked out so murkily".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the "agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden, but now it's just, well, dispiriting".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Rafer Guzman of ''[[Newsday]]'' states that "[p]laying spot-the-influence is the most fun you'll have during this expensive-looking, slow-moving plod through familiar territory."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Joe Williams of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' states that "[i]nstead of developing characters, Kosinski pours most of his imagination into the annihilated landscapes and futuristic gadgetry."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' states that "[w]hen you go to a futuristic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic barn dance starring Tom Cruise and his space guns, you expect a little zap with your thoughtful pauses."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calls it "arid and antiseptic, untouched by human hands".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>

Rene Rodriguez of the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' states that the "filmmakers don't even have the courage to see the story to its proper end, opting for a ridiculous finale that feels vaguely insulting".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Soren Anderson from ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' states that "[y]ou start wondering whether director Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn have any original ideas of their own. And then you realize they don't."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Randy Myers of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' states that the "mix of gee-whiz gadgetry and the day-to-day routineness of Jack and Victoria's lives is interesting enough, but the film is too glacially paced for it to work".<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/> Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' states that "[a]ll the eye candy in the world can't mask the sensation that you've seen this all before...and done better. Too bad the movie's script wasn't given the same attention as its sleek, brave-new-world look."<ref name="rottentomatoes.com"/>
