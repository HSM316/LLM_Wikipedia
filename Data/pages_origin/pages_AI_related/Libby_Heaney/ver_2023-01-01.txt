== Artistic career ==
In 2013 Heaney returned to the UK and completed a master's degree at the [[University of the Arts London]]. She studied arts and science at [[Central Saint Martins]] and graduated in 2015.<ref name=":0" /> She then became a lecturer at the [[Royal College of Art]], teaching Information Experience Design.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/dr-libby-heaney/|title=Dr Libby Heaney|website=rca.ac.uk|publisher=Royal College of Art|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> In 2016, she created ''Tinderbot'' which presented [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] conversations between real users and AI bots programmed using ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. ''Tinderbot'' was covered by [[BBC News]], [[TheJournal.ie]] and the [[Irish Examiner]] and was exhibited at [[The Lowry]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |date=2017-11-16 |title=When Lady Chatterley joined Tinder |language=en-GB |website=bbc.com |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41995722 |access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=deBurca Butler |first=Jonathan |date=2017-02-14 |title=New exhibition addresses the blurring of the lines between humanity and the digital world |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/new-exhibition-addresses-the-blurring-of-the-lines-between-humanity-and-the-digital-world-442890.html |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=irishexaminer.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Murray |first=Sean |title=Lady Chatterley's Tinderbot: Modern dating at Dublin's Science Gallery |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/science-gallery-exhibits-3230398-Feb2017/ |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=TheJournal.ie |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title={{!}} The Lowry |url=https://thelowry.com/exhibitions/humansbeingdigital |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=thelowry.com}}</ref> In 2017, Heaney was commissionned by [[Sky Arts]] and the [[Barbican Centre]] to design ''Britbot,'' an [[internet bot]] built using [[artificial intelligence]] and the citizenship book ''Life in the UK: a guide for new residents.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=Britbot |url=https://www.britbot.org/ |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=britbot.org}}</ref>''  The book, a manual for the citizenship test, has been described by Heaney as being "largely a white male privileged version of British history and culture".<ref>{{Cite web |title=LIBBY HEANEY, art and quantum computing {{!}} CLOT Magazine |url=https://www.clotmag.com/interviews/libby-heaney-when-quantum-computing-is-more-than-a-tool |access-date=2022-12-09 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The bot created a test for the public, learnt from their responses and assesses how British they are.<ref name=":0" />  She was awarded an [[Arts Council England]] grant to widen participation of the Britbot to social media.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About - Britbot |url=https://www.britbot.org/about |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=britbot.org}}</ref> Heaney has exhibited her chatterbots at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=noisy chatterbots |url=https://digitransglasgow.github.io/ArtificiallyIntelligent/contributions/15_Noisy.html |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=github.io |publisher=ArtificiallyIntelligent |language=en-US}}</ref> She has created quantum physics inspired artwork for [[Science Gallery]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and [[Light Art Space (LAS)]] in Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fake - Science Gallery |url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/fake/?page=quantum-fake |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=dublin.sciencegallery.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=V&A · Art, Science and Quantum Computing |url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/event/dQLoj98D/art-science-and-quantum-computing |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=vam.ac.uk |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Brown |first=Kate |date=2022-02-11 |title=Is It Time to Rethink the Art Exhibition?

== Major works ==

=== ''Ent-'' and ''The Evolution of Ent-: QX'' (2022) ===
In 2022, Libby Heaney was commissioned by [[Light Art Space]] to create ''Ent-'', a 360 immersive installation that revisits [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch’s]] ''Garden of Earthly Delights'' through quantum''.''<ref>{{Cite web |last=Space (LAS) |first=Light Art |title=LIGHT ART SPACE (LAS) {{!}} Ent- |url=https://lightartspace.org/programme/ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Light Art Space (LAS) |language=en}}</ref> The work uses quantum computing as both a medium and a paradigm through which to conceive human and non-human relations. 

''Ent-'' was exhibited at [[Light Art Space|LAS]], [[Prix Ars Electronica|Ars Electronica]], and arebyte gallery in London.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Space (LAS) |first=Light Art |title=LIGHT ART SPACE (LAS) {{!}} Ent- |url=https://lightartspace.org/programme/ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Light Art Space (LAS) |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ent- |url=https://ars.electronica.art/planetb/de/ent/ |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Welcome to Planet B |language=de-DE}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |title=arebyte Gallery — The Evolution of Ent-: QX |url=https://www.arebyte.com/evolution-of-ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=arebyte Gallery |language=en-US}}</ref>The work was also modified to fit a full dome projection at the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, projected onto a public facade in Seoul, and turned into a playable version for an exhibition at Nahmad Contemporary in New York.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EVERY KIND OF WIND: CALDER AND THE 21ST CENTURY - Curated by Kelly Taxter - Exhibitions - Nahmad Contemporary |url=https://www.nahmadcontemporary.com/exhibitions/every-kind-of-wind-calder-and-the-21st-century |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=www.nahmadcontemporary.com |language=en}}</ref> 

In 2022, ''Ent''- won the [[Lumen Prize]] immersive environment award.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Enter the Winners |url=https://www.lumenprize.com/blog/enter-the-winners |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=The Lumen Prize |language=en-GB}}</ref> 

''The Evolution of Ent-:QX,'' first displayed at arebyte gallery in London, builds on ''Ent-'' and imagines a fictional quantum computing company (QX) that appropriates, parodies and subverts the language of big tech in order to educate the viewer on current profit-oriented uses of quantum computing as well as propose new ways to think about and use the technology.<ref>{{Cite web |title=arebyte Gallery — The Evolution of Ent-: QX |url=https://www.arebyte.com/evolution-of-ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=arebyte Gallery |language=en-US}}</ref> 

=== ''SlimeQore'' (2022) ===
''SlimeQore'' is a performative lecture accompanied by an immersive video montage, first performed at the [[Zabludowicz Collection]] in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Collection |first=Zabludowicz |title=Libby Heaney: slimeQore {{!}} Art Event at Zabludowicz Collection, London Art Gallery |url=https://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/events/view/libby-heaney-slimqore |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Zabludowicz Collection |language=en}}</ref> It uses slime as a metaphor for quantum particles and for the slimy world of big tech. Throughout the performance, Libby invites the audience to play with slime in order to understand the fluid nature of quantum physics and its implications.
