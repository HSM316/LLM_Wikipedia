== Artistic career ==
In 2013 Heaney returned to the UK and completed a master's degree at the [[University of the Arts London]]. She studied arts and science at [[Central Saint Martins]] and graduated in 2015.<ref name=":0" /> She then became a lecturer at the [[Royal College of Art]], teaching Information Experience Design.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/dr-libby-heaney/|title=Dr Libby Heaney|website=rca.ac.uk|publisher=Royal College of Art|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> In 2016, she created ''Lady Chatterley's Tinderbot'' which presented [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] conversations between real users and AI bots programmed using ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.

In 2017, Heaney was commissionned by [[Sky Arts]] and the [[Barbican Centre]] to design ''Britbot,'' an [[internet bot]] built using [[artificial intelligence]] and the citizenship book ''Life in the UK: a guide for new residents.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=Britbot |url=https://www.britbot.org/ |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=britbot.org}}</ref>''  The book, a manual for the citizenship test, has been described by Heaney as being "largely a white male privileged version of British history and culture".<ref>{{Cite web |title=LIBBY HEANEY, art and quantum computing {{!}} CLOT Magazine |date=11 July 2019 |url=https://www.clotmag.com/interviews/libby-heaney-when-quantum-computing-is-more-than-a-tool |access-date=2022-12-09 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The bot spoke to  the public about what it meant to be British and learnt from their responses to become an ever changing, plural version of Britishness.<ref name=":0" /> She was awarded an [[Arts Council England]] grant to widen participation of the Britbot to social media.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About - Britbot |url=https://www.britbot.org/about |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=britbot.org}}</ref> Heaney has exhibited ''Britbot'' at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], at CogX, the Sheffield Documentary Festival the Edinburgh TV festival, and Art Ai in Leicester.<ref>{{Cite web |title=noisy chatterbots |url=https://digitransglasgow.github.io/ArtificiallyIntelligent/contributions/15_Noisy.html |access-date=2018-12-28 |website=github.io |publisher=ArtificiallyIntelligent |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Machine Dreams' at CogX 2018 |url=http://elluba.com/machine-dreams-exhibition-at-cogx-2018/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=Luba Elliott |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=elwyn.co |title=Sky Arts Art 50 {{!}} 'Britbot' by Libby Heaney |url=http://www.skyartsart50.tv/projects/the-britbot-by-libby-heaney/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=Sky Arts Art 50 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Phoenix Leicester - Britbot by Libby Heaney at Art AI Festival 2019 |url=https://www.phoenix.org.uk/events/libby-heaney-britbot/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=Phoenix |language=en}}</ref>

In 2022, ''Ent-'' received the Lumen Prize immersive environment award.

== Major works ==

=== ''Ent-'' and ''The Evolution of Ent-: QX'' (2022) ===
In 2022, Libby Heaney was commissioned by [[Light Art Space]] to create ''Ent-'', a 360 immersive installation that revisits [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch’s]] ''Garden of Earthly Delights'' through quantum''.''<ref name="Space LAS">{{Cite web |last=Space (LAS) |first=Light Art |title=LIGHT ART SPACE (LAS) {{!}} Ent- |url=https://lightartspace.org/programme/ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Light Art Space (LAS) |language=en}}</ref> The work uses quantum computing as both a medium and a paradigm through which to conceive human and non-human relations.

''Ent-'' was exhibited at [[Light Art Space|LAS]], [[Prix Ars Electronica|Ars Electronica]], and arebyte gallery in London.<ref name="Space LAS"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ent- |url=https://ars.electronica.art/planetb/de/ent/ |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=Welcome to Planet B |language=de-DE}}</ref><ref name="arebyte.com">{{Cite web |title=arebyte Gallery — The Evolution of Ent-: QX |url=https://www.arebyte.com/evolution-of-ent |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=arebyte Gallery |language=en-US}}</ref> The work was also modified to fit a full dome projection at the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, projected onto a public facade in Seoul, and turned into a playable version for an exhibition at Nahmad Contemporary in New York.<ref name="nahmadcontemporary.com">{{Cite web |title=EVERY KIND OF WIND: CALDER AND THE 21ST CENTURY - Curated by Kelly Taxter - Exhibitions - Nahmad Contemporary |url=https://www.nahmadcontemporary.com/exhibitions/every-kind-of-wind-calder-and-the-21st-century |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=www.nahmadcontemporary.com |language=en}}</ref>

In 2022, ''Ent''- was a winner in the Art Science Category of the [[Falling Walls]] prize and received the [[Lumen Prize]] immersive environment award.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Art and Science {{!}} Falling Walls Science Summit |url=https://falling-walls.com/art-and-science/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=falling-walls.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Enter the Winners |url=https://www.lumenprize.com/blog/enter-the-winners |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=The Lumen Prize |language=en-GB}}</ref>

''The Evolution of Ent-:QX,'' first displayed at arebyte gallery in London, builds on ''Ent-'' and imagines a fictional quantum computing company (QX) that appropriates, parodies and subverts the language of big tech in order to educate the viewer on current profit-oriented uses of quantum computing as well as propose new ways to think about and use the technology.<ref name="arebyte.com"/>

=== ''Touch is response-ability'' (2020) ===
''Touch is response-ability'' is an instagram performance and touch screen installation where participants activate animations by flicking through instagram stories. The performance investigates representations of the female body in art history and through computer vision to see how stereotypes are socially constructed and maintained. Images of the body are passed through a quantum algorithm, and as the users interact with them they progressively become fragmented and dissolve beyond recognition.

The work was originally commissioned by Hervisions at LUX in 2020 and performed on the LUX instagram account. It was also exhibited at Etopia Zaragoza in 2021 and at Art SG with Gazelli Art House in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=etopia_01 |date=2021-01-19 |title=VisionarIAs.

=== ''Lady Chatterley's Tinderbot'' (2016) ===
In ''Lady Chatterley’s Tinderbot,'' Libby Heaney programmed a bot to engage in conversations on Tinder by using lines from the 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Lady Chatterley’s Lover]],'' by D.H. Lawrence. The work was first shown as an interactive installation in 2016 at the Dublin Science Gallery, allowing visitors to swipe left or right to navigate through various conversations.

''Lady Chatterley’s Tinderbot'' was also exhibited at Sonar+D in Barcelona (2017), the Telefonica Fundacion in Lima (2017), [[the Lowry]] in Salford (2018), [[RMIT Gallery|RMIT gallery]] in Melbourne (2021), Microwave Festival in Hong Kong (2022) and was shortlisted for the HEK-Basel Net-based art award in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Somerset House Studios - Sónar+D Barcelona 2017 |url=https://sonarplusd.com/en/programs/barcelona-2017/areas/marketlab/somerset-house-studios-presented-by-british-council |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=Sónar+D |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Performance with Art with Heart at The Lowry – Libby Heaney |url=http://libbyheaney.co.uk/exhibitions/performance-with-art-with-heart-at-the-lowry/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Future U |url=https://rmitgallery.com/exhibitions/future-u/ |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=RMIT Gallery |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=HALF HALF ::: MICROWAVE INTERNATIONAL NEW MEDIA ARTS FESTIVAL 2022 ::: |url=http://www.microwavefest.net/festival2022/MainExhibition.html |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=HALF HALF ::: MICROWAVE INTERNATIONAL NEW MEDIA ARTS FESTIVAL 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Libby Heaney – HEK |url=https://hek.ch/fr/projets/net-based-award-2018/libby-heaney-lady-chatterleys-tinderbot-2016-17 |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=hek.ch |language=fr}}</ref>
