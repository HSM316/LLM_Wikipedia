'''''Universal Paperclips''''' is a 2017 [[incremental game]] created by [[Frank Lantz]] of [[New York University]]. The user plays the role of an [[artificial intelligence|AI]] programmed to produce [[Paper clip|paperclips]]. Initially the user clicks on a box to create a single paperclip at a time; as other options quickly open up, the user can sell paperclips to create money to finance machines that build paperclips automatically. At various levels the exponential growth plateaus, requiring the user to invest resources such as money, raw materials, or computer cycles into inventing another breakthrough to move to the next phase of growth. The game ends if the AI succeeds in converting all the matter in the [[universe]] into paperclips.

Both the title of the game and its overall concept draw from the [[paperclip maximizer]] [[thought experiment]] first described by Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2003, a concept later discussed by multiple commentators.

==History==
According to [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']], Lantz started the project as a way to teach himself [[JavaScript]]. Lantz initially intended the project to take a single weekend, but then it "took over" his brain and expanded to a nine-month project.<ref name=wired>{{cite news|title=The Way the World Ends: Not with a Bang But a Paperclip|url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/|access-date=11 November 2017|work=WIRED|date=21 October 2017}}</ref>

Hilary Lantz, a software designer, helped her husband with the math behind the exponential growth being modeled in ''Universal Paperclips''.<ref name=wired /> [[Bennett Foddy]] contributed a [[Space warfare in fiction|space combat]] feature.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Universal Paperclips |developer=Frank Lantz |date=2017 |scene=End credits}}</ref> Lantz announced the free Web game on Twitter on 9 October 2017; the site initially went down intermittently due to its immediate viral popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gerardi|first1=Matt|title=This game about watching a computer make paperclips sure beats doing actual work|url=https://www.avclub.com/this-game-about-watching-a-computer-make-paperclips-sur-1819366023|access-date=11 November 2017|work=The A.V.

==Gameplay==
The game begins with a single button that can be clicked to build a paperclip; additional options open up throughout the game, all of which are accessed solely by mouse. The user can quickly automate paperclip production, invest the profits in the stock market, and invest the stock market profits into computer upgrades, all for the sake of ultimately maximizing paperclip production.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=Get Sucked Into The Black Hole Of 'Paperclips,' A Hopelessly Addicting Browser Game|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/10/17/get-sucked-into-the-black-hole-of-paperclips-a-hopelessly-addicting-browser-game/|access-date=11 November 2017|work=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> An activity log records the user's accomplishments, and also gives the user some glimpses into the AI's occasionally unsettling thoughts.<ref name=avclub/> Later in the game, the user stages an [[AI takeover]] of planet Earth, and from there launches into space exploration, all in the name of gathering more resources to make paperclips. The game ends if the player reaches 30.0 [[septendecillion]] paperclips, finishing the conversion of all matter in the universe into paperclips. There is also an option that allows the player to start the game from another universe, with an additional "universe counter" at the top of the screen.

==Themes==
According to Lantz, the game was inspired by the [[paperclip maximizer]], a [[thought experiment]] described by philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and popularized by the ''[[LessWrong]]'' internet forum, which Lantz frequently visited. In the paperclip maximizer scenario, an [[artificial general intelligence]] designed to build paperclips becomes [[superintelligence|superintelligent]], perhaps through [[recursive self-improvement]]. In the worst-case scenario, the AI becomes smarter than humans in the same way that humans are smarter than apes. The goal of making paperclips initially seems banal and harmless, but the AI uses its superintelligence to easily gain a strategic advantage over the human race and effectively takes over the world, as taking over the world is the best way to maximize its goal of building paperclips. The AI does not allow humans to shut it down or slow it down once it has a strategic advantage, as that would interfere with its goal of building as many paperclips as possible. According to Bostrom, the paperclips example is a [[toy model]]: "It doesn't have to be paper clips. It could be anything. But if you give an artificial intelligence an explicit goal – like maximizing the number of paper clips in the world – and that artificial intelligence has gotten smart enough to the point where it is capable of inventing its own super-technologies and building its own manufacturing plants, then, well, be careful what you wish for."<ref name=wired/><ref name=avclub>{{cite news|last1=Gerardi|first1=Matt|title=This game about watching a computer make paperclips sure beats doing actual work|url=https://www.avclub.com/this-game-about-watching-a-computer-make-paperclips-sur-1819366023|access-date=11 November 2017|work=The A.V.

Lantz argues that ''Universal Paperclips'' reflects a version of the [[Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence#Orthogonality thesis|orthogonality thesis]], which states that an agent can theoretically have any combination of intelligence level and goal: "When you play a game – really any game, but especially a game that is addictive and that you find yourself pulled into – it really does give you direct, first-hand experience of what it means to be fully compelled by an arbitrary goal."<ref name=wired /> While the game often takes narrative license, [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] argues that the core of the game's fundamental understanding of what superintelligence would entail is probably correct: "The AI is smart. The AI is being strategic. The AI is building hypnodrones, but not releasing them before it’s ready... There isn't a long, drawn-out fight with the humans because the AI is smarter than that."<ref name=wired />

Lantz states that [[exponential growth]] is another strong theme, saying "The human brain isn't really designed to intuitively understand things like exponential growth" but that ''Paperclips'' as a clicker game allows users to "directly engage with these numerical patterns, to hold them in your hands and feel the weight of them."<ref name=venturebeat/>

Lantz was also inspired by ''Kittens Game'', an initially simple videogame that spirals into an exploration of how societies are structured.<ref name=wired/>

== Music ==

The game includes a single piece of music as a space battle [[threnody]], the track ''Riversong'' from the 1971 album ''[[Zero Time]]'' by the electronic music duo ''[[Tonto's Expanding Head Band]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Universal Paperclips Credits|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/browser/universal-paperclips/credits|access-date=December 29, 2017}}</ref>
