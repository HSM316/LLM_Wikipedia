Fiji's main purpose is to provide a distribution of ImageJ2 with many bundled [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. Fiji features an integrated updating system and aims to provide users with a coherent menu structure, extensive documentation in the form of detailed algorithm descriptions and tutorials, and the ability to avoid the need to install multiple components from different sources.

Fiji is also targeted at developers, through the use of a [[Git|version control system]], an issue tracker, dedicated development channels, and a rapid-prototyping infrastructure in the form of a script editor which supports [[BeanShell]], [[Jython]], [[JRuby]], [[Clojure]], [[Groovy]], [[JavaScript]], and other scripting languages, as well as [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] Java development.

==Plugins==
Many plugins exist for ImageJ, that have a wide range of applications, but also a wide range of quality.<ref>Compare the presentations at the [https://imagejconf.tudor.lu/archive/imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2008/doku.php?id=archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2008:copy_of_programme:presentations:fiji-is-just-imagej-batteries-included 2nd ImageJ User and Developer Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128145404/https://imagejconf.tudor.lu/archive/imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2008/doku.php?id=archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2008:copy_of_programme:presentations:fiji-is-just-imagej-batteries-included |date=28 January 2021 }} in November 2008 and the [http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/archive/imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010/doku.php?id=:archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010:presentations:schindelin:start 3rd ImageJ and User Developer Conference] in October 2010.</ref>

Further, some plugins require specific versions of ImageJ, specific versions of third-party libraries, or additional Java components such as the Java compiler or [[Java 3D]].

One of Fiji's principal aims is to make the installation of ImageJ, Java, Java 3D, the plugins, and further convenient components, as easy as possible. As a consequence, Fiji enjoys more and more active users.<ref>Compare with the [https://fiji.sc/Fiji_Usage Fiji Usage Map]</ref>

==Development==
Fiji is fully [[open source]]. Its sources live in a public [[Git]] repository.

Fiji was accepted as organization into the [[Google Summer of Code]] 2009, and completed two projects.

The scripting framework, which supports [[JavaScript]], [[Jython]], [[JRuby]], [[Clojure]], [[BeanShell]], and other languages, is an integral part of the development of Fiji; many developers prototype their plugins in one of the mentioned scripting languages, and gradually turn the prototypes into proper [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code. To this end, as one of the aforementioned Google Summer of Code projects, a script editor was added with [[syntax highlighting]] and in-place code execution.

The scripting framework is included in the Fiji releases, so that advanced users can use such scripts in their common workflow.

The development benefits from occasional [[hackathon]]s, where life scientists with computational background meet and improve their respective plugins of interest.

==Script editor==
The script editor in Fiji supports rapid prototyping of scripts and ImageJ plugins, making Fiji a powerful tool to develop new image processing algorithms and explore new image processing techniques with ImageJ.<ref>''Scripting in Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ)'' at [https://imagejconf.tudor.lu/archive/imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010/doku.php?id=:archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010:workshops:schindelin:start 3rd User and Developer Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207172150/http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/archive/imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010/doku.php?id=:archive:imagej-user-and-developer-conference-2010:workshops:schindelin:start |date=7 February 2019 }} in October 2010</ref><ref>Albert Cardona's crash course [http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/fiji-tutorial/index.html ''Jython scripting with Fiji''].</ref>

==Supported platforms==
Fiji runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, Intel 32-bit or 64-bit, with limited support for MacOSX/PPC.
