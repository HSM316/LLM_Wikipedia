==Plot==
[[File:They're Made Out of Meat.jpg|thumb|right|''They’re Made Out of Meat'' (2009) by [[Alexander S. Peak]], inspired by the story.]]
The two characters are [[intelligent]] beings capable of traveling [[faster than light]], on a mission to "contact, welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe." Bisson's stage directions represent them as "two lights moving like fireflies among the stars" on a [[projection screen]]. One of them tells the incredulous other about the recent discovery of [[carbon-based life|carbon-based]] lifeforms "made up entirely of meat". After conversing briefly about it, they both deem such beings and communication with them too bizarre and agree to "erase the records and forget the whole thing", marking the [[Solar System]] "unoccupied".<ref name="tb">{{cite web |url=http://www.terrybisson.com/theyre-made-out-of-meat-2/ |title=They're Made out of Meat  |first=Terry|last=Bisson |work=Terry Bisson SF Story Showcase |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501130711/http://www.terrybisson.com/theyre-made-out-of-meat-2/ |archive-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>
