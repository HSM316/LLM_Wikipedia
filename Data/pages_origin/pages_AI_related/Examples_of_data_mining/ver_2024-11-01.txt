[[Data mining]], the process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s, has been used in many applications.

==Business==

In business, data mining is the analysis of historical business activities, stored as static data in data warehouse databases. The goal is to reveal hidden patterns and trends. Data mining software uses advanced [[Pattern recognition|pattern recognition algorithms]] to sift through large amounts of data to assist in discovering previously unknown strategic business information. Examples of what businesses use data mining for is to include performing market analysis to identify new product bundles, finding the root cause of manufacturing problems, to prevent [[customer attrition]] and acquire new customers, [[cross-selling]] to existing customers, and profiling customers with more accuracy.<ref>O'Brien, J. A., & Marakas, G. M. (2011). Management Information Systems. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.</ref>
* In today's world raw data is being collected by companies at an exploding rate. For example, Walmart processes over 20 million point-of-sale transactions every day. This information is stored in a centralized database, but would be useless without some type of data mining software to analyze it. If Walmart analyzed their point-of-sale data with data mining techniques they would be able to determine sales trends, develop marketing campaigns, and more accurately predict customer loyalty.<ref>{{cite web | author=Alexander, Doug | title=Data Mining | publisher=The University of Texas at Austin: College of Liberal Arts | url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/~anorman/BUS.FOR/course.mat/Alex/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Daniele Medri: Big Data & Business: An on-going revolution|url=http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5393251/Big-Data--Business-An-on-going-revolution.html|publisher=[[Statistics Views]]|date=21 Oct 2013|access-date=21 September 2015|archive-date=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617211645/http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5393251/Big-Data--Business-An-on-going-revolution.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Categorization of the items available in the e-commerce site is a fundamental problem. A correct item categorization system is essential for user experience as it helps determine the items relevant to him for search and browsing.  Item categorization can be formulated as a supervised classification problem in data mining where the categories are the target classes and the features are the words composing some textual description of the items. One of the approaches is to find groups initially which are similar and place them together in a latent group.  Now given a new item, first classify into a latent group which is called coarse level classification. Then, do a second round of classification to find the category to which the item belongs to.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|title =Large Scale Item Categorization|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151005215055/http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|archive-date =2015-10-05}}</ref>
* Every time a credit card or a store loyalty card is being used, or a warranty card is being filled, data is being collected about the user's behavior. Many people find the amount of information stored about us from companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, disturbing and are concerned about privacy. Although there is the potential for our personal data to be used in harmful, or unwanted, ways it is also being used to make our lives better. For example, Ford and Audi hope to one day collect information about customer driving patterns so they can recommend safer routes and warn drivers about dangerous road conditions.<ref name="macon.com">Goss, S.

* Data mining in [[customer relationship management]] applications can contribute significantly to the bottom line.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Rather than randomly contacting a prospect or customer through a call center or sending mail, a company can concentrate its efforts on prospects that are predicted to have a high likelihood of responding to an offer. More sophisticated methods may be used to optimize resources across campaigns so that one may predict to which channel and to which offer an individual is most likely to respond (across all potential offers). Additionally, sophisticated applications could be used to automate mailing. Once the results from data mining (potential prospect/customer and channel/offer) are determined, this "sophisticated application" can either automatically send an e-mail or a regular mail. Finally, in cases where many people will take an action without an offer, "[[uplift modelling|uplift modeling]]" can be used to determine which people have the greatest increase in response if given an offer. Uplift modeling thereby enables marketers to focus mailings and offers on persuadable people, and not to send offers to people who will buy the product without an offer. [[Data clustering]] can also be used to automatically discover the segments or groups within a customer data set.
* Businesses employing data mining may see a return on investment, but also they recognize that the number of predictive models can quickly become very large. For example, rather than using one model to predict how many customers will [[Churn rate|churn]], a business may choose to build a separate model for each region and customer type. In situations where a large number of models need to be maintained, some businesses turn to more automated data mining methodologies.
* Data mining can be helpful to human resources (HR) departments in identifying the characteristics of their most successful employees. Information obtained – such as universities attended by highly successful employees – can help HR focus recruiting efforts accordingly. Additionally, Strategic Enterprise Management applications help a company translate corporate-level goals, such as profit and margin share targets, into operational decisions, such as production plans and workforce levels.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book |last1=Monk |first1=Ellen |last2=Wagner |first2=Bret |title=Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning, Second Edition |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |location=Boston, MA |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-619-21663-4 |oclc=224465825 }}</ref>
* Data mining can be helpful to organizations. Organizational Data Mining (ODM) is defined as leveraging data mining (DM) tools and technologies to enhance organizational decision-making process by transforming data into valuable and actionable knowledge in order to gain a strategic and business competitive advantage. Data obtained – such as employee turnover rates – can help organizations focus their retention efforts accordingly. Additionally, organizational performance management data-mining and analytics applications help firms translate company-level goals, such as profit and sales targets, into operational decisions, as workers KPI and required measured effort levels. <ref>{{cite web|author =  Chalutz-Ben Gal, H. |format = PDF|title = Human Resources-Based Organizational Data Mining (HRODM): Themes, Trends, Focus, Future|editor=Rokach, L.|editor2=Maimon, O.|editor3=Shmueli, E.|url = https://www.lambda.sites.tau.ac.il/_files/ugd/901879_491d6bb99b584942b6efaefaa0acb282.pdf |publisher = Springer|pp=833–866|date=2023}}</ref>

==Science and engineering==
In recent years, data mining has been used widely in the areas of science and engineering, such as [[bioinformatics]], [[genetics]], [[medicine]], [[educational data mining|education]] and [[electrical power]] engineering.
* In the study of human genetics, [[sequence mining]] helps address the important goal of understanding the mapping relationship between the inter-individual variations in human [[DNA]] sequence and the variability in disease susceptibility. In simple terms, it aims to find out how the changes in an individual's DNA sequence affects the risks of developing common diseases such as [[cancer]], which is of great importance to improving methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating these diseases. One data mining method that is used to perform this task is known as [[multifactor dimensionality reduction]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Xingquan |last1=Zhu |first2=Ian |last2=Davidson |title=Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Challenges and Realities |publisher=Hershey |location=New York, NY |year=2007 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-59904-252-7 }}</ref>
* In the area of electrical power engineering, data mining methods have been widely used for [[condition monitoring]] of high voltage electrical equipment. The purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on, for example, the status of the [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]] (or other important safety-related parameters). [[Data clustering]] techniques – such as the [[self-organizing map]] (SOM), have been applied to vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on-load tap-changers (OLTCS). Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms. Obviously, different tap positions will generate different signals. However, there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for exactly the same tap position. SOM has been applied to detect abnormal conditions and to hypothesize about the nature of the abnormalities.<ref name="McGrail">{{Cite journal |first1=Anthony J. |last1=McGrail |first2=Edward |last2=Gulski |first3=David |last3=Allan |first4=David |last4=Birtwhistle |first5=Trevor R. |last5=Blackburn |first6=Edwin R.

==Spatial data mining==
Spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. The end objective of spatial data mining is to find patterns in data with respect to geography. So far, data mining and [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions, and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality. The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasizes the importance of developing data-driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.

Data mining offers great potential benefits for GIS-based applied decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become of critical importance, especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realize the huge potential of the information contained therein. Among those organizations are:
* Offices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo-referenced statistical data
* Public health services searching for explanations of disease clustering
* Environmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land-use patterns on climate change
* Geo-marketing companies doing customer segmentation based on spatial location.

Challenges in Spatial mining:
Geospatial data repositories tend to be very large. Moreover, existing GIS datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems. Algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational (attribute) data management and for topological (feature) data management.<ref>Healey, Richard G. (1991); ''Database Management Systems'', in Maguire, David J.; Goodchild, Michael F.; and Rhind, David W., (eds.), ''Geographic Information Systems: Principles and Applications'', London, GB: Longman</ref> Related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats, which present unique challenges. The digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional "vector" and "raster" formats. Geographic data repositories increasingly include ill-structured data, such as imagery and geo-referenced multi-media.<ref>Camara, Antonio S.; and Raper, Jonathan (eds.) (1999); ''Spatial Multimedia and Virtual Reality'', London, GB: Taylor and Francis</ref>

There are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining. Miller and Han<ref>Miller, Harvey J.; and Han, Jiawei (eds.) (2001); ''Geographic Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', London, GB: Taylor & Francis</ref> offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field:
* '''Developing and supporting geographic data warehouses (GDW's)''': Spatial properties are often reduced to simple [[Theory of Forms#What are the Forms?|aspatial]] attributes in mainstream data warehouses. Creating an integrated GDW requires solving issues of spatial and temporal data interoperability – including differences in semantics, referencing systems, geometry, accuracy, and position.
* '''Better spatio-temporal representations in geographic knowledge discovery''': Current geographic knowledge discovery (GKD) methods generally use very simple representations of geographic objects and spatial relationships. Geographic data mining methods should recognize more complex geographic objects (i.e., lines and polygons) and relationships (i.e., non-Euclidean distances, direction, connectivity, and interaction through attributed geographic space such as terrain). Furthermore, the time dimension needs to be more fully integrated into these geographic representations and relationships.
* '''Geographic knowledge discovery using diverse data types''': GKD methods should be developed that can handle diverse data types beyond the traditional raster and vector models, including imagery and geo-referenced multimedia, as well as dynamic data types (video streams, animation).

==Temporal data mining==
Data may contain attributes generated and recorded at different times. In this case finding meaningful relationships in the data may require considering the temporal order of the attributes. A temporal relationship may indicate a causal relationship, or simply an association.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Sensor data mining==
[[Wireless sensor network]]s can be used for facilitating the collection of data for spatial data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Richards | first2 = M. | last3 = Ghanem | first3 = M. | last4 = Guo | first4 = Y. | last5 = Hassard | first5 = J. | title = Air Pollution Monitoring and Mining Based on Sensor Grid in London | doi = 10.3390/s8063601 | journal = Sensors | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 3601–3623 | year = 2008 | pmid =  27879895| pmc =3714656 | bibcode = 2008Senso...8.3601M | doi-access = free }}</ref> A characteristic of such networks is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Guo | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tian | first3 = X. | last4 = Ghanem | first4 = M. | title = Distributed Clustering-Based Aggregation Algorithm for Spatial Correlated Sensor Networks | doi = 10.1109/JSEN.2010.2056916 | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 641 | year = 2011 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.724.1158 | bibcode = 2011ISenJ..11..641M | s2cid = 1639100 }}</ref>

==Visual data mining==
In the process of turning from analog into digital, large data sets have been generated, collected, and stored discovering statistical patterns, trends and information which is hidden in data, in order to build predictive patterns. Studies suggest visual data mining is faster and much more intuitive than is traditional data mining.<ref>Zhao, Kaidi; and Liu, Bing; Tirpark, Thomas M.; and Weimin, Xiao; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1106390 ''A Visual Data Mining Framework for Convenient Identification of Useful Knowledge'']</ref><ref>Keim, Daniel A.; [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.135.7051 ''Information Visualization and Visual Data Mining'']</ref><ref>Burch, Michael; Diehl, Stephan; Weißgerber, Peter; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1056018.1056024 ''Visual Data Mining in Software Archives'']</ref> See also [[Computer vision]].

==Music data mining==
Data mining techniques, and in particular [[co-occurrence]] analysis, has been used to discover relevant similarities among music corpora (radio lists, CD databases) for purposes including classifying music into [[genres]] in a more objective manner.<ref>Pachet, François; Westermann, Gert; and Laigre, Damien; [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf ''Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327024728/http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf |date=2014-03-27 }}, Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference, Firenze, Italy, 2001, pp. 101–106.</ref>

==Surveillance==
Data mining has been used by the U.S. government. Programs include the [[Total Information Awareness]] (TIA) program, Secure Flight (formerly known as Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System ([[CAPPS II]])), Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, Semantic Enhancement ([[ADVISE]]),<ref>Government Accountability Office, ''Data Mining: Early Attention to Privacy in Developing a Key DHS Program Could Reduce Risks'', GAO-07-293 (February 2007), Washington, DC</ref> and the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange ([[MATRIX]]).<ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20604775 Secure Flight Program report], NBC News</ref> These programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organizations or under different names.<ref name="eff-tia-funding">{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |title=Total/Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA): Is It Truly Dead? |year=2003 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (official website) |access-date=2009-03-15 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325113304/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |archive-date=2009-03-25 }}</ref>

In the context of combating terrorism, two particularly plausible methods of data mining are "pattern mining" and "subject-based data mining".

==Pattern mining== <!-- [[Pattern mining]] links to here. -->
"Pattern mining" is a data mining method that involves finding existing [[pattern]]s in data. In this context ''patterns'' often means [[association rules]]. The original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data, that is, to examine customer behavior in terms of the purchased products. For example, an association rule "beer ⇒ potato chips (80%)" states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought potato chips.

In the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Pattern-based data mining looks for patterns (including anomalous data patterns) that might be associated with terrorist activity&nbsp;— these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise."<ref>Agrawal, Rakesh; Mannila, Heikki; Srikant, Ramakrishnan; Toivonen, Hannu; and Verkamo, A. Inkeri; ''Fast discovery of association rules'', in ''Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 307–328</ref><ref name="NRC2008">National Research Council, ''Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists: A Framework for Program Assessment'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2008</ref><ref name="Haag2006">{{cite book |last1=Haag |first1=Stephen |first2=Maeve |last2=Cummings |first3=Amy |last3=Phillips |title=Management Information Systems for the information age |page=[https://archive.org/details/managementinform0000unse_n7i0/page/28 28] |isbn=978-0-07-095569-1 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson |location=Toronto |oclc=63194770 |url=https://archive.org/details/managementinform0000unse_n7i0/page/28 }}</ref> Pattern Mining includes new areas such a [[Music Information Retrieval]] (MIR) where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search methods.

==Subject-based data mining== <!-- [[Subject-based data mining]] links to here. -->
"Subject-based data mining" is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. In the context of combating terrorism, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered, based on other information, to be of high interest, and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements, etc., are related to that initiating datum."<ref name="NRC2008" />

==Knowledge grid==
Knowledge discovery "On the Grid" generally refers to conducting knowledge discovery in an open environment using [[grid computing]] concepts, allowing users to integrate data from various online data sources, as well make use of remote resources, for executing their data mining tasks. The earliest example was the [[Discovery Net]],<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Guo | first2 = Yike | last3 = Rowe | first3 = Anthony | last4 = Wendel | first4 = Patrick | chapter = Grid-based knowledge discovery services for high throughput informatics | doi = 10.1109/HPDC.2002.1029946 | title = Proceedings 11th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing | pages = 416 | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7695-1686-8 | s2cid = 28782519 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Curcin | first2 = Vasa | last3 = Wendel | first3 = Patrick | last4 = Guo | first4 = Yike | chapter = Building and Using Analytical Workflows in Discovery Net | doi = 10.1002/9780470699904.ch8 | title = Data Mining Techniques in Grid Computing Environments | pages = 119 | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780470699904 }}</ref> developed at [[Imperial College London]], which won the "Most Innovative Data-Intensive Application Award" at the ACM SC02 (Supercomputing 2002) conference and exhibition, based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed knowledge discovery application for a bioinformatics application. Other examples include work conducted by researchers at the [[University of Calabria]], who developed a Knowledge Grid architecture for distributed knowledge discovery, based on [[grid computing]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cannataro, Mario |author2=Talia, Domenico |title=The Knowledge Grid: An Architecture for Distributed Knowledge Discovery |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=46 |number=1 |date=January 2003 |pages=89–93 |doi=10.1145/602421.602425 |s2cid=8709194 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110142404/http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf |url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-11-10 |access-date=17 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Talia, Domenico |author2=Trunfio, Paolo |title=How distributed data mining tasks can thrive as knowledge services |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=53 |number=7 |date=July 2010 |pages=132–137 |doi=10.1145/1785414.1785451 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027003824/http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf |url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-27 |access-date=17 October 2011 |citeseerx=10.1.1.378.2206 |s2cid=14713292 }}</ref>
