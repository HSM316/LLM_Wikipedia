'''MLOps''' (a compound of “[[machine learning]]” and “operations”) is a practice for collaboration and communication between [[data scientists]] and operations professionals to help manage production ML (or [[deep learning]]) lifecycle.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Talagala |first1=Nisha |title=Why MLOps (and not just ML) is your Business’ New Competitive Frontier |url=https://aitrends.com/machine-learning/mlops-not-just-ml-business-new-competitive-frontier/ |website=AITrends |publisher=AITrends |accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> Similar to the [[DevOps]] or [[DataOps]] approaches, MLOps looks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps also started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation ([[software development lifecycle]], [[continuous integration]]/[[continuous delivery]]), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics. According to [[Gartner]], MLOps is a subset of [[ModelOps]]. MLOps is focused on the operationalization of ML models, while ModelOps covers the operationalization of all types of AI models.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vashisth |first1=Shubhangi |last2=Brethenoux |first2=Erick |last3=Choudhary |first3=Farhan |last4=Hare |first4=Jim |title=Use Gartner’s 3-Stage MLOps Framework to Successfully Operationalize Machine Learning Projects |url=https://www.gartner.com/document/3987104 |website=Gartner |publisher=Gartner |accessdate=30 October 2020 |ref=G00725627}}</ref>

In October 2020, ModelOp, Inc. launched [http://ModelOp.io ModelOp.io], an online hub for MLOps and ModelOps resources. Alongside the launch of this website, ModelOp released a Request for Proposal (RFP) template. Resulting from interviews with industry experts and analysts, this RFP template was designed to address the functional requirements of ModelOps and MLOps solutions.<ref>{{cite web |title=ModelOps RFP |url=https://modelop.io/modelops-rfp/ |website=ModelOps: The ModelOps and MLOps Resource Hub |accessdate=30 October 2020}}</ref>

A standard practice, such as MLOps, takes into account each of the aforementioned areas, which can help enterprises optimize workflows and avoid issues during implementation. 

A common architecture of an MLOps system would include data science platforms where models are constructed and the analytical engines where computations are performed, with the MLOps tool orchestrating the movement of machine learning models, data and outcomes between the systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Nick |title=The Rise of Quant-Oriented Devs & The Need for Standardized MLOps |url=http://slides.com/walsh/standards-in-ml-ops#/ |website=Slides |publisher=Nick Walsh |accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>
