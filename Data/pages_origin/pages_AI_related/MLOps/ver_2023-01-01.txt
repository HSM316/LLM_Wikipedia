'''MLOps''' or '''ML Ops''' is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain [[machine learning]] models in production reliably and efficiently.<ref name="tds1" /> The word is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous development practice of [[DevOps]] in the software field. Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. When an algorithm is ready to be launched, MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Talagala |first1=Nisha |title=Why MLOps (and not just ML) is your Business’ New Competitive Frontier |url=https://aitrends.com/machine-learning/mlops-not-just-ml-business-new-competitive-frontier/ |website=AITrends |publisher=AITrends |accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> Similar to [[DevOps]] or [[DataOps]] approaches, MLOps seeks to increase automation and improve the quality of production models, while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation ([[software development lifecycle]], [[continuous integration]]/[[continuous delivery]]), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics. According to [[Gartner]], MLOps is a subset of [[ModelOps]]. MLOps is focused on the operationalization of ML models, while ModelOps covers the operationalization of all types of AI models.<ref name="Gartner">{{cite web |last1=Vashisth |first1=Shubhangi |last2=Brethenoux |first2=Erick |last3=Choudhary |first3=Farhan |last4=Hare |first4=Jim |title=Use Gartner’s 3-Stage MLOps Framework to Successfully Operationalize Machine Learning Projects |url=https://www.gartner.com/document/3987104 |website=Gartner |publisher=Gartner |accessdate=30 October 2020 |ref=G00725627}}</ref>

==History==

The challenges of the ongoing use of machine learning in applications were highlighted in a 2015 paper.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sculley |first1=D. |last2=Holt |first2=Gary |last3=Golovin |first3=Daniel |last4=Davydov |first4=Eugene |last5=Phillips |first5=Todd |last6=Ebner |first6=Dietmar |last7=Chaudhary |first7=Vinay |last8=Young |first8=Michael |last9=Crespo |first9=Jean-Francois |last10=Dennison |first10=Dan |title=Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems |journal=NIPS Proceedings |date=7 December 2015 |issue=2015 |url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf |accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>

The predicted growth in machine learning included an estimated doubling of ML pilots and implementations from 2017 to 2018, and again from 2018 to 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sallomi |first1=Paul |last2=Lee |first2=Paul |title=Deloitte Technology, Media and Telecommunications Predictions 2018 |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/technologymediatelecommunications/gx-deloitte-tmt-2018-predictions-full-report.pdf |website=Deloitte |publisher=Deloitte |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>

Reports show a majority (up to 88%) of corporate AI initiatives are struggling to move beyond test stages{{Citation needed|reason=The article linked to at the end of this paragraph does not mention this|date=May 2020}}. However, those organizations that actually put AI and machine learning into production saw a 3-15% profit margin increases.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bughin |first1=Jacques |last2=Hazan |first2=Eric |last3=Ramaswamy |first3=Sree |last4=Chui |first4=Michael |last5=Allas |first5=Tera |last6=Dahlström |first6=Peter |last7=Henke |first7=Nicolaus |last8=Trench |first8=Monica |title=Artificial Intelligence The Next Digital Frontier? |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Advanced%20Electronics/Our%20Insights/How%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/MGI-Artificial-Intelligence-Discussion-paper.ashx |website=McKinsey |publisher=McKinsey Global Institute |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>

The MLOps market was estimated at $23.2billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $126 billion by 2025 due to rapid adoption.<ref>{{cite web |title=2021 MLOps Platforms Vendor Analysis Report |url=https://neu.ro/2021-mlops-platforms-vendor-analysis-report/ |website=Neu.ro |accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
Machine Learning systems can be categorized in eight different categories: data collection, data processing, feature engineering, data labeling, model design, model training and optimization, endpoint deployment, and endpoint monitoring. Each step in the machine learning lifecycle is built in its own system, but requires interconnection. These are the minimum systems that enterprises need to scale machine learning within their organization.

== Goals ==
There are a number of goals enterprises want to achieve through MLOps systems successfully implementing ML across the enterprise, including:<ref name="Nick Walsh">{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Nick |title=The Rise of Quant-Oriented Devs & The Need for Standardized MLOps |url=http://slides.com/walsh/standards-in-ml-ops#/ |website=Slides |publisher=Nick Walsh |accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>

A standard practice, such as MLOps, takes into account each of the aforementioned areas, which can help enterprises optimize workflows and avoid issues during implementation.

A common architecture of an MLOps system would include data science platforms where models are constructed and the analytical engines where computations are performed, with the MLOps tool orchestrating the movement of machine learning models, data and outcomes between the systems.<ref name="Nick Walsh"/>
