The '''motion history image''' (MHI) is a static image template helps in understanding the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] location and path as it progresses.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/CVL/Research/MHI/mhi.html | title=Research: Motion History Images | accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> In MHI, the temporal motion information is collapsed into a single image template where intensity is a function of recency of motion. Thus, the MHI pixel intensity is a function of the motion history at that location, where brighter values correspond to a more recent motion. Using MHI, moving parts of a [[video]] sequence can be engraved with a single image, from where one can predict the motion flow as well as the moving parts of the video action.

Some important features of the MHI representation are:<ref>Ahad, Md Atiqur Rahman. Motion history images for action recognition and understanding. Springer Science & Business Media, 2012.</ref>
* It represents motion sequence in a compact manner. In this case, the [[silhouette]] sequence is condensed into a [[grayscale]] image, where dominant motion information is preserved. 
* MHI can be created and implemented in low illumination conditions where the structure cannot be easily detected otherwise. 
* The MHI representation is not so sensitive to silhouette noises, holes, shadows, and missing parts. 
* The gray-scale MHI is sensitive to the direction of motion because it can demonstrate the flow direction of the motion. 
* It keeps a history of temporal changes at each pixel location, which then decays over time. 
* The MHI expresses the motion flow or sequence by using the intensity of every pixel in a temporal manner.
