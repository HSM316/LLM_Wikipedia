{{distinguish|the Turing Test}}

'''Turing's Wager''' is a [[philosophical argument]] that claims it is impossible to infer or deduce a detailed mathematical model of the [[human brain]] within a reasonable timescale, and thus impossible in any practical sense. The argument was first given in 1950 by the [[computational theory|computational theorist]] [[Alan Turing]] in his paper ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]'', published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' {{harv|Turing|1950|p=453}}. The argument asserts that determining any [[mathematical model]] of a computer (its [[source code]] or any isomorphic equivalent such as a [[Turing machine]] or [[virtual simulation]]) is not possible in a reasonable timeframe.<ref>Turing suggests 1000 years as a reasonable timeframe {{harv|Turing|1950|p=453}}.</ref> As a consequence, determining a mathematical model of the human brain (which is, by its nature, more complicated) must also be impossible within that timeframe.

== Effect of modern technology on wager ==

It has been argued that modern [[medical imaging|neuroimaging techniques]] will allow researchers to create accurate simulations of the human mind within the 21st century ({{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2012}}; {{Harvnb|Markram|2012}}, {{Harvnb|Fildes|2009}}), thereby overcoming the wager.<ref>Turing's Wager should not be confused with 'A Wager on the Turing Test', a real-life wager between Kurzweil and Mitchell Kapor over whether a computer will pass the Turing Test by 2029 {{harv|Kurzweil|Kapor|2009}}.</ref> Others have argued that such claims are unjustified {{harv|Thwaites|Soltan|Wieser|Nimmo-Smith|2017}}.

== Relationship between Turing's Wager and the Turing Test ==

The [[Turing Test]] attempts to define when a machine might be said to possess [[human intelligence]], while Turing's Wager is an argument aiming to demonstrate that characterising the brain mathematically will take over a thousand years. While building an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[brain mapping|mapping the human brain]] are both difficult endeavours, the former is actually a sub-problem of the latter {{harv|Thwaites|Soltan|Wieser|Nimmo-Smith|2017}}.

{{Quote|text=
Turing was optimistic about mankind's ability to build a machine able to pass the Turing Test [...]. He was not, by contrast, optimistic about their chances of beating Turing's Wager – and with good reason: modelling a brain accurately is a much harder problem than imitating it approximately. Indeed, the former is sub-problem of the latter: if an individual was able to overcome Turing’s Wager and come into possession of a complete mathematical characterisation of the human brain, then that individual would, as a consequence, be in possession of a machine able to pass the Turing Test.}}-->
