The '''Dynamic Graphics Project''' (commonly referred to as '''dgp''') is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the [[University of Toronto]] devoted to projects involving [[Computer Graphics]], [[Computer Vision]], and [[Human Computer Interaction]]. The lab began as the computer graphics research group of [[Computer Science]] Professor [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Mezei Leslie Mezei] in 1967.<ref>http://hciweb.cs.toronto.edu/DGPis40/speakers_session5.html</ref> Mezei invited [[Bill Buxton]], a  pioneer of [[human-computer interaction|human–computer interaction]] to join. In 1972, [[Ronald Baecker]], another [[human-computer interaction|HCI]] pioneer joined dgp, establishing dgp as the first Canadian university group focused on computer graphics and human-computer interaction.<ref>http://graphicsinterface.org/wp-content/uploads/gi2005-frontmatter.pdf Ron Baecker CHCCS 2005 Achievement Award</ref>

Since then, dgp has hosted many well known faculty and students in computer graphics, computer vision and HCI (e.g., [[Alain Fournier]], [[William Reeves (animator)|Bill Reeves]],  [[Jos Stam]], [[Demetri Terzopoulos]], [[Marilyn Tremaine]]). dgp also occasionally hosts [[artist in residence|artists in residence]] (e.g., [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner [[Chris Landreth]]<ref>https://www.utoronto.ca/news/oscar-winning-animator-and-filmmaker-chris-landreth-u-t-computer-science</ref>). Many past and current researchers at [[Autodesk]] (and before that [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias Wavefront]]) graduated after working at dgp.<ref>http://hciweb.cs.toronto.edu/DGPis40/alumni.php?page=home</ref> dgp is located in the St. George Campus of University of Toronto in the [[Bahen Centre for Information Technology]]. dgp researchers regularly publish at [[ACM SIGGRAPH]], [[ACM SIGCHI]] and [[ICCV]].

dgp hosts the Toronto User Experience (TUX) Speaker Series and the Sanders Series Lectures <ref>http://www.tux-hci.org</ref>.
