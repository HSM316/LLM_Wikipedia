'''Sentient''' is a [[Classified information in the United States|heavily classified]] [[artificial intelligence]] [[Reconnaissance satellite|satellite]] [[intelligence analysis]] system of the [[United States Intelligence Community]], operated by the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO) and developed by their Advanced Systems and Technology Directorate (AS&T), with the [[United States Air Force|United States Air Forces]] [[Air Force Research Laboratory|Research Laboratory]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] and the [[Department of Energy|Department of Energy's]] [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|National Laboratories]].<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" /><ref name="NRO Sentient Operations Highlight 6 May 2021" /><ref name="NRO Recent Sentient Highlights 6 May 2021" /><ref name="NRO Sentient Official Feb 13 2012" /><ref name="NRO FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification Volume IV, page 217" />

Available information describes it as a complex automated system that allows [[United_States_Intelligence_Community#List_of_members|intelligence agencies]] of the United States and the [[United States Armed Forces]] to use [[Satellite imagery|artificial satellites]] in [[List of orbits|Earth orbits]] to track in real time any objects detected or photographed, and to automatically repurpose with artificial intelligence and [[machine learning]] the tracking of targets, and to even decide which targets are worth tracking.<ref name="NRO Sentient Operations Highlight 6 May 2021" /><ref name="NRO Recent Sentient Highlights 6 May 2021" /><ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" /><ref name="NRO Sentient Official Feb 13 2012" />

Known public records of Sentients development programs and process date from 2009-2010 onward.<ref name="NRO FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification Volume IV, page 1" /><ref name="NRO Sentient Official Feb 13 2012" /><ref name="SENTIENT 2019 NRO" /> NRO emails from 2021 disclosed that the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force ([[UAPTF]]), which later became the [[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office]] (AARO), was involved with the NRO and the Sentient program.<ref name="NRO Official declassified release June 2022" />

==History==
A later declassified May 2009 report to the [[United States Congress]], "FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification, Volume IV," contains details about the National Reconnaissance Offices plans for real-time and updated satellite [[signals intelligence]], providing context on NROs space-based missions and programs to collect data, such as Sentient, which would initially begin soliciting defense and related industry feedback in 2010.<ref name="Sentient Enterprise NRO 2010" /><ref name="NRO FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification Volume IV, page 1" />

|text=The US is arguably more reliant on overhead collection than ever before. To a large extent, satellite reconnaissance is the foundation for global [[Situation awareness|situational awareness]], and as such, it is an essential underpinning of the entire US intelligence effort. Space collection provides unique access to otherwise [[denied area|denied areas]] to provide persistent and responsive collection; and it does so without risk to [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human collectors]] or infringing upon the [[Territorial integrity|territorial sovereignty]] of other nations. It is also enables users to quickly focus on almost any point of the globe to rapidly respond to emerging situations or to monitor ongoing events. The NRO provides direct support to the [[War on terror|war on terrorism]], deployed military forces, and other IC and [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] activities requiring near real-time situational awareness and sustained high resolution/high sensitivity collection capability 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-per-week.}}

The NRO continued to explain to Congress the [[Research and development|AR&D activities]] (research and development) goals of its Advanced Systems and Technology Directorate related to [[GEOINT]], [[SIGINT]], and [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|Multi-INT]] collection of intelligence data.<ref name="NRO FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification Volume IV, page 215"/> Their areas of focus were detailed as monitoring any target across wide areas on-demand, including new [[Phenomenological model|phenomenological models]] for detecting [[Unobservable|non-traditional]] [[Observable|observables]] from targets of interest; [[geolocate|geolocating]] them; increasing performance for collection against [[Field strength|weak signals]] and low [[reflectance]] targets in [[Clutter (radar)|dense clutter]] and [[co-channel interference]] backgrounds; and improvements in [[Phased Array]] technologies.<ref name="NRO FY 2010 Congressional Budget Justification Volume IV, page 215"/> 

The earliest known public references to Sentient date to 2010, when the NRO put forward a public [[request for information]] (RFI) requesting [[white papers]] on the concepts that would become Sentient, including [[Human–computer interaction|user interaction technology]], computing [[Artificial consciousness|self-awareness]] and [[Cognitive computing|cognitive processing]], and [[Process automation system|automated system processing]].<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" /><ref name="Sentient Enterprise NRO 2010" /> Official NRO documents from 2012, declassified in 2019, describe it as "an on-going Research and Development (R&D) program, which is managed and operates out of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)".<ref name="NRO Sentient Official Feb 13 2012" /> NRO documents detail the Sentient program was in some form of initial development from 2013 through 2016.<ref name="NRO Sentient Overview 2017"/>

==Public details==
In 2019, a declassified National Reconnaissance Office document detailed Sentient as:<ref name="SENTIENT 2019 NRO" />

{{Blockquote|text=Sentient collects vast amounts of complex information, buried in noisy data, and extrapolates the relevant pieces. What once required teams of analysts now uses automation to speed the information flow, enabling quicker, well-informed decisions. Analysts can focus on situational understanding instead of sifting through data-working smarter, not harder. Sentient will continue to investigate various alerting schemes and tasking methodologies for improving overall employment of [[National technical means of verification|NTM imaging capabilities]]. Through predictive analytics and [[machine learning]], Sentient will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of NTM collections.}}

The program architecture was developed to demonstrate advanced technologies and techniques to revolutionize the then current [[Intelligence cycle|intelligence analysis process]] across the Intelligence Community (IC).<ref name="NRO Sentient Official Feb 13 2012" /><ref name="NRO Sentient Campaign Feb 19 2019" /> Sentient utilizes "[[tipping and queueing]]", described as a method to coordinate multiple discrete sensor systems to optimize real-time monitoring over large areas from multiple systems; coordinating in effect multiple satellites to hand off and coordinate tracking of targets as the target leaves the area of one set of satellites and enters new areas.<ref name="Rand USAF Intel 2016" /><ref name="Sapp Strategic Forces House 2017" /><ref name="ICEye Tip Queue Forces Jan 2021" /> A principle purpose of the Sentient system is described by the NRO as compiling at machine, versus human speed, synthesis of complex distributed data sources for rapid analysis faster than humans can manage.<ref name="NRO Sentient Challenge Themes Feb 13 2012" /><ref name="NRO Official declassified release June 2022" />

The [[Rand Corporation]] in 2016 summarized a major benefit of Sentient as allowing humans performing intelligence analysis to focus on the "so what?" aspect of analysis, while the Sentient automation would handle the details of "what", as automation may be better suited for the data collection role.<ref name="Rand USAF Intel 2016" /> Writing for Grey Dynamics and analyzing NRO declassified collateral, Alec Smith noted Sentient's ability to increase "situational awareness based on observed activity and historical intelligence to model and anticipate potential courses of actions of adversaries".<ref name="Smith Gray Feb 2024" />

According to [[Robert Cardillo]], former Director of the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], the system is intended to use "[[automated inference|automated inferencing]]" to aid intelligence collection.<ref name="Cardillo Cipher March 16 2017" /> Cardillo summarized Sentient in 2017 as "...a research and development effort, conducted jointly with NRO, to experiment with automation that ingests data, makes sense of it in the context of an intelligence problem, and then infers likely future intelligence and collection needs... The approach is to continue to introduce automation in the processing arena that will support automated inferencing, and therefore, faster tasking for future collections."<ref name="Cardillo Cipher March 16 2017" /><ref name="Smith Gray Feb 2024" />

[[United States Army]] Captain Anjanay Kumar proposed in 2021 that should the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] engage in conflict with [[China]] over [[Taiwan]], Sentient would be a likely target of [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese forces]].<ref name="Kumar Sentient Army 2021" /> Kumar described the scenario as, "While the Sentient program itself may be secure, the [[Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government|contractors]] and [[Data center|infrastructure]] associated with its hardware are not and present a weak point for the PRC to exploit. Before the [[Data migration|data moves]] from the [[Server (computing)|servers]], malicious [[Malware|software]] will attack the servers and causes their [[Cyber-kinetic attack|physical destruction]]."<ref name="Kumar Sentient Army 2021" /> 

''[[The Verge]]'' described Sentient as “an omnivorous analysis tool, capable of devouring data of all sorts, making sense of the past and present, anticipating the future, and pointing satellites toward what it determines will be the most interesting parts of that future.”<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" /> Quoted in ''The Verge'', [[Steven Aftergood]] of the [[Federation of American Scientists]] and the Project on Government Secrecy, said of Sentient, "It could include electronic intercepts of international communications; it could include prior imagery; it could include human sources."<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" />  In the same report, retired [[Central Intelligence Agency]] analyst Allen Thomson stated, "As I understand it, the intended — and aspirational — answer is ‘everything,’" and said that in "addition to images, that could include financial data, weather information, shipping stats, information from Google searches, records of pharmaceutical purchases, and more."<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" /> In ''The Fragile Dictator: Counterintelligence Pathologies in Authoritarian States'' by Wege and Mobley, they compared the NRO's Sentient program to the commercial Blacksky Global geospatial intelligence service offered by [[Spaceflight Industries]], and noted that Sentient-type tools can increase "intelligence equities" in regard to [[Maritime transport|oceanic shipping]] and "[[International sanctions|sanctions busting]]" attempts by [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Nation state|nation-states]].<ref name="Wege Mobley Fragile 2023" /> Sarah Shoker noted in ''Military-Age Males in Counterinsurgency and Drone Warfare'' that Sentient and comparable systems like [[automatic target recognition]] (ATR) can remove human limitations from time-sensitive intelligence analysis, highlighting that past behavioral and tactical patterns interpreted by these systems can forecast similar future actions.<ref name="Shoker 2020" />

The National Reconnaissance Office revealed in 2022 that the Sentient program had involvement with the [[United States Department of Defense]]s [[UAPTF|Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force]] (UAPTF) in tracking and research of [[Unidentified flying object|unidentified aerial phenomena]], also known as unidentified anomalous phenomena or unidentified flying objects.<ref name="NRO Official declassified release June 2022" /> In June 2022, the NRO declassified and released two unique and redacted reports on Sentient activities related to a UAP sighting of what was described as a "tic tac" shape, and other successes at detecting UAP.<ref name="NRO Sentient Operations Highlight 6 May 2021" /><ref name="NRO Recent Sentient Highlights 6 May 2021" /> NRO Office of Public Affairs official Karen Furgerson reported to ''The Verge'' in 2019 that:<ref name="Scoles Verge July 31 2019" />

{{Blockquote|text="The NRO has not said much about Sentient publicly because it is a classified program and NRO rarely appears before Congress in open hearings. It ingests high volumes of data and processes it. Sentient catalogs normal patterns, detects anomalies, and helps forecast and model adversaries’ potential courses of action. Sentient is a thinking system. Sentient aims to help analysts ‘connect the dots’ in a large volume of data."}}

In his book ''The Origins of Victory: How Disruptive Military Innovation Determines the Fates of Great Powers'', [[Andrew Krepinevich]] highlights the same remarks from Furgerson, and notes that the "avalanche" of data available from intelligence, military, and commercial sources would overwhelm human staff attempting to analyze it all.<ref name="Krepinevich Sentient 2023" /> Krepinevich provides details on some of the commercial sources of data the NRO has contracted with to provide intelligence services and data for the Sentient program.<ref name="Krepinevich Sentient 2023" /> Among these are [[Maxar Technologies]], Planet, and BlackSky; Krepinevich notes that BlackSky "hoovers up" materials from dozens of satellites, over one hundred million mobile devices, and similar numbers of ships, planes, social networks, and environmental sensors as raw collateral for big-data analytics to assist Sentient and it's machine learning operations.<ref name="Krepinevich Sentient 2023" />

[[Betty J. Sapp]], former [[Leadership of the National Reconnaissance Office|Director of the National Reconnaissance Office]] from 2012 to 2019, described the Sentient program to the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces]] as "...a 'thinking' system that allows automated, multi-intelligence tipping and cueing at machine speeds-has been focused against many of our most challenging mission sets, resulting in new intelligence information that human-in-the-loop systems would have missed. Our Future Ground Architecture will leverage Sentient, and create an integrated cloud-based enterprise that will share tasking and intelligence products quickly across each of our ground sites, increasing both performance and resilience.<ref name="Sapp Strategic Forces House 2017" /> At the 2013 GEOINT Symposium held by the [[United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation]], Sapp said of Sentient, "The ground needs to be a very capable orchestrator to realize the full potential of multi-INT overhead space architecture," and that Sentient will 'will allow NRO to be not only responsive, but also predictive, with where it aims spaceborne assets.'<ref name="GEOINT 2013 Symposium" /> In 2016, Sapp discussed the application of using [[cubesat]] systems for NRO work, which were tested as part of the Sentient program.<ref name="Gruss Spacenews May 18 2016" />

According to Sapp, the NRO has been asked to give more demonstrations to observe Sentient and its capabilities in demonstrations to the defense and intelligence communities than 'any other capability since the [[Chronology of the National Reconnaissance Office|beginning of the organization’s history]].'<ref name="Ackermann Signal April 1 2015" />
