==Impact on the legal industry==

In the 2016 report, [[Deloitte]] estimated that more than 110,000 law jobs in just the United Kingdom alone could disappear within the next twenty years due to automation. This change could result in the creation of more highly skilled jobs and in the reduction of paralegal and temporary positions. Deloitte's report asserts that "there is significant potential for high-skilled roles that involve repetitive processes to be automated by smart and self-learning algorithms".<ref>"Developing legal talent: Stepping into the future law firm." Deloitte. N.p., Feb. 2016. Web. 17 June 2017. <https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/audit/articles/developing-legal-talent.html#>.</ref> 

Legal tech start-up companies have begun developing applications that assist law firms with completing low-risk legal processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiprofessionals.io/|title=AI Professionals Home - AI Contract Review For Lawyers|website=aiprofessionals.io|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawgeex.com/|title=Homepage|website=LawGeex|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kirasystems.com/|title=Machine Learning Contract Search, Review and Analysis Software|website=kirasystems.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> These applications can enable lawyers to focus on more work that requires their specific expertise.

The automation of processes like contract reviewing, enforcement of negotiations (smart contracts) and client intake (expert systems) allows law firms to streamline their procedures and improve efficiency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2018/09/five-ways-for-law-firms-to-become-more-efficient/|title=Five Ways for Law Firms to Become More Efficient|last=Urban|first=Holly|date=2018-09-24|website=Law Technology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> In addition, automation benefits small-to-medium law firms that do not have the resources to utilize junior talent on such routine tasks.  

The increase of law firms utilizing automated applications could result into legal tech becoming a necessity in the industry. Digital Reason CEO, Tim Estes, stated that those who refuse the opportunity to integrate AI in their workflow are “most at risk.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cio.com/article/3190142/why-ai-will-both-increase-efficiency-and-create-jobs.html|title=Why AI will both increase efficiency and create jobs|last=White|first=Sarah K.|date=2017-04-17|website=CIO|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>

In 2018, Forbes reported a 713% increase in investments in legal tech. This rapid growth is reflective of law firms beginning to “cede business to… new model legal providers… that meld technological, business and legal expertise.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcohen1/2019/05/03/getting-beyond-the-tech-in-legal-tech/|title=Getting Beyond The Tech in Legal Tech|last=Cohen|first=Mark A.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>

==Access to law and justice==

It has been widely estimated for at least the last generation that all the programs and resources devoted to ensuring access to justice address only 20% of the civil legal needs of low-income people in the United States.<ref>Legal Services Corporation, Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low Income Americans, 2009, p.13.</ref> Drawing on this experience, in late 2011, the U.S. government-funded [[Legal Services Corporation]] decided to convene a summit of leaders to explore how best to use technology in the access-to-justice community. The group adopted a mission for The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice (Summit) consistent with the magnitude of the challenge: "to explore the potential of technology to move the United States toward providing some form of effective assistance to 100% of persons otherwise unable to afford an attorney for dealing with essential civil legal needs".<ref>Legal Services Corporation, Report of The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice, p. 1; December 2013.</ref>

In April 2017, joined by [[Microsoft]] and [[Pro Bono Net]], the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) announced a pilot program to develop online, statewide legal portals to direct individuals with civil legal needs to the most appropriate forms of assistance. These portals will use cutting-edge, user-centered technology to help ensure that all people with civil legal needs can navigate their options and more easily access solutions and services available from legal aid, the courts, the private bar, and community partners.<ref>"Press Release: The Legal Services Corporation Announces Pilot States for Innovative Program to Increase Access to Justice." Lsc.gov. Legal Service Corporation (LSC), 24 Apr. 2017. Web. 17 June 2017. <http://www.lsc.gov/media-center/press-releases/2017/legal-services-corporation-announces-pilot-states-innovative>.</ref>
