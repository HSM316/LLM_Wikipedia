A '''personal knowledge base''' ('''PKB''') is an electronic tool used by an individual to express, capture, and later retrieve personal knowledge. It differs from a traditional [[database]] in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner, that others may not agree with nor care about. Importantly, a PKB consists primarily of knowledge, rather than [[information]]; in other words, it is not a collection of documents or other sources an individual has encountered, but rather an expression of the distilled knowledge the owner has extracted from those sources or from elsewhere.<ref name="Davies 2005">{{Cite tech report |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |last2=Velez-Morales |first2=Javier |last3=King |first3=Roger |date=August 2005 |title=Building the memex sixty years later: trends and directions in personal knowledge bases |number=CU-CS-997-05 |location=Boulder, Colo. |institution=Department of Computer Science, [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] |url=https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/reports/t722h9830}}</ref><ref name="Davies 2011">{{Cite journal |last=Davies |first=Stephen |date=February 2011 |title=Still building the memex |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=80–88 |doi=10.1145/1897816.1897840 |s2cid=9551946 |url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/2/104378-still-building-the-memex/fulltext |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624161048/https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/2/104378-still-building-the-memex/fulltext |archive-date=2021-06-24 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Völkel 2010">See also the dissertation of Max Völkel, which examined personal knowledge data models, and proposed a meta-model called "Conceptual Data Structures": {{Cite thesis |last=Völkel |first=Max |title=Personal knowledge models with semantic technologies |date=January 2010 |publisher=Faculty of Economics, [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], University of the State of Baden-Württemberg, and National Laboratory of the Helmholtz Association |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000019641 |doi=10.5445/IR/1000019641 |oclc=837821583 |type=Ph.D. thesis |location=Karlsruhe}}</ref>

The term {{em|personal knowledge base}} was mentioned as early as the 1980s,<ref name="Brooks 1985">{{Cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Tom |date=April 1985 |title=New technologies and their implications for local area networks |journal=Computer Communications |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=82–87 |doi=10.1016/0140-3664(85)90218-X }}</ref><ref name="Kruger 1986">{{Cite book |last=Krüger |first=Gerhard |title=Employment and the transfer of technology |date=1986 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=3540166394 |editor-last=Henn |editor-first=Rudolf |location=Berlin; New York |pages=39–52 |chapter=Future information technology—motor of the 'information society' |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-71292-0_4 |oclc=14108228 }}</ref><ref name="Forman 1988">{{Cite book |last=Forman |first=George E. |title=Constructivism in the computer age |date=1988 |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=0805801014 |editor-last=Forman |editor-first=George E. |series=The Jean Piaget Symposium series |location=Hillsdale, NJ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/constructivismin0000unse/page/83 83–101] |chapter=Making intuitive knowledge explicit through future technology |oclc=16922453 |editor-last2=Pufall |editor-first2=Peter B. |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/constructivismin0000unse/page/83 |chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name="Smith 1991">{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Catherine F. |title=Evolving perspectives on computers and composition studies: questions for the 1990s |date=1991 |publisher=[[National Council of Teachers of English]] |isbn=0814111661 |editor-last=Hawisher |editor-first=Gail E. |location=Urbana, IL |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolvingperspect00gail/page/224 224–252] |chapter=Reconceiving hypertext |oclc=23462809 |editor-last2=Selfe |editor-first2=Cynthia L. |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/evolvingperspect00gail/page/224 |chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref> but the term came to prominence in the 2000s when it was described at length in publications by computer scientist Stephen Davies and colleagues,<ref name="Davies 2005" /><ref name="Davies 2011" /> who compared PKBs on a number of different dimensions, the most important of which is the [[data model]] that each PKB uses to organize knowledge.<ref name="Davies 2005" />{{rp|18}}<ref name="Völkel 2010" />

==Data models==
Davies and colleagues examined three aspects of the data models of PKBs:<ref name="Davies 2005" />{{rp|19–36}}

* their {{em|structural framework}}, which prescribes rules about how knowledge elements can be structured and interrelated (as a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]], [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], tree plus graph, spatially, categorically, as n-ary links, chronologically, or [[ZigZag (software)|ZigZag]]);
* their {{em|knowledge elements}}, or basic building blocks of information that a user creates and works with, and the level of [[granularity]] of those knowledge elements (such as word/concept, phrase/proposition, free text notes, links to information sources, or composite); and
* their {{em|schema}}, which involves the level of [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]] introduced into the data model (such as a [[type system]] and related [[Database schema|schema]]s, keywords, [[attribute–value pair]]s, etc.).

Davies and colleagues also emphasized the principle of [[transclusion]], "the ability to view the same knowledge element (not a copy) in multiple contexts", which they considered to be "pivotal" to an ideal PKB.<ref name="Davies 2005" /><ref name="Davies 2011" /> They concluded, after reviewing many design goals, that the ideal PKB was still to come in the future.<ref name="Davies 2005" /><ref name="Davies 2011" />

===Personal knowledge graph===
In their publications on PKBs, Davies and colleagues discussed [[knowledge graph]]s as they were implemented in some software of the time.<ref name="Davies 2005" /><ref name="Davies 2011" /> Later, other writers used the term '''personal knowledge graph''' (PKG) to refer to a PKB featuring a graph structure and [[graph visualization]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pyne |first1=Yvette |last2=Stewart |first2=Stuart |date=March 2022 |title=Meta-work: how we research is as important as what we research |journal=[[British Journal of General Practice]] |volume=72 |issue=716 |pages=130–131 |pmid=35210247 |pmc=8884432 |doi=10.3399/bjgp22X718757}}</ref> However, the term {{em|personal knowledge graph}} is also used by software engineers to refer to the different subject of a knowledge graph {{em|about}} a person,<ref>For example: {{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Xiang |last2=Tur |first2=Gokhan |last3=Hakkani-Tür|author3-link=Dilek Hakkani-Tür |first3=Dilek |last4=Li |first4=Qi |date=December 2014 |chapter=Personal knowledge graph population from user utterances in conversational understanding |title=SLT 2014: 2014 IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology: proceedings: December 7–10, 2014, South Lake Tahoe, Nevada, U.S.A. |publisher=[[IEEE]] |location=Piscataway, NJ |pages=224–229 |isbn=9781479971305 |oclc=945951970 |doi=10.1109/SLT.2014.7078578 |s2cid=6428777 |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282177475}} And: {{cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=Lei |last2=Zhang |first2=Huijun |last3=Feng |first3=Ling |date=January 2022 |title=Building and using personal knowledge graph to improve suicidal ideation detection on social media |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Multimedia]] |volume=24 |pages=87–102 |doi=10.1109/TMM.2020.3046867|arxiv=2012.09123 |s2cid=229210559 }}</ref> in contrast to a knowledge graph {{em|created by}} a person in a PKB.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Balog |first1=Krisztian |last2=Mirza |first2=Paramita |last3=Skjæveland |first3=Martin G. |last4=Wang |first4=Zhilin |date=June 2022 |title=Report on the Workshop on Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKG 2021) at AKBC 2021 |journal=ACM SIGIR Forum |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 (8) |quote=What does 'personal' in PKG mean? It could be taken to mean (objective) facts about the user (''I ate lunch at restaurant X on date Y. I like fish.''), subjective beliefs of the user (''[I believe that] Pineapple pizza is just wrong. The Earth is flat.''), or objective facts that are of particular interest to the user (''Pineapple pizza is also often called Hawaiian Pizza''). |url=https://www.sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p04.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220711210242/https://www.sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/p04.pdf |archive-date=2022-07-11 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Software architecture ==
Davies and colleagues also differentiated PKBs according to their [[software architecture]]: [[Computer file|file]]-based, database-based, or [[client–server]] systems (including Internet-based systems accessed through desktop computers and/or handheld mobile devices).<ref name="Davies 2005" />{{rp|37–41}}

== History ==
Non-electronic personal knowledge bases have probably existed in some form for centuries: [[Leonardo da Vinci#Journals and notes|Leonardo da Vinci's journals and notes]] are a famous example of the use of [[notebook]]s. [[Commonplace books]], {{em|[[florilegia]]}}, annotated [[private libraries]], and [[card file]]s (in German, {{lang|de|Zettelkästen}}) of [[index card]]s and [[edge-notched card]]s are examples of formats that have served this function in the pre-electronic age.<ref>For example, two articles that describe the use of [[edge-notched card]]s as a personal knowledge base in health and medicine are: {{cite journal |last=Hoff |first=Wilbur |date=May 1967 |title=A health information retrieval system for personal use |journal=[[Journal of School Health]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=251–254 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1967.tb00505.x |pmid=5182183 }} And: {{Cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Phil R. |title=Medicine, preserving the passion |last2=DeBakey |first2=Lois |date=1987 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=0387963618 |edition=1st |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/medicinepreservi00mann/page/57 57–71 (59)] |chapter=The personal information center |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-1954-3_3 |oclc=13580831 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/medicinepreservi00mann/page/57 |chapter-url-access=registration}} Another mention of its use by a writer is: {{cite book |last=Piercy |first=Marge |author-link=Marge Piercy |date=1982 |title=Parti-colored blocks for a quilt |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/particoloredbloc00pier/page/27 27] |isbn=0472063383 |oclc=8476006 |url=https://archive.org/details/particoloredbloc00pier/page/27 |url-access=registration |doi=10.3998/mpub.7442 |quote=I have a memory annex which serves my purposes. It uses edge-notched cards.}}</ref>

Undoubtedly the most famous early formulation of an electronic PKB was [[Vannevar Bush]]'s description of the "[[memex]]" in 1945.<ref name="Davies 2005" /><ref name="Davies 2011" /><ref name="Bush 1945">{{Cite journal |last=Bush |first=Vannevar |date=July 1945 |title=As we may think |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ |journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=101–108 }}</ref> In a 1962 technical report, [[human–computer interaction]] pioneer [[Douglas Engelbart]] (who would later become famous for his 1968 "[[Mother of All Demos]]" that demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing) described his use of edge-notched cards to partially model Bush's memex.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Engelbart |first=Douglas C. |url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |title=Augmenting human intellect: a conceptual framework |date=1962 |publisher=[[Stanford Research Institute]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |chapter=Some possibilities with cards and relatively simple equipment |oclc=8671016 |access-date=2018-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035147/http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |archive-date=2011-05-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
