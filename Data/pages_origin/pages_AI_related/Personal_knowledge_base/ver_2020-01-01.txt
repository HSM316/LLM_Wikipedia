A '''personal knowledge base''' ('''PKB''') is an electronic tool used to express, capture, and later retrieve the personal knowledge of an individual. It differs from a traditional [[database]] in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner, that others may not agree with nor care about. Importantly, a PKB consists primarily of knowledge, rather than [[information]]; in other words, it is not a collection of documents or other sources an individual has encountered, but rather an expression of the distilled knowledge the owner has extracted from those sources.<ref name="Davies 2005">{{cite techreport |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |last2=Velez-Morales |first2=Javier |last3=King |first3=Roger |date=August 2005 |title=Building the memex sixty years later: trends and directions in personal knowledge bases |number=CU-CS-997-05 |location=Boulder, Colo. |institution=Department of Computer Science, [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] |url=http://scholar.colorado.edu/csci_techreports/931/ |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="Davies 2011">{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Stephen |date=February 2011 |title=Still building the memex |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=80–88 |doi=10.1145/1897816.1897840 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="Völkel 2010">See also the dissertation of Max Völkel, which examined personal knowledge data models, and proposed a meta-model called "Conceptual Data Structures": {{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. thesis |last=Völkel |first=Max |date=January 2010 |title=Personal knowledge models with semantic technologies |location=Karlsruhe |publisher=Faculty of Economics, [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], University of the State of Baden-Württemberg, and National Laboratory of the Helmholtz Association |oclc=837821583 |doi=10.5445/IR/1000019641 |url=http://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000019641}}</ref>

Davies and colleagues examined three aspects of the data models of PKBs:

* their {{em|structural framework}}, which prescribes rules about how knowledge elements can be structured and interrelated (as a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]], [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], tree plus graph, spatially, categorically, or as n-ary links);
* their {{em|knowledge elements}}, or basic building blocks of information that a user creates and works with, and the level of [[granularity]] of those knowledge elements (such as word/concept, phrase/proposition, free text notes, links to information sources, or composite); and
* their {{em|schema}}, which involves the level of [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]] introduced into the data model (such as a [[type system]] and related [[Database schema|schema]]s, keywords, [[attribute–value pair]]s, etc.).<ref name="Davies 2005" />{{rp|19–36}}

Davies and colleagues also differentiated PKBs according to their [[Software architecture|architecture]]: [[Computer file|file]]-based, database-based, or [[client–server]] systems (including Internet-based systems accessed through desktop computers and/or handheld mobile devices).<ref name="Davies 2005" />{{rp|37–41}}

Non-electronic personal knowledge bases have probably existed in some form for centuries: [[Leonardo da vinci#Journals and notes|Da Vinci's notebooks]] are a famous example. More commonly, files of [[index card]]s (in German, ''[[:de:Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]]''), [[edge-notched card]]s and annotated [[private libraries]], have served this function in the pre-electronic age.<ref>For example, two articles that describe the use of [[edge-notched card]]s as a personal knowledge base in health and medicine are: {{cite journal |last=Hoff |first=Wilbur |date=May 1967 |title=A health information retrieval system for personal use |journal=[[Journal of School Health]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=251–254 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1967.tb00505.x |pmid=5182183 |ref=harv}} And: {{cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Phil R. |last2=DeBakey |first2=Lois |date=1987 |chapter=The personal information center |title=Medicine, preserving the passion |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/medicinepreservi00mann/page/57 57–71 (59)] |isbn=0387963618 |oclc=13580831 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-1954-3_3 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/medicinepreservi00mann/page/57 }}</ref> Undoubtedly the most famous early formulation of an electronic PKB was [[Vannevar Bush]]'s description of the "[[memex]]" in 1945.<ref name="Davies 2005"/><ref name="Davies 2011"/><ref name="Bush 1945">{{cite journal |last=Bush |first=Vannevar |date=July 1945 |title=As we may think |journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=101–108 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ |ref=harv}}</ref> In a 1962 technical report, [[human–computer interaction]] pioneer [[Douglas Engelbart]] (who would later become famous for his 1968 "[[Mother of All Demos]]" that demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing) described his use of edge-notched cards to partially model Bush's memex.<ref>{{cite book |last=Engelbart |first=Douglas C. |date=1962 |chapter=Some possibilities with cards and relatively simple equipment |title=Augmenting human intellect: a conceptual framework |location=Menlo Park, CA |publisher=[[Stanford Research Institute]] |oclc=8671016 |url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |ref=harv}}</ref>
