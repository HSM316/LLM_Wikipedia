'''''AI Dungeon''''' is a [[free-to-play]] [[Single-player video game|single-player]] and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[Interactive fiction|text adventure game]] which uses [[artificial intelligence]] to generate content. It allows players to create and share their own custom adventure settings. The game's first version was made available on [[Project Jupyter|Google Colaboratory]] in May 2019, and its second version (initially called ''AI Dungeon 2'') was released online and for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2019. The AI model was then upgraded in July 2020.

After beginning an adventure, there are three main interaction methods that can be chosen for each of the player's pieces of text input:<ref name="verge2" />

* Do: Must be followed by a [[verb]], allowing the player to perform an action.
* Say: Must be followed by [[Dialogue|dialogue sentences]], allowing players to communicate with other characters.
* Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events.
The game adapts and responds to most actions entered by the player.<ref name=":12" /> Providing blank input can also be used to prompt the AI to generate further content, and the game also provides players with options to [[Undo|undo or redo]] or modify recent events in order to improve the game's narrative.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gailloreto|first=Coleman|date=November 15, 2020|title=How Good Is The AI Dungeon At Narrating Roleplaying Games?|url=https://screenrant.com/ai-dungeon-game-run-dm-gm-tabletop-rpgs/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 20, 2020|website=[[ScreenRant]]|language=en-US}}</ref> Players are also given an option to explicitly tell the AI what elements to "remember" for reference in future parts of their play-through.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Creswell|first=Jacob|date=November 17, 2020|title=AI Dungeon Proves Machine Learning Games Are the Future|url=https://www.cbr.com/ai-dungeon-machine-learning-future-of-games/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 25, 2020|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== User-generated content ===
[[File:Ai dungeon with a custom setting.png|thumb|AI dungeon with a custom prompt]]

In addition to the pre-configured settings available in ''AI Dungeon'', players have the ability to create custom "adventures" from scratch by describing the setting in text format. The AI will then generate a setting based on the user's input.<ref name="verge2" /><ref name=":9" />

Custom adventures that players create can be published for others to play. The game provides an interface for browsing published adventures along with the ability to leave comments and [[Like button|like]] them.

=== Multiplayer ===
''AI Dungeon'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode in which different players each have a dedicated character and can take turns interacting with the AI within the same game session. This supports both online play across multiple devices or local play using a shared device.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

The game's host players are given additional permissions, whereby they can supervise the AI and make modifications to its output.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Unlike the single-player game, in which actions and stories use [[Narration#Second-person|second person narration]], multiplayer game stories are presented using [[Narration|third-person narration]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Worlds ===
''AI Dungeon'' allows players to set their adventures within specific "Worlds," which give context to the broader environment in which the adventure takes place.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|last=Orr|first=Andrew|date=October 1, 2020|title=Delve Into the 'AI Dungeon' for Text-Based Adventures|url=https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/delve-into-ai-dungeon/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 3, 2020|website=The Mac Observer|language=en-US}}</ref> This feature was first released with two different worlds available for selection: Xaxas, a "world of peace and prosperity," and Kedar, a "world of [[Dragon|dragons]], [[Demon|demons]], and [[Monster|monsters]]."<ref name=":20" />

â€œI realized that there were no games available that gave you the same freedom to do anything that I found in [Dungeons & Dragons]<ref name=":2" /> ... You can be so creative compared to other games."<ref name=":8" /></blockquote>
This led him to wonder if an AI could function as a [[Dungeon Master|dungeon master]].<ref name=":2" />

Unlike later versions of ''AI Dungeon'', the original did not allow players to specify any action they wanted. Instead, it generated them a finite list of possible actions to choose from.<ref name=":14" />

This first version of the game was released to the public in May 2019.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> It was released within [[Google]] Colab, an online tool for [[Data science|data scientists]] and AI researchers that allows for free execution of code on Google-hosted machines.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Abner|date=February 8, 2020|title=Google introduces Colab Pro w/ faster GPUs, more memory|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/02/08/google-introduces-colab-pro/|access-date=July 26, 2020|website=9to5Google|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":12" /> It required players to download the full model, 5 [[gigabyte]]s of data at the time.<ref name=":12" /> Within days of the initial release, this mandatory download resulted in [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] charges of over $20,000, forcing the temporary shut-down of the game until a [[peer-to-peer]] alternative solution was established.<ref name=":12" />

This initial version is not to be confused with another GPT-2-based adventure game, ''GPT Adventure'', created by [[Northwestern University]] [[neuroscience]] [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] student Nathan Whitmore, also released on Google Colab several months after the public release of ''AI Dungeon''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rayne|first=Elizabeth|date=September 9, 2019|title=This AI 'choose your own adventure' game literally writes itself as you play|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/this-ai-choose-your-own-adventure-game-literally-writes-itself-as-you-play|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 26, 2020|website=SYFY Wire|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Robitzski|first=Dan|date=September 5, 2019|title=A neural network dreams up this text adventure game as you play|url=https://futurism.com/text-adventure-game-neural-network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 26, 2020|website=Futurism|language=en}}</ref>

Reflecting later on the first version of ''AI Dungeon'', Walton stated that:<blockquote>"The first version of AI Dungeon was entertaining in its own wacky way, but it could almost never form a cohesive story... it was nothing like what it's become today."<ref name=":5" /></blockquote>

=== ''AI Dungeon 2'' (Full GPT-2) ===
In November 2019, a new, "full" version of GPT-2 was released by OpenAI.

At this time, Nick Walton also established a [[Patreon]] campaign to support the game's further growth (such as addition of multiplayer and voice support,<ref name=":12" /> along with longer-term plans to include music and image content<ref name=":12" />) and turn the game into a commercial endeavor, which Walton felt was necessary in order to cover the costs of delivering a high-quality version of the game.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":12" /> ''AI Dungeon'' was one of the only commercial applications to be based upon GPT-2.<ref name=":13" />

=== ''Dragon'' model release (GPT-3) ===
In July 2020, the developers introduced a premium-exclusive version of the AI model, named ''Dragon'', which uses OpenAI's new [[Application programming interface|API]] for leveraging the [[GPT-3]] model without maintaining a local copy (released on June 11, 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=July 17, 2020|title=The new, GPT-3-powered version of AI Dungeon is scarily good|url=https://boingboing.net/2020/07/17/the-new-gpt-3-powered-version.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 18, 2020|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" /> GPT-3 was trained with 570 gigabytes of text content (approximately one [[trillion]] words, with a $12 million development cost<ref name=":13" />) and can support 175 billion parameters, compared to the 40 gigabytes of training content and 1.5 billion parameters of GPT-2.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Heaven|first=Will Douglas|date=July 20, 2020|title=OpenAI's new language generator GPT-3 is shockingly goodâ€”and completely mindless|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 26, 2020|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6" /> 

The free model was also upgraded to a less advanced version of GPT-3 and was named ''Griffin''.<ref name=":5">{{cite web |last1=Walton |first1=Nick |date=July 14, 2020|title=AI Dungeon: Dragon Model Upgrade |url=https://medium.com/@aidungeon/ai-dungeon-dragon-model-upgrade-7e8ea579abfe |website=Medium|language=en|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref>

Speaking shortly after this release, on the differences between GPT-2 and GPT-3, Walton stated:<blockquote>"[GPT-3 is] one of the most powerful AI models in the world...<ref name=":17" /> It's just much more coherent in terms of understanding who the characters are, what they're saying, what's going on in the story and just being able to write an interesting and believable story."<ref name=":13" /></blockquote>In the latter half of 2020, the "Worlds" feature was added to ''AI Dungeon'', providing players with a selection of overarching worlds in which their adventures can take place.<ref name=":20" /> In February 2021, it was announced that ''AI Dungeon''<nowiki/>'s developers, Latitude, had raised $3.3 million in [[Seed money|seed funding]] (led by NFX, with participation from Album VC and Griffin Gaming Partners) to "build games with â€˜infinite' story possibilities."<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|last=Ha|first=Anthony|date=February 4, 2021|title=AI Dungeon-maker Latitude raises $3.3M to build games with 'infinite' story possibilities|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/latitude-seed-funding/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=[[TechCrunch]]|language=en-US}}</ref> The intention of this funding was to move AI content creation beyond the purely text-based nature of ''AI Dungeon'' as it existed at the time.
== Reception ==
Approximately two thousand people played the original version of the game within the first month of its May 2019 release.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> By contrast, within a week of its December 2019 relaunch, the game reached over 100,000 players and over 500,000 play-throughs,<ref name=":0" /> and reached 1.5 million players by June 2020.<ref name=":3" />

As of December 2019, the game's corresponding Patreon campaign was raising approximately $15,000 per month.<ref name="verge2" />

[It] is a game that's charming, occasionally frustrating, but mostly just impressive in its raw creativity and spirit."<ref name=":19" /></blockquote>Jon Mundy of ''TapSmart'' awarded it a 3 out of 5-star rating, similarly, praising its variety and the "magical" custom adventure option, but described its adventure narratives as "often too passive and vague" and lacking in resolution.<ref name=":9" />

=== GPT-3 edition reviews ===
The AI's tendency to create graphic and sexual content despite not being prompted by players was noted by reviewers, including Lindsay Bicknell. Latitude [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Nick Walton and employee Suchin Gururangan responded to such concerns, stating that the behavior was unexpected and reasoning that such a thing occurs due to a lack of strict constraints placed on the GPT-3 model. They stated that they did not do enough to prevent it from behaving this way "in the wild".<ref name="Utah Review">{{cite web |last1=Bicknell |first1=Lindsay |title=Latitude Games' AI Dungeon was changing the face of AI-generated content |url=https://www.utahbusiness.com/latitude-games-ai-dungeon-was-changing-the-face-of-ai-generated-content-until-its-users-turned-against-it/ |website=Utah Business Magazine |access-date=June 23, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Wired-Darker">{{Cite news|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 5, 2021|title=It Began as an AI-Fueled Dungeon Game.

=== Creating non-game content ===
In addition to those who used ''AI Dungeon'' for its primary purpose as a game, other users experimented with using its language generation interface to create other forms of content that would not be found in traditional games (primarily via the custom adventure option). Although the game was primarily trained using text adventures, training content for the GPT models themselves included large amounts of web content (including the entirety of the English-language [[Wikipedia]]), thereby allowing the game to adapt to areas outside of this core focus.<ref name=":13" /> <ref>{{Cite web |last=Vincent |first=James |date=July 30, 2020 |title=OpenAI's latest breakthrough is astonishingly powerful, but still fighting its flaws |url=https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential |access-date=July 31, 2020 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref> Examples of ''AI Dungeon'' being used in this way include:

=== Content moderation and user privacy ===
In April 2021, ''AI Dungeon'' implemented a new algorithm for [[Moderation system|content moderation]] to prevent instances of text-based [[simulated child pornography]] created by users. The moderation process involved a human moderator reading through private stories.<ref name="Vice-Moderators"/><ref name="Wired-Darker"/><ref name="Techspot-Censored"/><ref name="Polygon-Controversy"/> The filter frequently flagged [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]] due to wording (terms like "eight-year-old laptop" misinterpreted as the age of a child), affecting permissible pornographic and non-pornographic stories. Controversy and [[review bombing]] of ''AI Dungeon'' occurred as a result of the moderation system, citing false positives and a lack of communication between Latitude and its userbase following the change.<ref name="Utah Review"/>

===Addition of advertisements===
In June 2022, ''AI Dungeon'' added [[advertisements]] to replace the past "energy" (users would need to wait to get more turns at generating AI content) system.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Latitude |url=https://latitude.io/blog/introducing-endless-ai-dungeon?utm_campaign=ads_banner&utm_source=banner&utm_medium=banner |access-date=July 11, 2022 |website=latitude.io}}</ref> The advertisement system would allow infinite tries of AI output, but would occasionally interrupt gameplay with advertisements. This addition was met with backlash from users, and Latitude would add a beta system in response, allowing storing of actions with the only way of getting more actions being watching an advertisement. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Latitude |url=https://latitude.io/blog/a-retrospective-on-adswere-making-changes-based-on-your-feedback |access-date=July 11, 2022 |website=latitude.io}}</ref>

=== Release on Steam ===
The [[Steam (service)|Steam]] version of ''AI Dungeon'' was released on July 28, 2022. <ref>{{Cite web |title=AI Dungeon is coming to Steam on July 28th. One-time purchase.
