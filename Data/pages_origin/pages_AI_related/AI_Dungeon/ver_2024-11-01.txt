'''''AI Dungeon''''' is a single-player/multiplayer [[Interactive fiction|text adventure game]] which uses [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) to generate content and allows players to create and share adventures and custom prompts. The game's first version was made available in May 2019, and its second version (initially called ''AI Dungeon 2'') was released on [[Google Colaboratory]] in December 2019. It was later ported that same month to its current cross-platform [[web application]]. The AI model was then reformed in July 2020.

== Gameplay ==
''AI Dungeon'' is a text adventure game that uses artificial intelligence to generate random storylines in response to player-submitted stimuli.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web |last=Nelius |first=Joanna |date=August 3, 2020 |title=This AI-Powered Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Text Game Is Super Fun and Makes No Sense |url=https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-powered-choose-your-own-adventure-text-game-is-1844593111 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228164901/https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-powered-choose-your-own-adventure-text-game-is-1844593111 |archive-date=February 28, 2021 |access-date=August 4, 2020 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Macgregor|first=Jody|date=December 8, 2019|title=This AI writes a text adventure while you play it|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/this-ai-writes-a-text-adventure-while-you-play-it/|access-date=December 10, 2019|work=[[PC Gamer]]|archive-date=July 20, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220720075000/https://www.pcgamer.com/this-ai-writes-a-text-adventure-while-you-play-it/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=James|date=December 6, 2019|title=This AI text adventure game has pretty much infinite possibilities|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning|access-date=December 10, 2019|work=[[The Verge]]|archive-date=July 13, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713160748/https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":18">{{Cite web|last=Grannell|first=Craig|date=January 12, 2020|title=App of the week: AI Dungeon|url=https://www.stuff.tv/app-reviews/ai-dungeon/review|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712163800/https://www.stuff.tv/app-reviews/ai-dungeon/review|archive-date=July 12, 2020|access-date=July 11, 2020|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

After beginning an adventure, four main interaction methods can be chosen for the player's text input:<ref name="verge2" />

* Do: Must be followed by a [[verb]], allowing the player to perform an action.
* Say: Must be followed by [[Dialogue|dialogue sentences]], allowing players to communicate with other characters.
* Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events.
* See: Must be followed by a description, allowing the player to perceive events, objects, or characters. Using this command creates an AI generated image, and does not affect gameplay.
The game adapts and responds to most actions the player enters.<ref name=":12" /> Providing blank inputs can be used to prompt the AI to generate further content, and the game also provides players with options to [[Undo|undo or redo]] or modify recent events to improve the game's narrative.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gailloreto|first=Coleman|date=November 15, 2020|title=How Good Is The AI Dungeon At Narrating Roleplaying Games?|url=https://screenrant.com/ai-dungeon-game-run-dm-gm-tabletop-rpgs/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120000520/https://screenrant.com/ai-dungeon-game-run-dm-gm-tabletop-rpgs/|archive-date=November 20, 2020|access-date=November 20, 2020|website=[[Screen Rant]]|language=en-US}}</ref> Players can also tell the AI what elements to "remember" for reference in future parts of their playthrough.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Creswell|first=Jacob|date=November 17, 2020|title=AI Dungeon Proves Machine Learning Games Are the Future|url=https://www.cbr.com/ai-dungeon-machine-learning-future-of-games/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119111753/https://www.cbr.com/ai-dungeon-machine-learning-future-of-games/|archive-date=November 19, 2020|access-date=November 25, 2020|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== User-generated content ===
[[File:Ai dungeon with a custom setting.png|thumb|''AI Dungeon'' with a custom prompt]]

In addition to ''AI Dungeon''<nowiki/>'s pre-configured settings, players can create custom "adventures" from scratch by describing the setting in text format, which the AI will then generate a setting from.<ref name="verge2" /><ref name=":9" />

These custom adventures can be published for others to play, with an interface for browsing published adventures and leaving comments under them.

=== Multiplayer ===
''AI Dungeon'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode in which different players each have their own character and take turns interacting with the AI within the same game session. Multiplayer supports both online play across multiple devices or local play using a shared device.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

The game's hosts are able to supervise the AI and modify its output.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Unlike the single-player game, in which actions and stories use [[Narration#Second-person|second person narration]], multiplayer game stories are presented using [[Narration|third-person narration]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Worlds ===
''AI Dungeon'' allows players to set their adventures within specific "Worlds" that give context to the broader environment where the adventure takes place.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|last=Orr|first=Andrew|date=October 1, 2020|title=Delve Into the 'AI Dungeon' for Text-Based Adventures|url=https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/delve-into-ai-dungeon/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010173051/https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/delve-into-ai-dungeon/|archive-date=October 10, 2020|access-date=October 3, 2020|website=The Mac Observer|language=en-US}}</ref> This feature was first released with two different worlds available for selection: Xaxas, a "world of peace and prosperity"; and Kedar, a "world of [[dragon]]s, [[demon]]s, and [[monster]]s".<ref name=":20" />

=== ''Dragon'' model release (GPT-3) ===
In July 2020, the developers introduced a premium-exclusive version of the AI model, named ''Dragon'', which uses [[OpenAI|OpenAI's]] new [[Application programming interface|API]] for leveraging the [[GPT-3]] model without maintaining a local copy (released on June 11, 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=July 17, 2020|title=The new, GPT-3-powered version of AI Dungeon is scarily good|url=https://boingboing.net/2020/07/17/the-new-gpt-3-powered-version.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200718075631/https://boingboing.net/2020/07/17/the-new-gpt-3-powered-version.html|archive-date=July 18, 2020|access-date=July 18, 2020|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" /> GPT-3 was trained with 570 gigabytes of text content (approximately one [[trillion]] words, with a $12 million development cost<ref name=":13" />) and can support 175 billion parameters, compared to the 40 gigabytes of training content and 1.5 billion parameters of GPT-2.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Heaven|first=Will Douglas|date=July 20, 2020|title=OpenAI's new language generator GPT-3 is shockingly good—and completely mindless|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725175436/https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/|archive-date=July 25, 2020|access-date=July 26, 2020|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6" />

The free model was also upgraded to a less advanced version of GPT-3 and was named ''Griffin''.<ref name=":5">{{cite web |last1=Walton |first1=Nick |date=July 14, 2020 |title=AI Dungeon: Dragon Model Upgrade |url=https://medium.com/@aidungeon/ai-dungeon-dragon-model-upgrade-7e8ea579abfe |website=Medium |language=en |access-date=July 15, 2020 |archive-date=October 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031042816/https://medium.com/@aidungeon/ai-dungeon-dragon-model-upgrade-7e8ea579abfe |url-status=live }}</ref>

Speaking shortly after this release, on the differences between GPT-2 and GPT-3, Walton stated:<blockquote>"[GPT-3 is] one of the most powerful AI models in the world...<ref name=":17" /> It's just much more coherent in terms of understanding who the characters are, what they're saying, what's going on in the story and just being able to write an interesting and believable story."<ref name=":13" /></blockquote>In the latter half of 2020, the "Worlds" feature was added to ''AI Dungeon'', providing players with a selection of overarching worlds in which their adventures can take place.<ref name=":20" /> In February 2021, it was announced that ''AI Dungeon''<nowiki/>'s developers, Latitude, had raised $3.3 million in [[Seed money|seed funding]] (led by NFX, with participation from Album VC and Griffin Gaming Partners) to "build games with 'infinite' story possibilities."<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|last=Ha|first=Anthony|date=February 4, 2021|title=AI Dungeon-maker Latitude raises $3.3M to build games with 'infinite' story possibilities|url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/latitude-seed-funding/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230429231817/https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/latitude-seed-funding/|archive-date=April 29, 2023|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=[[TechCrunch]]|language=en-US}}</ref> this funding intended to move AI content creation beyond the purely text-based nature of ''AI Dungeon'' as it existed at the time.

After its announcement on August 20, a new 'See' interaction mode was made available for all players and added to the game on August 30, 2022.

''AI Dungeon'' was retired from Steam on March 12, 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-12 |title=AI Dungeon - AI Dungeon on Steam has been retired - Steam News |url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1519310/view/4139442565112398687 |access-date=2024-07-12 |website=store.steampowered.com |language=en}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Approximately two thousand people played the original version of the game within the first month of its May 2019 release.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> Within a week of its December 2019 relaunch, the game reached over 100,000 players and over 500,000 play-throughs,<ref name=":0" /> and reached 1.5 million players by June 2020.<ref name=":3" />

As of December 2019, the game's corresponding Patreon campaign had raised approximately $15,000 per month.<ref name="verge2" />

=== GPT-3 edition reviews ===
The AI's tendency to create graphic and sexual content despite not being prompted by players was noted by reviewers, including Lindsay Bicknell. Latitude [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Nick Walton and researcher Suchin Gururangan responded to such concerns, stating that the behavior was unexpected and reasoning that such a thing occurs due to a lack of strict constraints placed on the GPT-3 model. They stated that they did not do enough to prevent it from behaving this way "in the wild".<ref name="Utah Review">{{cite web |last1=Bicknell |first1=Lindsay |title=Latitude Games' AI Dungeon was changing the face of AI-generated content |url=https://www.utahbusiness.com/latitude-games-ai-dungeon-was-changing-the-face-of-ai-generated-content-until-its-users-turned-against-it/ |website=Utah Business Magazine |date=June 22, 2021 |access-date=June 23, 2021 |archive-date=July 4, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704135806/https://www.utahbusiness.com/latitude-games-ai-dungeon-was-changing-the-face-of-ai-generated-content-until-its-users-turned-against-it/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Wired-Darker">{{Cite magazine|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 5, 2021|title=It Began as an AI-Fueled Dungeon Game.

=== Creating non-game content ===
In addition to those who used ''AI Dungeon'' for its primary purpose as a game, other users experimented with using its language generation interface to create other forms of content that would not be found in traditional games (primarily via the custom adventure option). Although the game was primarily trained using text adventures, training content for the GPT models themselves included large amounts of web content (including the entirety of the English-language [[Wikipedia]]), thereby allowing the game to adapt to areas outside of this core focus.<ref name=":13" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Vincent |first=James |date=July 30, 2020 |title=OpenAI's latest breakthrough is astonishingly powerful, but still fighting its flaws |url=https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential |access-date=July 31, 2020 |website=The Verge |language=en |archive-date=July 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730235924/https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential |url-status=live }}</ref> Examples of ''AI Dungeon'' being used in this way include:

=== Content moderation and user privacy ===
In April 2021, ''AI Dungeon'' implemented a new algorithm for [[Moderation system|content moderation]] to prevent instances of text-based [[simulated child pornography]] created by users. The moderation process involved a human moderator reading through private stories.<ref name="Vice-Moderators"/><ref name="Wired-Darker"/><ref name="Techspot-Censored"/><ref name="Polygon-Controversy"/> The filter frequently flagged [[False positives and false negatives|false positives]] due to wording (terms like "eight-year-old laptop" misinterpreted as the age of a child), affecting both pornographic and non-pornographic stories. Controversy and [[review bombing]] of ''AI Dungeon'' occurred as a result of the moderation system, citing false positives and a lack of communication between Latitude and its user base following the change.<ref name="Utah Review"/>

===Addition of advertisements===
In June 2022, ''AI Dungeon'' added [[advertisements]] to replace the past "energy" system. in which users would need to wait for energy to refill to generate more content.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Latitude |url=https://latitude.io/blog/introducing-endless-ai-dungeon |access-date=July 11, 2022 |website=latitude.io |archive-date=July 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220716002354/https://latitude.io/blog/introducing-endless-ai-dungeon?utm_campaign=ads_banner&utm_source=banner&utm_medium=banner |url-status=live }}</ref> The advertisement system would allow for infinite tries of AI output, but would occasionally interrupt gameplay with advertisements.
