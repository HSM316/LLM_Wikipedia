== Models ==
[[File:ADMs.jpg|thumb|(left to right): K3 Indoor, K5 Outdoor, K1 Stationary and K7 Multi-Terrain Autonomous Data Machines]]
Knightscope has four different robot models: the K1, K3, K5 and K7. Clients are charged [[software as a service|an hourly rate]] of $7 for each machine they use &mdash; a price designed to compete with the [[minimum wage]] in various states. The price structure requires the robots to operate on a 24/7 basis, and a minimum of two robots per location, costing $122,640 per annum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-security-robots-from-maker-of-now-infamous-k5-unit/|title=Two new security robots from maker of now-infamous K5 unit|first=Greg|last=Nichols|website=ZDNet|date=2017-09-27|accessdate=2018-12-23}}</ref>

=== K5 ===
The K5 model is a bullet-shaped robot that stands about 5 feet tall. It has twin panels of lights about two-thirds of the way up its body. There is also a small silver-colored [[flag of the United States]] on the left side of its body.<ref name=pandodaily>{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=James|title=Knightscope's new robotic law enforcer is like staring at the demise of humanity|url=http://pando.com/2014/02/24/knightscopes-new-robotic-law-enforcer-is-like-staring-at-the-demise-of-humanity/|website=Pandodaily|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref> The K5 patrols and charges autonomously and detects crime using a variety of [[sensor]]s including a [[video camera]], [[thermal imaging|thermal imaging sensors]], a [[laser range finder]], [[radar]], air quality sensors, and a detector for suspicious wireless signals.<ref name=SPCA>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Shankland |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/security-robot-loses-its-job-after-vandalism-threats/ |title=Security robot loses its job after vandalism, threats |publisher=CNet |date=December 15, 2017 }}</ref>

During its autonomous patrol, if the K5 detects abnormal noise and temperature change, or known [[criminals]], it will alert the guards.<ref name="New York Times" /><ref name="FOX News" /> The software package with which a user can respond to such alerts is called the Knightscope Security Operations Center.<ref name="ap">{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/78062635741c416face805692cd93452|title=Knightscope showroom to open in NYC|publisher=Associated Press|date=2018-08-29|accessdate=2019-02-06}}</ref>

=== Mobility ===
The K5 moves at 1 to 3 miles per hour.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/01/26/knightscope-k5-police-robot/4018047/|title=Change Agents: William Li's robot wants to police you|website=USA Today|last1=Cava|first1=Marco|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=CIO>{{cite web|last1=Brandon|first1=John|title=5 Uses for the Surveillance Robot of Tomorrow|url=http://www.cio.com/article/2463903/robotics/5-uses-for-the-surveillance-robot-of-tomorrow.html|website=CIO|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref> It uses [[Robotic mapping|mapping]] software to create a [[geo-fence]]d perimeter that makes it stay within one area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} The K5 creates a [[point cloud]] to show a [[Stereoscopy|3D image]] of the surroundings in the geo-fenced area. The K5 also uses an [[ultrasonic sensor]] to detect objects in surroundings and movements of its wheels.<ref name=CIO />

=== K1, K3 and K7 ===
In 2016, one year after the release of the K5, Knightscope announced a K3 robot with a focus on indoor environments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160405005759/en/Knightscope-Announces-K3-Indoor-Autonomous-Security-Robot|title=Knightscope announces K3 indoor autonomous security robot|publisher=Business Wire|date=2016-04-05|accessdate=2019-02-06}}</ref> K1 and K7 follow-up models were both launched in 2018. The K1 is a stationary scanner designed for entrances and exits to buildings. It won the ''Security Today'' New Product of the Year award.<ref name="ap" /> The K7 is a larger all-terrain unit with four wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nanalyze.com/2018/05/robot-security-guards-knightscope/|title=Robot security guards from Knightscope|publisher=Nanalyze|date=2018-05-29|accessdate=2019-02-06}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

=== Privacy ===
The possibility of a K5 being used in public places has led to concerns with [[privacy]]. The K5 can take pictures and videos of people without any notification. It can also monitor conversations and social media feeds.<ref name=Mashable>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=The K5 Robot: A Roomba for Crime|url=http://mashable.com/2013/12/12/knightscope-k5/|website=Mashable |date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref> Some do not trust the K5's ability to recognize the actual suspects. Jeramie Scott, a national security fellow at the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)]] said, “Automated surveillance, facial recognition and license plate recognition in public makes us all suspects. The K5 could become like a cuter, less aggressive [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] that kills privacy instead of people.”<ref name=PCWorld>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Martyn|title=Will this robot make America safer?|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2069240/will-this-robot-make-america-safer.html|website=PCWorld|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref> The center's President, [[Marc Rotenberg]] stated that “Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge.”<ref name="mysecuritysign">{{cite web|last1=Pareek|first1=Shabdita|title=The Knightscope K5 robot could replace some security guards|url=http://www.mysecuritysign.com/blog/knightscope-k5-robot-replace-security-guards/|website=MySecuritySign|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

=== Incidents ===
In July 2016, a Knightscope K5 which was deployed at the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] in [[Palo Alto, CA]] collided with a 16-month-old toddler, bruising the child's leg and running over the child's foot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mall-powers-down-security-robots-after-one-bumps-into-toddler-2016-07-13|title=Mall Powers Down Security Robots After One Bumps into Toddler|last1=Wells|first1=Georgia|website=MarketWatch|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}</ref> The Stanford Shopping center responded by docking all of its K5 units, suspending any further activity by the robots until the incident could be investigated. Knightscope responded, calling the incident an "accident", and issued a formal apology to the family of the child.

In April 2017, a 41-year-old [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] man was arrested in connection with an alleged parking-lot altercation with a K5, also at the Stanford Shopping Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/silicon-valley-security-robot-beat-up-in-parking-lot-police-say/|title=Silicon Valley security robot beat up in parking lot, police say|last1=Kravetz|first1=David|website=Ars Technica|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2017, a Knightscope K5 ADM at the [[Washington Harbour]] development in Washington D.C. slipped on a loose brick surface and fell into a water fountain.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frankel|first1=Todd C|title=A security robot fell into a water fountain at a D.C. office building.

In December 2017, the San Francisco [[SPCA]] rented a Knightscope K5 robot to patrol the area next to their animal shelter, including the public sidewalk, to deter vandalism. The SPCA received complaints about using a robot on a public sidewalk where homeless people were encamped. A spokesperson of SPCA stated that the robot was effective at significantly reducing vandalism and petty crime in the area; however, amid accusations that SPCA was using the robot to deter nearby homeless encampments, which SPCA denied, the SPCA discontinued the contract.<ref name=SPCA/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/after-outcry-non-profit-stops-use-of-security-robot-to-oust-homeless/|title=After backlash, animal shelter fires security robot, 'effective immediately'|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|website=Ars Technica|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>

In October 2019 a woman attempted to report a fight in a Huntington Park, California Park using the k5's emergency alert button, only for it to reportedly tell the woman to "step out of the way."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/robocop-park-fight-how-expectations-about-robots-are-clashing-reality-n1059671?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma|title = Real-life RoboCop was at the scene of a crime.
