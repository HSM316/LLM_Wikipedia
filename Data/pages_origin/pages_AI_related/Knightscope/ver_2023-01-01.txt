Knightscope was founded in 2013, its founders stated that they were motivated to create autonomous security robots following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook School Shooting]] in 2012. Knightscope shipped their first robot in 2015. The company has four models of robots, designed for indoor, outdoor, and all terrain uses, as well as a model for stationary use. After several years of operation and several rounds of fundraising, primarily through [[equity crowdfunding]], the company became public and launched an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on January 27, 2022.

Knightscope is the most well known maker of fully autonomous security robots.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top security robots available in the market right now - asmag.com|url=https://www.asmag.com/showpost/30825.aspx|access-date=2022-01-04|website=www.asmag.com|archive-date=2022-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104195004/https://www.asmag.com/showpost/30825.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> Users of Knightscope robots have generally reported lower crime rates in the areas the robots were deployed, attributed mostly to physical deterrence by the robot's presence. Knightscope autonomous robots have raised concerns from critics over privacy and job displacement.

Vanderbilt University law professor Christopher Slobogin described Knightscope robots as "panvasive" because they are more noticeable than traditional security cameras and can thus be perceived as more intrusive.<ref name=":0"/> Cornell University computer science professor Ross Knepper argues that the mysterious nature of Knightscope robots adds value to their use as a physical deterrent to crime, arguing that potential offenders are unsure about the robots' features and capabilities and thus refrain from committing crimes with them in the vicinity.<ref name=":1" />

=== Job displacement concerns ===
Although designed to work in tandem with security personnel, Knightscope units have raised concerns about the displacement of private security guards. Knightscope robots are slightly more expensive than a typical unarmed security guard on an annual basis, but can operate 24 hours on a single charge, taking up three 8-hour shifts, thus costing a fraction of the price of round the clock security guards.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Statt|first=Nick|title=This crime-predicting robot aims to patrol our streets by 2015|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/this-crime-predicting-robot-aims-to-patrol-our-streets-by-2015/|access-date=2022-01-01|website=CNET|language=en|archive-date=2022-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220101060833/https://www.cnet.com/news/this-crime-predicting-robot-aims-to-patrol-our-streets-by-2015/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Privacy ===
The possibility of a K5 being used in public places has led to concerns with [[privacy]]. The K5 can take pictures and videos of people without any notification. It can also monitor conversations and social media feeds.<ref name=Mashable>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Chris|title=The K5 Robot: A Roomba for Crime|url=http://mashable.com/2013/12/12/knightscope-k5/|website=Mashable|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=November 4, 2014|archive-date=November 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102203625/http://mashable.com/2013/12/12/knightscope-k5/|url-status=live}}</ref> Some do not trust the K5's ability to recognize the actual suspects.

=== Incidents ===
In July 2016, a Knightscope K5 which was deployed at the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] in [[Palo Alto, CA]] collided with a 16-month-old toddler, bruising the child's leg and running over the child's foot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mall-powers-down-security-robots-after-one-bumps-into-toddler-2016-07-13|title=Mall Powers Down Security Robots After One Bumps into Toddler|last1=Wells|first1=Georgia|website=MarketWatch|accessdate=July 14, 2016|archive-date=2016-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714000116/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mall-powers-down-security-robots-after-one-bumps-into-toddler-2016-07-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The Stanford Shopping center responded by docking all of its K5 units, suspending any further activity by the robots until the incident could be investigated. Knightscope responded, calling the incident an "accident", and issued a formal apology to the family of the child.

In April 2017, a 41-year-old [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] man was arrested in connection with an alleged parking-lot altercation with a K5, also at the Stanford Shopping Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/silicon-valley-security-robot-beat-up-in-parking-lot-police-say/|title=Silicon Valley security robot beat up in parking lot, police say|last1=Kravetz|first1=David|website=Ars Technica|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-date=26 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001647/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/silicon-valley-security-robot-beat-up-in-parking-lot-police-say/|url-status=live}}</ref> The man was allegedly drunk and attacked the robot, he was then arrested by police with footage from the security robot showing the chain of events.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Favro|first1=Marianne|last2=Ellison • •|first2=Stephen|title=Man Knocks Over Security Robot, Ends Up in Jail in Mountain View|url=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/man-knocks-over-security-robot-ends-up-in-jail-in-mountain-view/17009/|access-date=2022-01-01|website=NBC Bay Area|language=en-US|archive-date=2022-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220101002229/https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/man-knocks-over-security-robot-ends-up-in-jail-in-mountain-view/17009/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2017, a Knightscope K5 ADM at the [[Washington Harbour]] development in Washington D.C. slipped on a loose brick surface and fell into a water fountain. Knightscope officials stated this was due to an error in the self-driving algorithm which they planned to fix.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Frankel|first1=Todd C|title=A security robot fell into a water fountain at a D.C. office building.

In December 2017, the San Francisco [[SPCA]] rented a Knightscope K5 robot to patrol the area next to their animal shelter, including the public sidewalk where homeless people were encamped. A spokesperson of SPCA stated that the robot was effective at significantly reducing vandalism and petty crime in the area; however, amid accusations that SPCA was using the robot to deter nearby homeless encampments, the SPCA discontinued the contract.<ref name="SPCA" /><ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/after-outcry-non-profit-stops-use-of-security-robot-to-oust-homeless/|title=After backlash, animal shelter fires security robot, 'effective immediately'|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|website=Ars Technica|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=December 18, 2017|archive-date=17 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217184458/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/after-outcry-non-profit-stops-use-of-security-robot-to-oust-homeless/|url-status=live}}</ref> An SPCA spokesperson denied that the purpose of the robot was to deter homeless encampments, but stated that the robot's presence did, however, reduce the presence of homeless encampments in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Robinson|first=Melia|title=Robots are being used to deter homeless people from setting up camp in San Francisco|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/security-robots-are-monitoring-the-homeless-in-san-francisco-2017-12|access-date=2022-01-03|website=Business Insider|language=en-US|archive-date=2022-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103063755/https://www.businessinsider.com/security-robots-are-monitoring-the-homeless-in-san-francisco-2017-12|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="SPCA" />

In October 2019 a woman attempted to report a fight in a Huntington Park, California park using the K5's emergency alert button, only for it to reportedly tell the woman to "step out of the way." The Huntington Park Chief of Police stated that alert features were not yet hooked up to the police department at the time, as the feature was still under development.<ref name=":1" />
