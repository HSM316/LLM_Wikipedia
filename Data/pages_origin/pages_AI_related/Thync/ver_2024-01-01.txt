'''Thync''' is a venture-backed startup that developed a non-invasive, neurostimulation technology that targets the autonomic nervous system.   The company launched the first electronic [[Wearable_technology | wearable device]] to increase energy and lower stress in 2015.  Its makers claim the device works by [[neurostimulation]] techniques such as [[Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation | TENS]].   In 2017, Thync exited the consumer health market and focused all efforts on the development of a bioelectronic therapy to treat moderate psoriasis.
