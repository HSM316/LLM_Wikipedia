'''Behavior informatics''' ('''BI''') is the [[informatics]] of [[behavior]]s so as to obtain behavior intelligence and behavior insights.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.03.025|arxiv=2007.15516|s2cid=7400761}}</ref> BI is a research method combining science and technology, specifically in the area of engineering. The purpose of BI includes analysis of current behaviors as well as the [[inference]] of future possible behaviors. This occurs through [[pattern recognition]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last=Pavel |first=Misha |date=2015 |title=Behavioral Informatics and Computational Modeling in Support of Proactive Health Management and Care |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2763–2775 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2015.2484286 |pmid=26441408 |pmc=4809752 }}</ref>

Different from applied [[behavior analysis]] from the psychological perspective, BI builds computational theories, systems and tools to qualitatively and quantitatively [[computer model|model]], represent, analyze, and manage behaviors of individuals, groups and/or organizations.<ref name=":02" />

BI is built on classic study of [[behavioral science]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences: Applying Statistical Concepts|last1=Hinkle|first1=D.E.|last2=Wiersma|first2=W.|last3=Jurs|first3=S.G.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2002}}</ref> including [[behavior modeling]], [[applied behavior analysis]], [[behavior analysis]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[organizational behavior]].

The Behavior Informatics approach to data utilizes cognitive as well as behavioral data. By combining the data, BI has the potential to effectively illustrate the big picture when it comes to behavioral decisions and patterns. One of the goals of BI is also to be able to study human behavior while eliminating issues like self-report bias. This creates more reliable and valid information for research studies. <ref>{{Cite book |last=Ghosh |first=Isha |url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4614-6439-6 |title=Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine |date=2020 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=978-1-4614-6439-6 |editor-last=Gellman |editor-first=Marc D. |location=New York, NY |language=en |chapter=Behavior Informatics |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6439-6}}</ref>

== Behavior analytics ==
Behavior informatics covers ''behavior analytics'' which focuses on analysis and learning of behavioral data.

== Behavior ==
From an [[Informatics]] perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of three key elements:
#actors (behavioral subjects and objects), 
#operations (actions, activities) and 
#interactions (relationships), and their properties.
A behavior can be represented as a behavior [[Euclidean vector|vector]], all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The following table explains some of the elements of behavior. <ref name=":2" />

Behavior Informatics takes into account behavior when analyzing business patterns and intelligence. The inclusion of behavior in these analyses provides prominent information on social and driving factors of patterns.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cao |first=Longbing |title=2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops |chapter=Behavior Informatics and Analytics: Let Behavior Talk |date=2008 |chapter-url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4733926 |pages=87–96 |doi=10.1109/ICDMW.2008.95|hdl=10453/10879 |s2cid=10850849 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

==Applications==

Behavior Informatics is being used in a variety of settings, including but not limited to health care management, [[telecommunications]], [[marketing]], and [[security]].<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":12">{{Cite journal |last=Cao |first=Longbing |date=2010-09-01 |title=In-depth behavior understanding and use: The behavior informatics approach |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510001374 |journal=Information Sciences |series=Including Special Section on Virtual Agent and Organization Modeling: Theory and Applications |language=en |volume=180 |issue=17 |pages=3067–3085 |doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.03.025 |arxiv=2007.15516 |s2cid=7400761 |issn=0020-0255}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference| first1=R.O.|last1=Lane|first2=H.M.|last2=State-Davey|first3=C.J.|last3=Taylor|first4=W.J.|last4=Holmes|first5=R.A.|last5=Boon|first6=M.D.|last6=Round|date=7 September 2023| title=Behavioural Analytics: Mathematics of the Mind| conference=7th IMA Conference on Mathematics in Defence and Security| url=https://cdn.ima.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Lane-FULL-PAPER.pdf| publisher=[[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]]}}</ref> Behavior Informatics is a turning point for the health care system.{{peacock inline|date=February 2023}} Behavior Informatics provides a manner in which to analyze and organize the many aspects that go into a person's health care needs and decisions.<ref name=":02" /> When it comes to business models, behavior informatics may be utilized for a similar role. Organizations implement behavior informatics to enhance business structure and regime where it helps moderate ideal business decisions and situations.<ref name=":12" />
