== Machine learning with quantum computers ==
Quantum-enhanced machine learning refers to [[quantum algorithm]]s that solve tasks in machine learning, thereby improving and often expediting classical machine learning techniques. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical data set into a quantum computer to make it accessible for quantum information processing. Subsequently, quantum information processing routines are applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a qubit reveals the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal [[quantum computer]] to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.

=== Linear algebra simulation with quantum amplitudes ===

A number of quantum algorithms for machine learning are based on the idea of ''amplitude encoding'', that is, to associate the [[Probability amplitude|amplitudes]] of a quantum state with the inputs and outputs of computations.<ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.130503|pmid=25302877|title=Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Data Classification|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=113|issue=13|pages=130503|year=2014|last1=Rebentrost|first1=Patrick|last2=Mohseni|first2=Masoud|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113m0503R|arxiv=1307.0471|hdl=1721.1/90391|s2cid=5503025}}</ref><ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050505|pmid=23006156|title=Quantum Algorithm for Data Fitting|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=109|issue=5|pages=050505|year=2012|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|last2=Braun|first2=Daniel|last3=Lloyd|first3=Seth|bibcode=2012PhRvL.109e0505W|arxiv=1204.5242}}</ref><ref name="Maria Schuld 2016">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.022342|title=Prediction by linear regression on a quantum computer|journal=Physical Review A|volume=94|issue=2|pages=022342|year=2016|last1=Schuld|first1=Maria|last2=Sinayskiy|first2=Ilya|last3=Petruccione|first3=Francesco|bibcode=2016PhRvA..94b2342S|arxiv=1601.07823|s2cid=118459345}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |arxiv=1512.03929 |last1=Zhao |first1=Zhikuan |title=Quantum assisted Gaussian process regression |journal=Physical Review A |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=052331 |last2=Fitzsimons |first2=Jack K. |last3=Fitzsimons |first3=Joseph F. |year=2019|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.99.052331 |bibcode=2019PhRvA..99e2331Z |s2cid=18303333 }}</ref> Since a state of <math>n</math> qubits is described by <math>2^n</math> complex amplitudes, this information encoding can allow for an exponentially compact representation.

The goal of algorithms based on amplitude encoding is to formulate quantum algorithms whose resources grow polynomially in the number of qubits <math>n</math>, which amounts to a logarithmic growth in the number of amplitudes and thereby the dimension of the input.

Many quantum machine learning algorithms in this category are based on variations of the [[quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]]<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv=0811.3171 |last1=Harrow |first1=Aram W. |title=Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=103 |issue=15 |pages=150502 |last2=Hassidim |first2=Avinatan |last3=Lloyd |first3=Seth |year=2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid=19905613 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103o0502H |s2cid=5187993 }}</ref> (colloquially called HHL, after the paper's authors) which, under specific conditions, performs a matrix inversion using an amount of physical resources growing only logarithmically in the dimensions of the matrix.

Quantum matrix inversion can be applied to machine learning methods in which the training reduces to solving a [[System of linear equations|linear system of equations]], for example in least-squares linear regression,<ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2012" /><ref name="Maria Schuld 2016" /> the least-squares version of [[support vector machine]]s,<ref name="Patrick Rebentrost 2014" /> and Gaussian processes.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

A crucial bottleneck of methods that simulate linear algebra computations with the amplitudes of quantum states is state preparation, which often requires one to initialise a quantum system in a state whose amplitudes reflect the features of the entire dataset.

=== Quantum machine learning algorithms based on Grover search ===
Another approach to improving classical machine learning with quantum information processing uses [[amplitude amplification]] methods based on [[Grover's algorithm|Grover's search]] algorithm, which has been shown to solve unstructured search problems with a quadratic speedup compared to classical algorithms. These quantum routines can be employed for learning algorithms that translate into an unstructured search task, as can be done, for instance, in the case of the [[K-medians clustering|k-medians]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Aïmeur|first1=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=2013-02-01|title=Quantum speed-up for unsupervised learning|journal=Machine Learning|language=en|volume=90|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1007/s10994-012-5316-5|issn=0885-6125|doi-access=free}}</ref> and the [[k-nearest neighbour|k-nearest neighbors algorithms]].<ref name="Nathan Wiebe 2014" /> Another application is a quadratic speedup in the training of [[perceptrons|perceptron]].<ref name=wiebe2016nips>{{cite conference |arxiv=1602.04799|last1=Wiebe|first1=Nathan|title=Quantum Perceptron Models|last2=Kapoor|first2=Ashish|last3=Svore|first3=Krysta M.|conference=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|volume=29|pages=3999–4007|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6401-quantum-perceptron-models|bibcode=2016arXiv160204799W|year=2016}}</ref> 

An example of amplitude amplification being used in a machine learning algorithm is Grover's search algorithm minimization. In which a subroutine uses Grover's search algorithm to find an element less than some less than some previously defined element. This can be done with an oracle that determines whether or not a state with a correponding element is less than the predefined one. Grover's algorithm can then find an element such that our condition is met. The minimization is initialized by some random element in our data set, and iteratively does this subroutine to find the minimum element in the data set. This minimization is notably used in quantum k-medians, and it has a speed up of at least <math>O(\sqrt{n/k})</math> compared to classical versions of k-medians, where <math>n</math> is the number of data points and <math>k</math> is the number of clusters.<ref name=":0" />   

Amplitude amplification is often combined with [[quantum walk]]s to achieve the same quadratic speedup.

=== Quantum annealing ===
{{Main|Quantum annealing}}
[[Quantum annealing]] is an optimization technique used to determine the local minima and maxima of a function over a given set of candidate functions. This is a method of discretizing a function with many local minima or maxima in order to determine the observables of the function. The process can be distinguished from [[Simulated annealing]] by the [[Quantum tunnelling|Quantum tunneling]] process, by which particles tunnel through kinetic or potential barriers from a high state to a low state. Quantum annealing starts from a superposition of all possible states of a system, weighted equally. Then the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] guides the time evolution of the system, serving to affect the amplitude of each state as time increases. Eventually, the ground state can be reached to yield the instantaneous Hamiltonian of the system.

=== Quantum sampling techniques ===
Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is at the core of a wide spectrum of computational techniques with important applications across science, engineering, and society. Examples include [[deep learning]], [[probabilistic programming]], and other machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

A computationally hard problem, which is key for some relevant machine learning tasks, is the estimation of averages over probabilistic models defined in terms of a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Sampling from generic probabilistic models is hard: algorithms relying heavily on sampling are expected to remain intractable no matter how large and powerful classical computing resources become. Even though [[quantum annealing|quantum annealers]], like those produced by D-Wave Systems, were designed for challenging combinatorial optimization problems, it has been recently recognized as a potential candidate to speed up computations that rely on sampling by exploiting quantum effects.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Biswas |first1=Rupak |last2=Jiang |first2=Zhang |last3=Kechezi |first3=Kostya |last4=Knysh |first4=Sergey |last5=Mandrà |first5=Salvatore |last6=O’Gorman |first6=Bryan |last7=Perdomo-Ortiz |first7=Alejando |last8=Pethukov |first8=Andre |last9=Realpe-Gómez |first9=John |last10=Rieffel |first10=Eleanor|author1-link= Eleanor Rieffel |last11=Venturelli|first11=Davide|last12=Vasko|first12=Fedir|last13=Wang|first13=Zhihui |title=A NASA perspective on quantum computing: Opportunities and challenges |year=2016|doi=10.1016/j.parco.2016.11.002|journal=Parallel Computing|volume=64 |pages=81–98 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259293 |arxiv=1704.04836 |s2cid=27547901 }}</ref>

Another possibility is to rely on a physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.

The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center has been recently used for the learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that can serve as a building block for deep learning architectures.<ref name=Benedetti2016b /> Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks.<ref name=Adachi2015 /> The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets.<ref name=Benedetti2016a /> In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.

Inspired by the success of Boltzmann machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian was recently proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Amin |first1=Mohammad H. |last2=Andriyash |first2=Evgeny |last3=Rolfe |first3=Jason |last4=Kulchytskyy |first4=Bohdan |last5=Melko |first5=Roger |year=2018 |title=Quantum Boltzmann machines |journal=Phys.

[[Quantum annealing]] is not the only technology for sampling. In a prepare-and-measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Wiebe |first1=Nathan |last2=Kapoor |first2=Ashish |last3=Svore |first3=Krysta M. |date=2014 |title=Quantum deep learning |eprint=1412.3489 |class=quant-ph}}</ref> The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well-known classical counterparts.

=== Fully quantum machine learning ===
In the most general case of quantum machine learning, both the learning device and the system under study, as well as their interaction, are fully quantum. This section gives a few examples of results on this topic.

One class of problem that can benefit from the fully quantum approach is that of 'learning' unknown quantum states, processes or measurements, in the sense that one can subsequently reproduce them on another quantum system. For example, one may wish to learn a measurement that discriminates between two coherent states, given not a classical description of the states to be discriminated, but instead a set of example quantum systems prepared in these states. The naive approach would be to first extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sentís|first1=Gael|last2=Guţă|first2=Mădălin|last3=Adesso|first3=Gerardo|date=9 July 2015|title=Quantum learning of coherent states|journal=EPJ Quantum Technology|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjqt/s40507-015-0030-4|doi-access=free}}</ref> (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sasaki|first1=Masahide|last2=Carlini|first2=Alberto|date=6 August 2002|title=Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine|journal=Physical Review A|volume=66|issue=2|pages=022303|arxiv=quant-ph/0202173|bibcode=2002PhRvA..66b2303S|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.66.022303|s2cid=119383508}}</ref>) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bisio|first1=Alessandro|last2=Chiribella|first2=Giulio|last3=D’Ariano|first3=Giacomo Mauro|last4=Facchini|first4=Stefano|last5=Perinotti|first5=Paolo|date=25 March 2010|title=Optimal quantum learning of a unitary transformation|journal=Physical Review A|volume=81|issue=3|pages=032324|arxiv=0903.0543|bibcode=2010PhRvA..81c2324B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.81.032324|s2cid=119289138}}</ref>

Going beyond the specific problem of learning states and transformations, the task of [[quantum clustering|clustering]] also admits a fully quantum version, wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between data-points and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Quantum Clustering Algorithms|last1=Aïmeur|first1=Esma|last2=Brassard|first2=Gilles|last3=Gambs|first3=Sébastien|date=1 January 2007|journal=Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Machine Learning|isbn=978-1-59593-793-3|pages=1–8|citeseerx=10.1.1.80.9513|doi=10.1145/1273496.1273497|s2cid=4357684}}</ref> Finally, a general framework spanning supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in,<ref name="DunjkoTaylorBriegel" /> where it was also shown that the possibility of probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in reinforcement learning.

== Classical learning applied to quantum problems ==
{{Further|Machine learning in physics}}

The term "quantum machine learning" sometimes refers to ''classical'' machine learning performed on data from quantum systems. A basic example of this is [[quantum tomography|quantum state tomography]], where a quantum state is learned from measurement. Other applications include learning Hamiltonians<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cory|first1=D. G.|last2=Wiebe|first2=Nathan|last3=Ferrie|first3=Christopher|last4=Granade|first4=Christopher E.|date=2012-07-06|title=Robust Online Hamiltonian Learning|journal=New Journal of Physics|volume=14|issue=10|pages=103013|language=en|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/10/103013|arxiv=1207.1655|bibcode=2012NJPh...14j3013G|s2cid=9928389}}</ref> and automatically generating quantum experiments.<ref name="Krenn 090405" />

== Quantum learning theory ==
Quantum learning theory pursues a mathematical analysis of the quantum generalizations of classical learning models and of the possible speed-ups or other improvements that they may provide. The framework is very similar to that of classical [[computational learning theory]], but the learner in this case is a quantum information processing device, while the data may be either classical or quantum. Quantum learning theory should be contrasted with the quantum-enhanced machine learning discussed above, where the goal was to consider ''specific problems'' and to use quantum protocols to improve the time complexity of classical algorithms for these problems. Although quantum learning theory is still under development, partial results in this direction have been obtained.<ref>{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=A Survey of Quantum Learning Theory|date=2017|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1701.06806}}</ref>

The starting point in learning theory is typically a ''concept class'', a set of possible concepts. Usually a concept is a function on some domain, such as <math>\{0,1\}^n</math>. For example, the concept class could be the set of [[disjunctive normal form]] (DNF) formulas on ''n'' bits or the set of Boolean circuits of some constant depth. The goal for the learner is to learn (exactly or approximately) an unknown ''target concept'' from this concept class. The learner may be actively interacting with the target concept, or passively receiving samples from it.

In active learning, a learner can make ''membership queries'' to the target concept ''c'', asking for its value ''c(x)'' on inputs ''x'' chosen by the learner. The learner then has to reconstruct the exact target concept, with high probability. In the model of ''quantum exact learning'', the learner can make membership queries in quantum superposition. If the complexity of the learner is measured by the number of membership queries it makes, then quantum exact learners can be polynomially more efficient than classical learners for some concept classes, but not more.<ref name="gortlerservedioquantum">{{cite journal|last2=Gortler|first2=Steven J.|year=2004|title=Equivalences and Separations Between Quantum and Classical Learnability|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=33|issue=5|pages=1067–1092|doi=10.1137/S0097539704412910|last1=Servedio|first1=Rocco A.|citeseerx=10.1.1.69.6555}}</ref> If complexity is measured by the amount of ''time'' the learner uses, then there are concept classes that can be learned efficiently by quantum learners but not by classical learners (under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).<ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" />

A natural model of passive learning is Valiant's [[probably approximately correct learning|probably approximately correct (PAC) learning]]. Here the learner receives random examples ''(x,c(x))'', where ''x'' is distributed according to some unknown distribution ''D''. The learner's goal is to output a hypothesis function ''h'' such that ''h(x)=c(x)'' with high probability when ''x'' is drawn according to ''D''. The learner has to be able to produce such an 'approximately correct' ''h'' for every ''D'' and every target concept ''c'' in its concept class. We can consider replacing the random examples by potentially more powerful quantum examples <math>\sum_x \sqrt{D(x)}|x,c(x)\rangle</math>. In the PAC model (and the related agnostic model), this doesn't significantly reduce the number of examples needed: for every concept class, classical and quantum sample complexity are the same up to constant factors.<ref>{{cite arXiv|class=quant-ph|first2=Ronald|last2=de Wolf|title=Optimal Quantum Sample Complexity of Learning Algorithms|date=2016|last1=Arunachalam|first1=Srinivasan|eprint=1607.00932}}</ref> However, for learning under some fixed distribution ''D'', quantum examples can be very helpful, for example for learning DNF under the uniform distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Jackson C.|year=1999|title=Learning DNF over the Uniform Distribution Using a Quantum Example Oracle|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=28|issue=3|pages=1136–1153|doi=10.1137/S0097539795293123|last1=Nader|first1=Bshouty H.|citeseerx=10.1.1.23.5709}}</ref> When considering ''time'' complexity, there exist concept classes that can be PAC-learned efficiently by quantum learners, even from classical examples, but not by classical learners (again, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions).<ref name="gortlerservedioquantum" />

This passive learning type is also the most common scheme in supervised learning: a learning algorithm typically takes the training examples fixed, without the ability to query the label of unlabelled examples. Outputting a hypothesis ''h'' is a step of induction. Classically, an inductive model splits into a training and an application phase: the model parameters are estimated in the training phase, and the learned model is applied an arbitrary many times in the application phase. In the asymptotic limit of the number of applications, this splitting of phases is also present with quantum resources.<ref>{{cite journal|first2=Gael|last2=Sentís|title=Inductive supervised quantum learning|year=2017|last1=Monràs|first1=Alex|last3=Wittek|first3=Peter|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=118|issue=19|pages=190503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.190503 |pmid=28548536|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118s0503M|arxiv=1605.07541}}</ref>

== Implementations and experiments ==

The earliest experiments were conducted using the adiabatic [[D-Wave Systems|D-Wave]] quantum computer, for instance, to detect cars in digital images using regularized boosting with a nonconvex objective function in a demonstration in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/de//googleblogs/pdfs/nips_demoreport_120709_research.pdf|title=NIPS 2009 Demonstration: Binary Classification using Hardware Implementation of Quantum Annealing|publisher=Static.googleusercontent.com|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> Many experiments followed on the same architecture, and leading tech companies have shown interest in the potential of quantum machine learning for future technological implementations.

Using a different annealing technology based on [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), a quantum [[Hopfield network]] was implemented in 2009 that mapped the input data and memorized data to Hamiltonians, allowing the use of adiabatic quantum computation.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Neves|first2=Jorge L.|last3=Sollacher|first3=Rudolf|last4=Glaser|first4=Steffen J.|year=2009|title=Quantum pattern recognition with liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance|journal=Physical Review A|volume=79|issue=4|pages=042321|arxiv=0802.1592|bibcode=2009PhRvA..79d2321N|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.79.042321|last1=Neigovzen|first1=Rodion|s2cid=119115625}}</ref> NMR technology also enables universal quantum computing,{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and it was used for the first experimental implementation of a quantum support vector machine to distinguish hand written number ‘6’ and ‘9’ on a liquid-state  quantum computer in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaomei|last3=Xu|first3=Nanyang|last4=Du|first4=Jiangfeng|year=2015|title=Experimental Realization of a Quantum Support Vector Machine|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=14|pages=140504|arxiv=1410.1054|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114n0504L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.140504|pmid=25910101|last1=Li|first1=Zhaokai}}</ref> The training data involved the pre-processing of the image which maps them to normalized 2-dimensional vectors to represent the images as the states of a qubit. The two entries of the vector are the vertical and horizontal ratio of the pixel intensity of the image.

The readout avoids costly [[quantum tomography]] by reading out the final state in terms of direction (up/down) of the NMR signal.

Recently, based on a neuromimetic approach, a novel ingredient has been added to the field of quantum machine learning, in the form of a so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical [[memristor]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep29507 |pmid=27381511 |pmc=4933948 |title=Quantum memristors |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |issue=2016 |pages=29507 |year=2016|last1=Pfeiffer |first1=P. |last2=Egusquiza |first2=I.

Since 2016, IBM has launched an online cloud-based platform for quantum software developers, called the [[IBM Q Experience]]. This platform consists of several fully operational quantum processors accessible via the IBM Web API. In doing so, the company is encouraging software developers to pursue new algorithms through a development environment with quantum capabilities. New architectures are being explored on an experimental basis, up to 32 qbits, utilizing both trapped-ion and superconductive quantum computing methods.

In October 2019, it was noted that the introduction of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) to machine learning models including Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for random initial weight distribution and Random Forests for splitting processes had a profound effect on their ability when compared to the classical method of Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bird | first1=Jordan J. | last2=Ekárt | first2=Anikó | last3=Faria | first3=Diego R. | title=On the effects of pseudorandom and quantum-random number generators in soft computing | journal=Soft Computing | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | date=2019-10-28 | issn=1432-7643 | doi=10.1007/s00500-019-04450-0 | volume=24 | issue=12 | pages=9243–9256 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Skepticism==

While [[machine learning]] itself is now not only a research field but an economically significant and fast growing industry and [[quantum computing]] is a well established field of both theoretical and experimental research, quantum machine learning remains a purely theoretical field of studies. Attempts to experimentally demonstrate concepts of quantum machine learning remain insufficient.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

Many of the leading scientists that extensively publish in the field of quantum machine learning warn about the extensive hype around the topic and are very restrained if asked about its practical uses in the foreseeable future. Sophia Chen<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-04|title=Can quantum machine learning move beyond its own hype?|url=https://www.protocol.com/manuals/quantum-computing/machine-learning-ai-quantum-computing-move-beyond-hype|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Protocol|language=en}}</ref> collected some of the statements made by well known scientists in the field:

* "I think we haven't done our homework yet. This is an extremely new scientific field," - physicist Maria Schuld of Canada-based quantum computing startup Xanadu.
* "There is a lot more work that needs to be done before claiming quantum machine learning will actually work," - computer scientist Iordanis Kerenidis, the head of quantum algorithms at the Silicon Valley-based quantum computing startup QC Ware.

* "I have not seen a single piece of evidence that there exists a meaningful [machine learning] task for which it would make sense to use a quantum computer and not a classical computer," - physicist Ryan Sweke of the Free University of Berlin in Germany.

“Don’t fall for the hype!” -  Frank Zickert<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zickert|first=Frank|date=2020-09-23|title=Quantum Machine Learning|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/quantum-machine-learning-e1955476a6ad|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref>, who is the author of probably the most practical book related to the subject beware that ”quantum computers are far away from advancing machine learning for their representation ability”, and even speaking about evaluation and optimization for any kind of useful task quantum supremacy is not yet achieved. Furthermore, nobody among the active researchers in the field make any forecasts about when it could possibly become practical.{{cn|date=December 2020}}
