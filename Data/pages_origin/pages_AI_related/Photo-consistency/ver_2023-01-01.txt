In [[computer vision]] '''Photo-consistency''' determines whether a given [[voxel]] is occupied. A voxel is considered to be photo consistent when its color appears to be similar to all the cameras that can see it.<ref>Jianfeng Yin and Jeremy R. Cooperstock, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1443180/ A New Photo Consistency Test for Voxel Coloring], Proceedings of the Second Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRVâ€™05), IEEE</ref> Most voxel coloring or space carving techniques require using photo consistency as a check condition in [[Image-based modeling and rendering]] applications.
