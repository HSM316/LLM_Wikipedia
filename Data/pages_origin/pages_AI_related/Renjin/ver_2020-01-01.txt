'''Renjin''' is an implementation of the [[R (programming language)|R programming language]] atop the [[Java Virtual Machine]]. It is [[free software]] released under  the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. Renjin is tightly integrated with [[Java (programming language)|Java]] to allow the embedding of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way access between the Java and R code.

Renjin's development is primarily supported by [[BeDataDriven]], but ultimately made possible by several current and past contributors including Mehmet Hakan Satman,
Hannes MÃ¼hleisen, and Ruslan Shevchenko.

==History==
Renjin's roots lie in an abortive 2010 attempt to compile the GNU R interpreter for the JVM via nestedvm,<ref>{{cite web

| title=R4JVM

can then translate to JVM bytecode. This proved challenging as GNU R had grown to rely heavily on dynamic linking and the best C standard library
implementation available at the time for the MIPS architecture, [[Newlib]], was not fully compatible with the [[GNU C Library]], against which
GNU R had been developed.

The experience with the R4JVM project provided the BeDataDriven team with in depth look at the GNU R codebase, and convinced them
that a new implementation, written in Java, was a feasible undertaking. Development on Renjin began in October 2010, and rapidly resulted in 
a functional, if minimal, interpreter for the R language.
