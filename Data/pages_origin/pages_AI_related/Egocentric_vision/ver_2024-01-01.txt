{{short description|Type of computer vision for wearable cameras}}
'''Egocentric vision''' or '''first-person vision''' is a sub-field of [[computer vision]] that entails analyzing images and videos captured by a [[wearable camera]], which is typically worn on the head or on the chest and naturally approximates the visual field of the camera wearer. Consequently, visual data capture the part of the scene on which the user focuses to carry out the task at hand and offer a valuable perspective to understand the user's activities and their context in a naturalistic setting.<ref>An Introduction to the 3rd Workshop on Egocentric (First-person) Vision, Steve Mann, Kris M. Kitani, Yong Jae Lee, M. S. Ryoo, and Alireza Fathi, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops 2160-7508/14, 2014, IEEE {{doi|10.1109/CVPRW.2014.1338272014}}</ref>

The wearable camera looking forwards is often supplemented with a camera looking inward at the user's eye and able to measure a user's eye gaze, which is useful to reveal attention and to better understand the
user's activity and intentions.

== History ==

The idea of using a wearable camera to gather visual data from a first-person perspective dates back to the 70s, when [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] invented "Digital Eye Glass", a device that, when worn, causes the human eye itself to effectively become both an electronic camera and a television display.<ref>Mann, S.

Subsequently, wearable cameras were used for health-related applications in the context of Humanistic Intelligence<ref>Haykin, Simon S., and Bart Kosko. Intelligent signal processing.

[[File:Egomotion-odometry.gif|thumb|[[Egomotion]] estimation]]
Today's wearable cameras are small and lightweight digital recording devices that can acquire images and videos automatically, without the user intervention, with different resolutions and frame rates, and from a first-person point of view. Therefore, wearable cameras are naturally primed to gather visual information from our everyday interactions since they offer an intimate perspective of the visual field of the camera wearer.

Depending on the frame rate, it is common to distinguish between photo-cameras (also called lifelogging cameras) and video-cameras. 
* The former (e.g., [[Narrative Clip]] and [[Microsoft SenseCam]]), are commonly worn on the chest, and are characterized by a very low frame rate (up to 2fpm) that allows to capture images over a long period of time without the need of recharging the battery. Consequently, they offer considerable potential for inferring knowledge about e.g. behaviour patterns, habits or lifestyle of the user. However, due to the low frame-rate and the free motion of the camera, temporally adjacent images typically present abrupt appearance changes so that motion features cannot be reliably estimated.
* The latter (e.g., [[Google Glass]], [[GoPro]]), are commonly mounted on the head, and capture conventional video (around 35fps) that allows to capture fine temporal details of interactions. Consequently, they  offer potential for in-depth analysis of daily or special activities. However, since the camera is moving with the wearer head, it becomes more difficult to estimate the global motion of the wearer and in the case of abrupt movements, the images can result blurred.

In both cases, since the camera is worn in a naturalistic setting, visual data present a huge variability in terms of illumination conditions and object appearance.
Moreover, the camera wearer is not visible in the image and what he/she is doing has to be inferred from the information in the visual field of the camera, implying that important information about the wearer,  such for instance as [[pose (computer vision)|pose]] or  facial expression estimation, is not available.

== Applications ==

A collection of studies published in a special theme issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine<ref name="auto1"/> has demonstrated the potential of lifelogs captured through wearable cameras from a number of viewpoints. In particular, it has been shown that used as a tool for understanding and tracking lifestyle behaviour, lifelogs would enable the prevention of noncommunicable diseases associated to unhealthy trends and risky profiles (such as obesity, depression, etc.). In addition, used as a tool of re-memory cognitive training, lifelogs would enable the prevention of cognitive and functional decline in elderly people.

More recently, egocentric cameras have been used to study human and animal cognition, human-human social interaction, human-robot interaction, human expertise in complex tasks.
