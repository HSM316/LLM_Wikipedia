The '''Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference''' (GECCO) is the premier conference in the area of [[Evolutionary computation|genetic and evolutionary computation]]. GECCO has been held every year since 1999, when it was first established as a recombination of the International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (ICGA) and the Annual Genetic Programming Conference (GP).

GECCO presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics of interest include: [[genetic algorithms]], [[genetic programming]], [[evolution strategies]], [[evolutionary programming]], [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]s, [[memetic algorithms]], [[hyper-heuristics]], [[evolutionary robotics]], [[evolvable hardware]], [[artificial life]], [[ant colony optimization algorithms]], [[swarm intelligence]], [[artificial immune system]]s, digital [[Entertainment technology|entertainment technologies]],  [[evolutionary art]], evolutionary [[combinatorial optimization]], [[metaheuristic]]s, evolutionary [[multi-objective optimization]], evolutionary [[machine learning]], [[search-based software engineering]], theory, real-world applications, and more.

Other important conferences in the field are [[IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation]] (CEC), [[Parallel Problem Solving from Nature]] (PPSN) and [[EvoStar]] (a group name for four co-located conferences, EuroGP, EvoCOP, EvoMUSART, and EvoApplications).

GECCO is the main annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (SIGEVO), which is a [[Association for Computing Machinery#Special Interest Groups|Special Interest Group]] (SIG) of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM).
