A '''smartwatch''' is a portable [[wearable computer]] that resembles a [[wristwatch]]. Most modern smartwatches are operated via a [[touchscreen]], and rely on [[mobile apps]] that run on a connected device (such as a [[smartphone]]) in order to provide core functions.

Early smartwatches were capable of performing basic functions like [[calculator watch|calculating]], displaying digital time, translating text, and playing games. More recent models often offer features comparable to [[smartphone]]s, including apps, a [[mobile operating system]], [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity, and the ability to function as [[portable media player]]s or [[FM broadcasting|FM radios]]. Some high-end models have cellular capabilities, allowing users to make and receive phone calls.<ref>{{cite web |last=Molen |first=Brad |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |title=i phone Gear 2 smartwatches coming in April with Tizen OS |publisher=Engadget.com |date=14 January 2012 |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723100948/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |archive-date=23 July 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Trew |first=James |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |title=Sony SmartWatch 2 review |date=26 October 2013 |publisher=Engadget.com |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701212716/http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |archive-date=1 July 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |title=Garmin's new app turns Sony's Smartwatch 2 into a tiny sat-nav |publisher=Engadget.com |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915134810/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |archive-date=15 September 2016  }}</ref>

They may also incorporate [[GPS navigation device|GPS receivers]], [[digital camera]]s, and [[Secure Digital|microSD card]] readers, as well as various internal and environmental sensors such as [[thermometer]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, and [[ambient light sensor]]s. Some smartwatches also function as [[Activity tracker|activity trackers]] and include body sensors such as [[pedometer]]s, [[heart rate monitor]]s, [[galvanic skin response]] sensors, and [[ECG]] sensors. Software may include [[Web mapping|maps]], health and exercise-related apps, [[Calendaring software|calendars]], and various [[Clock face|watch faces]].

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The first [[digital watch]] was the [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]], introduced by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] in 1972. The "Pulsar" became a brand name, and would later be acquired by [[Seiko]] in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, likely making it the first watch with user-programmable memory, or the first "[[Memory bank|memorybank]]" watch.<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Doensen|first=Pieter |title=Q.5 Watches with Memory and Database|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~doensen/q5.html|work=WATCH.

With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, [[Seiko]] began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch, named for its ability to store 2000 characters, came with an external keyboard for data entry. Data was synchronised from the keyboard to the watch via electromagnetic coupling (wireless docking).<ref name="seiko">{{cite web|title=Seiko Computer Watch Fun|date=15 July 2005|url=http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|access-date=17 September 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024235156/http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|archive-date=24 October 2012}}</ref> Its memory was small, at only 112 digits.<ref name="history"/> It was released in 1984, in gold, silver, and black.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEIKO D-409|url=http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|publisher=Digital Watch Library|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013182237/http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|archive-date=13 October 2010}}</ref> 

These models were followed by many others from Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series". The RC-1000 Wrist Terminal from [[Seiko Epson]] was released in 1984; it was the first Seiko model to interface with a computer<ref name="seiko" /> and was priced at around £100.<ref name="pcw198510_seiko">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerWorld1985-10/page/122/mode/1up | title=The greatest breakthrough in wrist technology since Seiko introduced quartz. | magazine=Personal Computer World | date=October 1985 | access-date=12 March 2022 | pages=122 }}</ref> It featured 2 KB of storage, a two-line, 12-character display, and data transfer with a computer via an [[RS232C]] interface.<ref name="pcw198409_seiko_rc1000">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/PersonalComputerWorld1984-09/page/107/mode/1up | title=Small is beautiful | magazine=Personal Computer World | date=September 1984 | access-date=12 March 2022 | last1=Kakizawa | first1=Shinichiro | pages=107 }}</ref> It was powered by a [[computer on a chip]], and was compatible with most of the popular PCs of that time, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] II, II+ and IIe, [[BBC Micro]],<ref name="acornuser198604_seiko">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/AcornUser045-Apr86/page/n180/mode/1up | title=Armed With Information | magazine=Acorn User | last1=Vine | first1=Jeremy | date=April 1986 | access-date=12 March 2022 | pages=179 }}</ref> [[Commodore 64|Commodore]] 64,<ref name="homecomputingweekly19850416_seiko">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/home-computing-weekly-108/page/n20/mode/1up | title=Hardware Review | magazine=Home Computing Weekly | date=April 1985 | access-date=12 March 2022 | last1=Doyle | first1=Eric | pages=21 }}</ref> [[IBM]] PC, [[NEC]] 8201, [[Tandy Computers|Tandy]] Color Computer, Model 1000, 1200, 2000 and TRS-80 Model I, III, 4 and 4p.

During the 1980s, [[Casio]] began to market a successful line of "computer watches" in addition to its [[calculator watch]]es, most notably the [[Casio data bank]] series. Casio and other companies also produced novelty "game watches", such as the [[Nelsonic game watch]]es.<ref name="watchclockreview198109_nelsonic">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/sim_watch-jewelry-review_1981-09_48_9/page/24/mode/1up | title=Game Watches | magazine=Watch & Clock Review | date=September 1981 | access-date=13 March 2022 | pages=24 }}</ref>

Although pager watches were predicted in the early 1980s,<ref name="watchclockreview198109_pager">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/sim_watch-jewelry-review_1981-09_48_9/page/26/mode/1up | title=The Watch-Pager Next Advance? | magazine=Watch & Clock Review | date=September 1981 | access-date=13 March 2022 | pages=26 }}</ref> it took until the end of the decade for them to become more common. Two models were particularly notable: [[Motorola]] and [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] produced the Wrist Watch Pager, while [[AT&T Corporation]] and Seiko produced the MessageWatch.<ref name="modernelectronics199009_pager">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/details/modern-electronics-september-1990/page/n7/mode/2up | title=Wrist-Watch Pagers | magazine=Modern Electronics | date=September 1990 | access-date=13 March 2022 | pages=8–9 }}</ref>

=== 1990's ===
The [[Timex Datalink]], introduced in 1994, was the first watch capable of transferring data wirelessly from a computer. Appointments and contacts created with [[Microsoft Schedule Plus|Microsoft Schedule+]] (the predecessor to MS Outlook) could be downloaded to the watch via [[Optical wireless communications|patterns of visible light]], which were displayed by a computer monitor and then detected by the watch's optical sensor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In 1998, [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] designed and built the world's first [[Linux]] wristwatch.<ref name ="Patent 2275784"/> He presented it at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[International Solid-State Circuits Conference|ISSCC]] on 7 February 2000, where he was dubbed "the father of wearable computing".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The watch later appeared on the cover of [[Linux Journal]] in July 2000, in which it was the topic of a featured article.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |title=WristWatchComputer |work=[[Linux Journal]] |issue=75 |date=1 July 2000 |pages=86–91 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712183307/http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |archive-date=12 July 2014  }} + Cover</ref>

Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in 1998 in Japan, a wristwatch computer with a 3.6 MHz processor. The Ruputer failed to achieve wide success due to its small, hard-to-read screen, cumbersome joystick method of navigation and text input, and poor battery life.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-10 |title=The world's first smartwatch had the same issues we have today |url=https://www.engadget.com/seiko-ruputer-first-smartwatch-133015434.html |access-date=2024-08-07 |website=Engadget |language=en-US}}</ref> Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite low demand, it was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are fully compatible with each other. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch, as it was the first to display graphics (albeit in monochrome), and third-party applications (mostly homebrew).{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10. It had a protruding antenna, monochrome LCD screen, and 90-minute talk time with an integrated speaker and microphone.<ref name="samsungwatch">{{cite web|title=The War For Your Wrist|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|work=happleinsider.com|access-date=12 October 2014|first=Neil|last=Hughes|date=21 March 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018042152/http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|archive-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, startup Omate announced its [[Omate TrueSmart|TrueSmart]] watch via a Kickstarter campaign, claiming it was the first smartwatch to capture the full capabilities of a smartphone. The campaign raised over $1 million, making it the 5th most successful Kickstarter at that time. The device made its public debut in early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|title=Top 5 Smartwatches Debuted At CES 2014|first=Ariel|last=Adams|website=[[Forbes]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019222704/https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|archive-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Consumer device analyst Avi Greengart, from research firm Current Analysis, suggested that 2013 may be the "year of the smartwatch", as "the components have gotten small enough and cheap enough" and many consumers own smartphones that are compatible with a wearable device. [[Wearable technology]], such as [[Google Glass]], was speculated to evolve into a business worth US$6 billion annually, and a July 2013 media report revealed that the majority of major consumer electronics manufacturers were undertaking work on a smartwatch device at the time of publication. The retail price of a smartwatch could be over US$300, plus data charges, while the minimum cost of smartphone-linked devices may be US$100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time is ripe for smart watches, say analysts|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|work=NDTV Gadgets|publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|access-date=15 July 2013|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=1 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414064430/http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|archive-date=14 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="Mims">{{cite news|title=Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smart watch|url=http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|access-date=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=5 July 2013|first=Christopher|last=Mims|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712160455/http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|archive-date=12 July 2013}}</ref>

* The physical size of smartwatches is likely to be large.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wajerski|first=Roger|date=August 2020|title=The Practical Uses of a Smartwatch|url=https://lucaneo.com/blogs/the-practical-uses-of-a-smart-watch/the-practical-uses-of-a-smartwatch-lucaneo|access-date=26 August 2020|website=Lucaneo|language=en}}</ref>
* Insufficient battery life is an ongoing problem for smartwatch developers, as the battery life of devices at the time of publication was three to four days, and this is likely to be reduced if further functions are added.
* New display technologies will be invented as a result of smartwatch research.
* The market success of smartwatches is unpredictable, as they may follow a similar trajectory to [[netbook]]s, or they may fulfil aims akin to those of Google Glass, another wearable electronic product.<ref name="Chris">{{cite news|title=What I learned from researching almost every single smart watch that has been rumored or announced|url=http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|access-date=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=11 July 2013|first=Christopher|last=Mims|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715195602/http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|archive-date=15 July 2013}}</ref>

==Market and popularity==
Smartwatches rose in popularity during the 2010s. Today, they are often used as fitness trackers, and smartphone "companions".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://medium.com/@avner_31565/the-2010s-the-decade-of-the-smartwatch-f68004fba068| title = The 2010s – The Decade of the Smartwatch {{!}} by Avner Brodsky {{!}} Medium| date = 5 February 2020}}</ref>{{user-generated inline|date=September 2023}} According to a study from [[statista]], smartwatch revenue was estimated to reach $44.15 billion by 2023, and revenue per year was expected to continue to grow to $62.46 billion by 2028.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Smartwatches - Worldwide {{!}} Statista Market Forecast |url=https://www.statista.com/outlook/hmo/digital-health/digital-fitness-well-being/fitness-trackers/smartwatches/worldwide |access-date=2023-12-08 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> The top contributors to the market size of market watches include [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]], [[Fossil Group Inc]], [[Garmin|Garmin Lt]], [[Google|Google LLC]], [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies Co]], [[Samsung]], and [[Xiaomi]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Koetsier |first=John |title=Global Smartwatch Market: Apple 34%, Huawei 8%, Samsung 8%, Fitbit 4.2% |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/05/27/global-smartwatch-market-apple-34-huawei-8-samsung-8-fitbit-42/ |access-date=2023-12-08 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref>

== Typical features ==
Many smartwatch smartphone models manufactured in the 2010s are completely functional as standalone products. Some are used in sports and feature a [[GPS tracking unit]] that can record historical data. For example, after a workout, data can be uploaded onto a computer or online in order to create a log of activities for analysis or sharing. Some watches can provide full GPS support, displaying maps and current coordinates, recording tracks, and bookmarking locations.

"Sport watch" functionality often includes [[activity tracker]] features, as included on [[GPS watch]]es made for training, diving, and outdoor sports. Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, GPS tracking unit, route tracking, [[dive computer]], [[heart rate monitor]] compatibility, [[Cadence (cycling)|Cadence]] sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in [[triathlon]]s).<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is a Smartwatch and What Do They Do? |url=https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381 |access-date=2024-05-14 |website=Lifewire |language=en}}</ref> Other watches can cooperate with a smartphone app to execute their functions. They are paired to a smartphone, usually via [[Bluetooth]]. Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same [[mobile operating system]]; others use an OS that is unique to the watch, or otherwise is able to work with most smartphones. Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone. This allows the watch to display data such as calls, [[SMS]] messages, [[email]]s, calendar invitations, and any data that may be made available by relevant [[phone app]]s.

===LTE===
{{Main|LTE (telecommunication)}}
From about 2015, several manufacturers began to release smartwatches with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] support, enabling direct connection to [[3G]]/[[4G]] [[mobile network]]s for voice and SMS use, without the need to carry a paired smartphone.<ref>{{cite web | last=Hicks | first=Michael L | title=Best smartwatch with LTE 2022| website=Android Central | date=15 December 2022 | url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte}}</ref>

==Security and other issues==
Tests by UK consumer organization [[Which?]] found that ultra-cheap smartwatches and fitness trackers sold online often had serious security flaws, including excessive data collection, insecure data storage, the inability to opt out of data collection, and a lack of a security lock function. Typically, a watch app can request permission to collect and store personally identifiable information, and apps can be rendered unusable if permission is denied. The user cannot know if information is being stored securely, and it cannot be deleted. There is no control over whether the supplier views it or sells it on, for whatever purpose. In many cases, data collected is not encrypted when transmitted to the supplier.<ref name=which>{{cite web | last=Woodger | first=Christina | title=Cheap Apple, Fitbit and Samsung smartwatch lookalikes snooping on users | publisher=[[Which?]] | date=23 December 2022 | url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/cheap-apple-fitbit-and-samsung-smartwatch-lookalikes-snooping-on-users-aWGm96j6KPOj}}</ref>

Which? did not specifically test the functionality of ultra-cheap watches, but noticed during their security audit that some could heart rate, blood oxygen measurements, and steps while not being worn or moved. They said that this "suggests [that] they are at best inaccurate and at worst useless".<ref name=which/>

In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[Product Security and Telecoms Infrastructure Act 2022|Product Security and Telecoms Infrastructure Act]] was passed in December 2022,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022|author= |website=Parliamentary Bills - UK Parliament |date=16 December 2022 |url= https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3069 }} House of Commons, Sessions 2021-22, 2022-23</ref> effective from 2024. The Act, which should cover smartwatches, specifies security standards that manufacturers, importers and distributors (including online marketplaces) of smart devices must meet.<ref name=which/>

== Social implications and biases ==
Due to faults in the design of current smartwatches, hardware and software designs have sometimes favored certain demographics. For example, smartwatches have more accurate tracking of data for individuals who have lighter skin, compared to individuals who have darker skin. This is due to the method that smartwatches use to monitor heart rate. An article published by the ''Healthcare Degree'' describes the most common method, in which devices use [[optical sensor]]s to track the presence of blood in the wrist, indicating a heart beat. This type of lighting technique is cheaper and simple to use than other methods; however, because the green light used has shorter [[wavelength]]s, it is less able to penetrate [[melanin]], the pigment which causes darker skin. This can make heart rate tracking for darker-skinned individuals less accurate.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zbrog |first1=Matt |title=The Racial Biases of Smartwatches and Other Healthcare Technologies |url=https://www.healthcaredegree.com/blog/biases-in-wearable-health-tech |website=HealthcareDegree |access-date=6 February 2024 |date=20 October 2020}}</ref>{{bettersource|date=February 2024}}

Social consequences from the increase in popularity of smartwatches include data collection and data privacy concerns. Smartwatches are capable of collecting personal health data such as activity levels, [[heart rate]], [[sleep patterns]], and other metrics. This user data is often collected and stored in the cloud, which can sometimes be accessed by companies and researchers, and used for many purposes. There have been many cases of data misuse. One instance published by the ''[[Warren Alpert Medical School]]'' involved [[Fitbit]] facing a lawsuit in 2011 for selling personal health data to advertisers without user consent.<ref name="Silva">{{Cite web |last=Silva |first=Jason Peres da |title=Privacy Data Ethics of Wearable Digital Health Technology |url=https://digitalhealth.med.brown.edu/news/2023-05-04/ethics-wearables |access-date=2023-12-08 |website=Center for Digital Health {{!}} Medical School {{!}} Brown University |language=en}}</ref> Another instance occurred when [[Strava]] allowed users to share their routes, which led to the accidental revelation of several [[military base]] locations throughout the world.<ref name="Silva"/>

While their functionality is limited, they primarily allow children to make and receive calls, display the time, and sometimes measure air temperature. These smartwatches typically cost between US$100 and US$200.

Children's smartwatches are also sold in other countries.<ref>{{cite web | title=SyncUP KIDS Watch - A Child GPS Tracker Watch | publisher=T-Mobile| url=https://www.t-mobile.com/iot-devices/syncup-kids-smartwatch | access-date=24 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=GizmoWatch 2: Kids smartwatch - real-time location | publisher=Verizon | url=https://www.verizon.com/connected-smartwatches/verizon-gizmowatch-2/ | access-date=24 December 2022}}</ref>
