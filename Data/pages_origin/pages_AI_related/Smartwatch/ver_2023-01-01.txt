A '''smartwatch''' is a [[wearable computer]] in the form of a [[watch]]; modern smartwatches provide a local [[touchscreen]] interface for daily use, while an associated [[smartphone app]] provides management and telemetry, such as long-term [[biomonitoring]]. While early models could perform basic tasks, such as [[calculator watch|calculations]], digital time telling, [[translation]]s, and [[Game watch|game-playing]], smartwatches released since 2015 have more general functionality closer to [[smartphone]]s, including [[mobile apps]], a [[mobile operating system]] and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function as [[portable media player]]s, with [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] and playback of digital audio and video files via a [[Bluetooth]] [[Headset (audio)|headset]]. Some models, called watch phones (or phone watches), have mobile cellular functionality such as making telephone calls.<ref>{{cite web |last=Molen |first=Brad |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |title=i phone Gear 2 smartwatches coming in April with Tizen OS |publisher=Engadget.com |date=14 January 2012 |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723100948/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |archive-date=23 July 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Trew |first=James |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |title=Sony SmartWatch 2 review |publisher=Engadget.com |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701212716/http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |archive-date=1 July 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |title=Garmin's new app turns Sony's Smartwatch 2 into a tiny sat-nav |publisher=Engadget.com |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915134810/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |archive-date=15 September 2016  }}</ref>

While internal hardware varies, most have an [[electronic visual display]], either backlit [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] or [[OLED]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.displaymate.com/Smart_Watch_ShootOut_1.htm|title=Smart Watch Display Technology Shoot-Out|website=displaymate.com|access-date=21 August 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813053218/http://www.displaymate.com/Smart_Watch_ShootOut_1.htm|archive-date=13 August 2016}}</ref> Some use [[Transflective liquid-crystal display|transflective]] or [[electronic paper]], to consume less power.  They are usually powered by a [[Lithium-ion battery|rechargeable lithium-ion battery]]. [[Peripheral device]]s may include [[digital camera]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, [[pedometer]]s, [[heart rate monitor]]s, [[altimeter]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[compass]]es, [[GPS navigation device|GPS receivers]], tiny [[Computer speaker|speakers]], and [[Secure Digital|microSD cards]], which are recognized as [[Mass storage|storage devices]] by many other kinds of [[computer]]s.

Software may include [[Web mapping|digital maps]], [[Calendaring software|schedulers]] and [[personal organizer]]s, [[calculator]]s, and various kinds of [[Clock face|watch faces]]. The watch may communicate with external devices such as sensors, [[wireless headset]]s, or a [[head-up display]]. Like other computers, a smartwatch may collect information from internal or external sensors and it may control, or retrieve data from, other instruments or computers. It may support wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, [[Wi-Fi]], and [[GPS]]. For many purposes, a "watch computer" serves as a front end for a remote system such as a smartphone, communicating with the smartphone using various wireless technologies. Smartwatches are advancing, especially their design, battery capacity, and health-related applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wearables: Has the Age of Smartwatches Finally Arrived?|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/1/181635-wearables|work=Medium|publisher=ACM|access-date=28 May 2015|author=Rawassizadeh|date=January 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The first [[digital watch]], which debuted in 1972, was the [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] manufactured by [[Hamilton Watch Company]]. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by [[Seiko]] in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Doensen|first=Pieter |title=Q.5 Watches with Memory and Database|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~doensen/q5.html|work=WATCH.

With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, [[Seiko]] began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name comes from its ability to store 2000 characters.<ref name="seiko">{{cite web|title=Seiko Computer Watch Fun|date=15 July 2005|url=http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|access-date=17 September 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024235156/http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|archive-date=24 October 2012}}</ref> Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<ref name="history"/> It was released in 1984, in gold, silver and black.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEIKO D-409|url=http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|publisher=Digital Watch Library|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013182237/http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|archive-date=13 October 2010}}</ref> These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series".

=== 1990s ===
The [[Timex Datalink]] wristwatch, was introduced in 1994. The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to receive data from a PC. Appointments and contacts created with [[Microsoft Schedule Plus|Microsoft Schedule+]], the predecessor of MS Outlook, could be easily transmitted to the watch via a screen blinking light protocol.

In early 1990s [[HMT (company)|HMT Limited]], the Indian state-run watch company, launched their first batch of digital watches, named 'Astra' which was sold in Indian market like hot cakes, even in black.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/678675/5-iconic-hmt-watches-prized-by-collectors|title = 5 iconic HMT watches prized by collectors}}</ref>

In 1998, [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] invented, designed, and built the world's first Linux wristwatch,<ref name ="Patent 2275784"/> which he presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where he was named "the father of wearable computing".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> See also Linux Journal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |title=WristWatchComputer |work=[[Linux Journal]] |issue=75 |date=1 July 2000 |pages=86â91 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712183307/http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |archive-date=12 July 2014  }} + Cover</ref> where Mann's Linux wristwatch appeared on the cover and was the feature article of LJ Issue 75. Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in Japan â a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are fully compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch as it was the first one to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).

In 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10. It had a protruding antenna, a monochrome LCD screen, and a 90-minutes of talk time with an integrated speaker and microphone.<ref name="samsungwatch">{{cite web|title=The War For Your Wrist|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|work=happleinsider.com|access-date=12 October 2014|first=Neil|last=Hughes|date=21 March 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018042152/http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|archive-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, the claim to first ever smartwatch to capture the full capability of a smartphone was laid by startup Omate with the [[Omate TrueSmart|TrueSmart]]. The TrueSmart originated from a Kickstarter campaign which raised over 1 million dollars, making it the 5th most successful Kickstarter to date. The TrueSmart made its public debut in early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|title=Top 5 Smartwatches Debuted At CES 2014|first=Ariel|last=Adams|website=[[Forbes]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019222704/https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|archive-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Consumer device analyst Avi Greengart, from research firm Current Analysis, suggested that 2013 may be the "year of the smartwatch", as "the components have gotten small enough and cheap enough" and many consumers own smartphones that are compatible with a wearable device. [[Wearable technology]], such as [[Google Glass]], was speculated to evolve into a business worth US$6 billion annually, and a July 2013 media report revealed that the majority of major consumer electronics manufacturers were undertaking work on a smartwatch device at the time of publication. The retail price of a smartwatch could be over US$300, plus data charges, while the minimum cost of smartphone-linked devices may be US$100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time is ripe for smart watches, say analysts|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|work=NDTV Gadgets|publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|access-date=15 July 2013|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=1 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414064430/http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|archive-date=14 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="Mims">{{cite news|title=Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smart watch|url=http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|access-date=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=5 July 2013|first=Christopher|last=Mims|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712160455/http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|archive-date=12 July 2013}}</ref>

* The physical size of smartwatches is likely to be large.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wajerski|first=Roger|date=August 2020|title=The Practical Uses of a Smartwatch|url=https://lucaneo.com/blogs/the-practical-uses-of-a-smart-watch/the-practical-uses-of-a-smartwatch-lucaneo|access-date=26 August 2020|website=Lucaneo|language=en}}</ref>
* Insufficient battery life is an ongoing problem for smartwatch developers, as the battery life of devices at the time of publication was three to four days and this is likely to be reduced if further functions are added.
* New display technologies will be invented as a result of smartwatch research.
* The success level of smartwatches is unpredictable, as they may follow a similar trajectory to [[netbook]]s, or they may fulfill aims akin to those of Google Glass, another wearable electronic product.<ref name="Chris">{{cite news|title=What I learned from researching almost every single smart watch that has been rumored or announced|url=http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|access-date=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=11 July 2013|first=Christopher|last=Mims|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715195602/http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|archive-date=15 July 2013}}</ref>

==Market and popularity==
Smartwatches have risen in popularity during the 2010s. Today, they are often used as fitness trackers, smartphone entertainment or communication "companions".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://medium.com/@avner_31565/the-2010s-the-decade-of-the-smartwatch-f68004fba068| title = The 2010s â The Decade of the Smartwatch {{!}} by Avner Brodsky {{!}} Medium| date = 5 February 2020}}</ref> Global smartwatch shipments counted 14 million in the third quarter of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/wearables/2019/11/06/global-smartwatch-shipments-leap-to-14-million-units-in-q3-2019|title = Global Smartwatch Shipments Leap to 14 Million Units in Q3 2019}}</ref> As of 2019 the market leader was Apple, followed by Samsung, Imoo, [[Fitbit]], [[Amazfit]], [[Huawei]], [[Fossil Group|Fossil]] and Garmin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/05/02/smartwatch-shipments-up-48-apple-36-samsung-11-imoo-9-fitbit-5-5-of-market/|title = Smartwatch Shipments up 48%: Apple 36%, Samsung 11%, Imoo 9%, Fitbit 5.5% of Market|website = [[Forbes]]}}</ref>

Many smartwatch smartphone models manufactured in the 2010s are completely functional as standalone products. Some are used in sports, the [[GPS tracking unit]] being used to record historical data. For example, after a workout, data can be uploaded onto a computer or online to create a log of activities for analysis or sharing. Some watches can provide full GPS support, displaying maps and current coordinates, recording tracks, and bookmarking locations.

"Sport watch" functionality often includes [[activity tracker]], or fitness tracker, features as included on [[GPS watch]]es made for training, diving, and outdoor sports. Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, GPS tracking unit, route tracking, [[dive computer]], [[heart rate monitor]] compatibility, [[Cadence (cycling)|Cadence]] sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in [[triathlon]]s). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a [[smartphone]] to carry out their functions.  They are paired usually by Bluetooth with a smartphone.  Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same [[mobile operating system]]; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones.  Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone.  This allows the watch to display data such as calls, [[SMS]] messages, [[email]]s, calendar invitations, and any data that may be made available by relevant [[phone app]]s. Some fitness-tracker watches give users reports on the distance walked, hours slept, and so on.

===LTE===
{{Main|LTE (telecommunication)}}
From about 2015 several manufacturers released smartwatches with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] support (''watch smartphones'' or autonomous vs. connected watches), enabling direct connection to [[3G]]/[[4G]] [[mobile network]]s for voice and SMS use, without the need to carry a paired smartphone.<ref>{{cite web | last=Hicks | first=Michael L | title=Best smartwatch with LTE 2022| website=Android Central | date=15 December 2022 | url=https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte}}</ref>

==Prices==
{{As of|2022}} smartwatches by the best-known providers sold for prices of typically several hundreds of pounds in the UK. There were also ultra-cheap watches, selling for prices typically between Â£2.07 and Â£30, which had security and other issues. There were also good watches costing less than Â£100 without all the features of the top models, but performing well in tests and meeting privacy and security assessments.<ref name=which/>

==Security and other issues==
Tests by UK consumer organisation [[Which?]] found by detailed testing that ultra-cheap smartwatches and fitness trackers sold online had serious security flaws including excessive data collection, data not stored securely, no way to opt out of data collection, and no security lock function to lock out thieves or other unauthorised users. Typically a watch app might request permission to collect and store "personally identifiable information and personal property information", such as information on passport, transactions, bank balances, and ID cards; the app is unusable if permission is denied. The user cannot know if information is being stored securely, and it cannot be deleted. There is no control over whether the supplier views it or sells it on, for whatever purpose. In many cases data collected is not encrypted when transmitted to the supplier.<ref name=which>{{cite web | last=Woodger | first=Christina | title=Cheap Apple, Fitbit and Samsung smartwatch lookalikes snooping on users | publisher=[[Which?]] | date=23 December 2022 | url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/cheap-apple-fitbit-and-samsung-smartwatch-lookalikes-snooping-on-users-aWGm96j6KPOj}}</ref>

Which? did not specifically test functionality of ultra-cheap watches, but while checking security they noticed that some displayed heart rate, blood oxygen measurements, and counted steps while not being worn or moved; they said that this "suggests they are at best inaccurate and at worst useless".<ref name=which/>

In the UK a [[Product Security and Telecoms Infrastructure Act 2022|Product Security and Telecoms Infrastructure Act]] was passed in December 2022,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022|author= |website=Parliamentary Bills - UK Parliament |date=16 December 2022 |url= https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3069 }} House of Commons, Sessions 2021-22, 2022-23</ref> effective from 2024.

The devices are commonly colorful and made of plastic. They normally have no display unless a button is pushed. These smartwatches have limited functionality, mainly being able to conduct [[telephone call|calls]], and display [[time]], and sometimes air temperature. They cost around US$100 to $200.

Children's smartwatches are also sold in other countries.<ref>{{cite web | title=SyncUP KIDS Watch - A Child GPS Tracker Watch | publisher=T-Mobile| url=https://www.t-mobile.com/iot-devices/syncup-kids-smartwatch | access-date=24 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=GizmoWatch 2: Kids smartwatch - real-time location | publisher=Verizon | url=https://www.verizon.com/connected-smartwatches/verizon-gizmowatch-2/ | access-date=24 December 2022}}</ref>
