A '''smartwatch''' is a [[wearable computer]] in the form of a [[wristwatch]]; modern smartwatches provide a local [[touchscreen]] interface for daily use, while an associated smartphone app provides for management and telemetry (such as long-term biomonitoring). While early models could perform basic tasks, such as [[calculator watch|calculations]], digital time telling, [[translation]]s, and [[Game watch|game-playing]], 2010s smartwatches have more general functionality closer to [[smartphone]]s, including [[mobile apps]], a [[mobile operating system]] and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function as [[portable media player]]s, with [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] and playback of digital audio and video files via a [[Bluetooth]] [[Headset (audio)|headset]]. Some models, called 'watch phones' (or vice versa), have mobile cellular functionality like making calls.<ref>{{cite web |last=Molen |first=Brad |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |title=i phone Gear 2 smartwatches coming in April with Tizen OS |publisher=Engadget.com |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723100948/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/22/samsung-gear-2/ |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Trew |first=James |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |title=Sony SmartWatch 2 review |publisher=Engadget.com |accessdate=22 July 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701212716/http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/26/sony-smartwatch-2-review/ |archivedate=1 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |title=Garmin's new app turns Sony's Smartwatch 2 into a tiny sat-nav |publisher=Engadget.com |accessdate=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915134810/http://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/gamin-xperia-smartwatch-2-nav-app/ |archivedate=15 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

They are generally powered by a [[Lithium-ion battery|rechargeable lithium-ion battery]]. [[Peripheral device]]s may include [[digital camera]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[accelerometer]]s, [[pedometer]]s, [[heart rate monitor]]s, [[altimeter]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[compass]]es, [[GPS navigation device|GPS receivers]], tiny [[Computer speaker|speakers]], and [[Secure Digital|microSD cards]], which are recognized as [[Mass storage|storage device]]s by many other kinds of [[computer]]s.

Software may include [[Web mapping|digital maps]], [[Calendaring software|schedulers]] and [[personal organizer]]s, [[calculator]]s, and various kinds of [[Clock face|watch faces]]. The watch may communicate with external devices such as sensors, [[wireless headset]]s, or a [[Head-up display|heads-up display]]. Like other [[computer]]s, a smartwatch may collect information from internal or external sensors and it may control, or retrieve data from, other instruments or computers. It may support wireless technologies such as [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], and [[GPS]]. For many purposes, a "watch computer" serves as a front end for a remote system such as a [[smartphone]], communicating with the smartphone using various wireless technologies. Smartwatches are advancing, especially their design, battery capacity, and health-related applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wearables: Has the Age of Smartwatches Finally Arrived?|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/1/181635-wearables|work=Medium|publisher=ACM|accessdate=28 May 2015|author=Rawassizadeh|date=January 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The first [[digital watch]], which debuted in 1972, was the [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] manufactured by [[Hamilton Watch Company]]. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by [[Seiko]] in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Doensen|first=Pieter |title=Q.5 Watches with Memory and Database|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~doensen/q5.html|work=WATCH. History of the modern wrist watch. Pieter Doensen. |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>  With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, [[Seiko]] began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name comes from its ability to store 2000 characters. The D409 was the first [[Seiko]] model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a [[dot matrix]] display.<ref name="seiko">{{cite web|title=Seiko Computer Watch Fun|url=http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|accessdate=17 September 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024235156/http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/seiko-computer-watch-fun/|archivedate=24 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<ref name="history"/> It was released in 1984, in gold, silver and black.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEIKO D-409|url=http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|publisher=Digital Watch Library|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013182237/http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|archivedate=13 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series": During the 1980s, [[Casio]] began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its [[calculator watch]]es. Most notable was the [[Casio data bank]] series. Novelty "game watches", such as the [[Nelsonic game watch]]es, were also produced by Casio and other companies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Seiko RC series ===
The RC-1000 Wrist Terminal was the first [[Seiko]] model to interface with a computer, and was released in 1984.<ref name="seiko"/> It was developed by [[Seiko Epson]] and was powered by a [[computer on a chip]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 Japanese PCs (1984)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707091011/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 |date=7 July 2017 }} (14:05), ''[[Computer Chronicles]]''</ref> It was compatible with most of the popular PCs of that time, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] II, II+ and IIe, the [[Commodore 64|Commodore]] 64, [[IBM]] PC, [[NEC]] 8201, [[Tandy Computers|Tandy]] Color Computer, Model 1000, 1200, 2000 and TRS-80 Model I, III, 4 and 4p. The RC-20 Wrist Computer was released in 1985, under the joint brand name "Seiko Epson".<ref>{{cite web|title=A history of the smart watch and why nobody wants one|url=https://medium.com/p/41c3b4796432|work=Medium|publisher=Medium|accessdate=14 September 2013|author=Simon Dingle|date=5 September 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224605/https://medium.com/p/41c3b4796432|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Epson">{{cite web|title=History of Smart Watches|url=http://www.verysmartwatches.com/blog/history-of-smart-watches/|accessdate=13 September 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920040950/http://www.verysmartwatches.com/blog/history-of-smart-watches/|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It had a SMC84C00 8-bit Z-80 [[microprocessor]]; 8&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]] of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and 2&nbsp;KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. It had applications for scheduling, memos, and world time and a four-function calculator app. The dot-matrix LCD displayed 42×32 pixels, and more importantly, was touch-sensitive. Like the RC-1000, it could be connected to a personal computer, in this case through a proprietary cable. It was also notable in that it could be programmed, although its small display and limited storage severely limited application development.<ref name="seiko"/> The RC-4000 PC Data graph also released in 1985, was dubbed the "world's smallest computer terminal".<ref name="seiko"/> It had 2&nbsp;KB of storage. The RC-4500 (1985), also known as the Wrist Mac, had the same features as the RC-4000, but came in a variety of bright, flashy colors.

=== 1990s ===
The [[Timex Datalink]] wristwatch, was introduced in 1994. The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to communicate with a PC. Appointments and contacts created with [[Microsoft Schedule Plus|Microsoft Schedule+]], the predecessor of MS Outlook, could be easily transmitted to the watch via a screen blinking light protocol.

In 1998, [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] invented, designed, and built the world's first Linux wristwatch,<ref name ="Patent 2275784"/> which he presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where he was named "the father of wearable computing".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> See also Linux Journal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |title=WristWatchComputer |work=[[Linux Journal]] |issue=75 |date=1 July 2000 |pages=86–91 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712183307/http://wearcam.org/wristcam/ |archivedate=12 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }} + Cover</ref> where Mann's Linux wristwatch appeared on the cover and was the feature article of LJ Issue 75. Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).

In 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10. It had a protruding antenna, a monochrome LCD screen, and a 90-minutes of talk time with an integrated speaker and microphone.<ref name="samsungwatch">{{cite web|title=The War For Your Wrist|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|work=happleinsider.com|accessdate=12 October 2014|author=Neil Hughes|date=21 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018042152/http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/new-samsung-smart-watch-will-be-companys-third-stab-at-wrist-accessory|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2013, the claim to first ever smartwatch to capture the full capability of a smartphone was laid by startup Omate with the [[Omate TrueSmart|TrueSmart]]. The TrueSmart originated from a Kickstarter campaign which raised over 1 million dollars, making it the 5th most successful Kickstarter to date. The TrueSmart made its public debut in early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|title=Top 5 Smartwatches Debuted At CES 2014|first=Ariel|last=Adams|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019222704/https://www.forbes.com/sites/arieladams/2014/01/13/top-5-smartwatches-ces-2014/|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Consumer device analyst Avi Greengart, from research firm Current Analysis, suggested that 2013 may be the "year of the smartwatch", as "the components have gotten small enough and cheap enough" and many consumers own smartphones that are compatible with a wearable device. [[Wearable technology]], such as [[Google Glass]], may evolve into a business worth US$6 billion annually and a July 2013 media report, revealed that the majority of major consumer electronics manufacturers were undertaking work on a smartwatch device at the time of publication. The retail price of a smartwatch could be over US$300, plus data charges, while the minimum cost of smartphone-linked devices may be US$100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time is ripe for smart watches, say analysts|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|work=NDTV Gadgets|publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|accessdate=15 July 2013|author=Agence France-Presse|date=1 April 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414064430/http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/time-is-ripe-for-smart-watches-say-analysts-348697|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Mims">{{cite news|title=Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smart watch|url=http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=5 July 2013|author=Christopher Mims|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712160455/http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/|archivedate=12 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

* The physical size of smartwatches is likely to be large.
* Insufficient battery life is an ongoing problem for smartwatch developers, as the battery life of devices at the time of publication was three to four days and this is likely to be reduced if further functions are added.
* New display technologies will be invented as a result of smartwatch research.
* The success level of smartwatches is unpredictable, as they may follow a similar trajectory to [[netbook]]s, or they may fulfill aims akin to those of [[Google Glass]], another wearable electronic product.<ref name="Chris">{{cite news|title=What I learned from researching almost every single smart watch that has been rumored or announced|url=http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|accessdate=15 July 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=11 July 2013|author=Christopher Mims|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715195602/http://qz.com/102646/takeaways-from-every-single-smart-watch/|archivedate=15 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Many smartwatch models manufactured in the 2010s are completely functional as standalone products. Some serve as being used in sports, the [[GPS tracking unit]] being used to record historical data.  For example, after a workout, data can be uploaded onto a computer or online to create a log of activities for analysis or sharing.  Some watches can serve as full [[GPS watch]]es, displaying maps and current coordinates, and recording tracks.  Users can "mark" their current location and then edit the entry's name and coordinates, which enables navigation to those new coordinates. As companies add competitive products into the market, media space is becoming a desired commodity on smartwatches.  With [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Sony]], [[Samsung]], and [[Motorola]] introducing their smartwatch models, 15% of tech consumers<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/03/23/smartwatches-ads/|title=The Fourth Screen: How Smartwatches Could Be Used for Ads|last=Wasserman|first=Todd|website=Mashable|access-date=7 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406022640/http://mashable.com/2014/03/23/smartwatches-ads/|archivedate=6 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> use [[Wearable technology|wearable technologies]].  This is a dense market{{Clarify|date=July 2016}} of tech consumers who possess buying power, which has attracted many advertisers. It is expected for mobile advertising on wearable devices to increase heavily by 2017 as [[Hypertargeting|advanced hypertargeting]] modules are introduced to the devices. In order for an advertisement to be effective on a smartwatch, companies have stated that the ad must be able to create experiences native to the smartwatch itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubnative.net/blog/native-smart-watch-ads/|title=Why Native Can Make Smart Watch Ads Work|website=PubNative|language=en-US|access-date=7 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421192319/http://pubnative.net/blog/native-smart-watch-ads/|archivedate=21 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

"Sport watch" functionality often includes [[activity tracker]] features (also known as "fitness tracker")  as seen in [[GPS watch]]es made for training, diving, and outdoor sports. Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, [[GPS tracking unit]], Route tracking, [[dive computer]], [[heart rate monitor]] compatibility, [[Cadence (cycling)|Cadence]] sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in [[triathlon]]s). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a [[smartphone]] to carry out their functions.  They are paired usually by [[Bluetooth]] with a smartphone.  Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same [[mobile operating system]]; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones.  Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone.  This allows the watch to display data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, calendar invites, and any data that may be made available by relevant [[phone app]]s. Some fitness tracker watches give users reports on the number of kilometers they walked, hours they slept, and so on.

===LTE===
{{Main|LTE (telecommunication)}}
Starting around 2014, several manufacturers started to release smartwatches with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (''watch smartphones'' or autonomous vs. connected watches), allowing for direct [[3G]]/[[4G]] connection to the general [[cellular network|telephone network]]s just like any other [[smartphone]].

===Long-lasting batteries ===
Long battery life lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, plus 20 more with time and activity tracking only.
Some watches use a button battery for time, with longer lasting periods.
