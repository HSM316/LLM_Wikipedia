{{Short description|Internet-connected soft toy line}}
'''CloudPets''' was an Internet-connected [[soft toy]] manufactured by now defunct Spiral Toys that was the subject of numerous security vulnerabilities in February 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/02/28/cloudpets-data-leak-is-a-privacy-nightmare-for-parents-and-kids/|title=The Latest Privacy Nightmare For Parents: Data Leaks From Smart Toys|last=Mathews|first=Lee|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3175225/security/smart-teddy-bears-involved-in-a-contentious-data-breach.html|title=Smart teddy bears involved in a contentious data breach|last=Kan|first=Michael|work=Network World|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en}}</ref> The plush [[teddy bear]]-style toys used [[Bluetooth]] to connect to a parent's smartphone to allow distant family members to send voice messages to the toy, and allow children to send voice messages back.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/28/cloudpets-data-breach-leaks-details-of-500000-children-and-adults|title=CloudPets stuffed toys leak details of half a million users|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2017-02-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Security researchers demonstrated that the toy itself was insecure and could be trivially accessed via Bluetooth.

Following disclosure of security vulnerabilities, CloudPets started enforcing stronger [[password]] requirements on users of the serviceâ€”they had previously not enforced any password complexity requirements and their documentation had suggested short, weak passwords.<ref name=":0" /> Numerous journalists and security researchers including Hunt noted that the company was non-responsive to disclosures from security researchers and enquiries from journalists.<ref name=":1" />
