'''Oculus Rift''' is a discontinued line of [[virtual reality headsets|virtual reality headset]]s developed and manufactured by [[Oculus VR]], a virtual reality company founded by [[Palmer Luckey]] that is widely credited with reviving the [[virtual reality]] industry. It was the first virtual reality headset to provide a realistic experience at an accessible price, utilizing novel technology to increase quality and reduce cost by orders of magnitude compared to earlier systems.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rubin |first=Peter |title=The Inside Story of Oculus Rift and How Virtual Reality Became Reality |language=en-US |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/oculus-rift-4/ |access-date=2023-05-29 |issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The first headset in the line was the Oculus Rift DK1, released on March 28, 2013.<ref name=":0" /> The last was the [[Oculus Rift S]], discontinued in April of 2021.

The Rift went through various pre-production models prior to the release of the Oculus Rift CV1, the first Oculus Rift intended for use by the general public. Two of these, the DK1 in early-2013 and DK2 in mid-2014, were intended to provide content developers with a [[development kit]] platform to create content for the Rift's eventual consumer release. However, both development kits were purchased by many gaming enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2015/02/iribe-100000-oculus-rift-dk2s-shipped/|title=Iribe: Over 100,000 Oculus Rift DK2s Shipped|date=February 16, 2015|publisher=VRFocus|access-date=September 7, 2015|archive-date=October 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020084346/https://www.vrfocus.com/2015/02/iribe-100000-oculus-rift-dk2s-shipped/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Rift saw its official consumer release in March 2016 with the Rift CV1, and was eventually replaced in March 2019 by the [[Oculus Rift S]].<ref name="rift-phaseout-tested" /><ref name="rift-phaseout-theverge" /><ref name="rift-phaseout-oculusblog" /> The Oculus Rift software library is still compatible with its successor, the [[Oculus Quest]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oculus Quest 2 vs. Oculus Rift S: Which VR Headset Should You Buy? |url=https://www.pcmag.com/comparisons/oculus-quest-vs-oculus-rift-s-which-vr-headset-should-you-buy |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=PCMAG |language=en}}</ref>

==History==

===Initial prototypes===

The first prototype of the Oculus Rift was created in 2011 by [[Palmer Luckey]] (then 18 years old) in his parents’ garage in [[Long Beach, California]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/oculus-rift-4/ |title=The Inside Story of Oculus Rift and How Virtual Reality Became Reality|magazine=Wired|date=2014-05-20}}</ref> Luckey had been building his own virtual reality headsets since 2009, but the 2011 prototype was the first to incorporate key technologies like geometric pre-distortion and a wide [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[Field of view|field-of-view]] that would come to define all of his subsequent designs.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rubin |first=Peter |title=The Inside Story of Oculus Rift and How Virtual Reality Became Reality |language=en-US |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/oculus-rift-4/ |access-date=2023-05-29 |issn=1059-1028}}</ref>  Luckey decided to drop out of college and start [[Oculus VR]], intending to turn his prototype into the world's first mass-produced virtual reality headset.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Luckey |first=Palmer |date=2022-04-15 |title=10 Years of Oculus |url=https://palmerluckey.com/10-years-of-oculus/ |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=The Blog of Palmer Luckey |language=en-US}}</ref>

Noted videogame pioneer [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]], the founder of [[id Software]], had been doing extensive research into virtual reality technology, leading Luckey to lend him a prototype Oculus Rift. Carmack wrote a public review of the prototype calling it "by far the most immersive [[Head-mounted display|HMD]]" he had used, noting that the targeted price would also make it the cheapest.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A day with an Oculus Rift - Meant to be Seen |url=https://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=14967 |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=www.mtbs3d.com}}</ref> At the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], Id Software gave demonstrations of their games running on the prototype Oculus Rift and announced that their newest game, ''[[Doom 3]]'' ''[[Doom 3 BFG Edition|BFG Edition]]'', would be compatible with the Oculus Rift.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2012/06/06/ign-reacts-john-carmack-makes-virtual-reality-actually-cool-with-new-head-tracking-device-e3-2012/|title=Carmack Makes Virtual Reality Actually Cool}}</ref>  These early prototypes used a high speed [[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]], 5.6" [[LCD]], and wide-FOV optics to project a 90 degrees horizontal and 110 degrees vertical [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3D view onto the retina of the user.<ref name="eurogamere3" /><ref name="g4tvrosenberg" />[[File:Oculus Rift - Developer Version - Front.jpg|thumb|The Development Kit 1]]

=== Development Kit 1 ===
[[File:Oculus Rift - Developer Version - Back and Control Box.jpg|thumb|Rear view and control box]]

Two months after being formed as a company, Palmer's [[Oculus VR]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] [[crowdfunding]] campaign on August 1, 2012, for their virtual reality headset, named the Rift. The main purpose of the Kickstarter was to get an Oculus Rift prototype—now referred to as DK1 (Development Kit 1)—into the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/26/a-brief-history-of-oculus/ |title=A Brief History Of Oculus |publisher=TechCrunch |date=March 26, 2014 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name="auto">Gleasure, R., & Feller, J. (2016). A Rift in the Ground: Theorizing the Evolution of Anchor Values in Crowdfunding Communities through the Oculus Rift Case Study. Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17(10), 708-736.</ref> The DK1 was given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter, and was later sold publicly for $300 on their website. These kits sold at a rate of 4–5 per minute for the first day, before slowing down throughout the week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oculus.com/blog/update-on-developer-kit-technology-shipping-details/|title=Update on Developer Kit Technology, Shipping Details|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=Oculus VR|access-date=March 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name="AutoFU-5"/>

The Rift DK1 was released on March 29, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game|title=Oculus Rift: Step Into the Game|work=Kickstarter.com|access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref> and uses a {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} screen with a significantly lower pixel switching time than the original prototype, reducing latency and motion blur when turning one's head quickly. The pixel fill is also better, reducing the [[Screen-door effect|screen door effect]] and making individual pixels less noticeable. The [[LCD]] is brighter and the color depth is 24 bits per pixel.

The 7-inch screen also makes the stereoscopic 3D no longer 100% overlapping, the left eye seeing extra area to the left and the right eye seeing extra area to the right, in which there is no 3D depth perception. The field of view (FOV) is more than 90 degrees horizontal (110 degrees diagonal), which is more than double the FOV of previous VR devices from other companies, and is the primary strength of the device. The resolution is 1280×800 (16:10 aspect ratio), which leads to an effective of 640×800 per eye (4:5 aspect ratio). However, since the device does not feature a 100% overlap between the eyes, the combined horizontal resolution is effectively greater than 640. The image for each eye is shown in the panel as a [[barrel distortion|barrel distorted]] image that is then corrected by [[Pincushion distortion|pincushion effect]] created by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped image for each eye.

Initial prototypes used a [[Hillcrest Labs]] [[3DoF]] head tracker that is normally 125&nbsp;Hz, with a special firmware requested by John Carmack that makes it run at 250&nbsp;Hz, tracker latency being vital due to the dependency of virtual reality's realism on response time. The latest version includes Oculus's new 1000&nbsp;Hz Adjacent Reality Tracker, which aims to provide much lower latency tracking than almost any other tracker. It uses a combination of three-axis [[Gyroscope|gyros]], [[accelerometer]]s, and [[magnetometer]]s, which make it capable of absolute (relative to Earth) head orientation tracking without drift.<ref name="update11" />

The Development Kit 1 also included interchangeable lenses that aim to allow for simple [[dioptric correction]].

The entire source for the Rift DK1 was released to the public in September 2014, including the firmware, schematics, and mechanicals for the device. The firmware is released under a [[simplified BSD license]], while the schematics and mechanicals are released under a [[Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].<ref>{{cite web|title=OculusVR/RiftDK1|url=https://github.com/OculusVR/RiftDK1|website=github.com|access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref>

===HD and Crystal Cove prototypes===
In June 2013, a prototype of the Rift that used a 1080p LCD panel was shown at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]. This step forwards to twice the number of pixels as DK1 significantly reduced the [[Screen-door effect|screen door effect]] and made objects in the virtual world more clear, especially at a distance. The poor resolution had been the main criticism of the DK1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/11/hands-on-new-1080p-oculus-rift-with-unreal-engine-4|title=E3 2013: New 1080p Oculus Rift with Unreal Engine 4|date=2013-06-11|work=IGN|access-date=November 1, 2013}}</ref>

This HD prototype is the only prototype of the Rift shown to the public which did not turn into a publicly available developer kit.

In January 2014, an updated prototype codenamed "Crystal Cove" was unveiled at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], which used a special low-[[persistence of vision]] [[OLED]] display as well as a new motion tracking system that utilized an external camera to track infrared dots located on the headset. The new motion tracking system would allow the system to detect actions such as leaning or crouching, which was claimed to help alleviate sickness experienced by users when the software did not respond to these actions.<ref name=verge-crystalcove>{{cite web|title=Oculus reveals Crystal Cove prototype virtual reality headset with intriguing OLED display|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5284918/oculus-rift-crystal-cove|work=The Verge|access-date=January 7, 2014|date=2014-01-07}}</ref>

===Development Kit 2===
[[File:Oculus Rift development kit 2.jpg|thumb|The Development Kit 2]]
Oculus began shipping Development Kit 2 (DK2) in July 2014.<ref name="Announcing the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2)" /> This is a small refinement of the "Crystal Cove" prototype, featuring several key improvements over the first development kit, such as having a higher-resolution (960×1080 per eye) low-persistence OLED display, higher refresh rate of 75{{nbsp}}Hz,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-08-15 |title=Oculus VR Rift DK2 Unboxing #throughglass and First Impressions |url=https://www.tweaktown.com/articles/6583/oculus-vr-rift-dk2-unboxing-throughglass-and-first-impressions/index.html |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=TweakTown |language=en-US}}</ref> positional tracking, a detachable cable, and the omission of the need for the external control box.

A teardown of DK2 revealed that it incorporates a modified [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3]] smartphone display, including the front panel from the device itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5956589/new-oculus-dev-kit-uses-front-of-galaxy-note-3-for-display|title=New Oculus Rift dev kit uses the front of a Galaxy Note 3 as its screen|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=2014-07-31|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

In February 2015, Oculus announced that over 100,000 DK2 units had been shipped up until that point.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/brendaniribe/status/565888922362728449|title = Brendan Iribe on Twitter: "Over 100k DK2's and tons of Gear VR's in the wild -- can't wait to see what the community creates.

===Crescent Bay prototype===
In September 2014, Oculus once again presented an updated version of the Rift, codenamed Crescent Bay. This version has a greater resolution than the DK2, a lower weight, built-in audio, and 360-degree tracking thanks to the presence of tracking LEDs in the back of the headset.<ref name=CrescentBay>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-unveils-new-crescent-bay-rift-model-with-in/1100-6422451/|title=Oculus Unveils New Crescent Bay Rift Model With Integrated Audio, 360 Tracking|date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> Oculus has also licensed software library RealSpace3D, which is expected to provide the Rift with [[Head-related transfer function|HRTF]] and reverb algorithms.<ref name=CrescentBay/> During a panel at [[South by Southwest#2015|SXSW 2015]], titled "Explore the Future of VR", it was publicly announced for the first time that the prototype uses two screens instead of one as previously thought.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/13/8212205/oculus-crescent-bay-two-screen-vr-headset-palmer-luckey|title = The Oculus Crescent Bay is a two-screen VR headset|date = March 14, 2015|access-date = March 14, 2015|website = The Verge}}</ref>

===First consumer version===
{{main|Oculus Rift CV1}}
[[File:Oculus-Rift-CV1-Headset-Back.jpg|thumb|Oculus Rift, sometimes referred to as "Consumer Version 1" or "CV1"]]
Oculus VR announced on May 6, 2015, that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of 2016,<ref>{{cite web|title=First Look at the Rift, Shipping Q1 2016|url=https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/first-look-at-the-rift-shipping-q1-2016/|website=oculus.com|date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> and on March 25, 2016, the first batch of headsets began shipping to consumers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2016-25-03-oculus-rift-vr-headset-starts-shipping-to-customers|title=Oculus Rift VR headset starts shipping to customers|last=Falcon|first=Jonah|publisher=GameWatcher|date=March 25, 2016|access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref>

The consumer version is an improved version of the Crescent Bay Prototype, featuring per-eye displays with a 1080×1200 resolution, running at 90&nbsp;Hz, 360-degree positional tracking, integrated audio, a vastly increased positional tracking volume, and a heavy focus on consumer ergonomics and aesthetics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/first-look-at-the-rift-shipping-q1-2016/ |title=Blog — First Look at the Rift, Shipping Q1 2016 &#124; Oculus - Oculus VR |publisher=Oculus |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

In March 2019, during the announcement of the Rift S, it was said that the Rift S would replace the original Rift.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273327/oculus-rift-available-out-of-stock-amazon-bestbuy-newegg|title=The Oculus Rift is out of stock almost everywhere, still shipping "while supplies last"|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2019-03-20|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> However, Oculus VR stated that they planned to support the CV1 with software updates for "the foreseeable future".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/original-oculus-rift-future/|title=Original Oculus Rift Will Be Supported 'For The Foreseeable Future'|date=2019-03-20|website=UploadVR|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>

===Rift S===
{{main|Oculus Rift S}}
On May 21, 2019, Oculus began shipping a new VR headset known as Rift S.<ref name=":2" /> The Rift S has a 1,280<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oculus Compare Headsets {{!}} Oculus|url=https://www.oculus.com/compare/|access-date=2020-08-28|website=www.oculus.com|language=en}}</ref> ×1,440 LCD @ 80&nbsp;Hz and slightly larger field of view than that of the CV1, but lacks mechanical IPD adjustment (IPD adjustment is software-only). The Rift S tracks the position of itself and its controllers in 3D space using a system known as Oculus Insight, which uses the 5 cameras on the HMD to track points in the environment and infrared LEDs on the controllers, information from accelerometers in both the HMD and controllers, and [[computer vision]] to predict what path the HMD and controllers are most likely to take.<ref>{{Citation|title=Oculus Insight: How Facebook's Oculus Quest & Rift S Track Your Head And Hand Movements|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrj3JE-NHMw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/nrj3JE-NHMw| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The Rift S uses a DisplayPort 1.2 port and one USB 3.0 port, as opposed to the HDMI and USB 3.0 port used on the Rift CV1. The Rift S targeted the same price point (USD$399) and hardware requirements as the Rift CV1, and has replaced the Rift CV1 since.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-rift-s-specs-release-date-announcement-gdc-2019/|title=Oculus Rift S Revealed with Inside-out Tracking, Resolution Bump, & New Ergonomics|last=Lang|first=Ben|date=2019-03-20|website=Road to VR|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref>

During September 2020, it was announced that the Rift S would be discontinued in 2021 in order for Oculus to focus on the [[Oculus Quest 2]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2020-09-16|title=Facebook is discontinuing the Oculus Rift S|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect|access-date=2021-07-20|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref> In 2021, the Rift S was officially discontinued and was no longer available on the Oculus website, effectively ending the Rift line.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lilly|first=Paul|date=2021-07-05|title=It was a nice run, but the Oculus Rift S is no longer available on the Oculus site|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/it-was-a-nice-run-but-the-oculus-rift-s-is-no-longer-available-on-the-oculus-site/|access-date=2021-07-19|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Software==

===Runtime===
The Oculus Rift runtime officially supports [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]]. The installation package includes components such as the headset driver (which includes Oculus Display driver and controller drivers), Positional Tracking Sensor driver, Oculus Service, and Oculus Home Application.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.oculus.com/sdk-downloads/documents/Oculus_User_Guide_0.4.4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303181137/http://static.oculus.com/sdk-downloads/documents/Oculus_User_Guide_0.4.4.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 3, 2015 |title=Oculus User Guide |date=March 3, 2015 |access-date=June 27, 2018}}</ref> The runtime service implements a number of processing techniques intended to minimize latency and in addition improve the smoothness of VR applications under weaker hardware. These include direct mode, [[asynchronous timewarp]], and [[asynchronous spacewarp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.oculus.com/blog/asynchronous-spacewarp/ |title=Asynchronous Spacewarp |publisher=developer.oculus.com |date=November 10, 2016 |access-date=June 27, 2018}}</ref>

===Oculus Home===
When the user puts on the Rift and no other content is being outputted to the headset, they are presented with ''Oculus Home''. This is the default environment of the Rift, which presents them with a loft environment and a floating menu, allowing the user to launch VR applications they own, see if their friends are using the Rift, and purchase virtual reality content on the ''Oculus Home'' store from the headset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/oculus-home-is-the-rift-s-homebase-1296412 |title=Oculus Home will let you buy games straight from the Rift |publisher=TechRadar |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

An update to the base software, called Core 2.0, introduced a more interactive default environment, allowing the user to navigate and customize it with imported 3D models.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/26/facebook-shows-off-oculus-home-improvements-and-hybrid-apps/|title=Facebook shows off Oculus Home improvements and Hybrid Apps|date=2018-09-26|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}</ref> However in 2023, Meta, formerly known as Oculus, closed Oculus Home and killed it off.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mixed-news.com/en/meta-kills-oculus-home-these-digital-spaces-are-lost-forever/}|title=Meta kills Oculus Home: These digital spaces are lost forever|date=2023-05-27|work=MIXED Reality News|access-date=2023-05-27|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Oculus Store===
Oculus maintains a market place for applications for the headsets. The listings are curated to only allow applications that run smoothly on the recommended hardware. Most listings are also rated on their comfort level based on their likelihood of causing motion sickness or number of jump scares. However, developers do not have to use ''Oculus Home'' to distribute content for the Rift, this being entirely optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/12/oculus-app-store/ |title=Oculus App Store Will Require Pre-Approvals, Comfort Ratings, Tax |publisher=TechCrunch |date=June 12, 2015 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref> The Store can be accessed from the VR-based Oculus Home, from its desktop app, or on the Oculus web site under the section "Experiences."

==== Features ====
Listings on the registry include:

* Age and content ratings
* Comfort rating: "comfortable", "moderate", "intense" (assigned by Oculus)
* User ratings and reviews: user can give a rating on a 5-star scale and write a review

===SDK===
Content for the Rift is developed using the Oculus PC SDK, a free proprietary [[Software development kit|SDK]] available for [[Microsoft Windows]] (OSX and Linux support is planned for the future).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/powering-the-rift/ |title=Blog — Powering the Rift - Oculus VR |publisher=Oculus.com |date=May 15, 2015 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> This is a feature complete SDK which handles for the developer the various aspects of making virtual reality content, such as the optical distortion and advanced rendering techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.oculus.com/ |title=Creators — Home &#124; Oculus |publisher=Developer.oculus.com |date=February 2, 2015 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

The Oculus SDK is directly integrated with the popular game engines [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 5]], [[Unreal Engine 4]], and [[Cryengine]]. This allows for developers already familiar with these engines to create VR content with little to no VR-specific code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/06/09/unity-5-1-is-here/ |title=Unity 5.1 is here! – Unity Blog |publisher=Blogs.unity3d.com |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unrealengine.com/vr-page |title=VR |publisher=Unrealengine.com |access-date=July 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629143348/https://www.unrealengine.com/vr-page |archive-date=29 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vrfocus.com/archives/17544/cryengine-gets-oculus-support/ |title=CryENGINE Gets Oculus Support |publisher=VRFocus |date=June 19, 2015 |access-date=July 17, 2015 |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705204851/http://vrfocus.com/archives/17544/cryengine-gets-oculus-support/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Rift is an open platform, and thus developers do not need any approval or verification to develop, distribute, or sell content for it, and do not have to pay any licensing fees.

At Oculus's 3rd annual conference (Oculus Connect 3), it announced the new technology, called "Asynchronous Spacewarp (ASW)". This technology allows the Rift to compensate for the dropped frames. According to Oculus, ASW reduces the minimum specs of a PC to run the Rift without any judder.

== System requirements ==
In May 2015, Oculus VR announced "recommended" hardware specifications for computers utilizing Oculus Rift, specifying a CPU equivalent to an [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Intel Core i5-4590]], at least 8GB of RAM, at least an [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 series|AMD Radeon R9 290]] or [[GeForce 900 series|Nvidia GeForce GTX 970]] graphics card, an [[HDMI]] 1.3 output, three [[USB 3.0]] ports, and one [[USB 2.0]] port. Oculus VR stated that these requirements would remain in force for the life of the first consumer model. The company also stated that while upcoming discrete GPUs for laptops may be able to reach the required performance for Oculus Rift, systems that switch between integrated and discrete graphics may not handle output in a manner that supports the device. Oculus Rift only supports [[x86-64|64-bit]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]] SP1 or later; Oculus VR stated that the device would initially support Windows only in order to focus on "delivering a high[-]quality consumer-level VR experience"; support for [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] will be developed in the future.<ref name="verge-requirements">{{cite web|title=Here's the high-end PC you'll need to run the Oculus Rift|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/15/8612027/oculus-rift-pc-recommended-specs|website=The Verge|date=15 May 2015 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="gamespot-requirements">{{cite web|title=Oculus Rift Minimum PC Spec Finalized|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-minimum-pc-spec-finalized/1100-6433566/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>

On October 6, 2016, Oculus VR announced lessened hardware recommendations, now suggesting an [[Skylake (microarchitecture)|Intel Core i3-6100]] or AMD [[FX 4350]] CPU, at least a GeForce GTX 960 or equivalent graphics card, two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port, and [[Windows 8]] or newer. The company stated that these lower requirements were enabled by the adoption of [[motion interpolation]]; on systems that cannot handle full 90&nbsp;frames per second rendering, the drivers will allow software to render at 45&nbsp;FPS instead, and generate frames based on differences between them to send to the headset to maintain its frame rate. Oculus promoted that these changes lowered the average hardware cost of a PC meeting these specifications to US$500 and would also enable certain laptops to run Oculus Rift.<ref name="ars-lowerspec">{{cite web|title=Oculus lowers minimum Rift specs using "asynchronous spacewarp" tech|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/oculus-lowers-minimum-rift-specs-using-asynchronous-spacewarp-tech/|website=Ars Technica|date=6 October 2016 |access-date=6 October 2016}}</ref><ref name="polygon-lowerrequirements">{{cite web|title=Oculus Rift has a new minimum spec, $499 entry-level PC|url=http://www.polygon.com/virtual-reality/2016/10/6/13189600/oculus-rift-minimum-spec|website=Polygon|date=6 October 2016 |access-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>

===Gaming===
{{main|List of Oculus Rift games}}
Oculus has stated that the Rift is primarily a gaming device and that their main content focus is gaming.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan Kedmey |url=http://time.com/3918081/oculus-rift-release-date-microsoft/ |title=Oculus Rift Headset Available Early 2016, Xbox Controller Included |publisher=Time.com |date=June 11, 2015 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

Existing games with a first-person or fixed-camera perspective can be ported to VR with some development effort. However, Oculus has stated that the best virtual reality experiences are those that are designed, from the beginning, for the Rift.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=addUnJpjjv4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/addUnJpjjv4| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Connect: Developing VR Experiences with the Oculus Rift |publisher=YouTube |date=October 29, 2014 |access-date=July 17, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

A number of [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]] have added Rift support (and can be played with the Development Kit 2), including ''[[Project CARS]]'', ''[[Elite: Dangerous]]'', ''[[Euro Truck Simulator 2]]'', and ''[[Dirt Rally]]'', as well as a number of [[indie games]] such as ''[[AaAaAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity]]'' and ''[[Ether One]]''. Fans and hobbyists have also modded support for the Rift into several popular titles which allow for extensive low-level [[modding]], including ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Flight Simulator X]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtbs3d.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=142&t=17489 |title=Meant to be Seen - View topic - Minecrift release archive |publisher=Mtbs3d.com |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyinside-fsx.com/ |title=FlyInside - Virtual Reality Flight Simulation |publisher=Flyinside-fsx.com |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>

===Non-gaming===

====Media====
Oculus is including ''Oculus Cinema'' as a free application, which allows the Rift to be used to view conventional movies and videos from inside a virtual cinema environment, giving the user the perception of viewing the content on a cinema-sized screen.<ref>{{cite web|last=Westaway |first=Luke |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/virtual-reality-and-the-silver-screen-a-match-made-in-heaven/ |title=Virtual reality and the silver screen: A match made in heaven |publisher=CNET |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Oculus Cinema'' will also have a networked mode, in which multiple users can watch the same video in the same virtual space, seeing each other as avatars and being able to interact and talk to one another while watching the video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/oculus-cinema-to-bring-online-multiplayer-experience-to-movie-watching-06395833/ |title=Oculus Cinema to bring 'online multiplayer' experience to movie watching |date=6 August 2015 |publisher=SlashGear |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

The Rift also offers the opportunity to view new types of media that are impossible to view on regular monitors; 360° 3D videos and 'virtual reality movies' (an entirely new medium).

Spherical videos (commonly called 360° videos) can be viewed simply by the user moving their head around, and the Rift opens up the possibility for stereoscopic spherical videos (commonly called 360° 3D videos). In September 2014, NextVR announced that they would be using a $200,000 camera rig to produce 360° 3D content for the Rift, including short films, as well as live streaming live events such as sports or concerts in 360° 3D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/nextvr-aims-to-transform-sports-entertainment-forever-05372279/ |title=NextVR aims to transform sports entertainment forever |date=5 March 2015 |publisher=SlashGear |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> In July 2015, Oculus announced a deal with Canadian film company Felix & Paul Studios to produce 360° 3D videos for the Rift.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/17/oculus-rift-joins-felix-and-paul-vr-film-studios |title=Oculus joins with VR filmmakers Felix & Paul (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=July 17, 2015 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

The Rift also supports a new medium of entertainment experiences, which Oculus calls "virtual reality movies". Oculus has established [[Oculus Story Studio]] to develop this type of content for the Rift, a team which has multiple former employees from major VFX companies such as [[PIXAR]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]]. [[Oculus Story Studio]] showed off its first VR movie, ''Lost'', at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]], gaining positive reviews from attendees.<ref>{{cite web|last=Volpe |first=Joseph |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/27/oculus-story-studio-is-the-pixar-of-virtual-reality/ |title=Oculus Story Studio is the Pixar of virtual reality |publisher=Engadget.com |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/117849907 |title=Introducing Oculus Story Studio on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dormehl |first=Luke |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3041482/fast-feed/oculus-debuts-pixar-quality-virtual-reality-short-at-sundance-film-festival |title=Oculus Debuts Pixar-Quality Virtual Reality Short At Sundance Film Festival &#124; Fast Company &#124; Business + Innovation |publisher=Fast Company |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

In May 2015, Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life, announced that they too were working on a new virtual world, codenamed ''Project Sansar'', built for virtual reality headsets such as the Rift and [[Gear VR]]. Like Second Life, Sansar will be hosted on Linden's servers and lease virtual land to players, on which they can build and sell virtual items and services (which Linden will take a cut of). Linden Lab hoped to release Sansar by the end of 2016.<ref name=X/>

====Industrial and professional====
As well as the consumer uses, the Rift has attracted significant interest from industry and professional spheres for productivity enhancement, visualization, and advertising.

A number of architecture firms have been experimenting with using the Rift for visualization and design. With the right software, the Rift allows architects to see exactly what their building will look like and get an understanding of the scale that is impossible on a traditional monitor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.willbereleased.com/event/oculus-rift/|title=Oculus Rift - Will be released|work=WillBeReleased.com|access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref>

==Reception==
The Oculus Rift received generally positive reviews. ''[[The Verge]]'' felt that the Rift was a "remarkably well-made and accessible device", describing its hardware design as having succeeded in "mak[ing] something so stereotypically geeky look (relatively) natural", and the headset itself as being "lighter and more comfortable than most of its competition" once properly fitted to the user's head. Its displays were considered to be "bright and relatively clear", albeit [[Screen-door effect|grainy]] in appearance. The Rift was panned for not offering its own [[motion controller]] at launch like the HTC Vive, and that the lack of support for room-scale experiences with a single camera led to games where VR support "[felt] like an addition, not a transformation". However, the reviewer felt that the Rift's launch titles marked the first time they had played any VR game that could "rival a decently made non-VR computer game for polish and scope", and the Vive and then-upcoming Oculus Touch controllers showed a bigger potential for VR than the largely stationary experiences the Rift offered at launch. It was argued that, while acknowledging the cost limitations of the headset and the necessary computing hardware, and its "relentless" focus on gaming, the Oculus Rift "makes a good case for seated VR, and it lays a solid foundation for what's to come.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=2016-03-28 |title=Oculus Rift review: Virtual reality is always almost here |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11284590/oculus-rift-vr-review |access-date=2023-05-31 |website=The Verge |language=en-US}}</ref>

In a post-launch review, ''[[PCMag]]'' felt that the Oculus Touch controllers, improved support for room-scale experiences, and a recent price cut to US$399 made the Rift "more appealing than the more expensive HTC Vive",  concluding that it "produces an immersive, crisp virtual reality experience that will continue to improve with the development of new software, which has been steadily coming out on both the Oculus store and SteamVR."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oculus Rift Review |url=https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/oculus-rift |access-date=2023-05-31 |website=PCMAG |language=en}}</ref>
