==Description==
The 2009 Director of the Intelligent Robotics Group Terry Fong stated in an [[interview]] that:

{{quote|IRG conducts applied research in a wide range of areas, including computer vision, geospatial data systems, [[humanâ€“robot interaction]], interactive 3-D visualization and robot software architecture. In 2009, we co-developed "[[Google Mars|Mars]] in [[Google Earth]]" and "[[Google Moon|Moon]] in Google Earth" with Google; we remotely operated one of our K10 planetary rovers to scout portions of Black Point Lava Flow (in Arizona); and we used our [[GigaPan]] robotic camera for science, education and journalism.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/robotics/careercorner/Terry_Fong.html interview with Terry Fong (David Hitt/NASA Educational Technology Services) 11.09.09] retrieved 18:37(UTC) 24.10.2011</ref>}}
