'''Multi-agent learning''' is the use of [[machine learning]] in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref>{{citation|last1=Albrecht|first1=Stefano|title=IJCAI-17 conference|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/ijcai17_tutorial/multiagent_learning.pdf|year=2017|contribution=Multiagent Learning: Foundations and Recent Trends. Tutorial|last2=Stone|first2=Peter}}</ref> Typically, agents improve their decisions via experience. In particular, an agent has to learn how to coordinate with the other agents.

== Overview ==
According to an article by Shoham et al. in 2007, it is difficult to pinpoint all relevant articles in the domain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shoham|first1=Yoav|last2=Powers|first2=Rob|last3=Grenager|first3=Trond|date=2007-05-01|title=If multi-agent learning is the answer, what is the question?|journal=Artificial Intelligence|series=Foundations of Multi-Agent Learning|volume=171|issue=7|pages=365–377|doi=10.1016/j.artint.2006.02.006|issn=0004-3702|url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4122247000000001156.pdf}}</ref> There are some inherent difficulties about multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hernandez-Leal|first1=Pablo|last2=Kartal|first2=Bilal|last3=Taylor|first3=Matthew E.|date=2019-11-01|title=A survey and critique of multiagent deep reinforcement learning|journal=Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems|language=en|volume=33|issue=6|pages=750–797|doi=10.1007/s10458-019-09421-1|issn=1573-7454|arxiv=1810.05587|s2cid=52981002}}</ref> The environment is not stationnary anymore, thus the [[Markov property]] is violated: transitions and rewards does not only depend on the current state of an agent.
