{{short description|Radio technology standard}}

'''Narrowband Internet of things''' ('''NB-IoT''') is a [[low-power wide-area network]] (LPWAN) [[radio technology]] standard developed by [[3GPP]] for cellular devices and services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsma.com/iot/narrow-band-internet-of-things-nb-iot/|title=NarrowBand – Internet of Things (NB-IoT)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/3GPP-Low-Power-Wide-Area-Technologies-GSMA-White-Paper.pdf|title=3GPP Low Power Wide Area Technologies - GSMA White Paper|last1=Grant<!--see document history, annex B-->|first1=Svetlana<!--see document history, annex B-->|date=September 1, 2016<!--see document history, annex B-->|website=gsma.com|publisher=[[GSMA]]|pages=49|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref> The specification was frozen in [[3GPP#Standards|3GPP Release 13]] ([[LTE Advanced Pro]]), in June 2016.<ref name="3GPP">{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1785-nb_iot_complete|title=Standardization of NB-IOT completed|date=June 22, 2016|website=3gpp.org|publisher=[[3GPP]]|pages=1|access-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Other 3GPP [[Internet of things|IoT]] technologies include [[eMTC]] (enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/extended-coverage-gsm-internet-of-things-ec-gsm-iot |title=Extended Coverage - GSM - Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT) |date=May 11, 2016 |website=gsma.com |publisher=[[GSMA]] |pages=1 |access-date=October 17, 2016 }}</ref> 

NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the [[LTE (telecommunication) | LTE]] standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It uses [[OFDM]] modulation for downlink communication and [[SC-FDMA]] for uplink communications.<ref name="sharetechnote.com">{{cite web |last1=Ryu|first1=Jaeku|title=NB-IoT Handbook|url=http://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_NB_LTE.html}}</ref><ref name="Computer World">{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Stephen |title=NarrowBand IoT standard for machines moves forward |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2984928/mobile-wireless/narrowband-iot-standard-for-machines-moves-forward.html |website=computerworld.com |publisher=[[Computerworld]] / [[International Data Group|IDG]] |pages=1 |date=September 21, 2015 |access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="LightReading">{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Dan |title=Ericsson, Intel, Nokia Back New Narrowband LTE IoT Spec |url=http://www.lightreading.com/mobile/4g-lte/ericsson-intel-nokia-back-new-narrowband-lte-iot-spec-/d/d-id/718162 |website=lightreading.com |publisher=[[Light Reading |LightReading]] |pages=1 |date=September 11, 2015 |access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="TelecomTV">{{cite web |title=3GPP agrees 'harmonized' proposal for narrowband IoT radio technology |url=http://www.telecomtv.com/articles/iot/3gpp-agrees-harmonized-proposal-for-narrowband-iot-radio-technology-12853/ |last1=Scales |first1=Ian |website=telecomtv.com |publisher=TelecomTV |pages=1 |date=September 18, 2015 |access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="PCWorld">{{cite web |title=LTE standard for Internet of Things machines gets the green light |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2985233/internet-of-things/lte-standard-for-machines-gets-the-green-light.html |last1=Lawson |first1=Stephen |via=pcworld.com |work=[[PC World|PCWorld]] / [[International Data Group|IDG]] |pages=1 |date=September 22, 2015 |access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> IoT applications which require more frequent communications will be better served by NB-IoT, which has no duty cycle limitations operating on the licensed spectrum.

In March 2019, the [[Global Mobile Suppliers Association]] (GSA) announced that over 100 operators had either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/global-narrowband-iot-lte-m-networks-march-2019/ Global Narrowband IoT – LTE-M networks – March 2019] (retrieved 27 March 2019)</ref> This number had risen to 142 deployed/launched networks by September 2019.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/nb-iot-and-lte-mtc-global-ecosystem-and-market-status/ NB-IoT and LTE-MTC Global Ecosystem and Market Status] (retrieved 15 October 2019)</ref>

== Devices and modules ==
The [[3GPP]]-compliant [[LPWA]] device ecosystem continues to grow. In April 2019, [[Global Mobile Suppliers Association|GSA]] identified 210 devices supporting either Cat-NB1/NB-2 or Cat-M1 – more than double the number in its GAMBoD database at the end of March 2018.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/iot-ecosystem-report-april19/ IoT Ecosystem: NB-IoT and LTE-M Report: April-19]</ref> This figure had risen a further 50% by September 2019, with a total of 303 devices identified as supporting either Cat-M1, Cat-NB1 (NB-IoT) or Cat-NB2. Of these, 230 devices support Cat-NB1 (including known variants) and 198 devices support Cat-M1 (including known variants). The split of devices (as of September 2019) was 60.4% modules, 25.4% asset trackers, and 5.6% routers, with data loggers, femtocells, smart-home devices, and smart watches, USB modems, and vehicle on-board units (OBUs), making up the balance.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/nb-iot-and-lte-mtc-global-ecosystem-and-market-status/ NB-IoT and LTE-MTC Global Ecosystem and Market Status] (retrieved 15 October 2019)</ref>

In 2018 first NB-IoT data loggers are other certified devices started to appear. For example ThingsLog released their first CE certified single channel NB-IoT data logger on Tindie in late 2018. 

To integrate NB-IoT into a maker board for IoT developments, SODAQ, a Dutch IoT hardware and software engineering company, crowdfunded an NB-IoT shield on [[Kickstarter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodaq/the-first-nb-iot-shield-for-arduino-supported-by-t|title=The first NB-IoT shield for Arduino: supported by T-Mobile|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref> They then went on to partner with module manufacturer [[u-blox]] to create maker boards with NB-IoT and [[LTE-M]] integrated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shop.sodaq.com/sodaq-sara-aff-r410m.html |title=SODAQ SARA AFF R410M|publisher=SODAQ|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>
