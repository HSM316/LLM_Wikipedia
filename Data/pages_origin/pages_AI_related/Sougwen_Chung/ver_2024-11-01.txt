An example of their work is the 2017 "Drawing Operations Unit." It is an exploration into how machine learning might be applied to the drawing style of the artist's hand. The robotic arm's behavior is generated from neural nets trained on the artist's drawing gestures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiartists.org/sougwen-chung|title=Sougwen Chung – Artist Profile (Photos, Videos, Exhibitions)|website=AIArtists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> In a sense, the robotic arm has learned from the visual style of the artist's previous drawings and outputs a machine interpretation during the human/robot drawing duet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nips4creativity.com/art/sougwen-chung/|title=Sougwen Chung – Art Gallery|website=nips4creativity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>

The acquisition of ''MEMORY'' comprises a fine art print, a film documenting the artist's process, and a [[Recurrent neural network|Recurrent Neural Network]] (RNN) model contained within a 3D printed sculpture.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-14 |title=The Algorithmic Gesture: Sougwen Chung's MEMORY • V&A Blog |url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/digital/the-algorithmic-gesture-sougwen-chungs-memory |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=V&A Blog |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2023, as part of Bulgari's '<nowiki/>''Serpenti: 75 Years of Infinite Tales''' exhibition in Milan, Chung showcased ''LIFE / LINES,'' a multimedia sculpture crafted from real-time motion-capture data and rendered in large-scale 3D printed chrome, evoking the appearance of liquid mercury.<ref>{{Citation |title=Serpenti Factory Milan: Bulgari x Sougwen Chung | date=25 October 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqQ4yaTuC1g |access-date=2024-02-26 |language=en}}</ref>
