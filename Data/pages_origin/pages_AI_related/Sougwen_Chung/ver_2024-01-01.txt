Chung's work has been shown at galleries and museums across the world, including [[EMMA – Espoo Museum of Modern Art|EMMA]] in Espoo, Finland, [[MAMCO]] in Geneva, Switzerland, [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] in Canada, and Istanbul's [[Akbank Sanat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akbanksanat.com/en/exhibition/yokyerler|title=NonSpaces |publisher=[[Akbank Sanat]]|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Chung has spoken globally at conferences including [[Tribeca Film Festival]], New York; The Hospital Club, London; [[MUTEK]] Festival, Montreal & Mexico City; [[Sónar]] +D, Barcelona; The Art Directors Club, New York; Stockholm; [[SXSW]], Austin; Tokyo; Internet Dargana, Barcelona: FITC; New York; OFFF, Barcelona; [[Gray Area Festival]], San Francisco; and [[SIGGRAPH]], Vancouver.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tfiny.org/events/detail/tfi_interactive|title=TFI Interactive|website=Tribeca Film Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grayareafestival.io/bio/sougwen-chung/|title=Sougwen Chung|website=The Gray Area Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/events/event_IAP18268|title=Schedule |website=SXSW Schedule 2014|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

Sougwen Chung's work has also been featured in multiple international press outlets including ''The New Yorker'', ''Art F City'', Artnet, Artsy, ''Dazed and Confused'', The Creators Project, MASHABLE, ''EXIT'' Magazine, Engadget, ''Business Insider'', ''Fast Company'' and ''USA Today''.<ref name="coolhunting" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10733/1/sougwen-chung|title=Sougwen Chung|last=Dazed|date=2011-06-30|website=Dazed|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/robotic-arm-draws-by-mimicking-an-artists-movements-2015-7|title=This robotic arm draws almost as well as a human artist — because it sort of is one|last=Saini|first=Shivam|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

An example of their work is the 2017 "Drawing Operations Unit." It is an exploration into how machine learning might be applied to the drawing style of the artist's hand. The robotic arm's behavior is generated from neural nets trained on the artist's drawing gestures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiartists.org/sougwen-chung|title=Sougwen Chung – Artist Profile (Photos, Videos, Exhibitions)|website=AIArtists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> In a sense, the robotic arm has learned from the visual style of the artist's previous drawings and outputs a machine interpretation during the human/robot drawing duet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nips4creativity.com/art/sougwen-chung/|title=Sougwen Chung – Art Gallery|website=nips4creativity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>

Chung is a former researcher at MIT's Media Lab and an inaugural member of NEW INC, the first museum-led technology and art in collaboration with [[New Museum|The New Museum]].<ref name="coolhunting" /> According to the World Science Festival 2018, they are an Artist-In-Residence at [[Bell Labs]] exploring new forms of drawing in virtual reality, with biometrics, machine learning, and robotics.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sougwen Chung |language=en-US |publisher=World Science Festival |url=https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/participants/sougwen-chung/ |access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>

In 2019 Chung presented a talk at TED@BCG Mumbai titled "Why I draw with robots".<ref name="TED Conferences, LLC">{{cite web |title=Why I draw with robots |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/sougwen_chung_why_i_draw_with_robots#t-15227 |website=TED Conferences, LLC |access-date=2 October 2021}}</ref>

In 2022, Chung's work ''MEMORY (Drawing Operations Unit Generation 2)'' was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The acquisition of ''MEMORY'' comprises a fine art print, a film documenting the artist's process, and a [[Recurrent neural network|Recurrent Neural Network]] (RNN) model contained within a 3D printed sculpture.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-14 |title=The Algorithmic Gesture: Sougwen Chung's MEMORY • V&A Blog |url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/digital/the-algorithmic-gesture-sougwen-chungs-memory |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=V&A Blog |language=en-US}}</ref>
