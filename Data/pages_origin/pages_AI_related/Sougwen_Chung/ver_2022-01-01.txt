==Early life==
Chung grew up in Toronto, Canada, and Hong Kong (where her parents are from). Her father, an opera singer, made sure that his children had experience with musical instruments at a very young age, and Chung grew up playing violin and piano. She moved to the States as a teenager and received her BFA from [[Indiana University]] before obtaining her Masters Diploma in Interactive Art from [[Hyper Island]] in Sweden.<ref name="coolhunting">{{cite web|last1=Shin|first1=Nara|title=Charged: Sougwen Chung|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/interview-sougwen-chung|website=Cool Hunting|accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref>

Chung is a former researcher at MIT's Media Lab and an inaugural member of [http://www.newinc.org/ NEW INC], the first museum-led technology and art in collaboration with [[New Museum|The New Museum]].<ref name="coolhunting" /> According to the World Science Festival 2018, she is an Artist-In-Residence at Bell Labs exploring new forms of drawing in virtual reality, with biometrics, machine learning, and robotics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/participants/sougwen-chung/|title=Sougwen Chung {{!}} World Science Festival|work=World Science Festival|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref>

An example of her work is the 2017 "Drawing Operations Unit." It is an exploration into how machine learning might be applied to the drawing style of the artist's hand. The robotic arm's behavior is generated from neural nets trained on the artist's drawing gestures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiartists.org/sougwen-chung|title=Sougwen Chung – Artist Profile (Photos, Videos, Exhibitions)|website=AIArtists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> In a sense, the robotic arm has learned from the visual style of the artist's previous drawings and outputs a machine interpretation during the human/robot drawing duet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nips4creativity.com/art/sougwen-chung/|title=Sougwen Chung – Art Gallery|website=nips4creativity.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>
