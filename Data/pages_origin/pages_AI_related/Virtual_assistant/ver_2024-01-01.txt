A '''virtual assistant''' ('''VA''') is a [[software agent]] that can perform a range of tasks or services for a user based on user input such as commands or questions, including verbal ones. Such technologies often incorporate [[chatbot]] capabilities to simulate human conversation, such as via [[online chat]], to facilitate interaction with their users. The interaction may be via text, graphical interface, or voice - as some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices.

In many cases users can ask their virtual assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars - all with verbal commands.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02763869.2018.1404391|pmid = 29327988|title = Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and More: An Introduction to Voice Assistants|journal = Medical Reference Services Quarterly|volume = 37|issue = 1|pages = 81–88|year = 2018|last1 = Hoy|first1 = Matthew B.|s2cid = 30809087}}</ref> In recent years, prominent virtual assistants for direct consumer use have included [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Siri]], [[Amazon Alexa]], [[Google Assistant]], and [[Samsung]]'s [[Bixby (software)|Bixby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.androidauthority.com/siri-vs-alexa-vs-google-assistant-vs-bixby-3192996/|title=Siri vs Alexa vs Google Assistant vs Bixby: Which one reigns supreme?|website=Android Authority}}</ref> Also, companies in various industries often incorporate some kind of virtual assistant technology into their customer service or support.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/the-magic-of-virtual-assistants-and-their-impact-on-customer-service/ | title=The Magic of Virtual Assistants and Their Impact on Customer Service }}</ref>

==History==
===Experimental decades: 1910s–1980s===
[[Radio Rex]] was the first voice activated toy, patented in 1916<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |number= 1209636 |title= Sound-Operated Circuit Controller |invent1 = Christian Berger |assign1= Submarine Wireless Company |gdate= 1916-12-19 }}</ref> and released in 1922.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Markowitz|first=Judith|title=Toys That Have a Voice|url=https://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=30031|website=SpeechTechMag }}</ref> It was a wooden toy in the shape of a dog that would come out of its house when its name is called.

In 1952, [[Bell Labs]] presented "Audrey", the Automatic Digit Recognition machine. It occupied a six- foot-high relay rack, consumed substantial power, had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum-tube circuitry. It could recognize the fundamental units of speech, phonemes. It was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers. It could therefore be used for voice dialing, but in most cases push-button dialing was cheaper and faster, rather than speaking the consecutive digits.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The machines that learned to listen|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170214-the-machines-that-learned-to-listen|last=Moskvitch |first=Katia |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>

Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the [[IBM Shoebox]] voice-activated calculator, presented to the general public during the [[1962 Seattle World's Fair]] after its initial market launch in 1961. This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first [[IBM Personal Computer]] in 1981, was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9.

The first [[natural language processing]] computer program or the chatbot [[ELIZA]] was developed by MIT professor [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] in the 1960s. It was created to "demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=J|last2=Klinkenberg|first2=W. D|date=1 May 2001|title=From Eliza to Internet: a brief history of computerized assessment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563201000048|journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1016/S0747-5632(01)00004-8|issn=0747-5632}}</ref> ELIZA used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation, which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program.

Weizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: "I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weizenbaum|first=Joseph|url=http://archive.org/details/computerpowerhum0000weiz|title=Computer power and human reason : from judgment to calculation|date=1976|publisher=San Francisco : W. H. Freeman|others=Oliver Wendell Holmes Library Phillips Academy}}</ref>

This gave name to the [[ELIZA effect]], the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors; that is, anthropomorphisation, a phenomenon present in human interactions with virtual assistants.

The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania with substantial support of the [[United States Department of Defense]] and its [[DARPA]] agency, funded five years of a Speech Understanding Research program, aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of 1,000 words. Companies and academia including IBM, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Stanford Research Institute took part in the program.

The result was "Harpy", it mastered about 1000 words, the vocabulary of a three-year-old and it could understand sentences. It could process speech that followed pre-programmed vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together, and thus reducing speech recognition errors.

In 1986 Tangora was an upgrade of the Shoebox, it was a voice recognizing typewriter. Named after the world's fastest typist at the time, it had a vocabulary of 20,000 words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past. IBM's approach was based on a [[hidden Markov model]], which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques. The method makes it possible to predict the most likely [[phoneme]]s to follow a given phoneme. Still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice, and pause between each word.

===Birth of smart virtual assistants: 1990s–2010s===
{{See also|Weak artificial intelligence|Speech recognition}}
In the 1990s, digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with [[IBM]], [[Philips]] and [[Lernout & Hauspie]] fighting for customers. Much later the market launch of the first [[smartphone]] [[IBM Simon]] in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In 1997, Dragon's [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking|Naturally Speaking]] software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of 100 words per minute. A version of Naturally Speaking is still available for download and it is still used today, for instance, by many doctors in the US and the UK to document their medical records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In 2001 [[Colloquis]] publicly launched  [[SmarterChild]], on platforms like [[AIM (software)|AIM]] and [[MSN Messenger]]. While entirely text-based SmarterChild was able to play games, check the weather, look up facts, and converse with users to an extent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Smartphone: your new personal assistant – Orange Pop|url=https://pop.orange.com/en/a1436/smartphone-personal-assistant-mobile/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710211123/https://pop.orange.com/en/a1436/smartphone-personal-assistant-mobile/|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 July 2017|date=10 July 2017|access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>

The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was [[Siri]], which was introduced as a feature of the [[iPhone 4S]] on 4 October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=iPhone 4S hands-on!|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-hands-on/|first=Darren|last=Murph|date=4 October 2011|publisher=Engadget.com|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.]] developed Siri following the 2010 acquisition of [[Siri Inc.]], a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[SRI International]], which is a research institute financed by [[DARPA]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]].<ref name="spracherkennung12">{{cite news|date=20 April 2012|title=Feature: Von IBM Shoebox bis Siri: 50 Jahre Spracherkennung – WELT|language=de|trans-title=From IBM Shoebox to Siri: 50 years of speech recognition|newspaper=Die Welt|publisher=Welt.de|url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/computer_nt/article106206488/Von-IBM-Shoebox-bis-Siri-50-Jahre-Spracherkennung.html|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> Its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message, making phone calls, checking the weather or setting up an alarm. Over time, it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations, search the internet, and provide driving directions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In November 2014, Amazon announced Alexa alongside the Echo.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kundu |first=Kishalaya |date=2023 |title=Amazon expands Echo lineup with new smart speaker, earbuds, and more |url=https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-echo-pop-show-buds/ |access-date=26 May 2023 |website=XDA}}</ref>

In April 2017 Amazon released a service for building [[conversational interfaces]] for any type of virtual assistant or interface.

===Artificial intelligence and language models: 2020s-present===
{{See also|History of artificial intelligence|Generative pre-trained transformer|Natural language generation|Language model}}
In the 2020s, artificial intelligence (AI) systems like [[ChatGPT]] have gained popularity for their ability to generate human-like responses to text-based conversations. In February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which was then the "largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters."<ref name="Wired_Sterling_20200213">{{Cite magazine| issn = 1059-1028| last = Sterling| first = Bruce| title = Web Semantics: Microsoft Project Turing introduces Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG)| magazine = Wired| access-date = July 31, 2020| date = February 13, 2020| url = https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2020/02/web-semantics-microsoft-project-turing-introduces-turing-natural-language-generation-t-nlg/}}</ref> On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was launched as a prototype and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. The advent of ChatGPT and its introduction to the wider public increased interest and competition in the space. In February 2023, Google began introducing an experimental service called "Bard" which is based on its [[LaMDA]] program to generate text responses to questions asked based on information gathered from the [[World Wide Web|web]].

While ChatGPT and other generalized chatbots based on the latest [[generative AI]] are capable of performing various tasks associated with virtual assistants, there are also more specialized forms of such technology that are designed to target more specific situations or needs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/gpt4-takes-the-world-by-storm-list-of-companies-that-integrated-the-chatbot-11679293885004.html | title=GPT-4 takes the world by storm - List of companies that integrated the chatbot | date=21 March 2023 }}</ref><ref name="rd.com"/>

==Method of interaction==
[[File:Amazon Echo Dot (27716286638).jpg|thumb|[[Amazon Echo Dot]] [[smart speaker]] running the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] virtual assistant]]
Virtual assistants work via:

* Text, including: [[online chat]] (especially in an [[instant messaging]] application or other application ), [[SMS|SMS text]], [[Email|e-mail]] or other text-based communication channel, for example [[Conversica]]'s intelligent virtual assistants for business.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-10-30|title=Conversica Raises $31 Million in Series C Funding to Fuel Expansion of Conversational AI for Business |website=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-10-30/conversica-raises-31-million-in-series-c-funding-to-fuel-expansion-of-conversational-ai-for-business|access-date=2020-10-23}}</ref>
* Voice: for example with [[Amazon Alexa]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-extends-alexas-reach-into-wearables-11569440641|title=Amazon Extends Alexa's Reach Into Wearables|last=Herrera|first=Sebastian|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=26 September 2019|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> on [[Amazon Echo]] devices, [[Siri]] on an [[iPhone]], [[Google Assistant]] on Google-enabled [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, or [[Bixby (software)|Bixby]] on Samsung devices.
* Images: some assistants, such as Google Assistant (which includes [[Google Lens]]) and Bixby on the [[Samsung Galaxy]] series, have the added capability of performing [[image processing]] to recognize objects in images.

Many virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods, offering versatility in how users can interact with them, whether through chat, voice commands, or other integrated technologies.

Virtual assistants use [[natural language processing]] (NLP) to match user text or voice input to executable commands. Some continually learn using [[artificial intelligence]] techniques including [[machine learning]] and [[ambient intelligence]]. 

To activate a virtual assistant using the voice, a wake word might be used. This is a word or groups of words such as "Hey Siri", "OK Google" or "Hey Google", "Alexa", and "Hey Microsoft".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gputechconf2017.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=112905|title=S7617 – Developing Your Own Wake Word Engine Just Like 'Alexa' and 'OK Google'|publisher=GPU Technology Conference|access-date=17 July 2017}}</ref> As virtual assistants become more popular, there are increasing legal risks involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2019-03-01|title=Digital Market Perfection|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/550|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=117|issue=5|pages=815|doi=10.36644/mlr.117.5.digital|s2cid=86402702|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{rp|815}}

Amazon enables Alexa "Skills" and Google "Actions", essentially applications that run on the assistant platforms.

==Virtual assistant privacy==
{{Main|Virtual assistant privacy}}
Virtual assistants have a [[Virtual assistant privacy|variety of privacy concerns]] associated with them. Features such as activation by voice pose a threat, as such features requires the device to always be listening.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1145/3133956.3134052| chapter=DolphinAttack| title=Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security - CCS '17| pages=103–117| year=2017| last1=Zhang| first1=Guoming| last2=Yan| first2=Chen| last3=Ji| first3=Xiaoyu| last4=Zhang| first4=Tianchen| last5=Zhang| first5=Taimin| last6=Xu| first6=Wenyuan|author6-link=Wenyuan Xu| isbn=9781450349468| arxiv=1708.09537| s2cid=2419970}}</ref> Modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint = 1712.03327|last1 = Lei|first1 = Xinyu|title = The Insecurity of Home Digital Voice Assistants – Amazon Alexa as a Case Study|last2 = Tu|first2 = Guan-Hua|last3 = Liu|first3 = Alex X.|last4 = Li|first4 = Chi-Yu|last5 = Xie|first5 = Tian|class = cs.CR|year = 2017}}</ref>

== Privacy policy of prominent virtual assistants ==
=== Google Assistant ===
The privacy policy of Google Assistant states that it does not store the audio data without the user's permission, but may store the conversation transcripts to personalise its experience. Personalisation can be turned off in settings. If a user wants Google Assistant to store audio data, they can go to Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) and turn on this feature. Audio files are sent to the cloud and used by Google to improve the performance of Google Assistant, but only if the VAA feature is turned on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/assistant/doing-more-protect-your-privacy-assistant/|title=Doing more to protect your privacy with the Assistant|date=23 September 2019|website=Google|language=en|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

=== Amazon's Alexa ===
The privacy policy of Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, states that it only listens to conversations when its wake word (like Alexa, Amazon, Echo) is used. It starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word, and stops recording after 8 seconds of silence. It sends the recorded conversation to the cloud. It is possible to delete the recording from the cloud by visiting 'Alexa Privacy' in 'Alexa'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alexa, Echo Devices, and Your Privacy |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V |website=Amazon.com |access-date=27 February 2020 }}</ref>

=== Apple's Siri ===
Apple states that it does not record audio to improve Siri. Instead, it uses transcripts. Transcript data is only sent if it is deemed important for analysis. Users can opt out anytime if they don't want Siri to send the transcripts in the cloud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2019/08/improving-siris-privacy-protections/|title=Improving Siri's privacy protections|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-IN|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

== Presumed and observed interest for the consumer ==

=== Presumed added value as allowing a new way of interactions ===
Added value of the virtual assistants can come among others from the following:

* Voice communication can sometimes represent the optimal [[Human-computer interaction|man-machine communication]]:

# It is convenient: there are some sectors where voice is the only way of possible communication, and more generally, it allows to free-up both hands and vision potentially for doing another activity in parallel, or helps also disabled people.
# It is faster: Voice is more efficient than writing on a keyboard: we can speak up to 200 [[words per minute]] opposed to 60 in case of writing on a keyboard. It is also more natural thus requiring less effort (reading a text however can reach 700 words per minute).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Minker|first1=W.|last2=Néel|first2=F.|date=2002|title=Développement des technologies vocales|journal=Le Travail Humain|volume=65|issue=3|pages=261|doi=10.3917/th.653.0261|issn=0041-1868|doi-access=free}}</ref>

* Virtual assistants save a lot of time by automation: they can take appointments, or read the news while the consumer does something else. It is also possible to ask the virtual assistant to schedule meetings, hence helping to organize time. The designers of new digital schedulers explained the ambition they had that these calendars schedule lives to make the consumer use his time more efficiently, through machine learning processes, and complete organization of work time and free time.  As an example when the consumer expresses the desire of scheduling a break, the VA will schedule it at an optimal moment for this purpose (for example at a time of the week where they are less productive), with the additional long-term objective of being able to schedule and organize the free time of the consumer, to assure them optimal work efficiency.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Digital Architecture of time Management|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|journal=Science, Technology, & Human Values|year=2019|volume=44|issue=2|pages=315–337|doi=10.1177/0162243918795041|s2cid=149648777|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89406/1/Wajcman_Digital-architecture-of-time-management_Accepted.pdf}}</ref>

=== Perceived interest ===
[[File:Study results.jpg|thumb|Graphical sum up of the study capturing reasons of interest of virtual assistants for consumers]]

*According to a recent study (2019), the two reasons for using virtual assistants for consumers are perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. The first result of this study is that both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have an equivalent very strong influence for the consumer willingness to use a virtual assistant.
* The second result of this study is that:

== Controversies ==

=== Artificial intelligence controversies ===

* Virtual assistants spur the [[filter bubble]]: As for [[social media]], virtual assistants' algorithms are trained to show pertinent data and discard others based on previous activities of the consumer: The pertinent data is the one which will interest or please the consumer. As a result, they become isolated from data that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them into their own intellectual bubble, and reinforcing their opinions. This phenomenon was known to reinforce [[fake news]] and [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tisseron|first=Serge|date=2019|title=La famille sous écoute|journal=L'École des Parents|volume=n° 632|issue=3|pages=16|doi=10.3917/epar.632.0016|s2cid=199344092|issn=0424-2238}}</ref>
* Virtual assistants are also sometimes criticized for being overrated. In particular, [[Antonio Casilli|A. Casilli]] points out that the AI of virtual assistants are neither intelligent nor artificial for two reasons:

# Not intelligent because all they do is being the assistant of the human, and only by doing tasks that a human could do easily, and in a very limited specter of actions: find, class, and present information, offers or documents. Also, virtual assistants are neither able to make decisions on their own nor to anticipate things.
# And not artificial because they would be impossible without human labelization through [[Microwork|micro working]].<ref name="Casilli, Antonio A. 2019">{{Cite book|last=Casilli, Antonio A.|title=En attendant les robots. Enquête sur le travail du clic.|date=2019|publisher=Editions Seuil|isbn=978-2-02-140188-2|oclc=1083583353}}</ref>

=== Ethics implications ===
In 2019 [[Antonio Casilli|Antonio A. Casilli]], a French [[sociologist]], criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way:

At a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant, often without knowing it, is ethically disturbing.

But at a second level, it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these [[Artificial intelligence|AIs]] are trained with this data.

This [[artificial intelligence]] is trained via [[Artificial neural networks|neural networks]], which require a huge amount of [[Labeled data|labelled data.]] However, this data needs to be labelled through a human process, which explains the rise of [[microwork]] in the last decade. That is, remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents, such as listening to virtual assistant speech data, and writing down what was said. Microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes, and for the total lack of regulation: The average salary was 1,38 <abbr>dollar/hour</abbr> in 2010,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Horton|first1=John Joseph|last2=Chilton|first2=Lydia B.|title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM conference on Electronic commerce |chapter=The labor economics of paid crowdsourcing |date=2010|series=EC '10|pages=209–218|location=New York, New York, USA|publisher=ACM Press|doi=10.1145/1807342.1807376|arxiv=1001.0627|isbn=978-1-60558-822-3|s2cid=18237602}}</ref> and it provides neither healthcare nor retirement benefits, [[sick pay]], [[minimum wage]]. Hence, virtual assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity, and the AIs they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers.<ref name="Casilli, Antonio A. 2019"/>

Privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form, and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner.<ref name="Fortune 2019">{{cite web | title=Apple, Google, and Amazon May Have Violated Your Privacy by Reviewing Digital Assistant Commands | website=Fortune | date=2019-08-05 | url=https://fortune.com/2019/08/05/google-apple-amazon-digital-assistants/ | access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref> Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech, a user's manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin.<ref name="KrögerLutz2020">{{cite book|last1=Kröger|first1=Jacob Leon|last2=Lutz|first2=Otto Hans-Martin|last3=Raschke|first3=Philip|title=Privacy and Identity Management.

==Developer platforms==
Notable developer platforms for virtual assistants include:

* [[Amazon Lex]] was opened to developers in April 2017. It involves [[natural language understanding]] technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/amazon-lex-the-technology-behind-alexa-opens-up-to-developers/ |title=Amazon Lex, the technology behind Alexa, opens up to developers |publisher=TechCrunch |date=20 April 2017 |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>
* Google provides the [[Actions on Google]] and [[Dialogflow]] platforms for developers to create "Actions" for Google Assistant<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/actions/ |title=Actions on Google &#124; Google Developers |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>
* Apple provides SiriKit for developers to create extensions for [[Siri]]
* [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (computer)|Watson]], while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire [[artificial intelligence]] platform and community powering some virtual assistants, [[chatbots]]. and many other types of solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/ |title=Watson – Stories of how AI and Watson are transforming business and our world |publisher=Ibm.com |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Memeti|first1=Suejb|last2=Pllana|first2=Sabri|title=PAPA: A parallel programming assistant powered by IBM Watson cognitive computing technology|journal=Journal of Computational Science|volume=26|pages=275–284|date=January 2018|doi=10.1016/j.jocs.2018.01.001}}</ref>

===Previous generations===
In previous generations of text chat-based virtual assistants, the assistant was often represented by an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] (a.k.a. ''interactive online character'' or ''automated character'') — this was known as an [[embodied agent]].

==Economic relevance==

=== For individuals ===
Digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends. Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status-weight comparable to 'real' experiences, if not become more sought-after and prized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trendwatching.com/trends/5-trends-for-2017/ |title=5 Consumer Trends for 2017 |publisher=TrendWatching |date=31 October 2016 |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants. In mid-2017, the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/5621/users-of-virtual-digital-assistants/ |title=Chart: Digital Assistants – Always at Your Service |first=Felix |last=Richter |publisher=Statista |date=26 August 2016 |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> In addition, it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications, but present across many industry sectors (incl. [[automotive]], telecommunications, [[retail]], healthcare and education).<ref name="wordpress1">{{cite web|url=https://gminsights.wordpress.com/tag/virtual-assistant-industry-statistics/ |title=Virtual Assistant Industry Statistics |publisher=Global Market Insights |date=30 January 2017 |access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref>
In response to the significant R&D expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices, the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a [[CAGR]] of 34.9% globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of US$7.5 billion by 2024.<ref name="wordpress1"/> According to an [[Ovum Ltd.|Ovum]] study, the "native digital assistant installed base" is projected to exceed the world's population by 2021, with 7.5 billion active voice AI–capable devices.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/virtual-digital-assistants-to-overtake-world-population-by-2021|title=Virtual digital assistants to overtake world population by 2021|website=ovum.informa.com|language=en|access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref> According to Ovum, by that time "Google Assistant will dominate the voice AI–capable device market with 23.3% market share, followed by Samsung's Bixby (14.5%), Apple's Siri (13.1%), Amazon's Alexa (3.9%), and Microsoft's Cortana (2.3%)."<ref name=":2" />

Taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders, North American companies (e.g. [[Nuance Communications]], [[IBM]], [[eGain]]) are expected to dominate the industry over the next years, due to the significant impact of BYOD ([[Bring Your Own Device]]) and enterprise mobility business models. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smartphone-assisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) industry growth. Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market, the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, with its main players located in India and China is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40% (above global average) over the 2016–2024 period.<ref name="wordpress1" />

=== Economic opportunity for enterprises ===
Virtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals, as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises. As an example, a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge. And which can organize meetings, check inventories, verify informations. Virtual assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle-sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of [[Internet of things|Internet of Things (IoT)]]. Indeed, IoT technologies are first perceived by small and medium-sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance, but too complicated, risky or costly to be used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nory B.|last2=Graham|first2=C. Matt|date=February 2018|title=Can the IoT Help Small Businesses?|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society|volume=38|issue=1–2|pages=3–12|doi=10.1177/0270467620902365|s2cid=214031256|issn=0270-4676}}</ref>

== Security ==
In May 2018, researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text, thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/alexa-siri-hidden-command-audio-attacks.html|title=Alexa and Siri Can Hear This Hidden Command. You Can't.|date=10 May 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 May 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The researchers made small changes to audio files, which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect. These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers, open websites or even transfer money.<ref name=":1" /> The possibility of this has been known since 2016,<ref name=":1" /> and affects devices from Apple, Amazon and Google.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/security-researchers-warn-of-voice-vulnerabilities/|title=As voice assistants go mainstream, researchers warn of vulnerabilities|date=10 May 2018|work=CNET|access-date=11 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>

In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording, another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands: An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to, for example, unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user's knowledge. Although some IVAs provide a voice-training feature to prevent such impersonation, it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices. Thus, a malicious person who is able to access an IVA-enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=H.|last2=Iorga|first2=M.|last3=Voas|first3=J.|last4=Lee|first4=S.|date=2017|title=Alexa, Can I Trust You?|journal=Computer|volume=50|issue=9|pages=100–104|doi=10.1109/MC.2017.3571053|issn=0018-9162|pmc=5714311|pmid=29213147}}</ref>
