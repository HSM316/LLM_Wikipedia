An '''intelligent virtual assistant''' ('''IVA''') or '''intelligent personal assistant''' ('''IPA''') is a [[software agent]] that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions. Sometimes the term "[[chatbot]]" is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by [[online chat]]. In some cases, online chat programs are exclusively for entertainment purposes. Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal (spoken?) commands.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02763869.2018.1404391|pmid = 29327988|title = Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and More: An Introduction to Voice Assistants|journal = Medical Reference Services Quarterly|volume = 37|issue = 1|pages = 81–88|year = 2018|last1 = Hoy|first1 = Matthew B.}}</ref>

As of 2017, the capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly, with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and [[voice user interface]]s. Apple and Google have large installed bases of users on [[smartphone]]s. Microsoft has a large installed base of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computers]], smartphones and [[smart speakers]]. Amazon has a large install base for smart speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/30/alexa-how-big-is-amazons-echo.aspx|title= Alexa, How Big Is Amazon's Echo? |website=[[The Motley Fool]]|date=2017-01-30|author= Daniel B.

==History==
Radio Rex was the first voice activated toy released in 1911.<ref>https://www.cnet.com/news/google-finding-its-voice/</ref>

Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the [[IBM Shoebox]], presented to the general public during the [[1962 Seattle World's Fair]] after its initial market launch in 1961. This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first [[IBM Personal Computer]] in 1981, was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9. The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] with substantial support of the [[United States Department of Defense]] and its [[DARPA]] agency. Their tool "Harpy" mastered about 1000 words, the vocabulary of a three-year-old. About ten years later the same group of scientists developed a system that could analyze not only individual words but entire word sequences enabled by a [[Hidden Markov Model]].<ref name="spracherkennung1">{{cite news|author= |language=German |url=https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/computer_nt/article106206488/Von-IBM-Shoebox-bis-Siri-50-Jahre-Spracherkennung.html |title=Feature: Von IBM Shoebox bis Siri: 50 Jahre Spracherkennung - WELT |trans-title=From IBM Shoebox to Siri: 50 years of speech recognition |publisher=Welt.de |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2017-12-10|newspaper=Die Welt }}</ref> Thus, the earliest virtual assistants, which applied speech recognition software were [[automated attendant]] and medical [[digital dictation]] software.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zwass |first=Vladimir |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/speech-recognition |title=speech recognition &#124; technology |publisher=Britannica.com |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref> In the 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the [[personal computer]] with [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Philips]] and [[Lernout & Hauspie]] fighting for customers. Much later the market launch of the first [[smartphone]] [[IBM Simon]] in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pop.orange.com/en/a1436/smartphone-personal-assistant-mobile/ |title=Smartphone: your new personal assistant - Orange Pop |publisher=Pop.orange.com |date=2016-02-23 |accessdate=2017-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710211123/https://pop.orange.com/en/a1436/smartphone-personal-assistant-mobile/ |archive-date=2017-07-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was [[Siri]], which was introduced as a feature of the [[iPhone 4S]] on October 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-hands-on/ |author=Darren Murph |date=2011-10-04 |title=iPhone 4S hands-on! |publisher=Engadget.com |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.]] developed Siri following the 2010 acquisition of [[Siri Inc.]], a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[SRI International]], which is a research institute financed by [[DARPA]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]].<ref name="spracherkennung1"/>

==Method of interaction==
Virtual assistants make work via:

* Text, including: [[online chat]] (especially in an [[instant messaging]] app or other app), [[SMS|SMS Text]], [[Email|e-mail]] or other text-based communication channel, for example [[Conversica]]'s Intelligent Virtual Assistants for business.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-10-30/conversica-raises-31-million-in-series-c-funding-to-fuel-expansion-of-conversational-ai-for-business</ref>
* Voice, for example with [[Amazon Alexa]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-extends-alexas-reach-into-wearables-11569440641|title=Amazon Extends Alexa's Reach Into Wearables|last=Herrera|first=Sebastian|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> on the [[Amazon Echo]] device, [[Siri]] on an [[iPhone]], or [[Google Assistant]] on Google-enabled/[[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile devices
* By taking and/or uploading images, as in the case of [[Samsung]] [[Bixby (virtual assistant)|Bixby]] on the [[Samsung Galaxy S8]]

Some virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods, such as [[Google Assistant]] via chat on the [[Google Allo]] and Google Messages app and via voice on [[Google Home]] [[smart speaker]]s.

Virtual assistants use [[natural language processing]] (NLP) to match user text or voice input to executable commands. Many continually learn using [[artificial intelligence]] techniques including [[machine learning]].

To activate a virtual assistant using the voice, a wake word might be used. This is a word or groups of words such as "Hey Siri", "OK Google" or "Hey Google", "Alexa", and "Hey Microsoft".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gputechconf2017.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=112905|title=S7617 - Developing Your Own Wake Word Engine Just Like 'Alexa' and 'OK Google'|publisher=GPU Technology Conference|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Devices and objects where found==
Virtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or, like [[Amazon Alexa]], across several of them:

* Into devices like [[smart speakers]] such as [[Amazon Echo]], [[Google Home]] and [[Apple HomePod]]
* In [[instant messaging]] apps on both smartphones and via the Web, e.g. [[Facebook]]'s [[M (virtual assistant)]] on both [[Facebook]] and [[Facebook Messenger]] apps or via the Web

==Economic relevance==
Digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends. Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status-weight comparable to ‘real’ experiences, if not become more sought-after and prized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trendwatching.com/trends/5-trends-for-2017/ |title=5 Consumer Trends for 2017 |publisher=TrendWatching |date=2016-10-31 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref> The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants. In mid-2017, the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/5621/users-of-virtual-digital-assistants/ |title=Chart: Digital Assistants - Always at Your Service |author=Felix Richter |publisher=Statista |date=2016-08-26 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref> In addition, it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications, but present across many industry sectors (incl. [[automotive]], telecommunications, [[retail]], healthcare and education).<ref name="wordpress1">{{cite web|author= |url=https://gminsights.wordpress.com/tag/virtual-assistant-industry-statistics/ |title=Virtual Assistant Industry Statistics « Global Market Insights, Inc |publisher=Gminsights.wordpress.com |date=2017-01-30 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref>
In response to the significant R&D expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices, the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a [[CAGR]] of 34.9% globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of US$7.5 billion by 2024.<ref name="wordpress1"/> According to an [[Ovum Ltd.|Ovum]] study, the "native digital assistant installed base" is projected to exceed the world's population by 2021, with 7.5 billion active voice AI–capable devices.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/virtual-digital-assistants-to-overtake-world-population-by-2021|title=Virtual digital assistants to overtake world population by 2021|website=ovum.informa.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref> According to Ovum, by that time "Google Assistant will dominate the voice AI–capable device market with 23.3% market share, followed by Samsung's Bixby (14.5%), Apple's Siri (13.1%), Amazon's Alexa (3.9%), and Microsoft's Cortana (2.3%)."<ref name=":2" />

Taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders, North American companies (e.g. [[Nuance Communications]], [[IBM]], [[eGain]]) are expected to dominate the industry over the next years, due to the significant impact of BYOD ([[Bring Your Own Device]]) and enterprise mobility business models. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smartphone-assisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) industry growth. Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market, the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, with its main players located in [[India]] and [[China]] is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40% (above global average) over the 2016-2024 period.<ref name="wordpress1" />

In May 2018, researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text, thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/alexa-siri-hidden-command-audio-attacks.html|title=Alexa and Siri Can Hear This Hidden Command. You Can't.|date=2018-05-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The researchers made small changes to audio files, which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect. These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers, open websites or even transfer money.<ref name=":1" /> The possibility of this has been known since 2016,<ref name=":1" /> and affects devices from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/security-researchers-warn-of-voice-vulnerabilities/|title=As voice assistants go mainstream, researchers warn of vulnerabilities|date=2018-05-10|work=CNET|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}</ref>

In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording, another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands: An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to, for example, unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user's knowledge. Although some IVAs provide a voice-training feature to prevent such impersonation, it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices. Thus, a malicious person who is able to access an IVA-enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that he or she is the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=H.|last2=Iorga|first2=M.|last3=Voas|first3=J.|last4=Lee|first4=S.|date=2017|title=Alexa, Can I Trust You?|journal=Computer|volume=50|issue=9|pages=100–104|doi=10.1109/MC.2017.3571053|issn=0018-9162|pmc=5714311|pmid=29213147}}</ref>
