'''OpenIO''' has been founded in 2015 by Laurent Denel ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) and six co-founders, to offer an [[object storage]] solution for building hyper-[[Scalability|scalable]] [[IT infrastructure]]s for a wide range of applications.<ref name="openio.io">{{Cite news|url=https://www.openio.io/product/product-overview|title=OpenIO Object Storage Overview|last=|first=|date=|work=OpenIO Official Website|access-date=2019-09-10|language=en}}</ref> OpenIO leverages [[Open-source software|open source software]], developed since 2006, which is based on a [[Grid computing|grid technology]] that enables dynamic behaviors and supports heterogenous hardware.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/15/the_history_boys_cas_and_object_storage_map/|title=The History Boys: Object storage ... from the beginning|last=|first=|date=|work=The Register|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}</ref> In October 2017 OpenIO completed a $5 million funding round.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/openio-raises-5-million-to-build-your-own-amazon-s3-on-any-storage-device/|title=OpenIO raises $5 million to build your own Amazon S3 on any storage device|last=Dillet|first=Romain|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref>  In October 2019, OpenIO announced that it had crossed the [[terabit per second]] barrier by benchmarking an infrastructure provided by [[Criteo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openio.io/press-releases/tbps-challenge_en-pr|title=OpenIO To Lead In Big Data Storage, After Achieving Ultra-High Performance|website=OpenIO Object Storage|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>

==Product==
OpenIO is a [[Software-defined storage|software-defined]] [[object storage]] solution that supports [[Amazon S3|S3]] and can be deployed [[On-premises software|on-premises]], [[Cloud computing|cloud-hosted]] or at the [[Edge computing|edge]], on any hardware mix. It has been designed from the beginning for performance and cost-efficiency at any scale<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/02/openio_object_storage_upstart/|title=Openio's objective is opening up object storage space|last=|first=|date=|work=The Register|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}</ref>, and it has been optimized for [[Big data|Big Data]], [[High Performance Computing|HPC]] and [[Artificial intelligence|AI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openio.io/|title=OpenIO {{!}} High Performance Object Storage for Big Data and AI|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenIO Official Website|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> 

OpenIO stores objects within in a flat structure within a massively distributed directory with [[Indirection (computing)|indirections]], this allows the data query path to be independent of the number of nodes and the performance not to be affected by the growth of the capacity. Servers are organized as a grid of nodes massively [[Distributed computing|distributed]], where each node takes part in directory and storage services, which ensures that there is no [[single point of failure]] and that new nodes are automatically discovered and immediately available without the need to rebalance data.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://docs.openio.io/latest/source/arch-design/sds_concepts.html|title=OpenIO Core Concepts|website=OpenIO Documentation|url-status=live|access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref> 

The software is built on top of ''ConsciousGrid'', a technology that ensures optimal data placement based on real-time metrics and allows the addition or removal of storage devices with automatic performance and [[Load balancing (computing)|load impact optimization]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.openio.io/resources/openio-overview|title=OpenIO Object Storage for Big Data|last=|first=|date=|work=OpenIO Official Website|access-date=2019-09-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://staging-openio.kinsta.cloud/blog/sds-a-storage-system-with-a-conscience|title=Why We Designed an Object Store with a Conscience|last=|first=|date=2017-07-18|website=OpenIO Blog|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> For data protection OpenIO has synchronous and asynchronous [[Replication (computing)|replication]] with multiple copies, and an [[erasure coding]] implementation based on [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon]] that can be deployed in one data center or geo-distributed or stretched [[Computer cluster|clusters]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.openio.io/latest/source/arch-design/data_management.html|title=OpenIO Data Management Features|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenIO Documentation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.openio.io/latest/source/arch-design/storage_policies.html|title=OpenIO Storage Policies|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenIO Documentation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>

The software has a ''GridForApps'' feature that catches all events that occur in the cluster and can pass them up in the [[Hardware stack|stack]] or to applications running on OpenIO nodes. This enables [[Event-driven architecture|event-driven]] computing directly into the storage infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.openio.io/blog/product/simple-metadata-indexing-through-grid-for-apps|title=Simple Metadata Indexing through Grid for Apps|last=|first=|date=|work=OpenIO Blog|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.openio.io/blog/product/detect-patterns-in-pictures-at-scale-using-tensorflow-and-openio-grid-for-apps|title=Detect patterns in pictures at scale using Tensorflow and OpenIO GridForApps|last=|first=|date=|work=OpenIO Blog|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}</ref> 

OpenIO has native object [[Application programming interface|APIs]] and [[Software development kit|SDKs]] for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], it integrates a [[HTTP]] [[REST API|REST/API]] and has strong compatibility with the [[Amazon S3]] API and the [[OpenStack Swift]] API.<ref name=":0" /> The company also offers a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[File system|File System]] connector to access data stored in an OpenIO object store through file access methods: it is based on [[Fuse ESB|Fuse]] and presents a [[POSIX]] File System which can be shared over local networks via [[Network File System|NFS]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]] and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.openio.io/latest/source/arch-design/fs_overview.html|title=OpenIO File System Connector (OIO-FS) Architecture|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenIO Documentation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>

== Performance ==
OpenIO claims to have reached '''1.372 Tbps write speed (171 GB/s)''' on a cluster of 350 physical machines<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2019/10/15/openio-high-performance-object-storage/|title=OpenIO 'solves' the problem with object storage hyperscalability – Blocks and Files|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The benchmark scenario, conducted under production conditions with standard hardware (commodity servers with 7200 rpm [[Hard disk drive|HDDs]]), consisted in backing up a 38 [[Petabyte|PB]] [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] [[Data lake|datalake]] via the DistCp command<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openio.io/tbps-challenge|title=Terabit Challenge {{!}} OpenIO Object Storage|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.
