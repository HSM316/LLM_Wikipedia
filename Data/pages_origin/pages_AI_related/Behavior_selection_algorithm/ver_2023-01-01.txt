{{Short description|Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents}}
In [[artificial intelligence]], a '''behavior selection algorithm''',<ref>[http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter04_Behavior_Selection_Algorithms.pdf Behavior Selection Algorithms: An Overview]</ref> or '''[[action selection]] algorithm''', is an algorithm that selects appropriate behaviors or actions for one or more [[intelligent agent]]s. In [[artificial intelligence (video games)|game artificial intelligence]], it selects behaviors or actions for one or more [[non-player character]]s. Common behavior selection algorithms include:

*[[Finite-state machine]]s
**[[Hierarchical finite-state machine]]s
*[[Decision tree]]s
*[[Behavior tree (artificial intelligence, robotics and control)|Behavior tree]]s
*[[Hierarchical task network]]s
*[[Hierarchical control system]]s
*[[Utility system (artificial intelligence)|Utility system]]s
*[[Dialogue tree]] (for selecting what to say)

In [[Application software|application]] programming, run-time selection of the behavior of a specific method is referred to as the [[strategy design pattern]].
