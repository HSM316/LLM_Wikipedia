Later in 2019, the two released another collaboration, "[[High Fashion (song)|High Fashion]]"

== Background ==
Roddy Ricch revealed in an interview that the song was composed in late 2018, but Mustard wanted to keep it for his album, ''[[Perfect Ten (album)|Perfect Ten]]'', which he was still working on.<ref name="bittersweet">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-12-05/roddy-ricch-nipsey-hussle-grammys-2020-racks-in-the-middle|title=For Nipsey Hussle friend Roddy Ricch, Grammy recognition is bittersweet|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=December 5, 2019|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref> The song was later included on the album, released in June 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/05/22/mustard-perfect-ten-release-date|title=Mustard confirms Perfect Ten details|last=Renshaw|first=David|date=May 22, 2019|work=[[The Fader]]|accessdate=December 29, 2019}}</ref> Ricch said he knew the song was "hard enough" the first time he heard it, while Mustard proclaimed "this is going to be the one".<ref name="bittersweet" />

== Composition and lyrics ==
"Ballin{{' "}} has a "[[rags to riches]]" theme. In its intro, the song samples girl group [[702 (group)|702]]'s 1997 top ten hit "[[Get It Together (702 song)|Get It Together]]".<ref name="PicthforkBest" />

The song features a "smooth, bouncy beat", with Roddy Ricch rapping about his come-up and ascent in the music industry.<ref name="Lyrics">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/lyrics/8530814/mustard-ballin-lyrics-roddy-ricch|title=Here Are the Lyrics to Mustard's 'Ballin',' Feat. Roddy Ricch|last=Mamo|first=Heran|date=September 23, 2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref>

In the first verse, Ricch salutes fellow Los Angeles rapper, the late [[Nipsey Hussle]] and his girlfriend [[Lauren London]]: "I run these racks up with my queen like London and Nip". The line simultaneously references Ricch and Hussle's collaboration "[[Racks in the Middle]]", released earlier in 2019 as Hussle's last single before his death.<ref name="Lyrics" /> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Heran Mamo noted that "in typical Hussle fashion", Roddy Ricch "narrates his life's hardships before delving into his newfound treasures".<ref name="Lyrics" />

== Critical reception ==
The song was widely acclaimed by music critics. Charles Holmes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called it "a song of the year contender",<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/roddy-ricch-gunna-start-with-me-903781/|title=The Ricch Get Riccher on Roddy Ricch and Gunna's 'Start Wit Me'|last=Holmes|first=Charles|date=October 31, 2019|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' both named it as a "standout track" on the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/10/mustard-new-video-ballin-feat-roddy-ricch|title=Watch Mustard and Roddy Ricch Live Out Their Dreams in "Ballin'" Video|last=Tigg|first=Fnr|date=October 2, 2019|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8531973/mustard-roddy-ricch-ballin-video|title=Mustard & Roddy Ricch Inspire Kids to Chase Their Dreams in Luxe 'Ballin' Video|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=October 2, 2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' magazine included "Ballin{{' "}} in its list of The Best Rap Songs of 2019 and called it "the centerpiece of Mustard's underappreciated album ''[[Perfect Ten (album)|Perfect Ten]]''".<ref name="PicthforkBest">{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/best-rap-songs-2019/|title=The Best Rap Songs of 2019|date=December 12, 2019|work=[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=December 13, 2019}}</ref> ''Complex'' later named it the Best Song of 2019, calling it "a feel-good anthem so infectious you'll need antibiotics just to stop running it back".<ref name="ComplexBest" />
