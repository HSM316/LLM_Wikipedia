==Production==
''A Very Fatal Murder'' satirizes popular true crime podcasts such as ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'', ''[[S-Town]]'', and ''[[My Favorite Murder]]''. According to head writer Katy Yeiser, the podcast is not meant as a take down of any particular podcast, but rather an ode to the genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/04/05/599765354/true-crime-fake-homicide-the-onions-a-very-fatal-murder-podcast |title=True Crime, Fake Homicide: The Onion's 'A Very Fatal Murder' Podcast |last= Cornish|first=Audie |date= 5 April 2018|website= npr.org|publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=17 December 2018 |quote=}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
The podcast follows fictional investigative reporter David Pascall (voiced by David Sidorov) in search of the perfect murder to create an award-winning podcast about. He is assisted by ETHL (the Extremely Timely Homicide Locator), an MIT-created computer programmed to find "the most interesting, violent, culturally relevant murder cases in America".<ref name= Guardian>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/20/could-a-very-fatal-kill-off-the-true-crime-podcast |title=
