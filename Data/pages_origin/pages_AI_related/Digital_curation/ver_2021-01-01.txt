== Word History ==
Much like the word ''archive'' has layered meanings and uses, the word ''curation'' is both a noun and a verb used originally in the field of [[museology]] to represent a wide range of activities, most often associated with collection care, long-term preservation, and exhibition design.  ''Curation'' can be a reference to physical repositories that store cultural heritage or natural resource collections (e.g., a curatorial repository) or a representation of varied policies and processes involved with the long-term care and management of heritage collections, digital archives, and research data (e.g, curatorial/collections management plans, curation life-cycle, and data curation). Yet ''curation'' is also associated with short-term objectives and processes of selection and interpretation for the purposes of presentation, such as for gallery exhibitions and websites, which contribute to knowledge creation.  It has also been applied to interaction with [[social media]] including compiling digital images, web links and movie files.  

The term ''curation'' entered the legal framework through federal historic preservation laws, starting with the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|National Historic Preservation Act]] of 1966,<ref>United States. 1993. ''National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended''. Washington, DC: Produced by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in conjunction with the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, and the National Park Service.</ref> and was further defined and coded into federal regulations through 36 CFR Part 79: ''Curation of Federally-owned and Administered Archaeological Collections.''<ref>United States. 1990. ''36 CFR Part 79: Curation of Federally-owned and Administered Archaeological Collections''. Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Park Service.</ref> ''Curation'' has since permeated into an array of disciplines but remains closely tied to heritage and information management. 

== Core Principles and Activities ==
The term “digital curation” was first used in the [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[Biology|biological science]] fields as a means of differentiating the additional suite of activities ordinarily employed by library and museum curators to add value to their collections and enable its reuse<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Dallas|first=Costis|date=2016-12-01|title=Digital curation beyond the "wild frontier": a pragmatic approach|journal=Archival Science|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=421–457|doi=10.1007/s10502-015-9252-6|issn=1389-0166}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18590|title=Preparing the Workforce for Digital Curation|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2015-04-22|isbn=9780309296946|language=en|doi=10.17226/18590|pmid=25950079}}</ref><ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last=Beagrie|first=Neil|title=Digital Curation for Science, Digital Libraries, and Individuals|journal=International Journal of Digital Curation|language=en-US|volume=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.2218/ijdc.v1i1.2|year=2008|doi-access=free}}</ref> from the smaller subtask of simply preserving the data, a significantly more concise archival task.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, the historical understanding of the term “[[curator]]” demands more than simple care of the collection. A [[curator]] is expected to command academic mastery of the subject matter as a requisite part of appraisal and selection of assets and any subsequent adding of value to the collection through application of metadata.<ref name=":0" />

=== Principles ===
There are five commonly accepted principles that govern the occupation of digital curation:
* Manage the complete birth-to-retirement life cycle of the digital asset.<ref name=":3" />
* Evaluate and cull assets for inclusion in the collection.<ref name=":3" />
* Apply preservation methods to strengthen the asset’s integrity and reusability for future users.<ref name=":3" />
* Act proactively throughout the asset life cycle to add value to both the digital asset and the collection.<ref name=":3" />
* Facilitate the appropriate degree of access to users.<ref name=":3" />

===Methodology===
The [[Digital Curation Centre|Digital Curation Center]] offers the following step-by-step life cycle procedures for putting the above principles into practice:<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/69/48|title=The DCC Curation Lifecycle Model|website=www.dcc.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>

Sequential Actions:

* Conceptualize: Consider what digital material you will be creating and develop storage options. Take into account websites, publications, email, among other types of digital output.<ref name=":4" />
* Create: Produce digital material and attach all relevant [[metadata]], typically the more metadata the more accessible the information.<ref name=":4" />
*[[Archival appraisal|Appraise]] and select: Consult the mission statement of the institution or private collection and determine what digital data is relevant. There may also be legal guidelines in place that will guide the decision process for a particular collection.
*Ingest: Send digital material to the predetermined storage solution. This may be an archive, repository or other facility.<ref name=":4" />
*Preservation action: Employ measures to maintain the integrity of the digital material.<ref name=":4" />
*Store: Secure data within the predetermined storage facility.<ref name=":4" />
* Access, use and reuse: Determine the level of accessibility for the range of digital material created. Some material may be accessible only by password and other material may be freely accessible to the public.<ref name=":4" /> Routinely check that material is still accessible for the intended audience and that the material has not been compromised through multiple uses.<ref name=":4" />
* Transform: If desirable or necessary the material may be transferred into a different digital format.<ref name=":4" />

Occasional Actions:

* Dispose: Discard any digital material that is not deemed necessary to the institution.<ref name=":4" />
*Reappraise: Reevaluate material to ensure that is it still relevant and is true to its original form.<ref name=":4" />
*Migrate:Migrate data to another format in order to protect data for using better in the future.<ref name=":4" />

== Related terms ==
The term "digital curation" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms such as "[[digital preservation]]" and "[[digital archiving]]". While digital preservation does focus a significant degree of energy on optimizing reusability, preservation remains a subtask to the concept of digital archiving, which is in turn a subtask of digital curation.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":22"/>  For example, archiving is a part of curation, but so are subsequent tasks such as themed collection-building, which is not considered an archival task. Similarly, preservation is a part of archiving, as are the tasks of selection and [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]] that are not necessarily part of preservation.<ref name=":22" />

[[Data curation]] is another term that is often used interchangeably with digital curation, however common usage of the two terms differs. While “[[data]]” is a more all-encompassing term that can be used generally to indicate anything recorded in binary form, the term “data curation” is most common in scientific parlance and usually refers to accumulating and managing information relative to the process of research.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Big data, little data, no data : scholarship in the networked world|last=1951-|first=Borgman, Christine L.|isbn=9780262327862|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=900409008}}</ref> Data-driven research of education request the role of information professional gradually develop tradition of digital service to data curation particularly at the management of digital research data.<ref>Data Curation Research and Education, Journal of Web Librarianship, 6:4, 305-320,DOI: 10.1080/19322909.2012.730358</ref> So, while documents and other discrete [[digital asset]]s are technically a subset of the broader concept of data,<ref name=":0" /> in the context of scientific vernacular digital curation represents a broader purview of responsibilities than data curation due to its interest in preserving and adding value to digital assets of any kind.<ref name=":1" />

== Challenges ==

=== Rate of creation of new data and data sets ===
The ever lowering cost, and increasing prevalence of entirely new categories of technology has led to a quickly growing flow of new data sets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Joyce|date=2009|title=Sharks, digital curation, and the education of information professionals|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=24 |issue=4|pages=357–368|doi=10.1080/09647770903314720}}</ref> These come from well established sources such as business and government, but the trend is also driven by new styles of sensors becoming embedded in more areas of modern life.<ref name=":1" /> This is particularly true of consumers, whose production of digital assets is no longer relegated strictly to work. Consumers now create wider ranges of digital assets, including videos, photos, location data, purchases, and fitness tracking data, just to name a few, and share them in wider ranges of social platforms.<ref name=":1" />

Additionally, the advance of technology has introduced new ways of working with data. Some examples of this are international partnerships that leverage astronomical data to create “virtual observatories”, and similar partnerships have also leveraged data resulting from research at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] and the database of protein structures at the [[Protein Data Bank]].<ref name=":22"/>

=== Storage format evolution and obsolescence ===
By comparison, archiving of analog assets is notably passive in nature, often limited to simply ensuring a suitable storage environment. Digital preservation requires a more proactive approach.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Sarah|title=Digital Curation: The Emergence of a New Discipline|journal=International Journal of Digital Curation|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=2|pages=78–88|doi=10.2218/ijdc.v6i2.191|year=2011|url=http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/184|doi-access=free}}</ref> Today’s artifacts of cultural significance are notably transient in nature and prone to obsolescence when social trends or dependent technologies change.<ref name=":1" /> This rapid progression of technology occasionally makes it necessary to migrate digital asset holdings from one file format to another in order to mitigate the dangers of hardware and software obsolescence which would render the asset unusable.<ref name=":4" />

=== Underestimation of human labor costs ===
Modern tools for program planning often underestimate the amount of human labor costs required for adequate digital curation of large collections. As a result cost-benefit assessments often paint an inaccurate picture of both the amount of work involved, and the true cost to the institution for both successful outcomes and failures.<ref name=":1" />

The concept of cost in business field would be more obvious. Varieties of business systems are running for daily operations. For example, human resources systems deal with recruitment and payroll, communication systems manage internal and external email, and administration systems handle finance, marketing and other aspects.  However, business systems in institutions are not designed for long-term information preservation initially.<ref name=":2">Katuu, Shadrack. (2012). Enterprise Content Management and Digital Curation Applications Maturity Model Connections.</ref> In some instances, business systems are revised to become Digital Curation systems for preserving transaction information due to cost consideration. The example of business systems are Enterprise Content Management (ECM) applications, which are used by designated group people such as business executives, customers for information management that support key processes organizationally. In the long run, to transfer digital content from ECM applications to Digital Curation (DC) applications would be a trend in large organizations domestically or internationally.  The improvement of maturity models of ECM and DC may add value to information that request cost deduction and extensive use for further modification.<ref name=":2" />

=== Standardization and coordination between institutions ===
An absence of coordination across different sectors of society and industry in areas such as the standardization of [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] definitions,<ref name="ijdcpw2007112">{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdc.net/./ijdc/article/view/43/50|title=Digital Preservation Theory and Application: Transcontinental Persistent Archives Testbed Activity|author=Paul Watry|date=November 2007|publisher=The International Journal of Digital Curation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315030030/http://www.ijdc.net/ijdc/article/view/43/50|archive-date=2008-03-15|url-status=dead|access-date=2008-04-01}}</ref> and in forming partnerships for proper stewardship of assets has resulted in a lack of interoperability between institutions, and a partial breakdown in digital curation practice from the standpoint of the ordinary user.<ref name=":1" /> The example of coordination is Open Archival Information System (OAIS).

OAIS Reference Model allows professionals and many other organizations and individuals to contribute efforts to the OAIS open forums for developing international standards of archival information in long-term access.<ref>A Lee, Christopher. (2011). Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model. 10.1201/b11499-56.</ref>

=== Digitization of analog materials ===
The curation of digital objects is not limited to strictly born-digital assets. Many institutions have engaged in monumental efforts to digitize analog holdings in an effort to increase access to their collections. Examples of these materials are books, photographs, maps, audio recordings, and more.<ref name=":1" /> The process of converting printed resources into digital collections has been epitomized to some degree by librarians and related specialists. For example, The [[Digital Curation Centre]] is claimed to be a "world leading centre of expertise in digital information curation"<ref name="Digital Curation Centre2">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about-us|title=About the DCC|last=Digital Curation Centre|work=Website|publisher=Digital Curation Centre|access-date=6 March 2013}}</ref> that assists higher education research institutions in such conversions.

=== New representational formats ===
For some topics, knowledge is embodied in forms that have not been conducive to print, such as how choreography of dance or of the motion of skilled workers or artisans is difficult to encode. New digital approaches such as 3D [[hologram]]s and other computer-programmed expressions are developing.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

For mathematics, it seems possible for a new common language to be developed that would express mathematical ideas in ways that can be digitally stored, linked, and made accessible. The [[Global Digital Mathematics Library]] is a project to define and develop such a language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/18619/chapter/4|title=Read "Developing a 21st Century Global Library for Mathematics Research" at NAP.edu|language=en|doi=10.17226/18619|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-29848-3|last1=Sciences|first1=Committee on Planning A.

=== Accessibility ===
The ability of the intended user community to access the repository’s holdings is of equal importance to all the preceding curatorial tasks. This must take into account not only the user community’s format and communication preferences, but also a consideration of communities that should not have access for various legal or privacy reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lavoie|first=Brian|last2=OCLC|title=The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model: Introductory Guide (2nd Edition)|url=http://www.dpconline.org/component/docman/doc_download/1359-dpctw14-02|doi=10.7207/twr14-02|year=2014|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Access can be increased by providing information about [[open access]] status with [[open data]] and [[open source]] methods such as the [[OAI-PMH]] endpoints of an [[open archive]], which are then aggregated by databases and search engines like [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]], [[COnnecting REpositories|CORE]] and [[Unpaywall]] for academic papers.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Kerry|last1=Dhakal|title=Unpaywall|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|date=15 April 2019|volume=107|issue=2|pmc=6466485|doi=10.5195/jmla.2019.650}}</ref>

===Responses to challenges===
* Specialized research institutions<ref>[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/ Digital Curation Centre]</ref><ref>[http://www.dpconline.org/ Digital Preservation Coalition]</ref>

There are three elements for essential needs of institutions dealing with issues of digital curation: Leadership, Resources, and Collaboration. Three elements related to the role of advance-guards for librarians and archivists working with open approaches to technology, standardized process and scholarly communication. The archivist with leadership, who needs to be a dynamic and active role to embrace technology, standardized process, and scholarly communication. In addition, Archivist leader might adopt the business concept and methods to deal with their workflow such as raise funds, invest technology system, and comply with industry standards, in order to obtain more resources. Collaboration in archives and digital curation community could provide and share training, technologies, standards and tools to help institutions on challengeable issues of digital curation. Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), the Open Preservation Foundation or novel partnerships offer collaboration opportunity to institutions facing similar challenges in digital curation issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/02/21/we-must-fight-to-preserve-digital-information|title=We must fight to preserve digital information|date=2019-02-21|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-05-01|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

* Academic courses

Information field especially in libraries, archives, and museums significantly need to bring knowledge of new technologies. Traditional graduate school education is not enough to meet that demand; training program for current staffs in cultural repository would be an efficient supplement for that request, such as professional workshops, and MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) in data curation and management.<ref>Helen R. Tibbo(2015) Digital Curation Education and Training: From Digitization to Graduate Curricula to MOOCs,International Journal of Digital Curation    Archives/ VOL 10 NO 1(2015)/Articles, DOI: <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.352</nowiki></ref>

The International Journal of Digital Curation (IJDC) is administered by IJDC Editorial Board including the Editor-in-Chief, Digital Curation Center (DCC), and the following members.  IJDC dedicate to provide scholarly platform for sharing, discussing, and improving knowledge and information of digital curation within the worldwide community. IJDC has two types of submission under editorial guidelines, which are peer-reviewed papers and general articles base on original research, the field information and relevant events in digital curation. IJDC is published by the University of Edinburgh for the Digital Curation Centre in electronic form on a rolling basis two times a year. The open access to the public supports knowledge exchangeable in digital curation worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijdc.net/|title=International Journal of Digital Curation|website=www.ijdc.net|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>

==Approaches==
Many approaches to digital curation exist, and have evolved over time in response to the changing technological landscape. Two examples of this are sheer curation<ref name=":0" /> and channelization{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

''Sheer curation'' is an approach to digital curation where curation activities are quietly integrated into the normal work flow of those creating and managing data and other digital assets. The word sheer is used to emphasize the lightweight and virtually transparent nature of these curation activities. The term ''sheer curation'' was coined by Alistair Miles in the ImageStore project,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/The_ImageStore_Project |title=The ImageStore Project - ImageWeb<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519051047/http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/The_ImageStore_Project |archive-date=2009-05-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the UK Digital Curation Centre's SCARP project.<ref>[http://www.dcc.ac.uk/scarp/ Digital Curation Centre: DCC SCARP Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The approach depends on curators having close contact or 'immersion' in data creators' working practices. An example is the case study of a neuroimaging research group by Whyte et al., which explored ways of building its digital curation capacity around the apprenticeship style of learning of neuroimaging researchers, through which they share access to datasets and re-use experimental procedures.<ref>Whyte, A., Job, D., Giles, S. and Lawrie, S. (2008) '[http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/74/53 Meeting Curation Challenges in a Neuroimaging Group]', The International Journal of Digital Curation Issue 1, Volume 3, 2008</ref>

Sheer curation depends on the hypothesis that good data and digital asset management at the point of creation and primary use is also good practice in preparation for sharing, publication and/or [[long-term preservation]] of these assets. Therefore, sheer curation attempts to identify and promote tools and good practices in local data and digital asset management in specific domains, where those tools and practices add immediate value to the creators and primary users of those assets. Curation can best be supported by identifying existing practices of sharing, stewardship and re-use that add value, and augmenting them in ways that both have short-term benefits, and in the longer term reduce risks to digital assets or provide new opportunities to sustain their long-term accessibility and re-use value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The aim of sheer curation is to establish a solid foundation for other curation activities which may not directly benefit the creators and primary users of digital assets, especially those required to ensure long-term preservation. By providing this foundation, further curation activities may be carried out by specialists at appropriate institutional and organisation levels, whilst causing the minimum of interference to others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A similar idea is ''curation at source'' used in the context of Laboratory Information Management Systems [[Laboratory information management system|LIMS]]. This refers more specifically to automatic recording of metadata or information about data at the point of capture, and has been developed to apply semantic web techniques to integrate laboratory instrumentation and documentation systems.<ref>Frey, J. [http://www.allhands.org.uk/2008/programme/jeremyfrey.cfm 'Sharing and Collaboration' keynote presentation at UK e-Science All Hands Meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820055827/http://www.allhands.org.uk/2008/programme/jeremyfrey.cfm |date=2008-08-20 }}, 8–11 September 2008, Edinburgh</ref> Sheer curation and curation-at-source can be contrasted with post hoc [[digital preservation]], where a project is initiated to preserve a collection of digital assets that have already been created and are beyond the period of their primary use.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

''Channelization'' is curation of digital assets on the web, often by brands and media companies, into continuous flows of content, turning the user experience from a lean-forward interactive medium, to a lean-back passive medium. The curation of content can be done by an independent third party, that selects media from any number of on-demand outlets from across the globe and adds them to a playlist to offer a digital "channel" dedicated to certain subjects, themes, or interests so that the end user would see and/or hear a continuous stream of content.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
