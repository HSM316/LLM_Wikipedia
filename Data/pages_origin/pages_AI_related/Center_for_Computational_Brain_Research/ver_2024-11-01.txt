The '''Center for Computational Brain Research (CCBR)''' is an Interdisciplinarity [[research]] centre located at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]], [[Chennai]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jan/08/decoding-the-human-brain-1557331.html |author=SV Krishna Chaitanya|title=Decoding the human brain|website=The New Indian Express |date=8 January 2017|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref> CCBR was set up in 2015 with funding from the  co-founder of [[Infosys]], [[Kris Gopalakrishnan]]. The stated objective of the center is "to explore the interface between Neuroscience and Engineering disciplines".{{cn|date=March 2023}}

==Research activities==
The two broad areas of research at the center are:
:to exploit engineering tools for analysing the structure and activity of neural circuits
:advancing machine intelligence with brain-inspired hardware and software architecture.

The center has three chairs with an endowment of {{INR}}100&nbsp;million each. These chairs are currently{{when|date=March 2023}} held by distinguished [[Indian American]] professors [[Partha Mitra]] ([[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/partha-mitra/|title=Partha Mitra|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> [[Mriganka Sur]] ([[MIT]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://surlab.mit.edu/mriganka/|title=Welcome to the Laboratory of Mriganka Sur |publisher=MIT|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> and Anand Raghunathan ([[Purdue University]]).<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/purdue-professor-in-india-is-part-of-team-unraveling-how-the-brain-works,-with-applications-to-computing.html|title=Purdue professor in India is part of team unraveling how the brain works, with applications to computing - Purdue University|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=11 January 2019}}<br>- {{cite web|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/~araghu/|publisher=Purdue University|title=Anand Raghunathan's webpage|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>
