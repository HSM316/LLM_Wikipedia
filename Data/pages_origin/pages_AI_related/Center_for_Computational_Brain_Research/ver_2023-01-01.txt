The '''Center for Computational Brain Research (CCBR)''' is an Interdisciplinarity [[research]] centre located at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]], [[Chennai]], [[India]].<ref name="newindianexpress">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jan/08/decoding-the-human-brain-1557331.html|title=Decoding the human brain|website=The New Indian Express|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> CCBR was set up in 2015 with funding from [[Infosys]] co-founder [[Kris Gopalakrishnan]]. The stated objective of the center is "to explore the interface between Neuroscience and Engineering disciplines".<ref name="iitmadras">{{cite web|url=https://ccbr.iitmadras.in/project|author=Yash Murty|title=CCBR {{pipe}} Home|website=ccbr.iitmadras.in|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref name="indiatimes">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Workshop-on-neuroscience-for-engineers-to-be-held-at-IIT-Madras/articleshow/50397280.cms|title=Workshop on neuroscience for engineers to be held at IIT-Madras|website=Times of India|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref>

==Research activities==
The two broad areas of research at the centre are (1) to exploit engineering tools for analysing the structure and activity of neural circuits
and (2) advancing machine intelligence with brain-inspired hardware and software architecture. The center has 3 chairs with an endowment of 100&nbsp;million ({{INR}}10&nbsp;crore) each. These chairs are currently held by distinguished [[Indian American]] professors, viz., [[Partha Mitra]] ([[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|CSHL]]),<ref name="cshl">{{cite web|url=https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/partha-mitra/|title=Partha Mitra - Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|website=cshl.edu|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> [[Mriganka Sur]] ([[MIT]])<ref name="mit">{{cite web|url=http://surlab.mit.edu/mriganka/|title=Sur Lab â€“ Laboratory of Mriganka Sur|website=surlab.mit.edu|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> and Anand Raghunathan ([[Purdue University]]).<ref name="purdue">{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/purdue-professor-in-india-is-part-of-team-unraveling-how-the-brain-works,-with-applications-to-computing.html|title=Purdue professor in India is part of team unraveling how the brain works, with applications to computing - Purdue University|website=purdue.edu|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref name="purdue2">{{cite web|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/~araghu/|website=engineering.purdue.edu|title=Anand Raghunathan's Webpage|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref>

==Academic activities==
Some of the teaching modules at CCBR are [[Neuroscience]], [[Machine learning]], [[Visual perception|Vision]], [[Auditory science|Audition]], [[Natural Language Processing]] and [[Reinforcement learning]].<ref name="iitmadras2">{{cite web|url=https://ccbr.iitmadras.in/course-details|author=Yash Murty|title=CCBR {{pipe}} Home|website=ccbr.iitmadras.in|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref name="thehindubusinessline">{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/education/neuroscience-curriculum-soon-in-iit-madras/article8089289.ece|title=Neuroscience curriculum soon in IIT Madras|website=The Hindu BusinessLine|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> The center has also been organizing an annual winter course/workshop on "Machine Intelligence and Brain Research" during the first week of January.<ref name="indianexpress">{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/education/iit-madras-winter-course-on-machine-intelligence-and-brain-research-begins-5519914/|title=IIT-Madras winter course on machine intelligence and brain research begins {{pipe}} Education News, The Indian Express|website=indianexpress.com|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref name="indiatimes2">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/registrations-double-for-iit-m-brain-research-course/articleshow/67355827.cms|title=Registrations double for IIT-M brain research course|website=Times of India|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref name="ndtv">{{cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-madras-winter-course-on-machine-intelligence-and-brain-research-begins-1971713|website=ndtv.com|title=IIT Madras Winter Course On Machine Intelligence And Brain Research Begins|accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref>
