The '''Kestrel Institute''' is a nonprofit [[computer science]] research center located in [[Palo Alto]]'s [[Stanford Research Park]]. [[Cordell Green]], who founded Kestrel in 1981, is its Director and Chief Scientist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kestrel Institute|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0050449D:US-kestrel-institute|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="form990"/> Its mission is to make it easier to write good, high-quality [[software]] and employs computer scientists like [[Lambert Meertens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=prof. L.G.L.T. Meertens|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/staff/lambert.html|website=Utrecht University|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>{{clarification needed |date=December 2023}}

In the 1980s, Kestrel described its research focus as "knowledge-based software environments" to make it easier to write software ("normalize and mechanize the programming process").<ref name="ieee">{{cite journal|author1=Douglas R.

Nearly all of Kestrel's [[Funding of science|funding]] comes from [[Federal grants in the United States|government grants]], from organizations such as the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[DARPA]], [[Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity]] (IARPA), [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL), AFOSR, [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR), [[NASA]], and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).<ref>{{cite web|title=Synthesis of High-Assurance Software|url=https://www.kestrel.edu/|website=Kestrel Institute|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="guide">{{cite web|title=GuideStar Report: Kestrel Institute|url=https://www.guidestar.org/ViewPdf.aspx?PdfSource=0&ein=94-2750021|website=GuideStar|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> In 2015, it received $4.9 million in grants and contributions, down from the previous year's $6.6 million.<ref name="form990"/>
