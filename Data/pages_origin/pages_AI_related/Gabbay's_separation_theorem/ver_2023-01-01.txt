{{short description|Any temporal logic formula can be rewritten in an equivalent "past → future" form}}
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''Gabbay's separation theorem''', named after [[Dov Gabbay]], states that any arbitrary [[temporal logic]] formula can be rewritten in a [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] "past&nbsp;→&nbsp;future" form.  I.e. the future becomes what must be satisfied.<ref>{{citation|title=Handbook of Temporal Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence|volume=1|series=Foundations of Artificial Intelligence|first1=Michael David|last1=Fisher|first2=Dov M.|last2=Gabbay|first3=Lluis|last3=Vila|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|isbn=9780080533360|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ajsvo6jWNhgC&pg=PA150}}.</ref>  This form can be used as execution rules; a [[MetateM]] program is a set of such rules.<ref>{{citation
