* [[Abductive logic programming]] – Abductive logic programming (ALP) is a high-level knowledge-representation framework that can be used to solve problems declaratively based on abductive reasoning. It extends normal logic programming by allowing some predicates to be incompletely defined, declared as abducible predicates.
* [[Abductive reasoning]] – (also called abduction,<ref name="Josephson">For example: {{cite book |editor1-last=Josephson |editor1-first=John R. |editor2-last=Josephson |editor2-first=Susan G. |date=1994 |title=Abductive Inference: Computation, Philosophy, Technology |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521434614 |oclc=28149683 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511530128}}</ref> abductive inference,<ref name="Josephson"/> or retroduction<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction|title = <nowiki>Retroduction | Dictionary | Commens</nowiki>|date = |accessdate = 2014-08-24|website = Commens – Digital Companion to C.

Peirce|publisher = Mats Bergman, Sami Paavola & João Queiroz}}</ref>) is a form of [[logical inference]] which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This process, unlike [[deductive reasoning]], yields a plausible conclusion but does not [[logical positivism|positively verify]] it.
* [[Abstract data type]] – is a [[mathematical model]] for [[data type]]s, where a data type is defined by its behavior ([[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) from the point of view of a ''user'' of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

* [[Action model learning]] – is an area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agent's knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment. This knowledge is usually represented in logic-based action description language and used as the input for automated planners.
* [[Action selection]] – is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, "the action selection problem" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment.
* [[Activation function]] – In [[artificial neural network]]s, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs.
* [[Adaptive algorithm]] – an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on ''a priori'' defined reward mechanism or criterion.
* [[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system]] – or adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a kind of [[artificial neural network]] that is based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy [[inference system]].

* [[AI-complete]] – In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].<ref name="Shapiro92">Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)</ref>  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.
* [[Algorithm]] – is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.  Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.
* [[Algorithmic efficiency]] – is a property of an [[algorithm]] which relates to the number of [[computational resource]]s used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be [[analysis of algorithms|analyzed]] to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering [[productivity]] for a repeating or continuous process.
* [[Algorithmic probability]] – In [[algorithmic information theory]], algorithmic probability, also known as Solomonoff probability, is a mathematical method of assigning a prior [[probability]] to a given observation. It was invented by [[Ray Solomonoff]] in the 1960s.<ref>Solomonoff, R., "[http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference]", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma.

* [[Ambient intelligence]] –  (AmI) refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people.
* [[Analysis of algorithms]] – is the determination of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to [[computation|execute them]]. Usually, this involves determining a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its [[time complexity]]) or the number of storage locations it uses (its [[space complexity]]).
* [[Analytics]] – the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data.
* [[Answer set programming]] – (ASP) is a form of [[declarative programming]] oriented towards difficult (primarily [[NP-hard]]) [[search algorithm|search problems]].  It is based on the [[stable model semantics|stable model]] (answer set) semantics of [[logic programming]].  In ASP, search problems are reduced to computing stable models, and ''answer set solvers''—programs for generating stable models—are used to perform search.
* [[Anytime algorithm]] – an algorithm that can return a valid solution to a problem even if it is interrupted before it ends.
* [[Application programming interface]] – (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, [[communication protocols]], and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a [[computer program]] by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the [[programmer]]. An API may be for a web-based system, [[operating system]], [[database system]], computer hardware, or [[Library (computing)|software library]].
* [[Approximate string matching]] – (often colloquially referred to as fuzzy string searching) is the technique of finding [[String (computing)|strings]] that match a [[pattern]] approximately (rather than exactly). The problem of approximate string matching is typically divided into two sub-problems: finding approximate [[substring]] matches inside a given string and finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately.
* [[Approximation error]] – The approximation error in some data is the discrepancy between an exact value and some approximation to it.
* [[Argumentation framework]] –  or argumentation system, is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it. In an abstract argumentation framework,<ref>See Dung (1995)</ref> entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a [[binary relation]] on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a [[directed graph]] such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation.  There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks<ref>See Besnard and Hunter (2001)</ref> or the value-based argumentation frameworks.<ref>see Bench-Capon (2002)</ref>
* [[Artificial immune system]] – Artificial immune systems (AIS) are a class of computationally intelligent, [[rule-based machine learning]] systems inspired by the principles and processes of the vertebrate [[immune system]]. The algorithms are typically modeled after the immune system's characteristics of [[learning]] and [[memory]] for use in [[Problem solving|problem-solving]].
* [[Artificial intelligence]] – (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is [[intelligence]] demonstrated by [[machine]]s, in contrast to the natural intelligence<!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --> displayed by humans and other animals.  In [[computer science]] AI research is defined as the study of "[[intelligent agent]]s": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.<ref name="Definition of AI">

* [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] – (AAAI) is an international, nonprofit, scientific society devoted to promote research in, and responsible use of, [[artificial intelligence]]. AAAI also aims to increase public understanding of artificial intelligence (AI), improve the teaching and training of AI practitioners, and provide guidance for research planners and funders concerning the importance and potential of current AI developments and future directions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Organization/bylaws.php|title=AAAI Corporate Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref>
* [[Asymptotic computational complexity]] – In [[computational complexity theory]], asymptotic computational complexity is the usage of [[asymptotic analysis]] for the estimation of computational complexity of [[algorithm]]s and [[computational problem]]s, commonly associated with the usage of the [[big O notation]].
* [[Attributional calculus]] – is a logic and representation system defined by [[Ryszard S. Michalski]]. It combines elements of [[predicate logic]], [[propositional calculus]], and [[multi-valued logic]]. Attributional calculus provides a formal language for ''natural induction'', an inductive learning process whose results are in forms natural to people.
* [[Augmented reality]] – (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including [[visual]], [[Hearing|auditory]], [[haptic perception|haptic]], [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]], and [[olfactory]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-13-1463155843-8474094-AR_history_timeline.jpg|title=The Lengthy History of Augmented Reality|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2016|work=Huffington Post|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.heg-fr.ch/EN/School-of-Management/Communication-and-Events/events/Pages/EventViewer.aspx?Event=patrick-schuffel.aspx|title=The Concise Fintech Compendium|last=Schueffel|first=Patrick|publisher=School of Management Fribourg/Switzerland|year=2017|isbn=|location=Fribourg|pages=|access-date=8 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024205446/http://www.heg-fr.ch/EN/School-of-Management/Communication-and-Events/events/Pages/EventViewer.aspx?Event=patrick-schuffel.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Automata theory]] – is the study of [[abstract machine]]s and [[automaton|automata]], as well as the [[computational problem]]s that can be solved using them.

* [[Automated planning and scheduling]] – sometimes denoted as simply AI Planning,<ref>{{Citation | last1=Ghallab | first=Malik | last2=Nau | first2=Dana S. | last3=Traverso | first3=Paolo | title=Automated Planning: Theory and Practice | publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] | year=2004 | url=http://www.laas.fr/planning/ | isbn=978-1-55860-856-6}}</ref> is a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] that concerns the realization of [[strategy|strategies]] or action sequences, typically for execution by [[intelligent agent]]s, [[autonomous robot]]s and [[unmanned vehicle]]s. Unlike classical [[control system|control]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]] problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to [[decision theory]].
* [[Automated reasoning]] – is an area of [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]] dedicated to understanding different aspects of [[reasoning]]. The study of automated reasoning helps produce [[computer programs]] that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of [[artificial intelligence]], it also has connections with [[theoretical computer science]], and even [[philosophy]].
* [[Autonomic computing]] – (also known as AC) refers to the [[Self-management (computer science)|self-managing]] characteristics of [[distributed computing]] resources, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by [[IBM]] in 2001, this initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing [[systems management]], and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth.<ref name="Kephart">{{Citation|doi=10.1109/MC.2003.1160055|title=The vision of autonomic computing|year=2003|last1=Kephart|first1=J.O.|last2=Chess|first2=D.M.|journal=Computer|volume=36|pages=41–52|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.613}}</ref>

* [[Belief-desire-intention software model]] – (BDI), is a software model developed for programming [[intelligent agent]]s. Superficially characterized by the implementation of an agent's ''beliefs'', ''desires'' and ''intentions'', it actually uses these concepts to solve a particular problem in agent programming. In essence, it provides a mechanism for separating the activity of selecting a plan (from a plan library or an external planner application) from the execution of currently active plans. Consequently, BDI agents are able to balance the time spent on deliberating about plans (choosing what to do) and executing those plans (doing it). A third activity, creating the plans in the first place (planning), is not within the scope of the model, and is left to the system designer and programmer.
* [[Bias–variance tradeoff]] – In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] in [[statistical parameter|parameter]] [[estimation theory|estimation]] have a higher [[variance]] of the parameter estimates across [[sample (statistics)|samples]], and vice versa.
* [[Big data]] – is a term used to refer to [[data set]]s that are too large or complex for traditional [[data processing|data-processing]] [[application software]] to adequately deal with. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater [[statistical power]], while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher [[false discovery rate]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breur|first=Tom|date=July 2016|title=Statistical Power Analysis and the contemporary "crisis" in social sciences|journal=Journal of Marketing Analytics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=61–65|doi=10.1057/s41270-016-0001-3|issn=2050-3318}}</ref>

* [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] – (sometimes called propositional satisfiability problem and abbreviated SATISFIABILITY or SAT) is the problem of determining if there exists an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] that [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula [[Validity (logic)|evaluates to TRUE]]. If this is the case, the formula is called ''satisfiable''. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction in formal logic|FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments and the formula is ''unsatisfiable''. For example, the formula "''a'' AND NOT ''b''" is satisfiable because one can find the values ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;FALSE, which make (''a'' AND NOT ''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;TRUE. In contrast, "''a'' AND NOT ''a''" is unsatisfiable.

* [[Computer science]] – is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of [[computer]]s. It involves the study of [[algorithm]]s that process, store, and communicate [[digital data|digital]] [[information]]. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search—3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>
* [[Computer vision]] – is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary scientific field]] that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from [[digital image]]s or [[video]]s. From the perspective of [[engineering]], it seeks to automate tasks that the [[human visual system]] can do.<ref>Dana H. Ballard; Christopher M. Brown (1982). Computer Vision.

* [[Concept drift]] – In [[predictive analytics]] and [[machine learning]], the concept drift means that the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time in unforeseen ways. This causes problems because the predictions become less accurate as time passes.
* [[Connectionism]] – is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>
* [[Consistent heuristic]] – In the study of [[shortest path problem|path-finding problems]] in [[artificial intelligence]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be consistent, or monotone, if its estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance from any neighboring vertex to the goal, plus the cost of reaching that neighbor.
* [[Constrained conditional model]] – (CCM), is a [[machine learning]] and inference framework that augments the learning of conditional (probabilistic or discriminative) models with declarative constraints.
* [[Constraint logic programming]] – is a form of [[constraint programming]], in which [[logic programming]] is extended to include concepts from [[constraint satisfaction]]. A constraint logic program is a logic program that contains constraints in the body of clauses. An example of a clause including a constraint is {{code|2=prolog|A(X,Y) :- X+Y>0, B(X), C(Y)}}. In this clause, {{code|2=prolog|X+Y>0}} is a constraint; <code>A(X,Y)</code>, <code>B(X)</code>, and <code>C(Y)</code> are [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literals]] as in regular logic programming. This clause states one condition under which the statement <code>A(X,Y)</code> holds: <code>X+Y</code> is greater than zero and both <code>B(X)</code> and <code>C(Y)</code> are true.
* [[Constraint programming]] – is a [[programming paradigm]] wherein [[Finitary relation|relation]]s between [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s are stated in the form of [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. Constraints differ from the common [[Language primitive|primitives]] of [[imperative programming]] languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found.
* [[Constructed language]] – (sometimes called a conlang) is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial, planned or invented languages<ref>{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>
* [[Control theory]] – in [[Control engineering|control systems engineering]] is a subfield of [[mathematics]] that deals with the control of continuously operating [[dynamical system]]s in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].
* [[Convolutional neural network]] – In [[deep learning]], a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of [[deep neural network]]s, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. CNNs use a variation of [[multilayer perceptron]]s designed to require minimal [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]].<ref name="LeCun">{{cite web|url=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/|title=LeNet-5, convolutional neural networks|last=LeCun|first=Yann|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and [[translation invariance]] characteristics.<ref>Zhang, Wei (1988).

* [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|Crossover]] – In [[genetic algorithm]]s and [[evolutionary computation]], crossover, also called recombination, is a [[genetic operator]] used to combine the [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genetic information]] of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way to [[stochastic]]ally generate new [[candidate solution|solutions]] from an existing population, and analogous to the [[chromosomal crossover|crossover]] that happens during [[sexual reproduction]] in [[biology]]. Solutions can also be generated by [[cloning]] an existing solution, which is analogous to [[asexual reproduction]]. Newly generated solutions are typically [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutated]] before being added to the population.

* [[Data set]] – (or dataset) is a collection of [[data]]. Most commonly a data set corresponds to the contents of a single [[table (database)|database table]], or a single statistical [[data matrix (multivariate statistics)|data matrix]], where every [[column (database)|column]] of the table represents a particular variable, and each [[row (database)|row]] corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Each value is known as a datum. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.

* [[Decision boundary]] – In the case of [[backpropagation]] based [[artificial neural network]]s or [[perceptron]]s, the type of decision boundary that the network can learn is determined by the number of hidden layers the network has. If it has no hidden layers, then it can only learn linear problems. If it has one hidden layer, then it can learn any [[continuous function]] on [[Compact space|compact subsets]] of [[Euclidean space|R<sup>n</sup>]] as shown by the [[Universal approximation theorem]], thus it can have an arbitrary decision boundary.
* [[Decision support system]] –  (DSS), is an [[Information systems|information system]] that supports business or organizational [[decision-making]] activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance—i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.
* [[Decision theory]] – (or the theory of choice) is the study of the reasoning underlying an [[agent (economics)|agent's]] choices.<ref>Steele, Katie and Stefánsson, H. Orri, "Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]</ref> Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the [[optimal decision|best decisions]] given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and descriptive decision theory which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions.
* [[Decision tree learning]] – uses a [[decision tree]] (as a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]]) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in [[statistics]], [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]].
* [[Declarative programming]] – is a [[programming paradigm]]—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a [[computation]] without describing its [[control flow]].<ref>{{citation|last=Lloyd|first=J.W.|title=Practical Advantages of Declarative Programming}}</ref>
* [[Deductive classifier]] – is a type of [[artificial intelligence]] [[inference engine]]. It takes as input a set of declarations in a [[frame language]] about a domain such as medical research or molecular biology. For example, the names of [[Class hierarchy|classes, sub-classes]], properties, and restrictions on allowable values.
* [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] – was a [[Computer chess|chess-playing computer]] developed by [[IBM]]. It is known for being the first computer chess-playing system to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls.
* [[Deep learning]] – (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of [[machine learning]] methods based on [[learning representation|learning data representation]]s, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be [[Supervised learning|supervised]], [[Semi-supervised learning|semi-supervised]] or [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]].<ref>Bengio, Y.; Courville, A.; Vincent, P. (2013).

* [[Default logic]] – is a [[non-monotonic logic]] proposed by [[Raymond Reiter]] to formalize reasoning with default assumptions.
* [[Description logic]] – Description logics (DL) are a family of formal [[knowledge representation]] languages. Many DLs are more expressive than [[propositional logic]] but less expressive than [[first-order logic]]. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) [[Decision problem|decidable]], and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|reasoning]] [[Complexity class|complexity]] by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}</ref>
* [[Developmental robotics]] – (DevRob), sometimes called [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] robotics, is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms, architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and open-ended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied [[machine]]s.
* [[Diagnosis (artificial intelligence)|Diagnosis]] – is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct.  If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing.  The computation is based on ''observations'', which provide information on the current behaviour.
* [[Dialogue system]] – or conversational agent (CA), is a computer system intended to converse with a human with a coherent structure. Dialogue systems have employed text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures, and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel.

* [[Discrete system]] – is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to [[computational theory]]. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise [[mathematical models]]. A [[computer]] is a [[finite state machine]] that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at [[discrete time]] intervals.
* [[Distributed artificial intelligence]] – (DAI), also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence,<ref>Demazeau, Yves, and J-P. Müller, eds. Decentralized Ai. Vol. 2. Elsevier, 1990.</ref> is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of [[multi-agent system]]s.
* [[Dynamic epistemic logic]] – (DEL), is a logical framework dealing with knowledge and information change. Typically, DEL focuses on situations involving multiple [[Intelligent agent|agents]]<nowiki/> and studies how their knowledge changes when [[Event (philosophy)|events]] occur.

''Science'' 2 April 2004: Vol. 304. no. 5667, pp.&nbsp;78 – 80 {{doi|10.1126/science.1091277}} [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/courses/w4070/Reading_List_Yuste/haas_04.pdf PDF]</ref><ref>Herbert Jaeger (2007) [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_State_Network Echo State Network.] Scholarpedia.</ref> is a [[recurrent neural network]] with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically 1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can (re)produce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system.

* [[Embodied cognitive science]] – is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior.   It comprises three main methodologies: 1) the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2) the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3) the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.

* [[Fast-and-frugal trees]] – a type of [[classification tree]]. Fast-and-frugal trees can be used as decision-making tools which operate as lexicographic classifiers, and, if required, associate an action (decision) to each class or category.<ref name=naive>Martignon, Laura; Vitouch, Oliver; Takezawa, Masanori; Forster, Malcolm.

* [[Feature extraction]] – In [[machine learning]], [[pattern recognition]] and in [[image processing]], feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values ([[Feature (machine learning)|features]]) intended to be informative and non-redundant, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps, and in some cases leading to better human interpretations.
* [[Feature learning]] – In [[machine learning]], feature learning or representation learning<ref name="pami">{{cite journal |author1=Y. Bengio |author2=A. Courville |author3=P.

This replaces manual [[feature engineering]] and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.
* [[Feature selection]] – In [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]], feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant [[Feature (machine learning)|features]] (variables, predictors) for use in model construction.
* [[Federated learning]] – a type of machine learning that allows for training on multiple devices with decentralized data, thus helping preserve the privacy of individual users and their data.
* [[First-order logic]] (also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic) – a collection of [[formal system]]s used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. First-order logic uses [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]] over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ''Socrates is a man'' one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is [[Socrates]] and X is a man" and ''there exists'' is a quantifier while ''X'' is a variable.<ref name="auto">Hodgson, Dr. J. P. E., [http://people.sju.edu/~jhodgson/ugai/1order.html "First Order Logic"], [[Saint Joseph's University]], [[Philadelphia]], 1995.</ref> This distinguishes it from [[propositional logic]], which does not use quantifiers or relations.<ref>[[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G.

* [[Fluent (artificial intelligence)|Fluent]] –&nbsp;a condition that can change over time. In [[logic]]al approaches to reasoning about actions, fluents can be represented in [[first-order logic]] by [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s having an argument that depends on time.
* [[Formal language]] – a set of [[String (computer science)|words]] whose [[Symbol (formal)|letters]] are taken from an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] and are [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] according to a specific set of rules.
* [[Forward chaining]] –   (or forward reasoning) is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an [[inference engine]] and can be described [[logically]] as repeated application of ''[[modus ponens]]''. Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for [[expert system]]s, [[business rules engine|business]] and [[Production system (computer science)|production rule systems]]. The opposite of forward chaining is [[backward chaining]].  Forward chaining starts with the available [[data]] and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user, for example) until a [[goal]] is reached. An [[inference engine]] using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] (If clause) is known to be true. When such a rule is found, the engine can conclude, or infer, the [[consequent]] (Then clause), resulting in the addition of new [[information]] to its data.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward|title=The Rise of the Expert Company|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofexpertco00feig|url-access=registration|year=1988|publisher=Times Books|isbn=978-0-8129-1731-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/riseofexpertco00feig/page/318 318]}}</ref>
* [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|Frame]] –&nbsp;an artificial intelligence [[data structure]] used to divide [[knowledge]] into substructures by representing "[[stereotype]]d situations." Frames are the primary data structure used in artificial intelligence [[frame language]].
* [[Frame language]] – a technology used for [[knowledge representation]] in artificial intelligence. Frames are stored as [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] of [[Set theory|sets]] and subsets of the [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frame concepts]]. They are similar to class hierarchies in [[object-oriented languages]] although their fundamental design goals are different. Frames are focused on explicit and intuitive representation of knowledge whereas objects focus on [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] and [[information hiding]]. Frames originated in AI research and objects primarily in [[software engineering]]. However, in practice the techniques and capabilities of frame and object-oriented languages overlap significantly.
* [[Frame problem]] – is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Patrick|title=The Frame Problem and Related Problems in Artificial Intelligence|journal=University of Edinburgh|url=http://aitopics.org/sites/default/files/classic/Webber-Nilsson-Readings/Rdgs-NW-Hayes-FrameProblem.pdf}}</ref>
* [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] (also friendly AI or FAI) – a hypothetical [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) that would have a positive effect on humanity. It is a part of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] and is closely related to [[machine ethics]]. While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent should behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behaviour and ensuring it is adequately constrained.

* [[Fuzzy control system]] –&nbsp;a [[control system]] based on [[fuzzy logic]]—a [[mathematics|mathematical]] system that analyzes [[analog signal|analog]] input values in terms of [[mathematical logic|logic]]al variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or [[Digital data|digital]] logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 (true or false, respectively).<ref name = "Pedrycz">{{cite book|last1=Pedrycz|first1=Witold|title=Fuzzy control and fuzzy systems|year=1993|publisher=Research Studies Press Ltd.|edition=2}}</ref><ref name="Hájek">{{cite book|last1=Hájek|first1=Petr|title=Metamathematics of fuzzy logic|year=1998|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|edition=4}}</ref>
* [[Fuzzy logic]] –&nbsp;a simple form for the [[many-valued logic]], in which the [[truth value]]s of variables may have any degree of "''Truthfulness''" that can be represented by any real number in the range between 0 (as in Completely False) and 1 (as in Completely True) inclusive. Consequently, It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. In contrast to [[Boolean algebra|Boolean logic]], where the truth values of variables may have the integer values 0 or 1 only.
* [[Fuzzy rule]] – Fuzzy rules are used within [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy logic systems]] to infer an output based on input variables.
* [[Fuzzy set]] – In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.<ref name=":0">D.

* [[Generative adversarial network]] – (GAN), is a class of [[machine learning]] systems. Two [[neural network]]s contest with each other in a [[zero-sum game]] framework.
* [[Genetic algorithm]] – (GA), is a [[metaheuristic]] inspired by the process of [[natural selection]] that belongs to the larger class of [[evolutionary algorithm]]s (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Search algorithm|search problem]]s by relying on bio-inspired operators such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]], [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|p=2}}
* [[Genetic operator]] – is an [[Operator (programming)|operator]] used in [[genetic algorithms]] to guide the algorithm towards a solution to a given problem. There are three main types of operators ([[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]], [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]]), which must work in conjunction with one another in order for the algorithm to be successful.

* [[Graph (discrete mathematics)]] – In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[graph theory]], a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called ''[[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]'' (also called ''nodes'' or ''points'') and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an ''edge'' (also called an ''arc'' or ''line'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory|year=1993|publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-67870-2|pages=19|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html|edition=Corrected, enlarged republication.|accessdate=8 August 2012|quote=A graph is an object consisting of two sets called its ''vertex set'' and its ''edge set''.}}</ref>

Bourbakis|accessdate=2018-04-20|publisher=World Scientific|page=381|isbn=9789810226374|year=1998}}</ref>), is a [[database]] that uses [[Graph (data structure)|graph structures]] for [[Semantic query|semantic queries]] with [[Node (graph theory)|node]]s, [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]]s and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the ''graph'' (or ''edge'' or ''relationship''), which directly relates data items in the store a collection of nodes of data and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for heavily inter-connected data.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Byoung-Ha|last2=Kim|first2=Seon-Kyu|last3=Kim|first3=Seon-Young|date=March 2017|title=Use of Graph Database for the Integration of Heterogeneous Biological Data|journal=Genomics & Informatics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.5808/GI.2017.15.1.19|issn=1598-866X|pmc=5389944|pmid=28416946}}</ref>

* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic]] –   is a technique designed for [[problem solving|solving a problem]] more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution.  This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]], or [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] for speed.  In a way, it can be considered a shortcut.  A heuristic function, also called simply a heuristic, is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that ranks alternatives in [[search algorithm]]s at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearl |first=Judea |title=Heuristics: intelligent search strategies for computer problem solving |year=1984 |publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

* [[Information integration]] – (II), is the merging of information from heterogeneous sources with differing conceptual, contextual and typographical representations. It is used in [[data mining]] and consolidation of data from unstructured or semi-structured resources. Typically, ''information integration'' refers to textual representations of knowledge but is sometimes applied to [[rich-media]] content. Information fusion, which is a related term, involves the combination of information into a new set of information towards reducing redundancy and uncertainty.<ref name="dca"/>

* [[Intelligent personal assistant]] – A virtual assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a [[software agent]] that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands. Sometimes the term "[[chatbot]]" is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by [[online chat]] (or in some cases online chat programs that are exclusively for entertainment purposes).  Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal commands.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02763869.2018.1404391|pmid = 29327988|title = Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and More: An Introduction to Voice Assistants|journal = Medical Reference Services Quarterly|volume = 37|issue = 1|pages = 81–88|year = 2018|last1 = Hoy|first1 = Matthew B.}}</ref>
* [[Interpretation (logic)]] – is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation.

* [[KL-ONE]] – is a well known [[knowledge representation]] system in the tradition of [[semantic networks]] and [[Frame (Artificial intelligence)|frames]]; that is, it is a [[frame language]]. The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = W.

* [[Knowledge acquisition]] – is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a [[knowledge-based system]]. The phrase was first used in conjunction with [[expert systems]] to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system, namely finding and interviewing [[knowledge domain|domain]] experts and capturing their knowledge via [[Rule-based system|rules]], [[Object-oriented programming|objects]], and [[Frame language|frame-based]] [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]].
* [[Knowledge-based systems]] – A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a [[computer program]] that [[automated reasoning|reasons]] and uses a [[knowledge base]] to [[problem solving|solve]] [[complex systems|complex problems]]. The term is broad and refers to many different kinds of systems. The one common theme that unites all knowledge based systems is an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly and a [[reasoning system]] that allows it to derive new knowledge. Thus, a knowledge-based system has two distinguishing features: a [[knowledge base]] and an [[inference engine]].
* [[Knowledge engineering]] – (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using [[knowledge-based systems]].
* [[Knowledge extraction]] – is the creation of [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] from structured ([[relational databases]], [[XML]]) and unstructured ([[text (literary theory)|text]], documents, [[image]]s) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|represent knowledge]] in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to [[information extraction]] ([[Natural language processing|NLP]]) and [[extract, transform, load|ETL]] (data warehouse), the main criteria is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a [[Database schema|relational schema]]. It requires either the reuse of existing [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|formal knowledge]] (reusing identifiers or [[ontologies]]) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.
* [[Knowledge Interchange Format]] –  (KIF) is a computer language designed to enable systems to share and re-use information from [[knowledge-based systems]]. KIF is similar to [[frame language]]s such as [[KL-ONE]] and [[LOOM (ontology)|LOOM]] but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to [[PostScript]]. PostScript was not designed primarily as a language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different languages, formalisms, platforms, etc.
* [[Knowledge representation and reasoning]] – (KR², KR&R) is the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as [[Computer-aided diagnosis|diagnosing a medical condition]] or [[natural language user interface|having a dialog in a natural language]]. Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology<ref>{{cite book |author1=Roger Schank |author2=Robert Abelson |title=Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding: An Inquiry Into Human Knowledge Structures |date=1977 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.}}</ref> about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalisms]] that will make complex systems easier to design and build.  Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from [[logic]] to automate various kinds of ''reasoning'', such as the application of rules or the relations of [[Set theory|sets]] and [[subset]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deepminds.science/knowledge-representation-neural-networks/|title=Knowledge Representation in Neural Networks - deepMinds|date=2018-08-16|work=deepMinds|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}</ref> Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include [[Semantic network|semantic nets]], [[systems architecture]], [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frames]], rules, and [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]. Examples of [[automated reasoning]] engines include [[inference engine]]s, [[automated theorem proving|theorem prover]]s, and classifiers.

== L ==

* [[Lazy learning]] – In [[machine learning]], lazy learning is a learning method in which generalization of the [[training data]] is, in theory, delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in [[eager learning]], where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries.

* [[Machine vision]] – (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, [[process control]], and robot guidance, usually in industry.  Machine vision is a term encompassing a large number of technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a [[systems engineering]] discipline can be considered distinct from [[computer vision]], a form of [[computer science]].  It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance.

* [[Model checking]] – In [[computer science]], model checking or property checking is, for a given model of a system, exhaustively and automatically checking whether this model meets a given [[formal specification|specification]]. Typically, one has hardware or software systems in mind, whereas the specification contains safety requirements such as the absence of [[deadlock]]s and similar critical states that can cause the system to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Model checking is a technique for automatically verifying correctness properties of ''finite-state'' systems.
* [[Modus ponens]] – In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], ''modus ponens'' is a [[rule of inference]].<ref>
Herbert B. Enderton, 2001, A Mathematical Introduction to Logic Second Edition Enderton:110, Harcourt Academic Press, Burlington MA, {{ISBN|978-0-12-238452-3}}.</ref> It can be summarized as "''P [[material conditional|implies]] Q'' and ''P'' is asserted to be true, therefore ''Q'' must be true."
* [[Modus tollens]] – In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], ''modus tollens'' is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[Logical form|argument form]] and a [[rule of inference]].  It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its [[contrapositive]].  The inference rule ''modus tollens'' asserts that the [[inference]] from ''P implies Q'' to ''the negation of Q implies the negation of P'' is valid.
* [[Monte Carlo tree search]] – In [[computer science]], Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] [[search algorithm]] for some kinds of [[decision process]]es.
* [[Multi-agent system]] – (MAS or "self-organized system"), is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting [[intelligent agent]]s. Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a [[monolithic system]] to solve. Intelligence may include [[Scientific method|method]]ic, [[Function (computer science)|functional]], [[Algorithm|procedural]] approaches, [[algorithm]]ic [[search algorithm|search]] or [[reinforcement learning]].
* [[Multi-swarm optimization]] – is a variant of [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) based on the use of multiple sub-swarms instead of one (standard) swarm. The general approach in multi-swarm optimization is that each sub-swarm focuses on a specific region while a specific diversification method decides where and when to launch the sub-swarms. The multi-swarm framework is especially fitted for the optimization on multi-modal problems, where multiple (local) optima exist.
* [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|Mutation]] – is a [[genetic operator]] used to maintain [[genetic diversity]] from one generation of a population of [[genetic algorithm]] [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosomes]] to the next. It is analogous to biological [[mutation]]. Mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state. In mutation, the solution may change entirely from the previous solution. Hence GA can come to a better solution by using mutation. Mutation occurs during evolution according to a user-definable mutation probability. This probability should be set low. If it is set too high, the search will turn into a primitive random search.
* [[Mycin]] – was an early [[backward chaining]] [[expert system]] that used [[artificial intelligence]] to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as [[bacteremia]] and [[meningitis]], and to recommend [[antibiotic]]s, with the dosage adjusted for patient's body weight – the name derived from the antibiotics themselves, as many antibiotics have the suffix "-mycin". The MYCIN system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases.

* [[Naive Bayes classifier]] – In [[machine learning]], naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple [[Probabilistic classification|probabilistic classifier]]s based on applying [[Bayes' theorem]] with strong (naive) [[statistical independence|independence]] assumptions between the features.
* [[Naive semantics]] – is an approach used in computer science for [[knowledge representation|representing basic knowledge]] about a specific domain, and has been used in applications such as the representation of the meaning of natural language sentences in artificial intelligence applications. In a general setting the term has been used to refer to the use of a limited store of generally understood knowledge about a specific domain in the world, and has been applied to fields such as the knowledge based design of data schemas.<ref>"[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=628188 Naive Semantics to Support Automated Database Design]", '''IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering'', Volume 14, issue 1 (January 2002) by V. C. Storey, R. C. Goldstein and
H. Ullrich</ref>
* [[Name binding]] – In programming languages, name binding is the association of entities (data and/or code) with [[identifier]]s.<ref name=tkac08>{{Citation |title=Using early binding and late binding in Automation |author=Microsoft |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245115 |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> An identifier bound to an object is said to [[Reference (computer science)|reference]] that object. [[Machine language]]s have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with [[scoping]], as scope determines which names bind to which objects – at which locations in the program code ([[Scope (computer science)#Lexical scoping|lexically]]) and in which one of the possible execution paths ([[Scope (computer science)#Dynamic scoping|temporally]]).  Use of an identifier <code>id</code> in a context that establishes a binding for <code>id</code> is called a binding (or defining) occurrence. In all other occurrences (e.g., in expressions, assignments, and subprogram calls), an identifier stands for what it is bound to; such occurrences are called applied occurrences.
* [[Named-entity recognition]] – (NER), (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of [[information extraction]] that seeks to locate and classify [[named entity]] mentions in [[unstructured data|unstructured text]] into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, [[medical classification|medical codes]], time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
* [[Named graph]] – Named graphs are a key concept of [[Semantic Web]] architecture in which a set of [[Resource Description Framework]] statements (a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) are identified using a [[URI]],<ref>strictly speaking a URIRef</ref> allowing descriptions to be made of that set of statements such as context, provenance information or other such [[metadata]].  Named graphs are a simple extension of the RDF data model<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/ "Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification"</ref> through which graphs can be created but the model lacks an effective means of distinguishing between them once published on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] at large.
* [[Natural language generation]] – (NLG), is a software process that transforms structured data into plain-English content.  It can be used to produce long-form content for organizations to automate custom reports, as well as produce custom content for a web or mobile application. It can also be used to generate short blurbs of text in interactive conversations (a [[chatbot]]) which might even be read out loud by a [[text-to-speech]] system.
* [[Natural language processing]] –  (NLP), is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of [[natural language]] data.
* [[Natural language programming]] – is an [[ontology (information science)|ontology]]-assisted way of [[programming language|programming]] in terms of [[natural language|natural-language]] sentences, e.g. [[English language|English]].<ref>Miller, Lance A. "Natural language programming: Styles, strategies, and contrasts." IBM Systems Journal 20.2 (1981): 184–215.</ref>
* [[Network motif]] – All networks, including biological networks, social networks, technological networks (e.g., computer networks and electrical circuits) and more, can be represented as [[complex network|graphs]], which include a wide variety of subgraphs. One important local property of networks are so-called network motifs, which are defined as recurrent and [[statistically significant]] sub-graphs or patterns.
* [[Neural machine translation]] – (NMT), is an approach to [[machine translation]] that uses a large [[artificial neural network]] to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model.
* [[Neural Turing machine]] – (NTMs) is a [[recurrent neural network]] model.  NTMs combine the fuzzy [[pattern matching]] capabilities of [[neural network]]s with the [[algorithm]]ic power of [[programmable computer]]s. An NTM has a neural network controller coupled to [[Auxiliary memory|external memory]] resources, which it interacts with through attentional mechanisms. The memory interactions are differentiable end-to-end, making it possible to optimize them using [[gradient descent]].<ref name="MyUser_Https:_May_17_2016c">{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-minds-interview-googles-alex-graves-koray-sophie-curtis |title=Deep Minds: An Interview with Google's Alex Graves & Koray Kavukcuoglu |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= May 17, 2016}}</ref> An NTM with a [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) network controller can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from examples alone.<ref>Graves, Alex; Wayne, Greg; Danihelka, Ivo (2014).

* [[Neuro-fuzzy]] – refers to combinations of [[artificial neural network]]s and [[fuzzy logic]].
* [[Neurocybernetics]] – A brain–computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a neural-control interface (NCI), mind-machine interface (MMI), direct neural interface (DNI), or brain–machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired [[brain]] and an external device. BCI differs from [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]] in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.<ref name="Krucoff 584">{{Cite journal|last=Krucoff|first=Max O.|last2=Rahimpour|first2=Shervin|last3=Slutzky|first3=Marc W.|last4=Edgerton|first4=V.

* [[Node (computer science)|Node]] – is a basic unit of a [[data structure]], such as a [[linked list]] or [[Tree (data structure)|tree]] data structure. Nodes contain [[data]] and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]].
* [[Nondeterministic algorithm]] –  is an [[algorithm]] that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a [[deterministic algorithm]].
* [[Nouvelle AI]] – Nouvelle AI differs from classical AI by aiming to produce robots with intelligence levels similar to insects. Researchers believe that intelligence can emerge organically from simple behaviors as these intelligences interacted with the "real world," instead of using the constructed worlds which symbolic AIs typically needed to have programmed into them.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/reference%20articles/what_is_AI/What%20is%20AI11.html|title = What is Artificial Intelligence?|date = May 2000|accessdate = 7 November 2015|website = AlanTuring.net|publisher = |last = Copeland|first = Jack}}</ref>
*[[NP (complexity)|NP]] – In [[computational complexity theory]], NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) is a [[complexity class]] used to classify [[decision problem]]s.  NP is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of decision problems for which the [[Computational complexity theory#Problem instances|problem instances]], where the answer is "yes", have [[mathematical proof|proofs]] verifiable in [[polynomial time]].<ref name = "kleinberg2006">{{cite book|year=2006|edition=2nd|title=Algorithm Design|url=https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei|url-access=registration|first1=Jon|last1=Kleinberg|first2=Éva|last2=Tardos|isbn=0-321-37291-3|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=[https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei/page/464 464]}}</ref><ref group="Note">''polynomial time'' refers to how quickly the number of operations needed by an algorithm, relative to the size of the problem, grows. It is therefore a measure of efficiency of an algorithm.</ref>
* [[NP-completeness]] – In [[computational complexity theory]], a problem is NP-complete when it can be solved by a restricted class of [[brute force search]] algorithms and it can be used to simulate any other problem with a similar algorithm. More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, whose validity can be tested quickly (in [[polynomial time]]<ref>{{Cite book| last=Cobham | first=Alan | authorlink=Alan Cobham | year = 1965 | chapter = The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions | title = Proc.

* [[NP-hardness]] – ([[NP (complexity)|non-deterministic polynomial-time]] hardness), in [[computational complexity theory]], is the defining property of a class of problems that are, informally, "at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP". A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the [[subset sum problem]].

* [[Occam's razor]] – (also Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor), is the problem-solving [[principle]] that states that when presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|title=What is Occam's Razor?|website=math.ucr.edu|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> and is not meant to filter out hypotheses that make different predictions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] ({{c.}} 1287–1347), a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher and [[Catholic theology|theologian]].
* [[Offline learning]] –
* [[Online machine learning]] – is a method of [[machine learning]] in which data becomes available in a sequential order and is used to update the best predictor for future data at each step, as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning on the entire training data set at once. Online learning is a common technique used in areas of machine learning where it is computationally infeasible to train over the entire dataset, requiring the need of [[out-of-core]] algorithms. It is also used in situations where it is necessary for the algorithm to dynamically adapt to new patterns in the data, or when the data itself is generated as a function of time.
* [[Ontology learning]] – (ontology extraction, ontology generation, or ontology acquisition), is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], including extracting the corresponding [[Domain of discourse|domain's]] terms and the relationships between the [[Conceptualization (information science)|concepts]] that these terms represent from a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of natural language text, and encoding them with an [[ontology language]] for easy retrieval.
* [[OpenAI]] – is the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP, whose [[parent company|parent organization]] is the non-profit organization OpenAI Inc<ref>"OpenAI shifts from nonprofit to 'capped-profit' to attract capital". TechCrunch. Retrieved 2019-05-10.</ref> that conducts research in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) with the stated aim to promote and develop [[Friendly artificial intelligence|friendly AI]] in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole.
* [[OpenCog]] – is a project that aims to build an [[open source software|open source]] artificial intelligence framework.

* [[Partial order reduction]] – is a technique for reducing the size of the [[State transition system|state-space]] to be searched by a [[model checking]] or [[automated planning and scheduling]] [[algorithm]]. It exploits the commutativity of concurrently executed [[Transition (computer science)|transitions]], which result in the same state when executed in different orders.
* [[Partially observable Markov decision process]] – (POMDP), is a generalization of a [[Markov decision process]] (MDP). A POMDP models an agent decision process in which it is assumed that the system dynamics are determined by an MDP, but the agent cannot directly observe the underlying state. Instead, it must maintain a probability distribution over the set of possible states, based on a set of observations and observation probabilities, and the underlying MDP.
* [[Particle swarm optimization]] – (PSO) is a computational method that [[Mathematical optimization|optimizes]] a problem by [[iterative method|iteratively]] trying to improve a [[candidate solution]] with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed [[Point particle|particle]]s, and moving these particles around in the [[Optimization (mathematics)#Concepts and notation|search-space]] according to simple [[formula|mathematical formulae]] over the particle's [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[velocity]]. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
* [[Pathfinding]] –  or pathing, is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant on [[Maze#Solving mazes|solving mazes]]. This field of research is based heavily on [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for finding a shortest path on a [[Glossary of graph theory#Weighted graphs and networks|weighted graph]].
* [[Pattern recognition]] –  is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.<ref>Bishop, Christopher M. (2006). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PDF). Springer. p. vii. Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years.</ref>
* [[Predicate logic]] – First-order logic—also known as predicate logic and first-order predicate calculus—is a collection of [[formal system]]s used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. First-order logic uses [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]] over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ''Socrates is a man'' one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man" and ''there exists'' is a quantifier while ''x'' is a variable.<ref name="auto"/> This distinguishes it from [[propositional logic]], which does not use quantifiers or [[finitary relation|relation]]s;<ref>[[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G. E.]], & [[Max Cresswell|Cresswell, M. J.]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dsn1xWNB4MEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22first-order%20logic%22&f=false A New Introduction to Modal Logic]'' ([[London]]: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=_CB5wiBeaA4C&pg=PA161#v=onepage&q&f=false p.161].</ref> in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.

* [[Principal component analysis]] – (PCA), is a statistical procedure that uses an [[orthogonal transformation]] to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of [[Correlation and dependence|linearly uncorrelated]] variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible [[variance]] (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is [[orthogonal]] to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a [[linear combination]] of the variables and containing ''n'' observations) are an uncorrelated [[orthogonal basis set]]. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.
* [[Principle of rationality]] – (or rationality principle), was coined by [[Karl R. Popper]] in his Harvard Lecture of 1963, and published in his book ''Myth of Framework''.<ref>[[Karl R. Popper]], ''The Myth of Framework'', London (Routledge) 1994, chap. 8.</ref> It is related to what he called the 'logic of the situation' in an ''Economica'' article of 1944/1945, published later in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism''.<ref>[[Karl R. Popper]], ''The Poverty of Historicism'', London (Routledge) 1960, chap. iv, sect. 31.</ref> According to Popper's rationality principle, agents act in the most adequate way according to the objective situation. It is an idealized conception of human behavior which he used to drive his model of [[situational analysis]].

A computation is initiated by running a ''query'' over these relations.<ref>Lloyd, J. W. (1984). Foundations of logic programming. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|978-3-540-13299-8}}.</ref>
* [[Propositional calculus]] – is a branch of [[logic]].  It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes '''[[zeroth-order logic]]'''. It deals with [[propositions]] (which can be true or false) and argument flow. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by [[logical connective]]s. The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions.  Unlike [[first-order logic]], propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] – is an [[interpreted language|interpreted]], [[high-level programming language|high-level]], [[general-purpose programming language|general-purpose]] [[programming language]]. Created by [[Guido van Rossum]] and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes [[code readability]] with its notable use of [[Off-side rule|significant whitespace]]. Its language constructs and [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<ref>Kuhlman, Dave.

It is strongly connected to, and opposite the [[ramification problem|ramification side]] of, the [[frame problem]].<ref name="reiter" />
* [[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifier]] – In [[logic]], quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the [[domain of discourse]] that satisfy an [[open formula]]. The two most common quantifiers mean "[[Universal quantification|for all]]" and "[[Existential quantification|there exists]]". For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that ''for all'' n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n.<!--this is to answer {{Technical|date=March 2016}} by making at least the first paragraph somewhat approachable.

* [[Query language]] – Query languages or data query languages (DQLs) are [[computer language]]s used to make queries in [[database]]s and [[information system]]s.  Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or [[information retrieval query language]]s. The difference is that a database query language attempts to give factual answers to factual questions, while an information retrieval query language attempts to find documents containing information that is relevant to an area of inquiry.

* [[Radial basis function network]] – In the field of [[mathematical modeling]], a radial basis function network is an [[artificial neural network]] that uses [[radial basis function]]s as [[activation function]]s. The output of the network is a [[linear combination]] of radial basis functions of the inputs and neuron parameters. Radial basis function networks have many uses, including [[function approximation]], [[time series prediction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], and system [[Control theory|control]].

Reasoning systems play an important role in the implementation of artificial intelligence and [[knowledge-based systems]].
* [[Recurrent neural network]] – (RNN), is a class of [[artificial neural network]]s where connections between nodes form a [[directed graph]] along a temporal sequence.

* [[Reinforcement learning]] – (RL), is an area of [[machine learning]] concerned with how [[software agent]]s ought to take [[Action selection|actions]] in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside [[supervised learning]] and [[unsupervised learning]].  It differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).<ref name="kaelbling">{{cite journal|last1=Kaelbling|first1=Leslie P.|last2=Littman|first2=Michael L.|authorlink2=Michael L.

"An overview of reservoir computing: theory, applications, and implementations." Proceedings of the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks ESANN 2007, pp. 471-482.</ref> Typically an input signal is fed into a fixed (random) [[dynamical system]] called a ''reservoir'' and the dynamics of the reservoir map the input to a higher dimension.

It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in [[web resource]]s, using a variety of syntax notations and [[data serialization]] formats. It is also used in [[knowledge management]] applications.
* [[Restricted Boltzmann machine]] – (RBM), is a [[generative model|generative]] [[stochastic neural network|stochastic]] [[artificial neural network]] that can learn a [[probability distribution]] over its set of inputs.
* [[Rete algorithm]] – is a [[pattern matching]] [[algorithm]] for implementing [[rule-based system]]s. The algorithm was developed to efficiently apply many [[Rule of inference|rules]] or patterns to many objects, or [[fact]]s, in a [[knowledge base]]. It is used to determine which of the system's rules should fire based on its data store, its facts.
* [[Robotics]] – is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] branch of [[List of engineering branches|engineering]] and [[Branch of science|science]] that includes [[mechanical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[computer science]], and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of [[robot]]s, as well as [[computer system]]s for their control, [[sensory feedback]], and [[information processing]].
* [[Rule-based system]] – In [[computer science]], a rule-based system is used to store and manipulate knowledge to interpret information in a useful way. It is often used in artificial intelligence applications and research.  Normally, the term ''rule-based system'' is applied to systems involving human-crafted or curated rule sets.  Rule-based systems constructed using automatic rule inference, such as [[rule-based machine learning]], are normally excluded from this system type.

* [[Satisfiability]] – In [[mathematical logic]], satisfiability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] are elementary concepts of [[semantics]]. A [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] is ''satisfiable'' if it is possible to find an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] ([[model theory|model]]) that makes the formula true.<ref>See, for example, Boolos and Jeffrey, 1974, chapter 11.</ref>  A formula is ''valid'' if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity, that is, a formula is ''unsatisfiable'' if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and ''invalid'' if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]].
* [[Search algorithm]] – is any [[algorithm]] which solves the [[search problem]], namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the [[Feasible region|search space]] of a [[problem domain]], either with [[Continuous or discrete variable|discrete or continuous values]].
* [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|Selection]] – is the stage of a [[genetic algorithm]] in which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding (using the [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover operator]]).
* [[Self-management (computer science)|Self-management]] – is the process by which [[computer]] systems shall manage their own operation without human intervention.
* [[Semantic network]] – or frame network, is a [[knowledge base]] that represents [[Semantics|semantic]] relations between [[concept]]s in a network. This is often used as a form of [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representation]]. It is a [[directed graph|directed]] or [[undirected graph]] consisting of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], which represent [[concept]]s, and [[graph theory|edges]], which represent [[semantic relationship|semantic relations]] between concepts,<ref name='Sowa'>{{cite encyclopedia |author=John F.

* [[Semantic reasoner]] –A semantic reasoner, reasoning engine, rules engine, or simply a reasoner, is a piece of software able to infer [[logical consequence]]s from a set of asserted facts or [[axioms]]. The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an [[inference engine]], by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The [[inference rules]] are commonly specified by means of an [[ontology language]], and often a [[description logic]] language.  Many reasoners use [[first-order predicate logic]] to perform reasoning; [[inference]] commonly proceeds by [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]].
* [[Semantic query]] – allows for queries and analytics of associative and [[Contextualization (computer science)|contextual]] nature. Semantic queries enable the retrieval of both explicitly and implicitly derived information based on syntactic, semantic and structural information contained in data. They are designed to deliver precise results (possibly the distinctive selection of one single piece of information) or to answer more fuzzy and wide open questions through [[pattern matching]] and [[Reasoning system|digital reasoning]].
* [[Semantics (computer science)|Semantics]] – In [[programming language theory]], semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [[programming language]]s. It does so by evaluating the meaning of [[programming language syntax|syntactically]] valid [[String (computer science)|strings]] defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain [[computer platform|platform]], hence creating a [[model of computation]].
* [[Sensor fusion]] – is combining of [[sensor]]y data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting [[information]] has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually.
* [[Separation logic]] –  is an extension of [[Hoare logic]], a way of reasoning about programs. The assertion language of separation logic is a special case of the [[logic of bunched implications]] (BI).<ref name="bi">{{cite journal| title=The Logic of Bunched Implications | first1=P.

* [[Similarity learning]] – is an area of supervised [[machine learning]] in artificial intelligence. It is closely related to [[regression (machine learning)|regression]] and [[classification in machine learning|classification]], but the goal is to learn from a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in [[ranking]], in [[recommendation systems]], visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.
* [[Simulated annealing]] – (SA), is a [[probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic technique]] for approximating the [[global optimum]] of a given [[function (mathematics)|function]]. Specifically, it is a [[metaheuristic]] to approximate [[global optimization]] in a large [[solution space|search space]] for an [[optimization problem]].
* [[Artificial intelligence, situated approach|Situated approach]] – In artificial intelligence research, the situated approach builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment. This requires designing AI "from the bottom-up" by focussing on the basic perceptual and motor skills required to survive. The situated approach gives a much lower priority to abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills.
* [[Situation calculus]] – is a [[logic]] formalism designed for representing and reasoning about dynamical domains.
* [[SLD resolution]] – (''Selective Linear Definite'' clause resolution), is the basic [[rule of inference|inference rule]] used in [[logic programming]]. It is a refinement of [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]], which is both [[Soundness|sound]] and refutation [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] for [[Horn clause]]s.
* [[Software]] – Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of [[data (computing)|data]] or [[computer]] instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]].

* [[Statistical classification]] – In [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]], classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of [[categorical data|categories]] (sub-populations) a new [[observation]] belongs, on the basis of a [[training set]] of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.  Examples are assigning a given email to the [[Spam filtering|"spam" or "non-spam"]] class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).  Classification is an example of [[pattern recognition]].
* [[Statistical relational learning]] – (SRL), is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and [[machine learning]] that is concerned with [[domain model]]s that exhibit both [[uncertainty]] (which can be dealt with using statistical methods) and complex, [[relation (mathematics)|relational]] structure.<ref name=Getoor2007>[[Lise Getoor]] and [[Ben Taskar]]: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSkIewOw2WoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Introduction to statistical relational learning]'', MIT Press, 2007</ref><ref>Ryan A. Rossi, Luke K. McDowell, David W. Aha, and Jennifer Neville, "[http://www.jair.org/media/3659/live-3659-6589-jair.pdf  Transforming Graph Data for Statistical Relational Learning.]"  ''Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)'', '''Volume 45''' (2012), pp. 363-441.</ref> Note that SRL is sometimes called Relational Machine Learning (RML) in the literature. Typically, the [[knowledge representation]] formalisms developed in SRL use (a subset of) [[first-order logic]] to describe relational properties of a domain in a general manner ([[universal quantification]]) and draw upon [[probabilistic graphical model]]s (such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[Markov network]]s) to model the uncertainty; some also build upon the methods of [[inductive logic programming]].
* [[Stochastic optimization]] – Stochastic optimization, (SO), methods are [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[iterative method|method]]s that generate and use [[random variable]]s. For stochastic problems, the random variables appear in the formulation of the optimization problem itself, which involves random [[objective function]]s or random constraints. Stochastic optimization methods also include methods with random iterates. Some stochastic optimization methods use random iterates to solve stochastic problems, combining both meanings of stochastic optimization.<ref name=spall2003>

* [[Stochastic semantic analysis]] – is an approach used in [[computer science]] as a [[semantic]] component of [[natural language understanding]].  Stochastic models generally use the definition of segments of words as basic semantic units for the semantic models, and in some cases involve a two layered approach.<ref>''Language Understanding Using Two-Level Stochastic Models'' by F. Pla, et al, 2001, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science {{ISBN|978-3-540-42557-1}}</ref>
* [[Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver]] (STRIPS) –
* [[Subject-matter expert]] –
* [[Superintelligence]] – is a hypothetical [[intelligent agent|agent]] that possesses [[intelligence]] far surpassing that of the [[genius|brightest]] and most [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] human minds. Superintelligence may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an [[Technological singularity#Intelligence explosion|intelligence explosion]] and associated with a [[technological singularity]].
* [[Supervised learning]] – is the [[machine learning]] task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.<ref>Stuart J. Russell, Peter Norvig (2010) ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]], Third Edition'', Prentice Hall {{ISBN|9780136042594}}.</ref> It infers a function from ''{{vanchor|labeled [[training set|training data]]|LABELLED_DATA}}'' consisting of a set of ''training examples''.<ref>[[Mehryar Mohri]], Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar (2012) ''Foundations of Machine Learning'', The MIT Press {{ISBN|9780262018258}}.</ref>  In supervised learning, each example is a ''pair'' consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the ''supervisory signal'').  A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see [[inductive bias]]).
* [[Support-vector machine]]s – In [[machine learning]], support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks<ref>Cortes, Corinna; Vapnik, Vladimir N. (1995). "Support-vector networks" (PDF). Machine Learning. 20 (3): 273–297. CiteSeerX 10.1.1.15.9362. doi:10.1007/BF00994018.</ref>) are [[supervised learning]] models with associated learning [[algorithm]]s that analyze data used for [[Statistical classification|classification]] and [[regression analysis]].

* [[Theoretical computer science]] – (TCS), is a subset of general [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]] that focuses on more mathematical topics of computing and includes the [[theory of computation]].
* [[Theory of computation]] – In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]], the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a [[model of computation]], using an [[algorithm]].  The field is divided into three major branches: [[automata theory]] and languages, [[computability theory]], and [[computational complexity theory]], which are linked by the question: ''"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?".''<ref name=Sipser-3rd>{{cite book|author = Michael Sipser | year = 2013 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation 3rd |quote=central areas of the theory of computation: automata, computability, and complexity.

* [[Thompson sampling]] – is a heuristic for choosing actions that addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the [[multi-armed bandit]] problem. It consists in choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a randomly drawn belief.<ref>Thompson, William R. "On the likelihood that one unknown probability exceeds another in view of the evidence of two samples". Biometrika, 25(3–4):285–294, 1933.</ref><ref>Daniel J. Russo, Benjamin Van Roy, Abbas Kazerouni, Ian Osband and Zheng Wen (2018), "A Tutorial on Thompson Sampling", Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning: Vol. 11: No. 1, pp 1-96.</ref> 
* [[Time complexity]] – is the [[computational complexity]] that describes the amount of time it takes to run an [[algorithm]]. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a [[constant factor]].
* [[Transhumanism]] – (abbreviated as H+ or h+), is an international [[school of thought|philosophical movement]] that advocates for the transformation of the [[human condition]] by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly [[human enhancement|enhance human]] intellect and physiology.<ref name="Mercer">{{Cite book|title = Religion and Transhumanism: The Unknown Future of Human Enhancement|last = Mercer|first = Calvin|publisher = Praeger|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref><ref name="Bostrom 2005">{{cite journal| last=Bostrom | first=Nick | authorlink = Nick Bostrom |title = A history of transhumanist thought|journal = [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/history.pdf| accessdate=February 21, 2006}}</ref>
* [[Transition system]] – In [[theoretical computer science]], a transition system is a concept used in the study of [[computation]]. It is used to describe the potential behavior of [[discrete system]]s.  It consists of [[state (computer science)|states]] and transitions between states, which may be labeled with labels chosen from a set; the same label may appear on more than one transition. If the label set is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], the system is essentially unlabeled, and a simpler definition that omits the labels is possible.
* [[Tree traversal]] – (also known as tree search), is a form of [[graph traversal]] and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a [[Tree (data structure)|tree data structure]], exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.
* [[True quantified Boolean formula]] – In [[computational complexity theory]], the language TQBF is a [[formal language]] consisting of the true quantified Boolean formulas.  A (fully) quantified Boolean formula is a formula in [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[propositional logic]] where every variable is quantified (or [[Bound variable|bound]]), using either [[existential quantification|existential]] or [[universal quantification|universal]] quantifiers, at the beginning of the sentence. Such a formula is equivalent to either true or false (since there are no [[Bound variable|free]] variables). If such a formula evaluates to true, then that formula is in the language TQBF. It is also known as QSAT (Quantified [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]]).
* [[Turing test]] – developed by [[Alan Turing]] in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to [[artificial intelligence|exhibit intelligent behaviour]] equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would [[natural language understanding|judge natural language conversations]] between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a [[keyboard (computing)|computer keyboard]] and [[visual display unit|screen]] so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech.<ref>Turing originally suggested a [[teleprinter]], one of the few text-only communication systems available in 1950. {{Harv|Turing|1950|p=433}}</ref> If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give.
* [[Type system]] – In [[programming language]]s, a type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called [[type (computer science)|type]] to the various constructs of a [[computer program]], such as [[variable (computer science)|variables]], [[expression (computer science)|expressions]], [[function (computer science)|functions]] or [[modular programming|modules]].{{sfn|Pierce|2002|p=1|ps=: "A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute."}} These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for [[algebraic data type]]s, data structures, or other components (e.g. "string", "array of float", "function returning boolean"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for [[bug (computer programming)|bugs]] in computer programs{{sfn|Cardelli|2004|p=1|ps=: "The fundamental purpose of a type system is to prevent the occurrence of execution errors during the running of a program."}} by defining [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at [[compile time]]), dynamically (at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for [[multiple dispatch]], providing a form of documentation, etc.
