'''AI for Good''' is a year-round digital platform of the [[United Nations]], where AI innovators and problem owners learn, discuss and connect to identify practical AI solutions to advance the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDGs]]. The impetus for organizing global summits that are action oriented, came from existing discourse in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) research being dominated by research streams such as the [[Netflix Prize]] (improve the movie recommendation algorithm).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/2018/|title=AI for Good Global Summit 2018|date=17 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923082803/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/2018/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2019-09-23|access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref> AI for Good aims to bring forward Artificial Intelligence research topics that contribute towards more global problems,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Declan|date=2017-06-06|title=AI summit aims to help world’s poorest|url=https://www.nature.com/news/ai-summit-aims-to-help-world-s-poorest-1.22112|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=546|issue=7657|pages=196–197|doi=10.1038/546196a|issn=0028-0836|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430190609/https://www.nature.com/news/ai-summit-aims-to-help-world-s-poorest-1.22112|archive-date=2019-04-30|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608049/how-can-we-optimize-ai-for-the-greatest-good-instead-of-profit/|title=How Can We Optimize AI for the Greatest Good, Instead of Profit?|website=www.technologyreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> in particular through the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. AI for Good came out of the AI for Good Global Summit 2020 which had been moved online in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. AI for Good is organized by the Standardization Sector of ITU ([[ITU-T]]). Since moving online, AI for Good developed into three main programme streams: Learn, Build, and Connect. AI for Good also helps organize ITU's [[Global Standards Symposium]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=AI for Good Global Summit 2019 {{!}} NTT Technical Review |url=https://www.ntt-review.jp/archive/ntttechnical.php?contents=ntr202001gls.html |access-date=2022-10-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221025194629/https://www.ntt-review.jp/archive/ntttechnical.php?contents=ntr202001gls.html |archive-date=2022-10-25 |website=www.ntt-review.jp}}</ref>
