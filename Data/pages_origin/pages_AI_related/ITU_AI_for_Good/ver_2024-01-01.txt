One of the outcomes of the 2017 Global Summit was the creation of an [[ITU-T]] Focus Group on Machine Learning for 5G.

== Outcomes ==

=== Machine Learning 5G ===
The ITU-T Focus Group on Machine Learning for 5G Networks (FG-ML5G) was created following discussions at the 2017 AI for Good Global Summit. The FG-ML5G is produced several technology standards in this domain, including [[Y.3172]], [[Y.3173]], [[Y.3176]], which were adopted by [[ITU-T Study Group 13]]. The FG-ML5G created the impetus for a new ITU-T Focus Group on Autonomous Networks, which is responsible for i.a. [[Y.3181]].

=== AI for Health ===
The 2018 Global Summit led to the creation of the [[ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health]] with the [[World Health Organization]], which created the [[AI for Health Framework]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-technologies_ai-has--enormous--potential-to-transform-health-sector/44123698|title=AI has ‘enormous’ potential to transform health sector|last=Bradley|first=Simon|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}</ref>

=== Trustworthy AI ===
Together with [[ITU-T Study Group 16]] and [[ITU-T Study Group 17|17]], AI for Good has been developing technology specifications under [[Trustworthy AI]]. Including items on [[homomorphic encryption]], secure [[multi-party computation]], and [[federated learning]].

=== ITU Journal "ICT Discoveries" ===
The ITU relaunched its Journal ICT Discoveries during the 2018 Global Summit, with the first edition being a special on Artificial Intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/journal/001/Pages/default.aspx|title=The impact of Artificial Intelligence|website=www.itu.int|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524232049/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/Pages/Speakers.aspx|archive-date=2019-05-24|access-date=2018-07-03}}</ref>
