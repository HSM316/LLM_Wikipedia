The '''AI for Good Global Summit''' is a [[United Nations]] platform, centered around annual Global Summits, that fosters the dialogue on the beneficial use of [[Artificial Intelligence]], by developing concrete projects. The impetus for organizing global summits that are action oriented, came from existing discourse in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) research being dominated by research streams such as the [[Netflix Prize]] (improve the movie recommendation algorithm).
