==History of AnyLogic==
At the beginning of the 1990s there was a big interest in the mathematical approach to modeling and simulation of parallel processes. This approach may be applied to the analysis of correctness of parallel and distributed programs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8vNBQAAQBAJ&dq=mathematical+approach+analysis+of+correctness+of+parallel+and+distributed+programs&pg=PA35|title=Distributed Databases in Real-Time Control|last1=Rodd|first1=M. G.|last2=Knuth|first2=E.|date=2014-07-04|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4832-9836-8|language=en}}</ref> The [[Distributed networking|Distributed Computer Network]] (DCN) research group at [[Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University|Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University]] developed a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation to be used for describing system structure and behavior. The tool was developed with the help of a research grant from [[Hewlett-Packard]].
[[Image:Different simulation methods.JPG|thumb|500px| right |Three business simulation approaches]]

In 1998 the success of this research inspired the DCN laboratory to organize a company with the mission of developing a new generation of simulation software. Development emphasis was placed on applied methods: simulation, performance analysis, behavior of [[stochastic systems]], optimization and visualization. The resulting software was released in 2000 and featured the latest information technologies: an object-oriented approach, elements of the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] standard, the use of [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and a modern [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. <ref>Albert Molderink, Maurice G.C.

[https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/144.pdf "Simulating the Effect on the Energy Efficiency of Smart Grid Technologies"] Proceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference</ref> 

The tool was named AnyLogic, because it supported all three well-known modeling approaches: [[system dynamics]],<ref name="WSC162" /> [[discrete event simulation]],<ref>Sudhanshu S Singh, Rakesh R Pimplikar, Ritwik Chaudhuri, Gyana Parija.

</ref> because the numbering continues the numbering of COVERS 3.0.

AnyLogic 5 was released in 2003. New version was focused on business simulation in different industries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zlatanovska|first1=Biljana|last2=Stojkovic|first2=Natasha|last3=Kocaleva|first3=Mirjana|last4=Stojanova|first4=Aleksandra|last5=Lazarova|first5=Limonka|last6=Gobubovski|first6=R.|date=2018-05-01|title=Modeling of some chaotic systems with anylogic software|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325685854|journal=TEM Journal|volume=7|pages=465–470|doi=10.18421/TEM72-31}}</ref>

AnyLogic 7, was released in 2014.<ref>The news on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/anylogic-7-released/ company’s official website].</ref> Being the biggest release for 7 years, it featured many updates aimed at simplifying model building, including support for multimethod modeling, a decreased need for coding, renewed libraries, and other usability improvements. AnyLogic 7.1, also released in 2014, included a new GIS implementation: in addition to shapefile-based maps, AnyLogic started to support tile maps from free online providers, including OpenStreetMap. <ref>The news on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/anylogic-7-1-released/ company's website]</ref>

2015 marked the release of AnyLogiс 7.2 with the built-in database and the Fluid Library.<ref>The news on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/anylogic-7-2-released/ company’s official website]</ref> Since 2015, AnyLogic Personal Learning Edition (PLE) is available for free for the purposes of education and self-education. The PLE license is perpetual, but created models are limited in size.<ref>The news on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/free-personal-learning-edition-anylogic-ple/ company's website]</ref>

The new Road Traffic Library was introduced in 2016 with AnyLogic 7.3.<ref>The news on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/anylogic-7-3-released/ company’s official website]</ref>

AnyLogic 8 was released in 2017. Beginning with Version 8.0, the AnyLogic model development environment was integrated with [[#AnyLogic Cloud|AnyLogic Cloud]], a web service for simulation analytics.<ref>Release notes on the [https://www.anylogic.com/blog/anylogic-8-simulation-analytics-in-the-cloud/ developer's official website].</ref><ref name="Timeline" /> 

The platform for AnyLogic 8 model [[integrated development environment|development environment]] is [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. <ref name="WSC314">Bin Li, Wen-feng Li.

Proceedings of the 2010 Winter Simulation Conference</ref>

==AnyLogic and Java==
[[Image:Simulation approaches vs abstraction levels.jpg|thumb|500px| right|How simulation approaches correspond to the level of abstraction]]

AnyLogic includes a graphical [[modeling language]] and also allows the user to extend simulation [[computer simulation|model]]s with [[Java (software platform)|Java]] code. <ref name="WSC314" /> The Java nature of AnyLogic lends itself to custom model extensions via Java coding <ref>Carol C. Menassa, Feniosky Peña Mora. [https://www.informs-sim.org/wsc09papers/254.pdf "Real Options and System Dynamics Approach to Model Value of Implementing A Project Specific Dispute Resolution Process in Construction Projects"]. Proceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference</ref> The Professional version allows for the creation of Java runtime applications which can be distributed to users.

==AnyLogic Cloud==


AnyLogic Cloud is a web service for simulation analytics. It allows users to store, access, run, and share simulation models online, as well as analyze experiment results.

Using AnyLogic model development environment, developers can upload their models to AnyLogic Cloud and set up sharable web dashboards to work with models online. These dashboards can contain configurable input parameters and output data in the form of charts and graphs. Model users can set input data on the dashboard screen, run the model, and analyze the output.

AnyLogic Cloud allows users to run models using web browsers, on desktop computers and mobile devices, with the model being executed on the [[server side]]. Multiple run experiments are performed using several nodes. The results of all executed experiments are stored in the database and can be immediately accessed. Models can be run both with and without [[HTML5]]-based interactive animation. <ref>Borshchev A.V. [http://simulation.su/uploads/files/default/2017-immod-18-26.pdf "Migration of Simulation Modeling to the Cloud"]. Proceedings of the 2017 IMMOD Conference </ref>

Developers can choose whether they want their models to be private or publicly available in the model library, which includes models from other AnyLogic users.

== anyLogistix supply chain optimization software ==

The AnyLogic Company converted its development efforts for the supply chain domain in a separate software tool – anyLogistix. This spin-off product was introduced in 2014 as AnyLogic Logistics Network Manager and was renamed anyLogistix in 2015.

anyLogistix is based on the AnyLogic and CPLEX engines, GIS, and the new industry-oriented GUI. It also includes algorithms and techniques specific for supply chain design and optimization. Like other simulation software such as [[Arena (software)|Arena]] and [[SIMUL8]], optimization functionality is provided by OptQuest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Creating an Optimization Experiment |url=https://help.anylogic.com/topic/com.anylogic.help/html/experiments/optimization-experiment.html?cp=0_11_2 |website=AnyLogic Help |publisher=AnyLogic |accessdate=23 August 2020}}</ref> anyLogistix is fully integrated with AnyLogic, for instance, AnyLogic can be used for customization of objects inside anyLogistix, including warehouses, production sites, suppliers, inventory, sourcing, and transportation policies.
