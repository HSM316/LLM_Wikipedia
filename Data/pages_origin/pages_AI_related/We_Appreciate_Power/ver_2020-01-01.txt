==Background==
A press release stated that the song was inspired by the [[North Korea]]n band [[Moranbong Band|Moranbong]] and was written "from the perspective of a Pro-[[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] Girl Group Propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards Artificial Intelligence."<ref name="P4K">{{cite web |last=Alston |first=Trey |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power |title=Listen to Grimes' New Song "We Appreciate Power" |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> In addition Grimes stated that by simply listening to the song you will be reducing your risk of ending up on any future AI overlord's hit list when it reigns supreme, mirroring the [[Roko's basilisk]] theory.  Lyrically, the song touches on [[transhumanist]] ideas such as the betterment and future of the human race, the possibilities of merging consciousness with machines to extend life indefinitely through [[mind uploading]], and the idea that reality may be [[Simulation hypothesis|simulated]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Burton |first=Jack |url=https://ontheaside.com/music/we-deconstructed-grimes-ai-manifesto-on-her-new-track-we-appreciate-power |title=We deconstructed Grimes' AI manifesto on her new track, "We Appreciate Power"  |work=A.Side |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> The song's chorus generated a spike in interest in the word "[[capitulation (surrender)|capitulate]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/online-searches-for-the-meaning-of-the-word-capitulate-soar-thanks-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power-2418915 |title=Online searches for the meaning of the word ‘capitulate’ spike by 500 percent thanks to Grimes’ new song ‘We Appreciate Power’ |work=NME |date=December 10, 2018 |accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described the song as "a dystopian, aggressive dive into a more rock-leaning sound."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8487138/grimes-we-appreciate-power-hana |title=Grimes Storms Back With Dark AI-Inspired 'We Appreciate Power' Featuring Hana |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> Similarly, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it "the most aggressive single Grimes has released to date", and described it as "somewhere between [[power pop]] and straightforward [[industrial music|industrial]] (with an extended bridge reminiscent of the most sweeping moments in a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' score)" and "a distinctly 2018 take on [[Nine Inch Nails]]-esque hard-edged rock."<ref name="RS"/> ''[[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]]'' called the song "an absolute motherfucker of a single" and opined it sounds "like a [[K-pop]] band covering [[nu-metal]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=D'Souza |first=Shaad |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/gy7jkb/grimes-we-appreciate-power-stream |title=Listen to "We Appreciate Power," Grimes's Absolute Monster of a New Single |work=Noisey |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>
