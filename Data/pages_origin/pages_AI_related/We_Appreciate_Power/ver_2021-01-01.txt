In an interview, Poppy mentioned that she wrote two songs with Grimes; one about "destroying things" and another about "power".<ref name="TwoSongs">{{cite web |last=Trendell |first=Andrew |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/poppy-interview-grimes-marilyn-manson-new-album-am-i-a-girl-tour-2361241 |title=Youtube sensation Poppy on her new album, gender fluidity, and working with Grimes and Marilyn Manson |work=NME |date=July 30, 2018 |accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref> The other song, "Play Destroy", was featured in the album.

Flashes of Nine Inch Nails’ ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' reverberate through the drum programming and synths."<ref name="p4k-review"/> Brendan Klinkenberg of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed the song "somewhere between [[power pop]] and straightforward [[industrial music|industrial]] (with an extended bridge reminiscent of the most sweeping moments in a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' score)" and "a distinctly 2018 take on [[Nine Inch Nails]]-esque hard-edged rock."<ref name="RS"/>

A press release stated that the song was inspired by the [[North Korea]]n band [[Moranbong Band|Moranbong]] and was written "from the perspective of a Pro-[[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] Girl Group Propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards Artificial Intelligence."<ref name="P4K">{{cite web |last=Alston |first=Trey |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power |title=Listen to Grimes' New Song "We Appreciate Power" |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> In addition Grimes stated that by simply listening to the song you will be reducing your risk of ending up on any future AI overlord's hit list when it reigns supreme, mirroring the [[Roko's basilisk]] theory.  Lyrically, the song touches on [[transhumanist]] ideas such as the betterment and future of the human race, the possibilities of merging consciousness with machines to extend life indefinitely through [[mind uploading]], and the idea that reality may be [[Simulation hypothesis|simulated]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Burton |first=Jack |url=https://ontheaside.com/music/we-deconstructed-grimes-ai-manifesto-on-her-new-track-we-appreciate-power |title=We deconstructed Grimes' AI manifesto on her new track, "We Appreciate Power"  |work=A.Side |date=November 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref> The song's chorus generated a spike in interest in the word "[[capitulation (surrender)|capitulate]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/online-searches-for-the-meaning-of-the-word-capitulate-soar-thanks-to-grimes-new-song-we-appreciate-power-2418915 |title=Online searches for the meaning of the word ‘capitulate’ spike by 500 percent thanks to Grimes’ new song ‘We Appreciate Power’ |work=NME |date=December 10, 2018 |accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Pitchfork critic Jillian Mapes wrote: "If "[[Freak on a Leash]]" isn't a dealbreaker, then the supervillain allure of "We Appreciate Power" might pull you in (it legitimately slaps), but it just as well may leave you weighed down by Grimes' commitment to the absolute darkest timeline."<ref name="p4k-review">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/we-appreciate-power/|title=Grimes: “We Appreciate Power” [ft.
