A '''TV gateway''' (also called network TV tuner) is a television [[Cable television headend|headend]] to a network UPnP router that receives live [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital video broadcast]] (DVB) [[MPEG transport stream]]s (channels) from terrestrial aerials, satellite dishes, or cable feeds and converts them into IP streams for distribution over an [[IP network]]. [[File:VBox-Live-TV-UPnP-Network-Tuner-with-NAS-PVR-and-OTT.JPG|thumb|TV Gateway - VBox]]

TV gateways allow users to stream broadcast live TV content to connected devices on the IP network, including tablets, smartphones, computers, gaming consoles and [[Smart TV|smart tv]]s. They also allow multiple users to watch and record different channels at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/vbox-communications-ltd-idUSnBw186031a+100+BSW20140218|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024001403/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/vbox-communications-ltd-idUSnBw186031a+100+BSW20140218|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 October 2014|title=VBox Unveils V@Home TV Gateway DVR – Watch Live TV: When, Where, What and How You Want It!|author=Reuters Editorial|date=18 February 2014|work=Reuters}}</ref>

The device offers multi-platform, multi-screen broadcast television with rich live TV content and high quality [[High-definition television|HD channels]].

== Digital TV signals used in TV gateways ==
Most TV gateways support [[Free-to-air|free-to-air]] (FTA) television services found in many countries. These include services such as [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Freesat]] in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2011/dec/29/ask-jack-digital-tv-freeview-freesat|title=Freeview or Freesat: which to choose?|author=Jack Schofield|work=the Guardian}}</ref> TNT in France and TDT in Spain, and basic cable packages in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and others.

A few TV gateways also support third party [[Conditional-access module|conditional access modules]] (CAMs) for premium [[Pay television|pay TV]] channels, which are transmitted by using a CAM CI card provided by the broadcasters or by third party manufacturers to access their TV service.

== Uses ==
While many first-generation TV gateways support only one channel or a limited number of channels, modern TV gateways provide multiple [[Tv tuners|TV tuners]] that can process several channels simultaneously. The more channels a TV gateway provides the more users it can service at the same time. Modern TV gateways also allow users to record TV programs to a USB flash drive, or external hard disk and in some cases, shared folders or [[Network Attached Storage|network attached storage]] (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/digital-home/3524451/vbox-xti-3340-tv-gateway-review/|title = VBox XTi 3340 review: TV gateway device lets you watch all of your TV, all over the house - PC Advisor|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

== Electronic program guide ==
An [[electronic program guide]] (EPG) is like a traditional TV listing magazine but available online or on a TV service like aerial, satellite or cable. It allows viewers to find out what shows will air and search for programs they’d like to watch. EPG's also allow users to set reminders and record shows automatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/helpplus/electronicprogrammeguides.shtml|title=BBC - BBC Help Plus|publisher=}}</ref>

Most TV gateways with PVR functionality offer EPG data. This can be free of charge for data processed from the broadcaster TV stream (according to standard DVB EN 300 468 and technical specification TS 101 211) or via a paid service provided by a third party online EPG provider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epg.cherryhill.eu/|title=cherryEPG - open source dvb epg generator|publisher=}}</ref>

== Whole house DVR ==
Whole house HD-[[Digital Video Recorder|digital video recorder]] allows users to record programs on a centralized TV gateway DVR and then watch them on any device connected to their home network.<ref name="timewarnercable.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/support/faqs/faqs-tv/wholehouse/what-is-whole-house-hd-dvr-di.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|publisher=}}</ref>

TV gateways with whole house HD-DVR require storage to record live TV programs or schedule future recordings using the EPG.

Whole house DVR TV gateways use a number of storage mediums to store recordings:<ref name="timewarnercable.com"/>
* Attached [[USB mass storage device class|USB storage]] such as removable HDD or USB flash drives
* Network Windows shared folder
* [[Network Attached Storage|Network attached storage]] (NAS)

== Streaming protocols ==
[[Unicast]] (HTTP) protocols are mainly used in consumer grade TV gateways to provide a small number of simultaneous users with the flexibility to view multiple channels.

[[IP multicast|Multicast]] (UDP), is mainly used in professional-grade TV gateways to enable efficient broadcast of a preset number of channels to a large number of simultaneous viewers. Multicast TV gateways are used primarily by [[IPTV]] broadcasters, hotels, hospitals, and [[digital signage]] applications.

== Discovery protocols ==
[[Universal Plug and Play|Universal plug and play (UPnP)]] is a set of [[communication protocols]] that permits network devices, to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional [[network service]]s for data sharing, communications, and entertainment.

[[M3U]] - The m3u8 file format is a de facto standard playlist format suitable for carrying lists of media file URL. Advanced TV gateways use M3U in addition to UPnP to offer better application support, allowing for faster channel zapping and provide a preset channel list.
