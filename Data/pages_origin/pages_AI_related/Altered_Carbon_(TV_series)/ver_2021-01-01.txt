Ann Foley served as costume designer. The production crew fitted about 2,000 costumers and custom made at least 500 pieces for the show, and emphasized "grounded" looks for future fashion but figured in specific details, such as a unique palette for Meth characters and subtle costume changes when different people are inhabiting the same sleeve.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/3/16965968/altered-carbon-netflix-ann-foley-costume-designer |title=How Altered Carbon's costume designer created the fashions for its futuristic world |website=The Verge |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=February 3, 2018 |access-date=July 22, 2018 |archive-date=July 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723034345/https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/3/16965968/altered-carbon-netflix-ann-foley-costume-designer |url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 26, 2020, Netflix canceled the series after two seasons. Per ''Deadline'', the decision was made in April and was not related to [[COVID-19]], but due to the series' high production cost.<ref name="Cancellation">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/altered-carbon-canceled-netflix-after-2-seasons-1203023456/|title='Altered Carbon' Canceled By Netflix After 2 Seasons|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=August 26, 2020|accessdate=August 26, 2020|archive-date=August 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826191154/https://deadline.com/2020/08/altered-carbon-canceled-netflix-after-2-seasons-1203023456/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Adaptation of the novels ===
==== First season ====
The first season is based on Richard Morgan's 2002 novel ''Altered Carbon''. While most of the major plot points in the book are retained, the adaptation featured several major changes for characters and organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/919030/Altered-Carbon-book-show-different-changes-torture-scene-Richard-Morgan-sequel-book-two |title=Altered Carbon book vs show: How much did they change? 19 major differences EXPLAINED |website=Express.co.uk |first=Stefan |last=Kyriazis |date=February 16, 2018 |access-date=April 22, 2019 |archive-date=April 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422133419/https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/919030/Altered-Carbon-book-show-different-changes-torture-scene-Richard-Morgan-sequel-book-two |url-status=live }}</ref> In the novel, the Envoys are elite soldiers of the United Nations Protectorate based on Earth, quite the opposite of the freedom-fighting rebels of the show, originating from Harlan's World, where Kovacs was born.

In the book, Kovacs was imprisoned for his freelance work after leaving the Envoys, while in the show, Kovacs is a captured rebel. The character of Reileen Kawahara in the novel was merely Kovacs' ruthless underworld boss and had no blood relation with him, in contrast to their sibling relationship in the show. The Envoy who trained Kovacs in the book was Virginia Vidaura. The show's Vidaura is only a minor character. Instead, his trainer is given the name and backstory of Quellcrist Falconer, who in book three is the historical messiah-like figure.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 15, 2018 |last1=Radish |first1=Christina |title='Altered Carbon' Creator Laeta Kalogridis on Book Changes, Season 2 Plans, and 'Alita: Battle Angel' |url=https://collider.com/altered-carbon-season-2-laeta-kalogridis-interview/ |website=[[Collider.com]] |access-date=April 17, 2020 |archive-date=January 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105114159/https://collider.com/altered-carbon-season-2-laeta-kalogridis-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Falconer's rebellion occurred not during Kovacs' training, as in the show, but long before Kovacs was born in the books.

The Hendrix is an AI character in the novel; it runs the hotel and takes the form of [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Hendrix's estate declined to license his image for the television series because of its violence. Instead, showrunner Kalogridis chose the likeness of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and a [[Victorian era]] hotel for the replacement Poe character and said it would juxtapose well with the futuristic Bay City.<ref name="Hendrix">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/altered-carbon-laeta-kalogridis-adaptation-edgar-allan-poe-interview-1202830788/ |title=Why 'Altered Carbon' Boss Replaced Hendrix With Poe for Netflix Adaptation |last=Holloway |first=Daniel |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 7, 2018 |access-date=July 21, 2018 |archive-date=July 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723034250/https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/altered-carbon-laeta-kalogridis-adaptation-edgar-allan-poe-interview-1202830788/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bancroft died just before his consciousness was to be uploaded and saved to a satellite, and the evidence suggests it was a suicide. Bancroft offers Kovacs a massive amount of wealth and Kovacs' freedom, but Kovacs declines. He is briefly interrogated by a police officer called Ortega, but makes it clear he doesn't want the case. Just before he checks into a gothic hotel run by an artificial intelligence, Kovacs is attacked by a high-class hitman called Dimitri. As Kovacs has been gone for two hundred and fifty years, he believes someone really did kill Bancroft and takes the case.

{{quotation|A key concept in Netflix's cyberpunk series ''Altered Carbon'' is the 'stack', an advanced hard drive installed on the brainstem on which a person can save a copy of their consciousness. The main effect of stack technology is a form of immortality, because a stack can be installed into another body if the original body dies. But there's another major implication only hinted at during the first season of ''Altered Carbon'': If you could choose your own body, would you go with the one you were born with? That's an especially important question for gender fluid or transgender people. The topic was only hinted at in the first season, but ''Altered Carbon'' creator Laeta Kalogridis told ''The Wrap'' it's something she would like to explore in greater detail.<ref name="Transgenderism">{{cite web |url=https://thewrap.com/altered-carbon-transgender-stacks-lgbt-laeta-kalogridis/ |title=''Altered Carbon'' Creator on How Show Could Examine LGBTQ Issues in Season 2 |website=The Wrap |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=February 13, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2019 |archive-date=August 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823215214/https://www.thewrap.com/altered-carbon-transgender-stacks-lgbt-laeta-kalogridis/ |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

==== Season 1 ====
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season holds an approval rating of 68% based on 95 reviews, and an average rating of 6.59/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Altered Carbon'' leans hard into its [[cyberpunk]] roots, serving up an ambitiously [[Pulp magazine|pulpy]] viewing experience that often overwhelms, but never bores."<ref>{{cite web |title=Altered Carbon: Season 1 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/altered_carbon/s01 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=March 8, 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the season has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/altered-carbon/season-1 |title=''Altered Carbon'': Season 1 |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=February 2, 2018 }}</ref>

David Griffin of [[IGN]] said the show "gets almost everything right" as a "cyberpunk fantasyland." Griffin praised the visuals and the complexity of the plot, as well as the acting, such as Chris Conner's performance as the AI hotel manager Poe. He also wrote of the show's problems, such as the intricacies of the murder often got "in the way of the show's momentum" and the murder plot "loses steam" early on. He ultimately gave it a score of 8.8 out of 10, summarizing it as "A visual titan with a less than stellar story."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/altered-carbon-season-1-review |title=''Altered Carbon'': Season 1 Review |last=Griffin |first=David |date=January 26, 2018 |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202163631/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/altered-carbon-season-1-review |url-status=live }}</ref> Michael Rougeau of [[GameSpot]] made a point of calling it "hardcore" science fiction, as a "noir sci-fi/[[Detective|gumshoe]] thriller bursting with the trappings of both genres, from murdered prostitutes and holographic billboard ads to AIs who flit between the real world and some convoluted [[cyberspace]]." The review praised how deeply the show examined and explored the cortical stack, the central concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-altered-carbon-contains-some-incredibly-h/1100-6456241/ |title=Netflix's ''Altered Carbon'' Contains Some Incredibly Hardcore Sci-Fi |last=Rougeau |first=Michael |date=January 26, 2018 |website=GameSpot |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127214938/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-altered-carbon-contains-some-incredibly-h/1100-6456241/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Catherine Pearson of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' said the visuals were magnificent and the themes fascinating, but that it had flaws; for example, the characters "mumbling their way through long expository dialogue."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/review/a847897/altered-carbon-netflix-trailer-tv-series/ |title=''Altered Carbon'' spoiler-free review: Netflix's new series is gorgeous, but drags over 10 hours |last=Pearson |first=Catherine |date=January 22, 2018 |publisher=Digital Spy |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-date=February 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203103748/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/review/a847897/altered-carbon-netflix-trailer-tv-series/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Robert Lloyd of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave it a mixed review, but particularly praised Kinnaman, even if the fight scenes were described as tedious in a way.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-altered-carbon-review-20180131-story.html |title=Netflix's ''Altered Carbon'' may be long and complicated, but it's good to have Joel Kinnaman back |last=Lloyd |first=Robert |date=February 2, 2018 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202145934/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-altered-carbon-review-20180131-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Jen Chaney of ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'' said the show was "ambitious, convoluted, violent, derivative, and somehow simultaneously grimy and glossy," but ultimately gave it a negative review, saying "the visual candy and philosophical subtext of ''Altered Carbon'' may wash over me, but none of it gets absorbed in any lasting way."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/altered-carbon-netflix-review.html |title=''Altered Carbon'' Is an Over-Stacked Cyberpunk Mess |last=Chaney |first=Jen |date=February 2, 2018 |publisher=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214252/http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/altered-carbon-netflix-review.html |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Radio Times]]'' wrote that the "drama tries to find its groove by shifting erratically from noir detective drama to war epic to soap opera, ultimately failing to meet its own lofty ambitions: it's a thunderous haymaker that only manages to graze its target." The review noted that the show takes on too much, and that much of the story could have been left for a second season.<ref name="radiotimes" /> Benjamin Lee at ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the series 3/5, praising the "sheer ambitious scale of it all" and "it's an impressive step up from what we're usually offered." Lee compared it to the work of [[Paul Verhoeven]] only lacking the social commentary. He concludes "it's refreshing to see a show so unashamed about its pulpiness. The spectacle might grow stale but for now, the flash is blinding."<ref name="theguardian18" />

Many critics focused on the show's violence. Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' wrote that the show seemed to use "the dystopian setting as an excuse for sexualized violence," and that the focus on dead, naked women's bodies "was a massive distraction from the show's stronger points, like the well-choreographed fight scenes and Takeshi Kovacs' backstory."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/altered-carbon-review-netflix/ |title=The future is still sexist in Netflix's cyberpunk thriller ''Altered Carbon'' |last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |date=January 21, 2018 |website=The Daily Dot |access-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063826/https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/altered-carbon-review-netflix/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Digital Spy]]'' defended the level of violence, arguing it accurately reflected the books, and was "the point" of the franchise, as "without showing brutal, unremitting violence, ''Altered Carbon'' would fail to fully explore the dystopian reality it aims to present."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/altered-carbon/feature/a849125/altered-carbon-netflix-tv-series-violence/ |title=''Altered Carbon'' on Netflix is spectacularly violent – but is the bloodshed justified? |last=Pearson |first=Catherine |date=February 4, 2018 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |access-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208095020/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/altered-carbon/feature/a849125/altered-carbon-netflix-tv-series-violence/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Kimberly Roots of [[TVLine]] also criticized the scenes of violence and nudity, and also said the story suffered from uneven pacing. However, she noted that the investigation part "clicks along smartly," and that the fight sequences were "sophisticated".

On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an approval rating of 83% based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 7.16/10.
