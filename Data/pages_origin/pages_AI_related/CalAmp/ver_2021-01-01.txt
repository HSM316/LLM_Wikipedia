LoJack Corporation was founded in 1986 in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]], by William Reagan, a former Medfield police commissioner.<ref name=twice1>{{cite web|url=https://www.twice.com/industry/lojack-founder-william-reagan-78-passes-away-7983 |title=LoJack Founder William Reagan, 78, Passes Away|website=twice.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref>  Reagan had patented the LoJack system in 1979, and chose its name to imply the opposite of "hijack". The system used a hidden car-mounted transceiver, and a tracking computer installed in police cars and aircraft, operating on a dedicated tracking frequency set aside by the Federal Communications Commission. Reagan served as the company's first CEO and Chairman.<ref name=twice1/>

In 1998, the company began offering its tracking system to the heavy machinery and construction industry, including entering into an agreement with [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/lojack-corporation-history/|title=LoJack Corporation History|website=fundinguniverse.com|date= |accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref>

By 2013, the LoJack system was reportedly operating in 28 states and the District of Columbia and in more than 30 countries. The company reported that more than 1,800 U.S. law enforcement agencies had LoJack tracking computers in their police vehicles.<ref name=twice1/> In November 2013, the company announced they were expanding tracking capabilities to parents, auto makers and insurance companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2486217/personal-technology/lojack-system-will-allow-parents-auto-makers-and-insurance-companies-to-track-v.html|title=LoJack system will allow parents, auto makers and insurance companies to track vehicles |website=computerworld.com |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2018-09-05}}</ref>
