'''Textual case-based reasoning''' (TCBR) is a subtopic of [[case-based reasoning]], in short CBR, a popular area in [[artificial intelligence]]. CBR suggests the ways to use past experiences to solve future similar problems, requiring that past experiences be structured in a form similar to [[attribute-value pairs]]. This leads to the investigation of textual descriptions for knowledge exploration whose output will be, in turn, used to solve similar problems.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=R.O.|last2=K.|first2=Ashley|last3=S.|first3=Brüninghaus|date=2005|title=Textual Case-Based Reasoning|url=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.91.9022&rep=rep1&type=pdf|url-status=live|journal=Knowledge Engineering Review|volume=20|pages=255–260|access-date=14 July 2021}}</ref>
