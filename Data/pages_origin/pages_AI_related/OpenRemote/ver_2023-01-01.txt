'''OpenRemote''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] platform that can be used for smart home building and smart city [[automation]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/openremote/openremote | title=GitHub - openremote/Openremote: OpenRemote v3.| website=[[GitHub]]}}</ref> The platform integrates many different protocols, and offers [[Visualization software|visualization]]. OpenRemote Inc. was originally created by the [[Marc Fleury]], founder of [[WildFly|JBoss]], to enable the sponsorship of the OpenRemote project. OpenRemote follows the same open source methodology, licensing under the [[Affero General Public License]] version 3. The company has since moved away from smart home automation and now develops a more genetic IoT platform.

== Platform ==

Manager 3.0 was created to handle larger multi-tenant applications. It includes a generic asset and attribute structure, allowing users to build their own asset types and adding their own protocols, and using generic protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and [[Bluetooth]], or older protocols such as KNX or BACnet. A rules engine allows for several ways of programming logic. A UI component library offers front end developers a quick way to build project specific frontend applications, using popular web frameworks like [[Angular (web framework)|Angular]] or [[React (web framework)|React]]. By utilizing multiple instances in an Edge Gateway mode on architectures like [[AArch64|ARM64]], multiple projects can be connected to, and synchronised with, a centrally hosted instance.
