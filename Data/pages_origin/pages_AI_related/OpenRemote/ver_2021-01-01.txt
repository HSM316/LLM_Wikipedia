'''OpenRemote''' is an [[Open-source software|open source IoT]] solution available for smart building, and smart city [[automation]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/openremote/openremote | title=GitHub - openremote/Openremote: OpenRemote v3.}}</ref> which integrates many different protocols and solutions, and offers [[Visualization software|visualization]] tools. OpenRemote Inc. was originally created by the founder of [[WildFly|JBoss]] [[Marc Fleury]], to enable the sponsorship of the OpenRemote open source project. OpenRemote follows the same Professional Open Source methodology, licensing under the [[Affero General Public License]] version 3.

It initially, successfully started the first open source home automation solution, but moved away form that with a new more generic IoT platform.

== OpenRemote open source IoT platform ==

Manager 3.0 is created to handle larger multi tenant applications. It includes a generic asset and attribute structure, allowing users to build their own asset types and adding their protocols, using generic protocols (eg. HTTP/REST, MQTT, Bluetooth) or more traditional protocols such as KNX, BACnet, Modbus, Zwave. A rules engine allows for several ways of programming logic (When-Then rules, Flow rules, or Groovy programmed). A UI component library offers front end developers a quick way to build project specific frontend applications, using regular tools like [[Angular (web framework)|Angular]] or [[React (web framework)]]. By using multiple instances in an Edge Gateway mode on eg. [[ARM64]], multiple projects can be connected to, and synchronised with, a centrally hosted instance.

== Reception ==

OpenRemote is applied in a range of energy management, asset management and smart city applications. Examples can be found on their website [https://openremote.io openremote.io]. Recently, they have gained some traction with licensing. In addition they are adopted by cities and property developers, which apply the tools to distributed energy management solutions<ref>{{cite news |title=The City of Arnhem selects OpenRemoteâ€™s Energy Management IoT solution |url=https://www.windtech-international.com/projects-and-contracts/the-city-of-arnhem-selects-openremote-s-energy-management-iot-solution |accessdate=December 2020}}</ref>, [[Smart city|smart cities]].
