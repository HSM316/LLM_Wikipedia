In information and archival communities, a '''designated community''' is an identified group of potential consumers who should be able to understand a particular set of information. These consumers may consist of multiple communities, are designated by the archive, and may change over time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (ISO 14721:2012) |url=http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf}}</ref>

Organizations determine their Designated Communities and establish standards and guidelines that create a mutually beneficial relationship. Designated Communities can be defined by their occupation, status, or geographic location.

Designated Community is a term closely aligned with the concept of [[Open Archival Information System]] (OAIS).<ref>{{cite web |title=Meeting the challenges of digital preservation: The OAIS reference model |url=https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html |website=OCLC Research |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> Each one gives the other a central purpose. The OAIS is a repository of information specified for its designated community. The designated community is the reason the OAIS maintains the information it collects.

Designated Communities can change, grow, or shrink over time, depending on the purpose of the information being preserved. Sometimes, designated communities can start as one subset and evolve into a wholly different subset depending on how the information that was originally assigned is being used, or misused.

== Example of a Designated Community ==
Canada's York University has a very specific definition for its Digital Preservation Designated Community. They categorize their Designated Communities in terms of “primary” and “secondary” communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-designated-community-definition |title=Designated Community Definition |website=York University |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> This demonstrates their prioritization of the intent behind what is digitally preserved. With a primary community made up of the university's faculty, students, staff, and researchers, York University situates that community's digital preservation needs above anyone else.
