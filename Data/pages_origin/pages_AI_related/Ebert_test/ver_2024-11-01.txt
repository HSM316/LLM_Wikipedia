Ebert lost his voice after surgery to treat cancer. He employed a Scottish company called [[CereProc]], which custom-tailors [[text-to-speech]] software for voiceless customers who record their voices at length before losing them, and mined tapes and DVD commentaries featuring Ebert to create a voice that sounded more like his own voice.<ref name=Esquire>Jones, Chris.
