'''MindSphere''' is a leading industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] as a service solution <ref>“MindSphere - Siemens Global Website”. siemens.com. Retrieved 2017-10-13.</ref> developed by [[Siemens]] for applications in the context of the Internet of Things ([[Internet of things|IoT]]).<ref name=":0">Naujoks, Stefanie. “MindSphere – Siemens cloud for industry: What is it all about?” pac-online.com. Retrieved 2016-05-09.</ref>
MindSphere stores operational data and makes it accessible through digital applications (“MindSphere applications”) to allow industrial customers to make decisions based on valuable factual information.<ref name=":1">Weinländer, Markus. (2017) Industrielle Kommunikation: Basistechnologie für die Digitalisierung der Industrie. Beuth Verlag. pp. 59-60. {{ISBN|978-3-410-26857-4}}.</ref> The system is used in applications such as automated production and vehicle fleet management.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">Reinheimer, Stefan. (ed.) (2017) Industrie 4.0: Herausforderungen, Konzepte und Praxisbeispiele. Springer Verlag. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-3-658-18164-2}}.</ref>

Assets can be securely connected to MindSphere with auxiliary MindSphere products (e.g. Data Capture Unit, MindConnect IoT2040 or MindConnect Nano) that collect and transfer relevant machine and plant data.<ref name=":0" />

Examples include real-time telemetric data from moving assets like cars, time series data and geographical data, which can be used for [[predictive maintenance]] or to develop new analytical tools.<ref name=":2" /><ref>5.

== Overview ==
As an industrial IoT as a service solution, MindSphere collects and analyzes all kinds of sensor data in real time.<ref name=":2" /> This information can be used to optimize products, production assets and manufacturing processes along the entire value chain.<ref name=":3">Dowling, Michael; Eberspächer, Jörg; Neuburger, Rahild; Noll, Elisabeth; Zisler, Kristina. (2016) Neue Produkte in der digitalen Welt. Books on Demand. {{ISBN|9783741278419}}.</ref> MindSphere’s open application interfaces make it possible to obtain data from machines, plants or entire fleets irrespective of the manufacturer.<ref name=":0" /> These interfaces include [[OPC Foundation]]’s OPC Unified Architecture ([[OPC UA]]).<ref>Weinländer, Markus. (2017) Industrielle Kommunikation: Basistechnologie für die Digitalisierung der Industrie. Beuth Verlag. pp. 56. {{ISBN|978-3-410-26857-4}}.</ref>

To help customers create their own software applications and services, MindSphere is equipped with open application programming interfaces (APIs) and development tools.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> This allows [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] to integrate their own technology.<ref>Schmalz, Kurt; Winter, Albrecht. (2016) “Trends in Vacuum Technology and Pneumatics in the Context of Digitalization”. qucosa.de. Retrieved 2017-10-09.</ref>

MindSphere is based on the concept of closed feedback loops enabling the bi-directional data flow between production and development:<ref>Williamson, Jonny. (2017) “Mindsphere: the next step in digital factories”. themanufacturer.com. Retrieved 2017-09-04.</ref> Real-world plants, machines and equipment can be connected to MindSphere in order to extract operational data.<ref name=":0" /> Valuable information (e.g. “[[digital twin]]s” of machines) can then be extrapolated from the raw data through analytics and utilized to optimize products as well as production processes and environments in the next cycle of innovation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /><ref>Dillon, Stuart; Schönthaler, Frank; Vossen, Gottfried. (2017) ''The Web at Graduation and Beyond: Business Impacts and Developments''. Springer Verlag. p. 266. {{ISBN|978-3-319-60160-1}}</ref>
