{{update|date=June 2018}}
The '''Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab''' (also called the '''Quantum AI Lab''' or '''QuAIL''') is a joint initiative of [[NASA]], [[Universities Space Research Association]], and [[Google]] (specifically, Google Research) whose goal is to pioneer research on how [[quantum computing]] might help with [[machine learning]] and other difficult computer science problems. The lab is hosted at NASA's [[Ames Research Center]].<ref name=google-announcement>{{cite web|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2013/05/launching-quantum-artificial.html|title = Launching the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab|last = Neven|first = Hartmut|date = May 16, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014|publisher = Google Research}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|url = http://www.nas.nasa.gov/quantum/|title = QuAIL Home|access-date = February 11, 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150310044853/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/quantum/|archive-date = March 10, 2015}}</ref>

==History==

The Quantum AI Lab was announced by Google Research in a blog post on May 16, 2013.<ref name=google-announcement/><ref name=technologyreview-launch>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514846/google-and-nasa-launch-quantum-computing-ai-lab/|title = Google and NASA Launch Quantum Computing AI Lab: The Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab will use the most advanced commercially available quantum computer, the D-Wave Two.|last = Choi|first = Charles|date = May 16, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014|magazine = [[Technology Review]]}}</ref><ref name=dwave>{{cite web|url=http://dwave.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/the-quantum-artificial-intelligence-lab/|publisher = Hack The Multiverse|date = May 16, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014| title=Private Site }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/05/24/google-nasa-computer/2358423/|title = Google, NASA take a 'quantum leap' with new computer|newspaper = [[USA Today]]|date = May 24, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014}}</ref> At the time of launch, the Lab was using the most advanced commercially available quantum computer, D-Wave Two from [[D-Wave Systems]].<ref name=google-announcement/><ref name=technologyreview-launch/><ref name=dwave/>

On May 20, 2013, it was announced that people could apply to use time on the [[D-Wave Two]] at the Lab.<ref name=dwave/>

On October 10, 2013, Google released a short film describing the current state of the Quantum AI Lab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/a-sneak-peak-inside-google-and-nasas-new-quantum-ai-la-1444007785|title = A sneak peak inside Google and NASA's new quantum AI lab|last = Dvorsky|first = George|date = October 11, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014|publisher = [[io9]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57607000-93/google-reveals-the-state-of-its-quantum-lab-in-short-film/|title = Google reveals the state of its quantum lab in short film: The multiverse, physicist Richard Feynman, lobsters, and quantum tunneling all make appearances in Google's short documentary about its Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab.|last = Rosenblatt|first = Seth|date = October 10, 2013|access-date = February 11, 2014|work = [[CNet]]}}</ref>

In January 2014, Google reported results comparing the performance of the D-Wave Two in the lab with that of classical computers. The results were ambiguous and provoked heated discussion on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+QuantumAILab/posts/DymNo8DzAYi|title = Where do we stand on benchmarking the D-Wave 2?|publisher = Google Quantum A.
