'''Artificial intelligence art''' is any [[visual artwork]] created through the use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) programs.<ref name="Epstein2023" />  

Artists began to create AI art in the mid to late-20th century, when the discipline was founded. In the early 21st century, the availability of AI art tools to the general public increased, providing opportunities for use outside of academia and professional artists. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns, including those related to copyright, deception, and its impact on traditional artists, including their incomes. 

== {{anchor|Awards and recognition}}History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Cartoon dynamo.jpg|thumb|In this 1923 comic, [[H. T. Webster]] humorously imagines the life of a cartoonist in 2023, when machines powered by [[electricity]] can produce and execute ideas for cartoons.]]
The concept of automated art dates back at least to the [[Automaton|automata]] of [[Hellenistic civilization|ancient Greek civilization]], where inventors such as [[Daedalus]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]] were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music.<ref name="Sharkey2019" /><ref name="automatabyzantine" />  The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, such as [[Maillardet's automaton]], created in the early 1800s.<ref name="maillardetsautomation" />

The academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research [[Dartmouth workshop|workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956, and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since.<ref name="creviertumultuous" /> Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by [[Artificial intelligence in myths and legends|myth]], [[Artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] and [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|philosophy]] since antiquity.<ref name="newquistbrainmakers" />

=== 1950s to 2000s ===

Since the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. These works were sometimes referred to as [[algorithmic art]],<ref name="elgammalblurring" /> [[computer art]], [[digital art]] or [[new media]].<ref name="greenfieldtaylor" />

One of the first significant AI art systems is [[AARON]], developed by [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]] beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego.<ref name="aaronsscode" /> AARON is the most notable example of AI art in the era of [[GOFAI]] programming because of its use of a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images.<ref name="intheera" /> Cohen developed AARON with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. In its primitive form, AARON created simple black and white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint. Cohen designed AARON to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.<ref name="Kate Vass" /> [[AARON]] was exhibited in 1972 at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].<ref name="cohenforum" />

In both 1991 and 1992, [[Karl Sims]] won the Golden Nica award at [[Prix Ars Electronica]] for his 3D AI animated videos using artificial evolution.<ref name="goldennicas" /><ref name="panspermia" /><ref name="liquidselves" />

In 2001 [[Scott Draves]] won the Fundacion Telefonica Life 4.0 prize<ref name="telefonica"/> for [[Electric Sheep]], which used AI to create an infinite animation by learning from its audience.

In 2009, [[Eric Millikin]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] along with several other awards for his artificial intelligence art that was critical of government corruption in Detroit and resulted in the city's mayor being sent to jail.<ref name="Detroit Free Press IRE" /><ref name="Detroit Free Press Pulitzer" /><ref name="2009pulitzers" />

=== 2010s and deep learning ===
[[File:Edmond de Belamy.png|thumb|The painting ''[[Edmond de Belamy]]'', created by a [[generative adversarial network]] in 2018]]

In 2014, [[Ian Goodfellow]] and colleagues at [[Université de Montréal]] developed the [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN), a type of [[deep neural network]] capable of learning to mimic the [[statistical distribution]] of input data such as images. The GAN uses a "generator" to create new images and a "discriminator" to decide which created images are considered successful.<ref name="GANnips" /> Unlike previous algorithmic art which followed hand-coded rules, generative adversarial networks could learn a specific aesthetic by analyzing a dataset of example images.<ref name="elgammalblurring" />

In 2015, a team at [[Google]] released [[DeepDream]], a program that uses a [[convolutional neural network]] to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].<ref name="codexample" /><ref name="goingdeeper" /><ref name="arxiv" /> The process creates deliberately over-processed images with a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a [[psychedelic experience]].<ref name="deepdream" />

In 2018, an auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at [[Christie's|Christie's Auction House]] in [[New York City|New York]] where the AI artwork ''[[Edmond de Belamy]]'' (a pun on Goodfellow's name) sold for $432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of $7,000–$10,000. The artwork was created by "Obvious", a [[Paris]]-based collective.<ref name="christies" /><ref name="bbc" /><ref name="nytimes" />

In 2019, [[Stephanie Dinkins]] won the [[Creative Capital]] award for her creation of an evolving artificial intelligence based on the "interests and culture(s) of people of color."<ref name="rnk8u" /> Also in 2019, [[Sougwen Chung]] won the [[Lumen Prize]] for her performances with a robotic arm that uses AI to attempt to draw in a manner similar to Chung.<ref name="NEA3o" />

=== 2020s and generative AI ===
[[File:Scenic Valley in the Afternoon Artistic (VQGAN+CLIP).jpg|thumb|Example of image made with VQGAN+CLIP (NightCafe Studio)]]
In the 2020s, [[text-to-image]] models, which generate images based on [[Prompt (natural language)|prompts]], began to approach the quality of real photographs and human-drawn art.<ref name="imagen-verge" />

In 2021, using the [[Transformer_(machine_learning_model)|Transformer]] models used in [[GPT-2]] and [[GPT-3]], [[OpenAI]] developed [[DALL-E]], a [[text-to-image]] AI model capable of producing high-quality images based on [[Prompt (natural language)|natural language prompts]].<ref name="dallepaper" />

Later in 2021, [[EleutherAI]] released the open source VQGAN+CLIP,<ref name="adafruitVQGANCLIP" /> based on [[OpenAI]]'s CLIP model.<ref name="hgnxS" />

In 2022, [[Midjourney]]<ref name="viceInsideMidjourney" /> was released, followed by the open source [[Stable Diffusion]],<ref name="FYD8W" /> leading to a dramatic growth in the use of AI to generate visual art.

== Tools and processes ==
=== Imagery ===
[[File:CyberpunkRoboChef (SDXL).jpg|thumb|Image made with [[Stable Diffusion]]]]
Many mechanisms for creating AI art have been developed, including procedural "rule-based" generation of images using mathematical patterns, algorithms which simulate brush strokes and other painted effects, and deep learning algorithms, such as [[generative adversarial networks]] (GANs) and [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformers]].

Several companies have released apps that transform photos into art-like images with the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of well-known sets of paintings.<ref name="digtrends" /><ref name="slimesmakeartfromphotos" />
The website [[Artbreeder]], launched in 2018, uses the models [[StyleGAN]] and BigGAN<ref name="about" /><ref name="Understanding Basic Concepts" /> to allow users to generate and modify images such as faces, landscapes, and paintings.<ref name="DigitalArts" />

Several programs use [[Text-to-image model|text-to-image models]] to generate a variety of images based on various [[Prompt engineering|text prompts]]. They include [[EleutherAI]]'s VQGAN+CLIP which was released in 2021,<ref name="adafruitVQGANCLIP" /> [[OpenAI]]'s [[DALL-E]] which released a series of images in January 2021, <ref name="nbc2" /> [[Google Brain]]'s Imagen and Parti which was announced in May 2022, [[Microsoft]]'s NUWA-Infinity,<ref name="nuwa-inf" /><ref name="imagen-verge" /> and [[Stable Diffusion]] which was released in August 2022.<ref name="technologyreview" /><ref name="stablediffusion" />  Stability.ai has a Stable Diffusion web interface called DreamStudio.<ref name="venturebeatai" /> Stable Diffusion is [[source-available software]], enabling further development such as plugins for [[Krita]], [[Photoshop]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], and [[GIMP]],<ref name="Choudhary" /> as well as the Automatic1111 web-based open source [[user interface]]<!-- that are made conveniently usable from the UI-->.<ref name="unclehermann" /><ref name="howtoSD" /><ref name="atsmooth" /> Stable Diffusion's main pre-trained model is shared on the [[Hugging Face#Hugging Face Hub|Hugging Face Hub]].<ref name="mehtaSDpy" /> 

There are many other AI art generation programs including simple consumer-facing mobile apps and [[Project Jupyter|Jupyter]] notebooks that require powerful [[GPUs]] to run effectively.<ref name="pharmapsychotic" /> Additional functionalities include {{anchor|Textual Inversion}}"Textual Inversion" which refers to enabling the use of user-provided [[concept]]s (like an object or a style) learned from few images. With textual inversion, novel personalized art can be generated from the associated word(s) (the keywords that have been assigned to the learned, often abstract, concept)<ref name="personalizing" /><ref name="textualinversion" /> and model extensions/[[Fine-tuning (deep learning)|fine-tuning]] (see also: [[DreamBooth]]).

==== Impact and applications ====
The exhibition "Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959–1989" at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] provided an overview of AI applications for art, architecture, and design. Exhibitions showcasing the usage of AI to produce art include the 2016 Google-sponsored benefit and auction at the Gray Area Foundation in San Francisco, where artists experimented with the [[DeepDream]] algorithm and the 2017 exhibition "Unhuman: Art in the Age of AI", which took place in Los Angeles and Frankfurt. In spring 2018, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] dedicated a magazine issue to the subject of computers and art. In June 2018, "Duet for Human and Machine", an art piece permitting viewers to interact with an artificial intelligence, premiered at the Beall Center for Art + Technology. The Austrian [[Ars Electronica]] and [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]] opened exhibitions on AI in 2019. Ars Electronica's 2019 festival "Out of the box" explored art's role in a sustainable societal transformation.

Examples of such augmentation may include e.g. enabling expansion of noncommercial niche genres (common examples are [[cyberpunk derivatives]] like [[solarpunk]]) by amateurs, novel entertainment, novel [[Imagination|imaginative]] childhood play,{{additional citation needed|date=September 2022}} very fast prototyping,<ref name="computerworld" /> increasing art-making accessibility<ref name="computerworld" /> and artistic output per effort and/or expenses and/or time<ref name="computerworld" /> – e.g. via generating drafts, inspirations, draft-refinitions, and image-components ([[Inpainting]]).

Generated images are sometimes used as sketches<ref name="nytimesRoose" /> or low-cost experimentations<ref name="CNBCLeswing" /> or illustration of [[proof-of-concept]]-stage ideas – additional functionalities or improvements may also relate to post-generation manual editing (polishing or artistic usage) of prompts-based art{{additional citation needed|date=November 2022}} (such as subsequent tweaking with an image editor).<ref name="CNBCLeswing" />

=== Prompt engineering and sharing ===
{{seealso|Prompt engineering#Text-to-image}}
[[File:Astronaut Riding a Horse (SDXL).jpg|thumb|An image generated by Stable Diffusion based on the text prompt "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse"]]
[[Prompt (natural language)|Prompts]] for some text-to-image models can also include images and keywords and configurable parameters, such as [[artistic style]], which is often used via keyphrases like "in the style of [name of an artist]" in the prompt<ref name="deviantartartstation" /> and/or selection of a broad aesthetic/art style.<ref name="arepicciesart" /><ref name="nytimesRoose" /> There are platforms for sharing, trading, searching, forking/refining and/or collaborating on prompts for generating specific imagery from image generators.<ref name="thevergeAnyoneCan" /><ref name="howtogeekgallery" /><ref name="whisperers" /><ref name="text-zu-bild" /> Prompts are often shared along with images on [[image sharing|image-sharing]] websites such as [[Reddit]] and AI art-dedicated websites. A prompt is not the complete input needed for the generation of an image: additional inputs that determine the generated image include the output resolution, [[random seed]], and random sampling parameters.<ref name="sdpromptbook" />

==== Related terminology ====
[[Synthetic media]], which includes AI art, was described in 2022 as a major technology-driven trend that will affect business in the coming years.<ref name="computerworld" /> 'Synthography' is a proposed term for the practice of generating images that are similar to photographs using AI.<ref name="invitation to reconsider" />
== Criticism, issues and controversy ==
===Copyright===
{{See|Artificial intelligence and copyright}}
Legal scholars, artists, and media corporations have considered the legal and ethical implications of artificial intelligence art since the 20th century.

In 1985, intellectual property law professor [[Pamela Samuelson]] argued that US copyright to algorithmically generated artworks should be allocated to the user of the computer program.<ref name="allocating" /> A 2019 ''[[Florida Law Review]]'' article presented three perspectives on the issue. In the first, the artificial intelligence itself would become the copyright owner. To do this, Section 101 of the [[United States Copyright Act|US Copyright Act]] would need to be amended to define "author" as a natural person or a computer. In the second, following Samuelson's argument, the user, programmer, or artificial intelligence company would be the copyright owner. This would be an expansion of the "work for hire" doctrine, under which ownership of a copyright is transferred to the "employer." In the third situation, copyright assignment would never take place, and such works would be in the [[public domain]], as copyright assignments require an act of authorship.<ref name="whatifaiwrotethis" />

In 2022, coinciding with the rising availability of consumer-grade AI image generation services, popular discussion renewed over the legality and ethics of AI-generated art. Of particular issue is the use of copyrighted art within AI [[training dataset]]s: in September 2022, Reema Selhi, of the [[Design and Artists Copyright Society]], stated that "there are no safeguards for artists to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out."<ref name="dude" /> Some have claimed that images generated by these models can bear an uncanny resemblance to extant artwork, sometimes including remains of the original artist's signature.<ref name="dude" /><ref name="Plunkett" /> In December 2022, users of the portfolio platform ArtStation staged an online protest against nonconsensual use of their artwork within datasets: this resulted in opt-out services, such as "Have I Been Trained?," increasing in profile, as well as some online art platforms promising to offer their own opt-out options.<ref name="massprotestartstation" /> According to the [[US Copyright Office]], artificial intelligence programs are unable to hold copyright,<ref name="smithsoniancopy" /><ref name="engadgetcopy" /><ref name="copygov" /> a decision upheld at the Federal District level as of August 2023 followed the reasoning from the [[monkey selfie copyright dispute]].<ref name="hollywoodreportercopy" />

An issue with many popular AI art programs is that they generate images based on artists' work without their consent.<ref name="newyorkerisstealing" /> In January 2023 three artists — [[Sarah Andersen]], [[Kelly McKernan]], and Karla Ortiz — filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit against [[Stability AI]], [[Midjourney]], and [[DeviantArt]], claiming that these companies have infringed the rights of millions of artists by training AI tools on five billion images scraped from the web without the consent of the original artists.<ref name="sdmjtargeted" /> In July 2023, U.S. District Judge [[William Orrick III|William Orrick]] inclined to dismiss most of the lawsuit filed by Andersen, McKernan, and Ortiz, but allowed them to file a new complaint.<ref name="judgeflaws" />

Also in 2023, Stability AI was sued by [[Getty Images]] for using its images in the training data.<ref name="gettysmad" />

===Income and employment stability===
[[File:Théâtre D’opéra Spatial.png|thumb|''[[Théâtre d'Opéra Spatial]]'', a Midjourney-generated image which won a digital art competition in 2022]]{{Main|Workplace impact of artificial intelligence|Technological unemployment}}
As generative AI image software such as [[Stable Diffusion]] and [[DALL-E]] continue to advance and proliferate, the potential problems and concerns that these systems pose on creativity and artistry has risen.<ref name="impactpaper" /> During 2022, artists working in various media raised concerns about the impact that [[generative artificial intelligence]] could have on their ability to earn money, particularly if AI-based images started replacing artists working in illustration and design industries. <ref name="spursdebate" /><ref name="canitbestopped" /> In August 2022, digital artist R. J. Palmer stated that "I could easily envision a scenario where using AI, a single artist or art director could take the place of 5-10 entry level artists... I have seen a lot of self-published authors and such say how great it will be that they don’t have to hire an artist."<ref name="Plunkett" /> Scholars Jiang et al. support this concern of job loss in creative fields by stating, “Leaders of companies like Open AI and Stability AI have openly stated that they expect generative AI systems to replace creatives imminently,” and adding that, “This labor displacement is evident across creative industries. For instance, according to an article on Rest of World, a Chinese gaming industry recruiter has noticed a 70% drop in illustrator jobs, in part due to the widespread use of image generators; another studio in China is reported to have laid off a third of its character design illustrators.” <ref name="impactpaper" />

AI-based images have become more commonplace in art markets and search engines because AI-based [[text-to-image]] systems are trained from pre-existing artistic images, sometimes without the original artist's consent, allowing the software to mimic specific artists' styles.<ref name="impactpaper" /><ref name="worries" /> For example, Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski has stated that it's more difficult to search for his work online because many of the images in the results are AI-generated specifically to mimic his style.<ref name="technologyreview" /> Furthermore, some training databases on which AI systems are based aren't accessible to the public, which makes it impossible to know the extent to which their training data contains copyright protected images. For example, a tool built by Simon Willison allowed people to search 0.5% of the training data for Stable Diffusion V1.1, i.e., 12 million of 2.3 billion instances from LAION 2B. Artist Karen Hallion discovered that their copyrighted images were used as training data without their consent.<ref name="impactpaper" />

The ability of AI-based art software to mimic or forge artistic style also raises concerns of malice or greed.<ref name="impactpaper" /><ref name="nytimes3" /><ref name="VicePiss" /> Works of AI-generated art, such as ''[[Théâtre d'Opéra Spatial]]'', a [[text-to-image]] AI illustration that won the grand prize in the August 2022 digital art competition at the Colorado State Fair, have begun to overwhelm art contests and other submission forums meant for small artists.<ref name="impactpaper" /><ref name="nytimes3" /><ref name="VicePiss" /> The [[Netflix]] short film ''[[The Dog & The Boy]]'', released in January 2023, received backlash online for its use of artificial intelligence art to create the film's background artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Min |title=Netflix Japan Is Drawing Ire for Using A.I. to Generate the Background Art of Its New Anime Short |url=https://news.artnet.com/news/netflix-japan-ai-anime-dog-and-boy-2251247 |publisher=[[Artnet]] |access-date=2 December 2023 |date=7 February 2023}}</ref>

===Deception===
[[File:Pope Francis in puffy winter jacket.jpg|thumb|A 2023 AI-generated image of [[Pope Francis]] wearing a puffy winter jacket fooled some viewers into believing it was an actual photograph.]]
The 2023 winner of the "creative open" category in the [[Sony World Photography Awards]], Boris Eldagsen, revealed after winning that his entry was actually generated by artificial intelligence. Photographer Feroz Khan commented to the BBC that Eldagsen had "clearly shown that even experienced photographers and art experts can be fooled".<ref name="refusesaward" /> Smaller contests have been affected as well; in 2023 a contest called the "[[Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off]] cover contest", run by author [[Mark Lawrence (author)|Mark Lawrence]], was cancelled after the winning entry was allegedly exposed to be a collage of images generated by Midjourney.<ref name="killedindie" />

Wider issues extend beyond the art world. As with other types of [[Photograph manipulation|photo manipulation]] since the early 19th century, some people in the early 21st century have been concerned that AI could be used to create content that is misleading, known as "[[deepfake]]s".<ref name="deepfakes" />

In May 2023, widespread attention was given to a [[Midjourney]]-generated photo of [[Pope Francis]] wearing a white puffer coat<ref name="forbespuffercoat" /><ref name="buzzfeedfooledtheworld" /> and another showing the fictional arrest of [[Donald Trump]],<ref name="independenttrump" /> and an AI-generated image of an attack on the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] went viral as a hoax news story on Twitter.<ref name="It Still Went Viral" />

=== Discrimination ===
AI-generated images have raised the concern that they can be made to damage an artist's reputation. Artist Sarah Andersen had her art copied and then used to depict [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] ideology. She stated that the spread of hate speech online can be worsened by the use of image generators.<ref name="impactpaper" /> Jiang et al. also add to this sentiment by stating that "tools trained on artists' works and which allow users to mimic their style without their consent or compensation, can cause significant reputational damage [by] spreading messages that they do not endorse."<ref name="impactpaper" />

Another major concern raised about AI-generated images and art is [[sampling bias]] within model training data leading towards discriminatory output from AI art models. In 2023, [[University of Washington]] researchers found evidence of racial bias within the Stable Diffusion model, with images of a "person" corresponding most frequently with images of males from Europe or North America.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Milne |first=Stefan |date=November 29, 2023 |title=AI image generator Stable Diffusion perpetuates racial and gendered stereotypes, study finds |work=UW News |url=https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/29/ai-image-generator-stable-diffusion-perpetuates-racial-and-gendered-stereotypes-bias/}}</ref>

== Ethics ==
AI produced images are causing many artists to be concerned about the way society values them and their output. Artists fear the production of AI will cause traditionally-made art to become devalued, with humans not being able to produce at the scale or price of an AI model.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Parra |first=Dex |date=February 24, 2023 |title=CASE STUDY: The Case of DALLE-2 |work=University of Texas at Austin, Center for Media Management |url=https://mediaengagement.org/research/the-ethics-of-ai-art/}}</ref>

AI systems have the ability to create deepfake content, which is often viewed as harmful and offensive. The creation of deepfakes poses a risk to individuals who have not consented to it.<ref name=":0" /> This mainly refers to revenge porn, where sexually explicit material is disseminated to humiliate or harm another person.

The public use of AI art is new, which means laws and policies regarding ownership have not been fully established. This poses a challenge when determining which parties own an image or video.

AI systems gather data in order to create solutions, when gathering data from various sources there becomes the question of whether or not the data can be used to produce a work.<ref name="ethicsofdatapractice" /> Galanter introduces a question of determining how to give credit through the thought process of differentiating the artist and the artistic influences.<ref name="ethicalrelationships" />

==Analysis of existing art using AI==
In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. This has been made possible due to large-scale [[digitization]] of artwork in the past few decades. Although the main goal of digitization was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.<ref name="ACM Transactions" />

Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.<ref name="ArtworksProcessed" /> Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece. Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties. In contrast, through distant viewing methods, the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized. Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification, [[object detection]], [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]] tasks, knowledge discovery in art history, and computational aesthetics.<ref name="ACM Transactions" /> Whereas distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.{{fact|date=August 2023}}

Researchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art such as [https://www.artemisdataset.org/ ArtEmis], a large-scale dataset with machine learning models that contain emotional reactions to visual art as well as predictions of emotion from images or text.<ref name="Achlioptas2021" />

According to CETINIC and SHE (2022), using artificial intelligence to analyse already-existing art collections can provide fresh perspectives on the development of artistic styles and the identification of artistic influences. AI-assisted study of existing art can also aid in the organization of art exhibitions and support the decision-making process for curators and art historians.<ref name="understandingandcreating" />

AI programs can automatically generate new images of artwork similar to those learned from the sample. Humans mainly just need to input data and discriminate output, the combination of AI mechanisms and human art creation mechanisms allows AI to produce works.<ref name="newharmonisation" />

== Other forms of art ==
Some prototype robots can create what may be considered forms of art – such as dynamic [[Robot#New functionalities and prototypes|cooking robots]] that [[Robotic sensing#Taste|can taste]] and readjust.<ref name="mastication-enhanced" />

There also is AI-assisted writing beyond copy-editing<ref name="poorenglishskills" /> (including support in the generation of fictional stories such as helping with [[writer's block]] or inspiration or rewriting segments).<ref name="koboldgithub" /><ref name="verge-canaiwrite" /><ref name="pcmagassistants" /><ref name="VergePrototype" />

Generative AI has also been used in video game production [[Artificial intelligence in video games beyond NPCs|beyond imagery]], especially for [[level design]] (e.g. for [[Video game modding|custom maps]]) and creating new content (e.g. for quests, dialogue) or interactive stories in video games.<ref name="Yannakakis" /><ref name="newlevelsbbc" />
