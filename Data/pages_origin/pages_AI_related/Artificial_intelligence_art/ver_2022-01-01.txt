'''Artificial intelligence Art''' refers to any artwork created with the assistance of [[artificial intelligence]]. It includes works created autonomously by AI systems and works that are a collaboration between a human and AI system.

== Examples of AI Art ==

Prominent artists using AI in their creative practice include: 
* [[Refik Anadol]] - Architecture and AI
* [[Sougwen Chung]] - Drawing and AI
*[[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]] - Drawing and AI
*[[Stephanie Dinkins]] - Social practice and AI
* [[Mario Klingemann]]  - Animation and AI
*[[Mauro Martino]] - Sculpture and AI
*[[Lauren McCarthy]]  - Performance and AI
*[[Wayne McGregor]] - Choreography and AI
*[[Eric Millikin]] - Video, VR and AI
*[[Trevor Paglen]] - Creativity and AI
*[[Anna Ridler]] - Photography, video and AI
*[[Karl Sims]] - Artificial life, animation and AI
*[[Pindar Van Arman]] - Creativity and AI

==Tools and processes==
There are many mechanisms for creating AI art, including procedural 'rule-based' generation of images using mathematical patterns, algorithms which simulate brush strokes and other painted effects, and artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks and transformers.

One of the first significant AI art systems is [[AARON]], developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s.<ref name="aaronshome"/>

Since their design in 2014, [[Generative adversarial network|Generative Adversarial Networks]] (GANs) are often used by AI artists. This is an AI system consisting of two elements.  The first is the "Generator", the second is the "Discriminator".  The discriminator is fed with images of existing art works, whilst the "Generator" attempts to create new images.  The role of the "Discriminator" is to see if it can spot which works are computer generated, whilst the generator tries to create works which fool the discriminator.  If the discriminator fails to spot a piece, that piece is considered successful.<ref name="christies" />

[[DeepDream]], released by [[Google]] in 2015, is one of the more well-known AI art tools. DeepDream uses a [[convolutional neural network]] to find and enhance patterns in [[Image|images]] via [[Algorithm|algorithmic]] [[pareidolia]], thus creating a [[dream]]-like [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.<ref name="codexample"/><ref name="goingdeeper"/><ref name="arxiv"/>

[[OpenAI]] released a series of images in January 2021 created using one of its algorithms "DALL-E". The program can use AI to generate a variety of drawings and pictures based on various text prompts.<ref name="nbc2" />

== Sales ==
An auction sale of artificial intelligence art was held at [[Christie's|Christie's Auction House]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 2018, where the AI artwork [[Edmond de Belamy]] sold for $432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The artwork was created by "Obvious", a [[Paris]]-based collective.<ref name=christies/><ref name=bbc/><ref name=nytimes/><ref name=nytimes2/>
