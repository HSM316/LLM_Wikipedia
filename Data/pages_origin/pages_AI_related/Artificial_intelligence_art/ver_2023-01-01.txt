There are many mechanisms for creating AI art, including procedural 'rule-based' generation of images using mathematical patterns, algorithms which simulate brush strokes and other painted effects, and artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks and transformers.

One of the first significant AI art systems is [[AARON]], developed by [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]] beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McCorduck |first=Pamela |title=AARONS's Code: Meta-Art.

In its primitive form, AARON created simple black and white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint. Cohen designed AARON to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Fine art print - crypto art |url=https://www.katevassgalerie.com/blog/harold-cohen-aaron-computer-art |access-date=2022-05-07 |website=Kate Vass Galerie |language=en-US}}</ref>

Since their design in 2014, [[generative adversarial networks]] (GANs) are often used by AI artists. This system uses a "generator" to create new images and a "discriminator" to decide which created images are considered successful.<ref name="GANnips">{{cite conference|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian|last2=Pouget-Abadie|first2=Jean|last3=Mirza|first3=Mehdi|last4=Xu|first4=Bing|last5=Warde-Farley|first5=David|last6=Ozair|first6=Sherjil|last7=Courville|first7=Aaron|last8=Bengio|first8=Yoshua|year=2014|title=Generative Adversarial Nets|url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf|conference=Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2014)|pages=2672–2680}}</ref> More recent models use ''Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network and Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training'' (VQGAN+CLIP).<ref name="adafruitVQGANCLIP">{{cite web |last1=Burgess |first1=Phillip |title=Generating AI “Art” with VQGAN+CLIP |url=https://learn.adafruit.com/generating-ai-art-with-vqgan-clip |website=[[Adafruit]] |access-date=July 20, 2022}}</ref>

Examples include [[Midjourney]], [[StyleGAN]], and [[Stable Diffusion]], among many others.<ref name="pharmapsychotic" />

Additional functionalities are under development and may improve various applications or enable new ones – such as {{anchor|Textual Inversion}}"Textual Inversion" which refers to enabling the use of user-provided [[concept]]s (like an object or a style) learned from few images.

Ever since artists began using AI to create art in the 20th century, the use of AI-generated art has sparked a number of debates. In the 2020s, some of those debates concerned whether AI art can be defined as art or not and concerning the impact it will have on artists.<ref>{{cite web|date=3 September 2022|title=AI won an art contest, and artists are furious|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html|author-last=Metz|author-first=Rachel|access-date=2 October 2022|work=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=12 September 2022|title=Flooded with AI-generated images, some art communities ban them completely|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/flooded-with-ai-generated-images-some-art-communities-ban-them-completely/|author-last=Edwards|author-first=Benj|access-date=2 October 2022|work=Ars Technica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=13 September 2022|title=AI art is everywhere right now.

In 1985, [[Pamela Samuelson]] considered the legal questions surrounding AI art authorship as it relates to copyright: who owns the copyright when the piece of art was created by artificial intelligence? Samuelson's article, "Allocating Ownership Rights in Computer-Generated Works," argued that rights should be allocated to the user of the generator program.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pamela |first=Samuelson |title=Allocating Ownership Rights in Computer-Generated Works |url=https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1112407?ln=en |journal=47 U. Pittsburgh L. Rev. 1185 (1985)}}</ref> In response to the same question, a 2019 ''[[Florida Law Review]]'' article has presented three possible choices. First, the artificial intelligence itself becomes the copyright owner. To do this, Section 101 of the Copyright Act would need to be amended to define "author" as a natural person or a computer. Second, following Samuelson's argument, the user, programmer, or artificial intelligence company is the copyright owner. This would be an expansion of the "work for hire" doctrine, under which ownership of a copyright is transferred to the "employer." Finally, no one becomes the copyright owner, and the work would automatically enter public domain. The argument here is that because no person "created" the piece of art, no one should be the copyright owner.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Victor |first=Palace |title=What if Artificial Intelligence Wrote This?

In 2022, coinciding with the rise of [[Stable Diffusion]]-based generation services, discussion renewed over the legality and ethics of AI-generated art. Of particular issue is the use of copyrighted art within AI training datasets: in September 2022, Reema Selhi, of the [[Design and Artists Copyright Society]], stated that "there are no safeguards for artists to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out."<ref name=Dude>{{cite web |author-last=Vallance |author-first=Chris |date=13 September 2022 |title="Art is dead Dude" - the rise of the AI artists stirs debate |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62788725 |access-date=2 October 2022 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Due to this, many images generated by these models will bear an uncanny resemblance to extant artwork, sometimes including remains of the original artist's signature.<ref name=Dude /><ref name=Plunkett>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/ai-art-dall-e-midjourney-stable-diffusion-copyright-1849388060|title=AI Creating 'Art' Is An Ethical And Copyright Nightmare|author-last=Plunkett|author-first=Luke|website=Kotaku|date=25 August 2022|accessdate=21 December 2022}}</ref> Such discussion came to a head in December, when users of the portfolio platform ArtStation staged an online protest against nonconsensual use of their artwork within datasets: this resulted in opt-out services, such as "Have I Been Trained?," increasing in profile, as well as some online art platforms promising to offer their own opt-out options.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/|title=Artists stage mass protest against AI-generated artwork on ArtStation|author-last=Edwards|author-first=Benj|website=Ars Technica|date=15 December 2022|accessdate=21 December 2022}}</ref>

===Concerns about impact on artists===
Some artists in 2022 have raised concerns about the impact AI art could have on their ability to earn money, particularly if AI art is used to replace artists working in illustration and design.<ref>{{cite web|date=10 August 2022|title=AI-generated digital art spurs debate about news illustrations|url=https://www.axios.com/2022/08/10/artificial-intelligence-digital-art-journalism|author-last=King|author-first=Hope|access-date=2 October 2022|work=Axios}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=16 September 2022|title=AI Is Coming For Commercial Art Jobs.

J. Palmer said in August 2022 that "I could easily envision a scenario where using AI a single artist or art director could take the place of 5-10 entry level artists... I have seen a lot of self-published authors and such say how great it will be that they don’t have to hire an artist," adding that "doing that kind of work for small creators is how a lot of us got our start as professional artists."<ref name=Plunkett /> Polish digital artist Greg Rutkowski said in September 2022 that "it's starting to look like a threat to our careers," adding that it has gotten more difficult to search for his work online because many of the images returned by search engines are generated by AI that was prompted to mimic his style.<ref name="technologyreview">{{cite web|date=16 September 2022|title=This artist is dominating AI-generated art.

===Issues of deepfakes===
As with other types of [[Photograph manipulation|photo manipulation]] since the early 19th century, some people in the early 21st century have been concerned that AI could be used to create content that is misleading, known as "[[deepfake]]s".<ref name="deepfakes"/>
