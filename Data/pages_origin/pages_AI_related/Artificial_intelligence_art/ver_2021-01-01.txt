'''Artificial Intelligence Art''' refers to any artwork created using [[Artificial intelligence]] software,<ref>AIArtists.org [https://aiartists.org/ AIArtists.org: "What is AI Art?"]</ref> such as Ahmed Elgammal's [https://aiartists.org/ahmed-elgammal AICAN], and Sougwen Chung's collaborative paintings  [https://aiartists.org/sougwen-chung Drawing Operations (Duet)]). 

One of the first significant AI artists was [[Harold Cohen (artist) | Harold Cohen]], who began developing the [[AARON]] system beginning in the 1960s. In the 1990s and 2000s, [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]] created artworks based on artificial evolution. AI art has greatly developed since 2018 with the discovery of [[generative adversarial networks]] (GANs), and how [[machine learning]] algorithms could be used to generate images. A [https://aiartists.org/ai-timeline-art timeline of AI art] illustrates how this artistic movement has evolved over time. 

== Sales ==
One AI-generated artwork that has been sold was at the Grand Palais at the Salon de Comparaison on February 13, 2018, by AI artist and scientist [http://www.alagraphy.com  "ALAgrApHY"] <ref name=alagraphy1/><ref name=fevrier/><ref name=franceinfo/>

An auction sale of artificial intelligence art was at [[Christie's|Christie's Auction House]] in [[New York City|New York]], where the AI artwork sold for $432,500, which was almost 45 times higher than its estimate of $7,000-$10,000. The artwork was created by "Obvious", a [[Paris]]-based collective consisting of Hugo Caselles-Dupré, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier.<ref name=christies/><ref name=bbc/><ref name=nytimes/><ref name=nytimes2/>

==Process==
"Obvious" uses a two step process to create their art.  The first step is the "Generator", the second is the "Discriminator".  The process is fed with images of existing art works and the "Generator" attempts to create new art works based on that input.  The role of the "Discriminator" is to see if it can spot which works are computer generated.  If it fails to spot a piece, that piece is considered successful.<ref name=christies/>

==Tools==
[https://Playform.io Playform] is a no-code AI Art generation platform. Playform has efficient implementations of different AI methods which allow artist and creative designers experiment and explore with AI as part of their process.  

[[DeepDream]] is one of the more well-known AI art tools, but there are many other tools that help artists create AI art. You can browse a list of [https://aiartists.org/ai-generated-art-tools tools to generate AI art here]. 

==Racism Warnings==
