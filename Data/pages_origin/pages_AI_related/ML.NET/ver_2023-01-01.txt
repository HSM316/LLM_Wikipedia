==Machine learning==
ML.NET brings model-based Machine Learning analytic and prediction capabilities to existing .NET developers. The framework is built upon .NET Core and .NET Standard inheriting the ability to run cross-platform on [[Linux]], [[Windows]] and [[macOS]]. Although the ML.NET framework is new, its origins began in 2002 as a Microsoft Research project named TMSN ([[text mining]] search and navigation) for use internally within Microsoft products. It was later renamed to TLC (the learning code) around 2011. ML.NET was derived from the TLC library and has largely surpassed its parent says Dr. James McCaffrey, Microsoft Research.<ref name="msdn05_Micr">{{Cite web | title = ML.NET: The Machine Learning Framework for .NET Developers | author = James McCaffrey | work = MSDN Magazine Connect() Special Issue 2018 | date = 2018-12-19 | access-date = 2019-01-09 | url = https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt848634/ | quote = Even though the ML.NET library is new, its origins go back many years. Shortly after the introduction of the Microsoft .NET Framework in 2002, Microsoft Research began a project called TMSN (“text mining search and navigation”) to enable software developers to include ML code in Microsoft products and technologies. The project was very successful, and over the years grew in size and usage internally at Microsoft. Somewhere around 2011 the library was renamed to TLC (“the learning code”). TLC is widely used within Microsoft and is currently in version 3.10. The ML.NET library is a descendant of TLC, with Microsoft-specific features removed. I’ve used both libraries and, in many ways, the ML.NET child has surpassed its parent. }}</ref>

Developers can train a Machine Learning Model or reuse an existing Model by a 3rd party and run it on any environment offline. This means developers do not need to have a background in Data Science to use the framework. Support for the [[open-source software|open-source]] Open Neural Network Exchange ([[Onnx|ONNX]]) [[Deep Learning]] model format was introduced from build 0.3 in ML.NET. The release included other notable enhancements such as Factorization Machines, [[LightGBM]], Ensembles, LightLDA transform and OVA.<ref name="github_rel_03">{{Cite web | title = Release Microsoft ML.NET v0.3 | work = Github| date = 2018-07-03 | access-date = 2018-07-03 | url =https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/release/preview/docs/release-notes/0.3/release-0.3.md/ }}</ref> The ML.NET integration of [[TensorFlow]] is enabled from the 0.5 release. Support for x86 & x64 applications was added to build 0.7 including enhanced recommendation capabilities with Matrix Factorization.<ref name="ms_nimbus">{{Cite web | title = Announcing ML.NET 0.7 (Machine Learning .NET) | work = Microsoft | date = 2018-11-08 | access-date = 2018-11-14 | url =https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/08/announcing-ml-net-0-7-machine-learning-net/ }}</ref> A full roadmap of planned features have been made available on the official GitHub repo.<ref name="github_roadmap">{{Cite web | title = The ML.NET Roadmap | work = Github| date = 2018-05-09 | access-date = 2018-06-30 | url =https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/d9d1216221701ee04951353e5180954056474cbf/ROADMAP.md/ }}</ref>

The first stable 1.0 release of the framework was announced at [[Build (developer conference)]] 2019. It included the addition of a Model Builder tool and [[Automated machine learning|AutoML]] (Automated Machine Learning) capabilities.<ref name="ms_build2019">{{Cite web | title = Announcing ML.NET 1.0 | work = Microsoft | date = 2019-05-06 | access-date = 2019-05-07 | url =https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ml-net-1-0/ }}</ref> Build 1.3.1 introduced a preview of Deep Neural Network training using C# bindings<ref>{{cite web |title=SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET |url=https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET |publisher=SciSharp STACK |date=21 February 2020}}</ref> for Tensorflow and a Database loader which enables model training on databases.

===Performance===
Microsoft's paper on machine learning with ML.NET demonstrated it is capable of training sentiment analysis models using large datasets while achieving high accuracy. Its results showed 95% accuracy on Amazon's 9GB review dataset.<ref name="arx_paper1">{{Cite journal | journal = Microsoft & Yandex | date = 2019-05-15 | arxiv = 1905.05715 | doi = 10.1145/3292500.3330667 | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Zeeshan | last2 = Amizadeh | first2 = Saeed | last3 = Bilenko | first3 = Mikhail | last4 = Carr | first4 = Rogan | last5 = Chin | first5 = Wei-Sheng | last6 = Dekel | first6 = Yael | last7 = Dupre | first7 = Xavier | last8 = Eksarevskiy | first8 = Vadim | last9 = Erhardt | first9 = Eric | last10 = Eseanu | first10 = Costin | last11 = Filipi | first11 = Senja | last12 = Finley | first12 = Tom | last13 = Goswami | first13 = Abhishek | last14 = Hoover | first14 = Monte | last15 = Inglis | first15 = Scott | last16 = Interlandi | first16 = Matteo | last17 = Katzenberger | first17 = Shon | last18 = Kazmi | first18 = Najeeb | last19 = Krivosheev | first19 = Gleb | last20 = Luferenko | first20 = Pete | last21 = Matantsev | first21 = Ivan | last22 = Matusevych | first22 = Sergiy | last23 = Moradi | first23 = Shahab | last24 = Nazirov | first24 = Gani | last25 = Ormont | first25 = Justin | last26 = Oshri | first26 = Gal | last27 = Pagnoni | first27 = Artidoro | last28 = Parmar | first28 = Jignesh | last29 = Roy | first29 = Prabhat | last30 = Shah | first30 = Sarthak | title = Machine Learning at Microsoft with ML.NET | pages = 2448–2458 | isbn = 9781450362016 | s2cid = 53380995 | display-authors = 29 }}</ref>

===Model builder===
The ML.NET CLI is a [[Command-line interface]] which uses ML.NET AutoML to perform model training and pick the best algorithm for the data. The ML.NET Model Builder preview<ref>{{cite web |title=dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder |url=https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder |publisher=.NET Platform |date=17 February 2020}}</ref> is an extension for [[Visual Studio]] that uses ML.NET CLI and ML.NET AutoML to output the best ML.NET Model using a [[GUI]].<ref name="ms_build2019"/>

===Model explainability===
[[fairness (machine learning)|AI fairness]] and [[explainable artificial intelligence|explainability]] has been an area of debate for AI Ethicists in recent years.<ref name="forbes_aifairness">{{Cite web | title = Artificial Intelligence Can Reinforce Bias, Cloud Giants Announce Tools For AI Fairness | work = Forbes | date = 2018-09-24 | access-date = 2018-12-05 | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulteich/2018/09/24/artificial-intelligence-can-reinforce-bias-cloud-giants-announce-tools-for-ai-fairness/ }}</ref> A major issue for Machine Learning applications is the black box effect where end users and the developers of an application are unsure of how an algorithm came to a decision or whether the dataset contains bias.<ref name="pwc_aiblackbox">{{Cite web | title = What it means to open AI's black box | work = PwC | date = 2018-05-15| access-date = 2018-12-05 | url = https://usblogs.pwc.com/emerging-technology/to-open-ai-black-box/ }}</ref> Build 0.8 included model explainability API's that had been used internally in Microsoft. It added the capability to understand the feature importance of models with the addition of 'Overall Feature Importance' and 'Generalized Additive Models'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hastie |first1=Trevor J. |title=Statistical Models in S |chapter=Generalized Additive Models |language=en |doi=10.1201/9780203738535-7 |date=1 November 2017|pages=249–307 |isbn=9780203738535 }}</ref>

When there are several variables that contribute to the overall score, it is possible to see a breakdown of each variable and which features had the most impact on the final score. The official documentation demonstrates that the scoring metrics can be output for debugging purposes. During training & debugging of a model, developers can preview and inspect live filtered data. This is possible using the [[Visual Studio]] DataView tools.<ref name="ms_explainability">{{Cite web | title = Announcing ML.NET 0.8 – Machine Learning for .NET | work = Microsoft | date = 2018-12-04| access-date = 2018-12-05 | url = https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/12/04/announcing-ml-net-0-8-machine-learning-for-net/ }}</ref>

===Infer.NET===
{{Main|Infer.NET}}
Microsoft Research announced the popular Infer.NET model-based machine learning framework used for research in academic institutions since 2008 has been released open source and is now part of the ML.NET framework.<ref name="register_infernet">{{Cite web | title = Microsoft open-sources Infer.NET AI code just in time for the weekend | work = The Register| date = 2018-10-05 | access-date = 2018-10-31 | url =https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/05/imicrosoft_nfernet/ }}</ref> The Infer.NET framework utilises [[probabilistic programming]] to describe [[probabilistic model]]s which has the added advantage of interpretability. The Infer.NET namespace has since been changed to Microsoft.ML.Probabilistic consistent with ML.NET namespaces.<ref name="packt_infernet">{{Cite web | title = Microsoft open sources Infer.NET, its popular model-based machine learning framework | work = Packt | date = 2018-10-08 | access-date = 2018-10-31 | url =https://hub.packtpub.com/microsoft-open-sources-infer-net-its-popular-model-based-machine-learning-framework }}</ref>

===NimbusML Python support===
Microsoft acknowledged that the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language is popular with Data Scientists, so it has introduced NimbusML the experimental Python bindings for ML.NET. This enables users to train and use machine learning models in Python. It was made open source similar to Infer.NET.<ref name="ms_nimbus" />

===Machine learning in the browser===
ML.NET allows users to export trained models to the [[Open Neural Network Exchange]] (ONNX) format.<ref name="onnx01">{{Cite web | title = ML.NET – Export Machine Learning.Net models to ONNX format | work = El Bruno | date = 2018-07-11 | access-date = 2019-01-09 | url = https://elbruno.com/2018/07/11/mlnet-export-machine-learning-net-models-to-onnx-format/ }}</ref> This establishes an opportunity to use models in different environments that don't use ML.NET. It would be possible to run these models in the client side of a browser using ONNX.js, a javascript client-side framework for deep learning models created in the Onnx format.<ref name="onnx02">{{Cite web | title = ONNX.js: Universal Deep Learning Models in The Browser | work = Will Badr | date = 2019-01-08 | access-date = 2019-01-09 | url = https://towardsdatascience.com/onnx-js-universal-deep-learning-models-in-the-browser-fbd268c67513/ }}</ref>
