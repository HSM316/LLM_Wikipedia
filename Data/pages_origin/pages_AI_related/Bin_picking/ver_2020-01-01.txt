'''Bin picking''' (also referred to as random bin picking<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robots.com/blog/viewing/the-future-of-automated-random-bin-picking|title=The Future of Automated Random Bin Picking|website=Robots.com}}</ref>, even sometimes referred to as "The Holy Grail in Sight"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-Industry-Insights/Robotic-Bin-Picking-The-Holy-Grail-in-Sight/content_id/6002|title=Robotic Bin Picking – The Holy Grail in Sight|website=Robotics Online}}</ref>) is a core problem in [[computer vision]] and [[robotics]].  The goal is to have a robot with sensors and cameras attached to it pick-up known objects with random poses out of a bin using a suction gripper, parallel gripper, or other kind of [[robot end effector]]. [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] previously held a competition focused on bin picking referred to as the "Amazon Picking Challenge", which was held from 2015 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robocup2016.org/en/events/amazon-picking-challenge/|title=Amazon Picking Challenge - RoboCup -|website=Robocup2016.org}}</ref>  The challenge tasked entrants with building their own robot hardware and software that could attempt simplified versions of the general task of picking and stowing items on shelves. The robots were scored by how many items were picked and stowed in a fixed amount of time. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazonrobotics.com/site/binaries/content/assets/amazonrobotics/arc/2017-amazon-robotics-challenge-rules-v3.pdf|title=Challenge Rules}}</ref> The first Amazon Robotics challenge was won by a team from TU Berlin in 2015, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazonrobotics.com/site/binaries/content/assets/amazonrobotics/pdfs/2015-apc-summary.pdf|title=2015 Results}}</ref> followed by a team from TU Delft in 2016. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/05/amazon-robot-picking-challenge-2016-winner/|title=2016 Winner}}</ref> The last Amazon Robotics Challenge was won by the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision at Queensland University of Technology with their robot named Cartman. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/aussies-win-amazon-robotics-challenge|title=2017 Results}}</ref> The Amazon Robotics/Picking Challenge was discontinued following the 2017 competition.

Although there can be some overlap, bin picking is not to be confused with each picking<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mhlc.com/archives/2015/Track%205-Innovate/T5S8%20Fully%20Automated%20Random%20Each%20Picking%E2%80%A6no,%20really..pdf|format=PDF|title=Fully Automated Random Each Picking…..no really|website=Mhlc.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1632460&HistoricalAwards=false|title=NSF Award Search: Award#1632460 - SBIR Phase II:  Versatile Robot Hands for Warehouse Automation|website=Nsf.gov}}</ref> or the [[bin packing problem]].
