'''Brain technology''', or self-learning know-how systems, defines a technology that employs latest findings in [[neuroscience]]. The term was first introduced by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in [[Zurich, Switzerland]], in the context of the [[ROBOY|Roboy]] project.<ref>[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/zuerich/uebersicht/die-zangengeburt-eines-designierten-stammvaters-1.18029566# ''NZZ- Die Zangengeburt eines möglichen Stammvaters''].

In particular, Brain Technology applications allow the visualization of the underlying learning architecture often coined as “know-how maps”.
