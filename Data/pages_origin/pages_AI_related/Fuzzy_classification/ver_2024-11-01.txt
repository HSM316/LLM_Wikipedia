Accordingly, fuzzy classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a [[fuzzy set]]. A fuzzy classification corresponds to a [[membership function]] <math display="inline">\mu_{\tilde{C}} : \tilde{PF} \times U \to \tilde{T}</math> that indicates the degree to which an individual <math display="inline">i\in U</math> is a member of the fuzzy class <math display="inline">\tilde{C}</math>, given its fuzzy classification [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] <math display="inline">\tilde{\Pi}_{\tilde{C}} \in \tilde{PF}</math>. Here, <math display="inline">\tilde{T}</math> is the set of fuzzy [[truth value]]s, i.e., the [[unit interval]] <math display="inline">[0,1]</math>. The fuzzy classification predicate <math display="inline">\tilde{\Pi} _{\tilde{C}}(i)</math> corresponds to the fuzzy restriction "<math display="inline">i</math> is a member of <math display="inline">\tilde{C}</math>".<ref name="Zadeh 1975" />

==Classification==
Intuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.

A [[class logic]]<ref>Glubrecht, J.-M., Oberschelp, A., & Todt, G. (1983). Klassenlogik. Mannheim/Wien/Zürich: Wissenschaftsverlag.</ref> is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator <math display="inline">\{\cdot|\cdot\}</math>. A ''class''

<math>C = \{ i | \Pi(i) \}</math>

is defined as a set C of individuals i satisfying a classification predicate Π which is a propositional function. The domain of the class operator { .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of propositional functions PF, and the range is the powerset of this universe P(U) that is, the set of possible subsets:

<math>\{\cdot|\cdot\} :V\times PF \rightarrow P(U)</math>

Here is an explanation of the logical elements that constitute this definition:
* An individual is a real object of reference.
* A universe of discourse is the set of all possible individuals considered.
* A variable <math display="inline">V: \rightarrow R</math> is a function which maps into a predefined range R without any given function arguments: a zero-place function.
* A propositional function is "an expression containing one or more undetermined constituents, such that, when values are assigned to these constituents, the expression becomes a proposition".<ref name="Russel 1919" />

In contrast, ''classification'' is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a set. A classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate Π.

<math>\mu :PF \times U \rightarrow T </math>

The membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership μ of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value τ of the classification predicate Π.

<math> \mu C(i):= \tau (\Pi(i)) </math>

In classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.
