==History==

It was launched in the summer of 2014.

==Overview==

S4 offers a suite of text analytics and [[linked data]] management in the cloud. You can analyze news, social media, biomedical documents and query Linked Data knowledge graphs. You can also create your own RDF knowledge graphs using GraphDB™.

S4 is low cost, on demand and [[Prepayment for service|pay-as-you-go]] providing affordable, easy access to companies of any size. The RDF triplestore included with S4 is GraphDB™ which is known for scalability and query performance. GraphDB™ is the only triplestore that performs inferencing at scale. Users realize improved query speed, data availability and accurate analysis.
With GraphDB it is possible to store, manage and search semantic triples extracted from S4 text mining or to create private Knowledge Graphs integrating structured and [[unstructured data]] with facts from public LOD datasets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neveq.com/en/stories/view/text-mining-semantic-technology-running-in-the-cloud-welcome-to-s4-from-ontotext|title=Text Mining & Semantic Technology Running in the Cloud – Welcome to "S4" from Ontotext &#124; NEVEQ}}</ref>
