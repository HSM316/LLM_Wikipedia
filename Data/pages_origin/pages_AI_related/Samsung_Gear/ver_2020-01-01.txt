'''Samsung Gear''' is a line of [[wearable computing]] devices produced by [[Samsung Electronics]].

The first device in the series, the [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]] smartwatch, was announced in 2013.<ref name=engadget-galaxygearunveil>{{cite web|title=Samsung unveils Galaxy Gear smartwatch with 1.63-inch AMOLED touchscreen, built-in camera, 70 apps|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/samsung-unveils-galaxy-gear/|work=Engadget|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> Since then, the line has expanded to include fitness bands and earbuds, as well as more smartwatches.

In February 2019, Samsung announced a new smartwatch, new fitness bands, and new earbuds under the "Samsung Galaxy," rather than "Samsung Gear," brand,<ref>{{cite web |title=Samsung Announces New Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Fit, and Galaxy Buds |url=https://www.droid-life.com/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-wearables-2019/ |website=Droid Life |publisher=Droid Life|date=2019-02-20 }}</ref> thus potentially switching wearable products to that name.
