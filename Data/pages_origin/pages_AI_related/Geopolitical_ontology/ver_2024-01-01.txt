The '''FAO geopolitical ontology''' is an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed by the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]] to describe, manage and exchange data related to [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] entities such as countries, territories, regions and other similar areas.

==Definitions and examples==
An [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] is a kind of dictionary that describes information  in a certain domain using concepts and relationships. It is often implemented using [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] (Web Ontology Language), an [[XML]]-based standard language  that can be interpreted by computers.

* A ''Concept'' is defined as abstract knowledge. For example, in the geopolitical ontology a [[United Nations list of non-self-governing territories|non-self-governing territory]] and a [[geographical region|geographical group]] are concepts. Concepts are explicitly implemented in the ontology with individuals and classes:
** An ''individual'' is defined as an object perceived from the real world. In the geopolitical domain [[Ethiopia]] and the [[least developed countries]] group are individuals.
** A ''class'' is defined as a set of individuals sharing common properties. In the geopolitical domain, [[Ethiopia]], [[Republic of Korea]] and [[Italy]] are individuals of the class ''self-governing'' territory; and [[least developed countries]] is an individual of the class ''special group''.
* Relationships between concepts are explicitly implemented by:
** ''[[Object (computer science)|Object]] properties'' between individuals of two classes. For example, ''has member'' and ''is in group'' properties, as shown in Figure 1.
** ''[[Datatype]] properties'' between individuals and literals or [[XML]] datatypes. For example, the individual [[Afghanistan]] has the datatype property ''CodeISO3'' with the value "AFG".
** ''Restrictions'' in classes and/or properties. For example, the property ''official English name'' of the class ''self-governing'' territory has been restricted to have only ''one'' value, this means that a self-governing territory (or country) can only have one internationally recognized official English name.<ref>Official names of countries from [http://www.fao.org/faoterm/nocs/pages/homeNocs.jsp?members=allC&lang=en&lang2=en FAO terminology database] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425183754/http://www.fao.org/faoterm/nocs/pages/homeNocs.jsp?members=allC&lang=en&lang2=en |date=2009-04-25 }}</ref>

The advantage of describing information in an ontology is that it enables to acquire [[domain knowledge]] by defining hierarchical structures of classes, adding individuals, setting object properties and datatype properties, and assigning restrictions.

==FAO ontology==
The geopolitical ontology provides names in seven languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, English, Spanish, Russian and Italian) and identifiers in various international coding systems ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO2]], [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|ISO3]], [[AGROVOC]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090219154825/http://www.fao.org/faoterm/index.asp?lang=en FAOTERM], [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]], [[UN]], [[List of UNDP country codes|UNDP]] and [[DBPedia]]ID codes) for territories and groups. Moreover, the [[FAO]] geopolitical ontology tracks historical changes from 1985 up until today;<ref>Country or area code changes since 1982:  [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49chang.htm United Nations Statistics Division - country or area codes added or changed]</ref> provides [[geolocation]] (geographical coordinates); implements relationships among [[countries]] and countries, or countries and groups, including properties such as ''has border with'', ''is predecessor of'', ''is successor of'', ''is administered by'', ''has members'', and ''is in group''; and disseminates country statistics including country area, land area, agricultural area, [[GDP]] or [[population]].

The FAO geopolitical ontology provides a structured description of data sources. This includes: source name, source identifier, source creator and source's update date. Concepts are described using the [[Dublin Core]] vocabulary (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description).

In summary, the main objectives of the FAO geopolitical ontology are:

* To provide the most updated geopolitical information (names, codes, relationships, statistics)
* To track historical changes in geopolitical information
* To improve information management and facilitate standardized [[data sharing]] of geopolitical information
* To demonstrate the benefits of the geopolitical ontology to improve [[interoperability]] of [[corporate]] [[information systems]]

It is possible to '''download''' the FAO geopolitical ontology in [http://aims.fao.org/geopolitical.owl OWL] and [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ RDF] formats. Documentation is available in the [[FAO Country Profiles]] [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo.asp?lang=en Geopolitical information] web page.

==Features of the FAO ontology==
The geopolitical ontology contains :

*Area types:<ref>When an area (territory or group) changed but kept the same name, the ontology differentiates the two areas by sub-fixing the name of the obsolete one with the year (e.g. “FAO 2006”). The year indicates the beginning of validity of that particular area.</ref>
**Territories: [[List of sovereign states|self-governing]], [[United Nations list of non-self-governing territories|non-self-governing]], [[Disputed area|disputed]], other.<ref>The area type ''Other'' is used for [[Antarctica]] which has no government and belongs to no country. See also [[Antarctica#Politics|Politics in Antarctica]].</ref>
**Groups: [[organizations]], [[subregion|geographic]], [[economic union|economic]] and special groups.<ref>Special groups term is used for non-economical or greographical territory groups like the [[Small Island Developing States]], [[Landlocked countries|Land Locked Countries]], Low Income Food Deficit Countries, [[Least Developed Countries]], etc.</ref>
*Names <ref>UN official names: [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/uncsgnreports.htm Reports of the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130040044/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/uncsgnreports.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}</ref> (official, short and names for lists) in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Italian.
*International codes: UN code – M49, [[ISO 3166]] Alpha-2 and Alpha-3, [[List of UNDP country codes|UNDP code]], [[Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)|GAUL]] code, FAOSTAT, [[AGROVOC]] FAOTERM and [[DBPedia]]ID.
*Coordinates: maximum [[latitude]], minimum [[latitude]], maximum [[longitude]], minimum [[longitude]].
*Basic country statistics: country area, land area, agricultural area, GDP, population.
*Currency names and codes.
*Adjectives of nationality.
*Relations:
**Groups membership.
**Neighbours (land [[border]]), administration of [[United Nations list of non-self-governing territories|non-self-governing]].
**Historic changes: predecessor, successor, valid since,<ref>The value of the datatype property "validSince" is the first year of validity  of a territory or group. The geopolitical ontology traces back historic changes only until 1985. Therefore if an area has a validSince = 1985, this indicates that the area is valid at least since 1985.</ref> valid until.<ref>The value of the datatype property "validUntil" is the last year of validity of the territory or group. In case the area is currently valid, this value is set by default to 9999.</ref>

==Implementation into  OWL==
The [[FAO]] geopolitical ontology is implemented in [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. It consists of classes, properties, individuals and restrictions. Table 1 shows all classes, gives a brief description and lists some individuals that belong to each class. Note that the current version of the geopolitical ontology does not provide individuals of the class "disputed" territories. Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate datatype properties and object properties.

== Geopolitical ontology in Linked Open Data ==

The FAO Geopolitical ontology is embracing the W3C [[Linked Open Data]] (LOD) initiative<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://linkeddata.org/ |title=Linked Data &#124; Linked Data - Connect Distributed Data across the Web |access-date=2011-07-08 |archive-date=2020-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205064936/http://linkeddata.org/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and released its [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] version of the geopolitical ontology in March 2011. 
The term 'Linked Open Data' refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web. The key technologies that support Linked Data are URIs, HTTP and RDF.

The RDF version of the geopolitical ontology is compliant with all [http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html Linked data principles] to be included in the [http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/ Linked Open Data cloud], as explained in the following.

==Resolvable http:// URIs ==
Every resource in the OWL format of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has a unique URI. Dereferenciation was implemented to allow for three different URIs to be assigned to each resource as follows:  
* URI identifying the non-information  resource
* Information resource with an RDF/XML representation
* Information resource with an HTML representation
In addition the current URIs used for OWL format needed to be kept to allow for backwards compatibility for other systems that are using them. Therefore, the new URIs for the FAO Geopolitical Ontology in LOD were carefully created, using  “Cool URIs for Semantic Web”  and considering other good practices for URIs, such as DBpedia URIs.

==New URIs==
The URIs of the geopolitical ontology need to be permanent, consequently all transient information, such as year, version, or format was avoided in the definition of the URIs. 
The new URIs can be accessed at
http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/ 
For example, for the resource “Italy” the URIs are the following: 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy
: identifies the non-information resource. 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data/Italy
: identifies the resource with an RDF/XML representation. 
;http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy
:identifies the information resource with an HTML representation.
In addition, “owl:[[sameAs]]” is used to map the new URIs to the OWL representation.

==Dereferencing URIs==
When a non-information resource is looked up without any specific representation format, then the server needs to redirect the request to information resource with an HTML representation. 
For example, to retrieve the resource “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/resource/Italy), which is a non-information resource, the server redirects to the HTML page of “Italy” (http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/page/Italy).

==At least 1000 triples in the datasets==
The total number of triple statements in FAO Geopolitical Ontology is 22,495. 
At least 50 links to a dataset already in the current LOD Cloud:  
FAO Geopolitical Ontology has 195 links to [http://www.dbpedia.org DBpedia], which is already part of the LOD Cloud.

==Access to the entire dataset==
FAO Geopolitical Ontology provides the entire dataset as a RDF dump. It is available at http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/geoinfo/geopolitical/data

The RDF version of the FAO Geopolitical Ontology has been already registered in CKAN (http://ckan.net/package/fao-geopolitical-ontology{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and it was requested to add it into the LOD Cloud.

==Example of use==
[[Image:Geopolitical Ontology in Country Profiles August 12 2009 v 1.png|thumb|200px|right|Figure 3. a website of introducing the geopolitical ontology in FAO Country Profiles.]]

The [[FAO Country Profiles]] is an information retrieval tool which groups the FAO's vast archive of information on its global activities in [[agriculture]] and [[rural development]] in one single area and catalogues it exclusively by country.

The [[FAO Country Profiles]] system provides access to country-based heterogeneous data sources.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp Inventory of data sources used in the FAO country profiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925011534/http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/resources.asp |date=2009-09-25 }}</ref> By using the  geopolitical ontology in the system, the following benefits are expected:<ref>[http://semanticweb.com/integrating-country-based-heterogeneous-data-at-the-united-nations-fao-s-geopolitical-ontology-and-services_b10681 Integrating country-based heterogeneous data at the United Nations: FAO's geopolitical ontology and services.]</ref>

* Enhanced system functionality for content aggregation and synchronization from the multiple source repositories.
* Improved information access and browsing through comparison of data in neighbor countries and groups.

Figure 3 shows a page in the [[FAO Country Profiles]] where the geopolitical ontology is described.
