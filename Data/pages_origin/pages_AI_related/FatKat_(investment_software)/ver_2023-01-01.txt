'''FatKat''', Inc. is a privately held company founded in 1999 by [[Raymond Kurzweil|Raymond C. Kurzweil]], an author, inventor, and [[futurist]]. He's perhaps best known for creating an [[optical character recognition]] system that – in conjunction with a [[flatbed scanner]] and [[speech synthesis|text-to-speech synthesizer]] – reads text aloud to the sight-impaired. FatKat is an acronym derived from "financial accelerating transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies". The aforesaid company is one of a total of nine Kurzweil companies.<ref name="Port">{{cite news |first=Otis |last=Port |title=Raymond C. Kurzweil: Prophet of Longevity |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_31/b3945019.htm |work=BusinessWeek |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=10 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231061422/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_31/b3945019.htm |archivedate=31 December 2008 }}</ref>

The purpose of FatKat as listed with the [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth]] Corporations Division is "investment software".<ref name="Massachusetts">{{cite web |title = Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, Corporations Division | url =http://www.sec.state.ma.us/COR/coridx.htm}}</ref> Kurzweil, who specializes in [[artificial intelligence]] coupled with [[pattern recognition]], has created [[computer software|software]] that uses [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] to pick [[stock]]s for investment purposes.<ref name="Duhigg">{{cite news | first=Charles| last=Duhigg | title=A Smarter Computer to Pick Stock | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/business/24trading.html | work=New York Times Late Edition (East Coast)| pages= C-1 | date=24 November 2006 |issn=0362-4331 | accessdate=10 December 2008 }}</ref>

Although selecting stocks based on software-generated recommendations is not new, FatKat's approach was unique at the time because of its “nonlinear decision making processes more akin to how a brain operates.” In layman's terms, the software can evolve by creating different rules, letting them compete, and using (or combining) the best outcomes. After FatKat's inception, other investment and/or software companies rushed to develop software based on this and similar [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] [[evolution]]ary principles, using [[genetic algorithm]]s.<ref name="Duhigg"/>

In 2005, Kurzweil reported that the FatKat software was "doing very well – 50% to 100% returns for the last two years".<ref name="Port"/>  But as of December 2008, FatKat does not offer its software for sale.
