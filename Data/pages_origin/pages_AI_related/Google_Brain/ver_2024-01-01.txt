'''Google Brain''' was a [[deep learning]] [[artificial intelligence]] research team under the umbrella of [[Google AI]], a research division at Google dedicated to artificial intelligence. Formed in 2011, Google Brain combined open-ended machine learning research with information systems and large-scale computing resources.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-06|title=What is Google Brain?|url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-google-brain/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=GeeksforGeeks|language=en-us}}</ref> The team has created tools such as [[TensorFlow]], which allow for neural networks to be used by the public, with multiple internal AI research projects.<ref name=":2" /> The team aims to create research opportunities in [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]].<ref name=":2" /> The team was merged into former Google sister company DeepMind to form [[Google DeepMind]] in April 2023.

==History==
The Google Brain project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google fellow [[Jeff Dean (computer scientist)|Jeff Dean]], Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and [[Stanford University]] professor [[Andrew Ng]].<ref name=nyt-cats /> Ng had been interested in using [[deep learning]] techniques to crack the problem of [[artificial intelligence]] since 2006, and in 2011 began collaborating with Dean and Corrado to build a large-scale deep learning software system, [[DistBelief]],<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jeffrey Dean|title=Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4687-large-scale-distributed-deep-networks.pdf|date=December 2012|access-date=25 October 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> on top of Google's cloud computing infrastructure. Google Brain started as a [[Google X]] project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: [[Astro Teller]] has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of [[Google X]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Conor Dougherty|title=Astro Teller, Google's 'Captain of Moonshots,' on Making Profits at Google X|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/googles-captain-of-moonshots-on-making-profits-at-google-x/|date = 16 February 2015|access-date=25 October 2015}}</ref>

In June 2012, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that a cluster of 16,000 [[Central processing unit|processors]] in 1,000 [[Computer|computers]] dedicated to mimicking some aspects of [[Brain activity|human brain activity]] had successfully trained itself to recognize a [[cat]] based on 10 million digital images taken from [[YouTube]] videos.<ref name=nyt-cats>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/technology/in-a-big-network-of-computers-evidence-of-machine-learning.html?pagewanted=all|title = How Many Computers to Identify a Cat? 16,000|last = Markoff|first = John|author-link = John Markoff|date = June 25, 2012|access-date = February 11, 2014|newspaper = The New York Times}}</ref> The story was also covered by [[National Public Radio]].<ref name=npr-cats>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/26/155792609/a-massive-google-network-learns-to-identify|title = A Massive Google Network Learns To Identify — Cats|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = June 26, 2012|access-date = February 11, 2014}}</ref>

In March 2013, Google hired [[Geoffrey Hinton]], a leading researcher in the [[deep learning]] field, and acquired the company DNNResearch Inc. headed by Hinton. Hinton said that he would be dividing his future time between his university research and his work at Google.<ref>{{cite press release|title=U of T neural networks start-up acquired by Google|date=12 March 2013|location=Toronto, ON|url=http://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/u-of-t-neural-networks-start-up-acquired-by-google/|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref>

In April 2023, Google Brain merged with Google sister company DeepMind to form [[Google DeepMind]], as part of the company's continued efforts to accelerate work on AI.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Roth |first1=Emma |last2=Peters |first2=Jay |date=April 20, 2023 |title=Google's big AI push will combine Brain and DeepMind into one team |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691468/google-ai-deepmind-brain-merger |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230420234052/https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691468/google-ai-deepmind-brain-merger |archive-date=April 20, 2023 |access-date=April 21, 2023 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>

==Projects==
===Artificial-intelligence-devised encryption system===
In October 2016, Google Brain designed an experiment to determine that [[Neural network|neural networks]] are capable of learning secure [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption]].<ref name=":15">{{Cite book|last1=Zhu|first1=Y.|last2=Vargas|first2=D.

===Image enhancement===
In February 2017, Google Brain determined a [[probabilistic method]] for converting pictures with 8x8 [[Image resolution|resolution]] to a resolution of 32x32.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dahl|first1=Ryan|last2=Norouzi|first2=Mohammad|last3=Shlens|first3=Jonathon|date=2017|title=Pixel Recursive Super Resolution|arxiv=1702.00783|bibcode=2017arXiv170200783D}}</ref><ref name=":14">{{cite web|date=2017-02-07|title=Google Brain super-resolution image tech makes "zoom, enhance!" real|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/google-brain-super-resolution-zoom-enhance/|access-date=2017-05-15|website=arstechnica.co.uk}}</ref> The method built upon an already existing probabilistic model called pixelCNN to generate pixel translations.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Bulat|first1=Adrian|date=2018|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01231-1_12|work=Computer Vision – ECCV 2018|pages=187–202|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-01230-4|access-date=2021-04-09|last2=Yang|first2=Jing|last3=Tzimiropoulos|first3=Georgios|title=To Learn Image Super-Resolution, Use a GAN to Learn How to do Image Degradation First |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=11210 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-01231-1_12|arxiv=1807.11458|s2cid=51882734}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oord|first1=Aaron Van|last2=Kalchbrenner|first2=Nal|last3=Kavukcuoglu|first3=Koray|date=2016-06-11|title=Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/oord16.html|journal=International Conference on Machine Learning|language=en|publisher=PMLR|pages=1747–1756|arxiv=1601.06759}}</ref>

=== Google Translate ===
The Google Brain team contributed to the [[Google Translate]] project by employing a new deep learning system that combines artificial neural networks with vast databases of [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] texts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Castelvecchi|first=Davide|title=Deep learning boosts Google Translate tool|url=http://www.nature.com/news/deep-learning-boosts-google-translate-tool-1.20696|journal=Nature News|year=2016|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20696|s2cid=64308242}}</ref> In September 2016, [[Google Neural Machine Translation]] ([[Google Neural Machine Translation|GNMT]]) was launched, an end-to-end learning framework, able to learn from a large number of examples.<ref name=":0" /> Previously, Google Translate's Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) approach would statistically analyze word by word and try to match corresponding words in other languages without considering the surrounding phrases in the sentence.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Lewis-Kraus|first=Gideon|date=2016-12-14|title=The Great A.I.

While the introduction of the GNMT has increased the quality of Google Translate's translations for the pilot languages, it was very difficult to create such improvements for all of its 103 languages. Addressing this problem, the Google Brain Team was able to develop a [[Multilingualism|Multilingual]] [[Google Neural Machine Translation|GNMT]] system, which extended the previous one by enabling translations between multiple languages. Furthermore, it allows for Zero-Shot Translations, which are translations between two languages that the system has never explicitly seen before.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Melvin|last2=Schuster|first2=Mike|last3=Le|first3=Quoc V.|last4=Krikun|first4=Maxim|last5=Wu|first5=Yonghui|last6=Chen|first6=Zhifeng|last7=Thorat|first7=Nikhil|last8=Viégas|first8=Fernanda|last9=Wattenberg|first9=Martin|last10=Corrado|first10=Greg|last11=Hughes|first11=Macduff|date=2017-10-01|title=Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation|journal=Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics|volume=5|pages=339–351|doi=10.1162/tacl_a_00065|issn=2307-387X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Google announced that Google Translate can now also translate without transcribing, using neural networks. This means that it is possible to translate speech in one language directly into text in another language, without first transcribing it to text. 

According to the Researchers at Google Brain, this intermediate step can be avoided using neural networks. In order for the system to learn this, they exposed it to many hours of Spanish audio together with the corresponding English text. The different layers of neural networks, replicating the human brain, were able to link the corresponding parts and subsequently manipulate the audio waveform until it was transformed to English text.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Matt|title=Google uses neural networks to translate without transcribing|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2126738-google-uses-neural-networks-to-translate-without-transcribing/|website=New Scientist|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> Another drawback of the GNMT model is that it causes the time of translation to increase exponentially with the number of words in the sentence.<ref name=":2" /> This caused the Google Brain Team to add 2000 more processors to ensure the new translation process would still be fast and reliable.<ref name=":1" />

=== Robotics ===
Aiming to improve traditional robotics control algorithms where new skills of a robot need to be [[Programming language|hand-programmed]], robotics researchers at Google Brain are developing [[machine learning]] techniques to allow robots to learn new skills on their own.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|last2=Dawson|first2=Brian|last3=Felling|first3=Meg|date=2019-03-26|title=Inside Google's Rebooted Robotics Program|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/technology/google-robotics-lab.html|access-date=2021-04-08|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> They also attempt to develop ways for information sharing between robots so that robots can learn from each other during their learning process, also known as [[cloud robotics]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2018-10-24|title=Google Cloud Robotics Platform coming to developers in 2019|url=https://www.therobotreport.com/google-cloud-robotics-platform/|access-date=2021-04-08|website=The Robot Report|language=en-US}}</ref> As a result, Google has launched the Google Cloud Robotics Platform for developers in 2019, an effort to combine [[robotics]], [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and the [[Cloud computing|cloud]] to enable efficient robotic automation through cloud-connected collaborative robots.<ref name=":3" />

Google Brain researchers have collaborated with other companies and academic institutions on robotics research. In 2016, the Google Brain Team collaborated with researchers at [[X Development|X]] in a research on learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Sergey|last2=Pastor|first2=Peter|last3=Krizhevsky|first3=Alex|last4=Ibarz|first4=Julian|last5=Quillen|first5=Deirdre|date=2018-04-01|title=Learning hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping with deep learning and large-scale data collection|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|language=en|volume=37|issue=4–5|pages=421–436|doi=10.1177/0278364917710318|issn=0278-3649|doi-access=free}}</ref> Their method allowed real-time robot control for grasping novel objects with self-correction.<ref name=":7" /> In 2020, researchers from Google Brain, Intel AI Lab, and UC Berkeley created an AI model for robots to learn surgery-related tasks such as suturing from training with surgery videos.<ref name=":6" />

=== Interactive Speaker Recognition with Reinforcement Learning ===
In 2020, Google Brain Team and [[University of Lille]] presented a model for automatic speaker recognition which they called Interactive Speaker Recognition. The ISR module recognizes a speaker from a given list of speakers only by requesting a few user specific words.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Seurin|first1=Mathieu|last2=Strub|first2=Florian|last3=Preux|first3=Philippe|last4=Pietquin|first4=Olivier|date=2020-10-25|title=A Machine of Few Words: Interactive Speaker Recognition with Reinforcement Learning|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2020-2892|journal=Interspeech 2020|pages=4323–4327|location=ISCA|publisher=ISCA|doi=10.21437/interspeech.2020-2892|arxiv=2008.03127|s2cid=221083446}}</ref> The model can be altered to choose speech segments in the context of [[Speech synthesis|Text-To-Speech]] Training.<ref name=":12" /> It can also prevent malicious voice generators from accessing the data.<ref name=":12" />

=== TensorFlow ===
{{Main|TensorFlow}}
TensorFlow is an open source software library powered by Google Brain that allows anyone to utilize machine learning by providing the tools to train one's own neural network.<ref name=":2" /> The tool has been used to develop software using deep learning models that farmers use to reduce the amount of manual labor required to sort their yield, by training it with a data set of human-sorted images.<ref name=":2" />

=== Magenta ===
Magenta is a project that uses Google Brain to create new information in the form of art and music rather than classify and sort existing data.<ref name=":2" /> [[TensorFlow]] was updated with a suite of tools for users to guide the [[neural network]] to create images and music.<ref name=":2" /> However, the team from [[Valdosta State University]] found that the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] struggles to perfectly replicate human intention in [[Art|artistry]], similar to the issues faced in [[translation]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Medical applications ===
The image sorting capabilities of Google Brain have been used to help detect certain medical conditions by seeking out patterns that human doctors may not notice to provide an earlier diagnosis.<ref name=":2" /> During screening for breast cancer, this method was found to have one quarter the false positive rate of human pathologists, who require more time to look over each photo and cannot spend their entire focus on this one task.<ref name=":2" /> Due to the neural network's very specific training for a single task, it cannot identify other afflictions present in a photo that a human could easily spot.<ref name=":2" />

===Text-to-image model===
Google Brain announced in 2022 that it created two different types of [[text-to-image model]]s called Imagen and Parti that compete with [[OpenAI]]'s [[DALL-E]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=All these images were generated by Google's latest text-to-image AI |url=https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/24/23139297/google-imagen-text-to-image-ai-system-examples-paper |access-date=May 28, 2022 |work=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |date=May 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Imad |title=Google's Parti Generator Relies on 20 Billion Inputs to Create Photorealistic Images |url=https://www.cnet.com/tech/googles-parti-generator-relies-on-20-billion-inputs-to-create-photorealistic-images/ |website=CNET |access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref>
