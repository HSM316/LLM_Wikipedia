In [[mathematics]], '''vague sets''' are an extension of [[fuzzy set]]s.

In a fuzzy set, each object is assigned a single [[Value (mathematics)|value]] in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1] reflecting its ''grade of [[Element (mathematics)|membership]]''. This [[Single-valued function|single value]] does not allow a separation of [[Mathematical proof|evidence]] for membership and evidence against membership.

Gau et al.<ref>[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/229476/ "Vague sets"].</ref> proposed the notion of vague sets, where each object is characterized by two different membership [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]: a true membership function and a false membership function.
This kind of reasoning is also called interval membership, as opposed to point membership in the context of fuzzy sets.

==Mathematical definition==
A vague set <math>V</math> is characterized by
* its true membership function <math>t_v(x)</math>
* its false membership function <math>f_v(x)</math>
* with <math>0 \le t_v(x)+f_v(x) \le 1</math>

The ''grade of membership'' for ''x'' is not a crisp value anymore, but can be located in <math>[t_v(x), 1-f_v(x)]</math>. This interval can be interpreted as an extension to the fuzzy membership function. The vague set degenerates to a fuzzy set, if <math>1-f_v(x)=t_v(x)</math> for all ''x''.
The ''uncertainty'' of ''x'' is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the membership interval; it can be computed as <math>(1-f_v(x))-t_v(x)</math>.
