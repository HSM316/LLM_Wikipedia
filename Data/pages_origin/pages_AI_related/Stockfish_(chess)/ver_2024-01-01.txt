'''Stockfish''' is a [[free and open-source]] [[chess engine]], available for various desktop and mobile platforms. It can be used in [[Computer chess|chess software]] through the [[Universal Chess Interface]].

Stockfish has consistently ranked first in most of the chess engine rating lists and, as of December 2023, is the strongest CPU chess engine in the world with an estimated [[Elo rating system|Elo]] rating of 3546 (CCRL 40/15).<ref>{{Cite web |title=CCRL 40/15 - Index |url=https://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/index.html |access-date=2023-02-03 |website=computerchess.org.uk}}</ref> It has won all the main events in the [[Top Chess Engine Championship]] (TCEC) and the [[Chess.com Computer Chess Championship]] (CCC) since 2020. 

The Stockfish engine was developed by Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba, and Joona Kiiski. It is now being developed and maintained by the Stockfish community.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Engine authors|url=https://stockfishchess.org/about/#engine-authors|access-date=3 July 2023|website=Stockfish|language=en}}</ref> It is derived from Glaurung, an open-source engine by Tord Romstad released in 2004.

== Features ==
Stockfish can use up to 1024 [[central processing unit|CPU thread]]s in [[multiprocessor]] systems. The maximal size of its [[transposition table]] is 32 TB. Stockfish implements an advanced [[alpha–beta search]] and uses [[bitboard]]s. Compared to other engines, it is characterized by its great search depth, due in part to more aggressive [[Alpha–beta pruning|pruning]] and [[late move reductions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?start=0&t=50220|title=Stockfish depth vs. others; challenge|date=24 November 2013|last=Kaufman|first=Larry|author-link=Larry Kaufman|work=TalkChess.com|access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref> {{As of|2023|10}}, Stockfish 16 (4-threaded) achieves an [[Elo rating]] of 3536{{+-|16|16}} on the CCRL 40/15 benchmark.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CCRL 40/15 - Index |url=https://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/ |access-date=2023-01-15 |website=ccrl.chessdom.com}}</ref>

Stockfish supports [[Chess960]], which is one feature that was inherited from Glaurung.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Computer Engines – Chess960.net |url=https://chess960.net/engines/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |language=en-AU}}</ref> The [[Syzygy (tablebase)|Syzygy]] [[Endgame tablebase|tablebase]] support, previously available in a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] maintained by Ronald de Man, was integrated into Stockfish in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://abrok.eu/stockfish_syzygy/ | title=Stockfish development versions | work=abrok.eu | access-date=1 February 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111094041/http://abrok.eu/stockfish_syzygy/ | archive-date=11 November 2014 }}</ref> In 2018 support for the 7-men Syzygy was added, shortly after becoming available.<ref>{{Cite web |title=7-piece Syzygy tablebases are complete |url=https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=lichess.org |date=19 August 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Stockfish has been a very popular engine on various platforms. On desktop, it is the default chess engine bundled with the [[Internet Chess Club]] interface programs BlitzIn and Dasher. On mobile, it has been bundled with the Stockfish app, SmallFish and Droidfish. Other Stockfish-compatible [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) include [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]], Arena, Stockfish for Mac, and [[PyChess]].<ref>[http://support.stockfishchess.org/kb/getting-started/using-the-stockfish-engine Using the Stockfish Engine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109115948/http://support.stockfishchess.org/kb/getting-started/using-the-stockfish-engine |date=2018-01-09 }}, Stockfish Support.</ref><ref>[https://github.com/pychess/pychess/wiki/ChessEngines ChessEngines], PyChess Github.</ref> Stockfish can be compiled to [[WebAssembly]] or [[JavaScript]], allowing it to run in the browser. Both [[chess.com]] and [[Lichess]] provide Stockfish in this form in addition to a server-side program.<ref name="lichess" /> Release versions and development versions are available as [[C++]] [[source code]] and as precompiled versions for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]] 32-bit/64-bit and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

== Architecture ==
The Stockfish engine essentially consists of three parts: [[Board representation (computer chess)|board representation]], [[Tree search|heuristic tree search]], and board evaluation. Board representation is about coding a chess board state efficiently so that it can be efficiently stored and searched over. Heuristic tree search approximates minimax tree search, which would be too slow to perform. Board evaluation takes in a board representation and gives it a score for how "good" the board is (i.e. the estimated chances of winning).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockfish - Chessprogramming wiki |url=https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=www.chessprogramming.org}}</ref>

Starting with Stockfish 12 (2020), a neural network board evaluation function was incorporated. In Stockfish 16 (2023), the classical board evaluation functions were removed, leaving just the neural network.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

== History ==
The program originated from ''Glaurung'', an open-source chess engine created by Romstad and first released in 2004. Four years later, Costalba, inspired by the strong open-source engine, decided to fork the project. He named it ''[[Stockfish]]'' because it was "produced in Norway and cooked in Italy" (Romstad is Norwegian, Costalba is Italian). The first version, Stockfish 1.0, was released in November 2008.<ref name="About">{{cite web | url=http://stockfishchess.org/about/ | title=About | work=stockfishchess.org | access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Stockfish 1.0">{{cite web | url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=24675 | title=Stockfish 1.0 | last=Costalba | first=Marco | date=2 November 2008 | work=talkchess.com | access-date=6 March 2014}}</ref> For a while, new ideas and code changes were transferred between the two programs in both directions, until Romstad decided to discontinue Glaurung in favor of Stockfish, which was the more advanced engine at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wbec-ridderkerk.forumotion.com/t402-stockfish-glaurung#883 | title=Re: Stockfish – Glaurung | last=Romstad | first=Tord | date=5 September 2009 | work=wbec-ridderkerk.forumotion.com | access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> The last Glaurung version (2.2) was released in December 2008.

Around 2011, Romstad decided to abandon his involvement with Stockfish in order to spend more time on his new iOS chess app.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Logics (Kings_Logics) |first=Kings |title=Stockfish |url=https://www.chess.com/blog/Kings_Logics/stockfish |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Chess.com |date=21 June 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref> On 18 June 2014 Marco Costalba announced that he had "decided to step down as Stockfish maintainer" and asked that the community create a fork of the current version and continue its development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/fishcooking/VsYuyij6uqQ|title=Step down|last=Costalba|first=Marco|work=groups.google.com|date=18 June 2014|access-date=19 June 2014}}</ref> An official repository, managed by a volunteer group of core Stockfish developers, was created soon after and currently manages the development of the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/fishcooking/aUqC13mtSEg|title=New official repository|last=Linscott|first=Gary|work=groups.google.com|date=18 June 2014|access-date=19 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Fishtest ===
Since 2013, Stockfish has been developed using a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] testing framework named ''Fishtest'', where volunteers can donate CPU time for testing improvements to the program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stockfish Testing Framework |url=http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests |access-date=7 March 2014 |work=tests.stockfishchess.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Get Involved |url=http://stockfishchess.org/get-involved/ |access-date=8 March 2014 |work=stockfishchess.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Costalba |first=Marco |date=1 May 2013 |title=Fishtest Distributed Testing Framework |url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?start=0&t=47885&topic_view=flat&sid=b5662f579ad4c7bea91668bb9d9723a4 |access-date=18 April 2014 |work=talkchess.com}}</ref>

Changes to game-playing code are accepted or rejected based on results of playing of tens of thousands of games on the framework against an older "reference" version of the program, using [[sequential probability ratio test]]ing. Tests on the framework are verified using the [[chi-squared test]], and only if the results are statistically significant are they deemed reliable and used to revise the software code.

After the inception of Fishtest, Stockfish experienced an explosive growth of 120 [[Elo rating system|Elo points]] in just 12 months, propelling it to the top of all major rating lists.<ref>

As of December 2023, the framework has used a total of more than 11700 years of CPU time to play over 6.8 billion chess games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stockfish Testing Framework – Users |url=https://tests.stockfishchess.org/users |access-date=26 September 2022

Stockfish is a [[TCEC]] multiple-time champion and the current leader in trophy count. Ever since TCEC restarted in 2013, Stockfish has finished first or second in every season except one. In TCEC Season 4 and 5, Stockfish finished runner-up, with Superfinal scores of 23–25 first against [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] 3 and later against [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]] 1142. Season 5 was notable for the winning Komodo team as they accepted the award posthumously for the program's creator [[Don Dailey]], who succumbed to an illness during the final stage of the event. In his honor, the version of Stockfish that was released shortly after that season was named "Stockfish DD".<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://blog.stockfishchess.org/post/68506094600/stockfish-dd|title = Stockfish Blog on Stockfish DD}}</ref>

On 30 May 2014, Stockfish 170514 (a development version of Stockfish 5 with tablebase support) convincingly won TCEC Season 6, scoring 35.5–28.5 against Komodo 7x in the Superfinal.<ref name="TCEC archive">{{cite web|title=TCEC Season Archive|url=https://tcec-chess.com/#x=archive|access-date=7 August 2021|work=tcec-chess.com}}</ref> Stockfish 5 was released the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=52487|title=Stockfish 5|last=Costalba|first=Marco|work=talkchess.com|date=31 May 2014|access-date=19 June 2014}}</ref> In TCEC Season 7, Stockfish again made the Superfinal, but lost to Komodo with the score of 30.5–33.5.<ref name="TCEC archive"/> In TCEC Season 8, despite losses on time caused by buggy code, Stockfish nevertheless qualified once more for the Superfinal, but lost the ensuing 100-game match 46.5–53.5 to Komodo.<ref name="TCEC archive"/> In Season 9, Stockfish defeated Houdini 5 with a score of 54.5 versus 45.5.<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Stockfish is the TCEC Season 9 Grand Champion|url=http://www.chessdom.com/stockfish-is-the-tcec-season-9-grand-champion/|website=Chessdom|date=5 December 2016 |access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

Stockfish finished third during season 10 of TCEC, the only season since 2013 in which Stockfish had failed to qualify for the superfinal. It did not lose a game but was still eliminated because it was unable to score enough wins against lower-rated engines.

=== Chess.com Computer Chess Championship ===
Ever since [[chess.com]] hosted its first [[Chess.com Computer Chess Championship]] in 2018, Stockfish has been the most successful engine. It dominated the earlier championships, winning six consecutive titles before finishing second in CCC7. Since then, its dominance has come under threat from the neural-network engines Leelenstein and [[Leela Chess Zero]], but it has continued to perform well, reaching at least the superfinal in every edition up to CCC11. CCC12 had for the first time a knockout format, with seeding placing CCC11 finalists Stockfish and Leela in the same half. Leela eliminated Stockfish in the semi-finals. However, a post-tournament match against the loser of the final, Leelenstein, saw Stockfish winning in the same format as the main event. After finishing second again to Leela in CCC13, and an uncharacteristic fourth in CCC14, Stockfish went on a long winning streak, taking first place in every championship since.

== Other Matches ==

=== Stockfish 5 versus Nakamura ===
Stockfish's strength relative to the best human chess players was most apparent in a handicap match with grandmaster [[Hikaru Nakamura]] (2798-rated) in August 2014. In the first two games of the match, Nakamura had the assistance of an older version of [[Rybka]], and in the next two games, he received White with pawn odds but no assistance. Nakamura was the world's fifth-best human chess player at the time of the match, while Stockfish 5 was denied use of its opening book and endgame tablebase. Stockfish won each half of the match 1.5–0.5. Both of Stockfish's wins arose from positions in which Nakamura, as is typical for his playing style, pressed for a win instead of acquiescing to a draw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chess.com/news/stockfish-outlasts-nakamura-3634.|title = Chess News and Event Coverage}}</ref>

=== Stockfish 8 versus AlphaZero ===
{{main|AlphaZero}}

In December 2017, Stockfish 8 was used as a benchmark to test [[Google]] division [[DeepMind]]'s [[AlphaZero]], with each engine supported by different hardware. AlphaZero was trained through self-play for a total of nine hours, and reached Stockfish's level after just four.<ref>{{Cite web |last=DeepMind |date=6 December 2018 |title=AlphaZero: Shedding new light on chess, shogi, and Go |url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go |access-date=20 July 2020 |website=deepmind.com}}</ref><ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |last2=Watson |first2=Leon |date=6 December 2017 |title=Entire human chess knowledge learned and surpassed by DeepMind's AlphaZero in four hours |language=en-GB |publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/06/entire-human-chess-knowledge-learned-surpassed-deepminds-alphazero/ |access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vincent |first=James |date=6 December 2017 |title=DeepMind's AI became a superhuman chess player in a few hours, just for fun |publisher=[[The Verge]] |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16741106/deepmind-ai-chess-alphazero-shogi-go |access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref> In 100 games from the normal starting position, AlphaZero won 25 games as White, won 3 as Black, and drew the remaining 72, with 0 losses.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |date=6 December 2017 |title='Superhuman' Google AI claims chess crown |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42251535 |access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref> AlphaZero also played twelve 100-game matches against Stockfish starting from twelve popular openings for a final score of 290 wins, 886 draws and 24 losses, for a point score of 733:467.<ref name="crushes">{{cite web |date=6 December 2017 |title=DeepMind's AlphaZero crushes chess |url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/deepmind-s-alphazero-crushes-chess |access-date=13 December 2017 |publisher=[[chess.com]]}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|The academic paper on this sequence of games does not provide the computer resources allocated to each engine.<ref name=preprint>{{Cite arXiv|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first1=David|last1= Silver|first2=Thomas|last2= Hubert|first3= Julian|last3=Schrittwieser|first4= Ioannis|last4=Antonoglou |first5= Matthew|last5= Lai|first6= Arthur|last6= Guez|first7= Marc|last7= Lanctot|first8= Laurent|last8= Sifre|first9= Dharshan|last9= Kumaran|first10= Thore|last10= Graepel|first11= Timothy|last11= Lillicrap|first12= Karen|last12= Simonyan|first13=Demis |last13=Hassabis|author-link13=Demis Hassabis |eprint=1712.01815|title=Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm|class=cs.AI|date=5 December 2017}}</ref>}}

AlphaZero's victory over Stockfish sparked a flurry of activity in the computer chess community, leading to a new open-source engine aimed at replicating AlphaZero, known as [[Leela Chess Zero]]. By January 2019, Leela was able to defeat the version of Stockfish that played AlphaZero (Stockfish 8) in a 100-game match. An updated version of Stockfish narrowly defeated Leela Chess Zero in the superfinal of the [[TCEC Season 14|14th TCEC season]], 50.5–49.5 (+10 =81 −9),<ref name="TCEC archive" /> but lost the superfinal of the [[TCEC Season 15|next season]] to Leela 53.5–46.5 (+14 =79 -7).<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=crem |title=Lc0 won TCEC 15 |url=http://blog.lczero.org/2019/05/lc0-won-tcec-15.html |access-date=20 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The two engines remain very close in strength to each other even as they continue to improve: Leela defeated Stockfish in the superfinal of [[TCEC Season 17]], but Stockfish has won every TCEC season since.
