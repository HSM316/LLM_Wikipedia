{{Chess programming series}}
'''Stockfish''' is a [[free and open-source]] [[chess engine]], available for various desktop and mobile platforms. It is developed by [[Marco Costalba]], Joona Kiiski, Gary Linscott, Tord Romstad, Stéphane Nicolet, Stefan Geschwentner, and Joost VandeVondele, with many contributions from a community of open-source developers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=List of Authors disclosed on Github|url=https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/AUTHORS|access-date=29 June 2020|website=GitHub|language=en}}</ref>

Stockfish is the strongest chess engine in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/rating_list_all.html|title=CCRL 40/15|date=11 January 2010|website=computerchess.org.uk|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> It won the [[TCEC|unofficial world computer chess championships]] in seasons 6 (2014),  9 (2016),  11 (2018),  12 (2018),  13 (2018), 14 (2019), 16 (2019), 18 (2020) and 19 (2020). It finished runner-up in season 5 (2013), 7 (2014),  8 (2015), 15 (2019) and 17 (2020).

Stockfish is derived from Glaurung, an open-source engine by [[Tord Romstad]] released in 2004.

== Features ==
Stockfish can use up to 512 [[central processing unit|CPU thread]]s in [[multiprocessor]] systems. The maximal size of its [[transposition table]] is 32 TB. Stockfish implements an advanced [[alpha–beta search]] and uses [[bitboard]]s. Compared to other engines, it is characterized by its great search depth, due in part to more aggressive [[Alpha–beta pruning|pruning]], and [[late move reductions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?start=0&t=50220|title=Stockfish depth vs. others; challenge|date=24 November 2013|last=Kaufman|first=Larry|author-link=Larry Kaufman|work=talkchess.com|accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> {{As of|2020|11}}, Stockfish 12 (4-threaded) achieves an [[Elo rating]] of 3516{{+-|24|20}} on the CCRL 40/15 benchmark.<ref>{{cite web |title=CCRL 40/15 – Complete list |url=https://computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/rating_list_all.html |website=computerchess.org.uk}}</ref>

Stockfish supports [[Chess960]], which is one feature that was inherited from Glaurung.

The [[Syzygy (tablebase)|Syzygy]] [[Endgame tablebase|tablebase]] support, previously available in a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] maintained by Ronald de Man, was integrated into Stockfish in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://abrok.eu/stockfish_syzygy/ | title=Stockfish development versions | work=abrok.eu | access-date=1 February 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111094041/http://abrok.eu/stockfish_syzygy/ | archive-date=11 November 2014 }}</ref> In 2018 support for the 7-men Syzygy was added, shortly after becoming available.

== History ==

The program originated from ''Glaurung'', an open-source chess engine created by Romstad and first released in 2004. Four years later, Costalba, inspired by the strong open-source engine, decided to fork the project. He named it ''[[Stockfish]]'' because it was "produced in Norway and cooked in Italy" (Romstad is Norwegian, Costalba is Italian). The first version, Stockfish 1.0, was released in November 2008.<ref name="About">{{cite web | url=http://stockfishchess.org/about/ | title=About | work=stockfishchess.org | accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Stockfish 1.0">{{cite web | url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=24675 | title=Stockfish 1.0 | last=Costalba | first=Marco | date=2 November 2008 | work=talkchess.com | accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> For a while, new ideas and code changes were transferred between the two programs in both directions, until Romstad decided to discontinue Glaurung in the favor of Stockfish, which was the more advanced engine at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wbec-ridderkerk.forumotion.com/t402-stockfish-glaurung#883 | title=Re: Stockfish – Glaurung | last=Romstad | first=Tord | date=5 September 2009 | work=wbec-ridderkerk.forumotion.com | accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref> The last Glaurung (version 2.2) was released in December 2008.

Around 2011, Romstad decided to abandon his involvement with Stockfish in order to spend more time on his new iOS chess app.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

On 18 June 2014 Marco Costalba announced that he had "decided to step down as Stockfish maintainer" and asked that the community create a fork of the current version and continue its development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/fishcooking/VsYuyij6uqQ|title=Step down|last=Costalba|first=Marco|work=groups.google.com|date=18 June 2014|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> An official repository, managed by a volunteer group of core Stockfish developers, was created soon after and currently manages the development of the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/fishcooking/aUqC13mtSEg|title=New official repository|last=Linscott|first=Gary|work=groups.google.com|date=18 June 2014|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>

In June 2020, an [[efficiently updatable neural network]] (NNUE) fork introduced by [[computer shogi]] programmers called Stockfish NNUE was discussed by developers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish|title=Stockfish NNUE|author=nodchip|accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SF NNUE.

On 2 September 2020, the twelfth version of Stockfish was released, incorporating the aforementioned neural network improvement.  According to the blog announcement, this new version "plays significantly stronger than any of its predecessors", typically winning ten times more games than it loses when matched against version eleven.<ref>[https://blog.stockfishchess.org/post/628172810852925440/stockfish-12 blog announcement of version 12]</ref>

== Fishtest ==
Since 2013, Stockfish has been developed using a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] testing framework named ''Fishtest'', where volunteers can donate CPU time for testing improvements to the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests|title=Stockfish Testing Framework|work=tests.stockfishchess.org|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockfishchess.org/get-involved/|title=Get Involved|work=stockfishchess.org|accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?start=0&t=47885&topic_view=flat&sid=b5662f579ad4c7bea91668bb9d9723a4 | title=Fishtest Distributed Testing Framework | date=1 May 2013 | last=Costalba | first=Marco | work=talkchess.com | accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref>

Changes to game-playing code are accepted or rejected based on results of playing of tens of thousands of games on the framework against an older "reference" version of the program, using [[sequential probability ratio test]]ing. Tests on the framework are verified using the [[chi-squared test]], and only if the results are statistically significant are they deemed reliable and used to revise the software code.

{{As of|2018|6}}, the framework has used a total of more than 1200 years of CPU time to play over 840 million chess games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tests.stockfishchess.org/users | title=Stockfish Testing Framework – Users | work=test.stockfishchess.org | accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref> After the inception of Fishtest, Stockfish experienced an explosive growth of 120 [[Elo rating system|Elo points]] in just 12 months, propelling it to the top of all major rating lists.<ref>

== Competition results ==
=== Stockfish versus Nakamura ===
Stockfish's strength relative to the best human chess players was most apparent in a handicap match with grandmaster [[Hikaru Nakamura]] (2798-rated) in August 2014. In the first two games of the match, Nakamura had the assistance of an older version of [[Rybka]], and in the next two games, he received White with pawn odds but no assistance. Nakamura was the world's fifth-best human chess player at the time of the match, while Stockfish was denied use of its opening book and endgame tablebase. Stockfish won each half of the match 1.5–0.5. Both of Stockfish's wins arose from positions in which Nakamura, as is typical for his playing style, pressed for a win instead of acquiescing to a draw.<ref>http://www.chess.com/news/stockfish-outlasts-nakamura-3634.</ref>

An artificial-intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the ''Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse'' ("Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute"), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish, rated [[Magnus Carlsen]] as the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history|best player of all-time]], as he had the highest probability of all World Chess Champions to play the moves that Stockfish suggested.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170425110954.htm|publisher=[[CNRS]]|website=[[Science Daily]]|date=25 April 2017|title=When artificial intelligence evaluates chess champions}}</ref>

=== Participation in TCEC ===
Stockfish is a [[TCEC]] multiple-time champion and the current leader in trophy count. Ever since TCEC restarted in 2013, Stockfish has finished first or second in every season except one. In TCEC Season 4 and 5, Stockfish finished runner-up, with Superfinal scores of 23–25 first against [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]] 3 and later against [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]] 1142. Season 5 was notable for the winning Komodo team as they accepted the award posthumously for the program's creator [[Don Dailey]], who succumbed to an illness during the final stage of the event. In his honor, the version of Stockfish that was released shortly after that season was named "Stockfish DD".<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://blog.stockfishchess.org/post/68506094600/stockfish-dd|title = Stockfish Blog on Stockfish DD}}</ref>

On 30 May 2014, Stockfish 170514 (a development version of Stockfish 5 with tablebase support) convincingly won TCEC Season 6, scoring 35.5–28.5 against Komodo 7x in the Superfinal.<ref name="TCEC archive">{{cite web|title=TCEC Season Archive|url=https://tcec-chess.com/archive|accessdate=9 January 2015|work=tcec-chess.com}}</ref> Stockfish 5 was released the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=52487|title=Stockfish 5|last=Costalba|first=Marco|work=talkchess.com|date=31 May 2014|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> In TCEC Season 7, Stockfish again made the Superfinal, but lost to Komodo with the score of 30.5–33.5.<ref name="TCEC archive"/> In TCEC Season 8, despite losses on time caused by buggy code, Stockfish nevertheless qualified once more for the Superfinal, but lost the ensuing 100-game match 46.5–53.5 to Komodo.<ref name="TCEC archive"/> In Season 9, Stockfish defeated Houdini 5 with a score of 54.5 versus 45.5.<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Stockfish is the TCEC Season 9 Grand Champion|url=http://www.chessdom.com/stockfish-is-the-tcec-season-9-grand-champion/|website=Chessdom|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref>

Stockfish finished third during season 10 of TCEC, the only season since 2013 in which Stockfish had failed to qualify for the superfinal. It did not lose a game, but was still eliminated because it was unable to score enough wins against lower-rated engines. After this technical elimination, Stockfish went on a long winning streak, winning seasons 11 (59 vs. 41 against Houdini 6.03),<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/tcec-2018-superfinal|title=TCEC Season 11 Superfinal 2018|website=chess24.com|language=en|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> 12 (60 vs. 40 against Komodo 12.1.1),<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/tcec-2018-season-12-superfinal|title=TCEC Season 12 Superfinal 2018|website=chess24.com|language=en|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> and 13 (55 vs. 45 against Komodo 2155.00)<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/tcec-2018-season-13-superfinal|title=TCEC Season 13 Superfinal 2018|website=chess24.com|language=en|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> convincingly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stockfish convincingly wins TCEC Season 11|url=http://www.chessdom.com/stockfish-convincingly-wins-tcec-season-11/|website=Chessdom|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref> In [[TCEC Season 14|Season 14]], Stockfish faced a new challenger in [[Leela Chess Zero]], but managed to eke out a win by one game (50.5–49.5).<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessdom.com/stockfish-continues-to-dominate-computer-chess-wins-tcec-s14/|title=Stockfish continues to dominate computer chess, wins TCEC S14|website=Chessdom|date=1 March 2019}}</ref> Its winning streak was finally ended in [[TCEC Season 15|season 15]], when Leela qualified again and won 53.5–46.5,<ref name="TCEC archive" /> but Stockfish promptly won [[TCEC Season 16|season 16]], defeating AllieStein 54.5–45.5, after Leela failed to qualify for the superfinal.<ref name="TCEC archive" /> In [[TCEC Season 17|season 17]], Stockfish faced Leela again in the superfinal, losing 52.5–47.5.

Stockfish also took part in the TCEC cup, winning the first edition, but was surprisingly upset by Houdini in the semifinals of the second edition.<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Houdunit ?

It gained its revenge{{tone inline|date=September 2020}} in the fourth edition, defeating Leela in the final 4.5–3.5.<ref name="TCEC archive" />

=== Computer chess tournament ===
Ever since [[chess.com]] hosted its first computer chess championship in 2018, Stockfish has been the most successful engine. It dominated the earlier championships, winning six consecutive titles before finishing second in CCC7. Since then, its dominance has come under threat from the neural-network engines [[Leelenstein]] and [[Leela Chess Zero]], but it has continued to perform well, reaching at least the superfinal in every edition up to CCC11. CCC12 had for the first time a knockout format, with seeding placing CCC11 finalists Stockfish and Leela in the same half. Leela eliminated Stockfish in the semi-finals. However, a post-tournament match against the loser of the final, Leelenstein, saw Stockfish winning in the same format as the main event.

=== Stockfish versus AlphaZero ===
{{main|AlphaZero}}
In December 2017, Stockfish 8 was used as a benchmark to test [[Google]] division [[Deepmind]]'s [[AlphaZero]], with each engine supported by different hardware. AlphaZero was trained through self-play for a total of nine hours, and reached Stockfish's level after just four.<ref>{{Cite web|last=DeepMind|date=6 December 2018|title=AlphaZero: Shedding new light on chess, shogi, and Go|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go|access-date=20 July 2020|website=deepmind.com}}</ref><ref name="telegraph">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/06/entire-human-chess-knowledge-learned-surpassed-deepminds-alphazero/|title=Entire human chess knowledge learned and surpassed by DeepMind's AlphaZero in four hours|last=Knapton|first=Sarah|date=6 December 2017|publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]|access-date=6 December 2017|last2=Watson|first2=Leon|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=James|last= Vincent|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16741106/deepmind-ai-chess-alphazero-shogi-go|title=DeepMind's AI became a superhuman chess player in a few hours, just for fun|publisher=[[The Verge]]|date=6 December 2017|access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref> In 100 games from the normal starting position, AlphaZero won 25 games as White, won 3 as Black, and drew the remaining 72, with 0 losses.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|title='Superhuman' Google AI claims chess crown|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42251535|accessdate=7 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=6 December 2017}}</ref> AlphaZero also played twelve 100-game matches against Stockfish starting from twelve popular openings for a final score of 290 wins, 886 draws and 24 losses, for a point score of 733:467.<ref name=crushes>{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/deepmind-s-alphazero-crushes-chess|title=DeepMind's AlphaZero crushes chess|publisher=[[chess.com]]|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|The academic paper on this sequence of games does not provide the computer resources allocated to each engine.<ref name=preprint>{{Cite arXiv|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first1=David|last1= Silver|first2=Thomas|last2= Hubert|first3= Julian|last3=Schrittwieser|first4= Ioannis|last4=Antonoglou |first5= Matthew|last5= Lai|first6= Arthur|last6= Guez|first7= Marc|last7= Lanctot|first8= Laurent|last8= Sifre|first9= Dharshan|last9= Kumaran|first10= Thore|last10= Graepel|first11= Timothy|last11= Lillicrap|first12= Karen|last12= Simonyan|first13=Demis |last13=Hassabis|author-link13=Demis Hassabis |eprint=1712.01815|title=Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm|class=cs.AI|date=5 December 2017}}</ref>}}

AlphaZero's victory over Stockfish sparked a flurry of activity in the computer chess community, leading to a new open-source engine aimed at replicating AlphaZero, known as [[Leela Chess Zero]]. By January 2019, Leela was able to defeat the version of Stockfish that played AlphaZero (Stockfish 8) in a 100-game match. An updated version of Stockfish narrowly defeated Leela Chess Zero in the superfinal of the [[TCEC Season 14|14th TCEC season]], 50.5–49.5 (+10 =81 −9),<ref name="TCEC archive" /> but lost the superfinal of the [[TCEC Season 15|next season]] to Leela 53.5–46.5 (+14 =79 -7).<ref name="TCEC archive" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.lczero.org/2019/05/lc0-won-tcec-15.html|title=Lc0 won TCEC 15|last=crem|language=en|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> The two engines remain very close in strength to each other even as they continue to improve: Leela defeated Stockfish in the superfinal of [[TCEC Season 17]], but Stockfish won [[TCEC Season 18]] and [[TCEC Season 19]].

==Platforms==
Release versions and development versions are available as [[C++]] [[source code]] and as precompiled versions for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]] 32-bit/64-bit and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

Stockfish has been a very popular engine for various platforms. On the desktop, it is the default chess engine bundled with the [[Internet Chess Club]] interface programs BlitzIn and Dasher. On the mobile platform, it has been bundled with the Stockfish app, SmallFish and [[Droidfish]]. Other Stockfish-compatible [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) include [[Fritz (chess)|Fritz]], Arena, Stockfish for Mac, and [[PyChess]].<ref>[http://support.stockfishchess.org/kb/getting-started/using-the-stockfish-engine Using the Stockfish Engine], Stockfish Support.</ref><ref>[https://github.com/pychess/pychess/wiki/ChessEngines ChessEngines], PyChess Github.</ref> As of March 2014, Stockfish is the chess engine used by [[Lichess]],<ref>[http://en.lichess.org/blog/U4mtoEQAAEEAgZRL/strongest-chess-player-ever] Lichess uses Stockfish announcement.</ref> a popular online chess site.

Stockfish can be compiled to [[WebAssembly]] or [[JavaScript]], allowing it to run in the browser. Both [[chess.com]] and [[Lichess]] provide stockfish in this form in addition to a server-side program.<ref name=lichess/>

== Derivatives ==
Stockfish has been used to create programs for many [[chess variant]]s. Some of the forks are:
* YaneuraOu, a strong shogi engine and the origin of NNUE. Speaks USI, a variant of [[Universal Chess Interface|UCI]] for chess.<ref>{{cite web |last1="yaneurao" |last3=Nasu |first3=Yu |last2=Noda |first2=Hisayori |title=YaneuraOu: tthe World's Strongest Shogi engine (AI player), WCSC29 1st winner, educational and USI compliant engine. |url=https://github.com/yaneurao/YaneuraOu |website=GitHub |date=8 November 2020}}</ref>
* Fairy Stockfish, a version modified to play [[fairy chess]]. Runs with regional variants (chess, shogi, [[makruk]], etc.) as well as other variants like [[antichess]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fichter |first1=Fabian |title=Fairy-Stockfish: chess variant engine supporting Xiangqi, Shogi, Janggi, Makruk, S-Chess, Crazyhouse, Bughouse, and many more |url=https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish |website=GitHub |date=8 November 2020}}</ref>
