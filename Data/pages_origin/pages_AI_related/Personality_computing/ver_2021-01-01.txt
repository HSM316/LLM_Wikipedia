'''Personality computing''' is a research field related to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[personality psychology]] that studies personality by means of computational techniques from different sources, including text, multimedia and social networks.

== Overview ==
Personality computing addresses three main problems involving personality: automatic personality recognition, perception and synthesis.<ref name="Vinciarelli et al 2014">[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/100498/7/100498.pdf] Vinciarelli, Alessandro, and Gelareh Mohammadi. "A survey of personality computing." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 5.3 (2014): 273-291.</ref> Automatic personality recognition is the inference of [[personality types|personality type]] of target individuals from their [[digital footprints|digital footprint]], automatic personality perception is the inference of the personality attributed by an observer to a target individual based on some observable behavior, and automatic personality synthesis is the generation of the style or behaviour of artificial personalities in Avatars and virtual agents.

Self-assessed [[personality test]]s or observer ratings are always exploited as the [[ground truth]] for testing and validating the performance of artificial intelligence [[algorithm]]s for the automatic prediction of personality types.<ref name="Celli et al 2013">Celli, Fabio, et al. "Workshop on computational personality recognition (shared task)." Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Personality Recognition. 2013.</ref> There is a wide variety of personality tests, such as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)]]<ref name="Briggs and Myers 2010">Isabel Briggs Myers and Peter B Myers. 2010. Giftsdiffering:  Understanding personality type.  Davies-Black Publishing.</ref> or the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]], but the most used are tests based on the [[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor Model]] such as the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]].<ref name="costa and MacCrae 2008">Paul  T  Costa  and  Robert  R  McCrae.  2008.   The  re-vised neo personality inventory (neo-pi-r).In G.J.Boyle,  G  Matthews  and  D.  Saklofske  (Eds.).  TheSAGE  handbook  of  personality  theory  and  assessment2:179–198</ref>

Personality computing can be considered as an extension or complement of [[Affective computing|Affective Computing]], where the former focuses on personality traits and the latter on affective states. A further extension of the two fields is [[Character Computing]] which combines various character states and traits including but not limited to personality and affect.

==History==
Personality computing begun around 2005 with few pioneering research works in personality recognition showing that personality traits could be inferred with reasonable accuracy from text, such as blogs, self-presentations,<ref name="Argamon et al 2005">Argamon, Shlomo, et al. "Lexical predictors of personality type." (2005).</ref><ref name="Oberlander and Nowson 2006">Oberlander, Jon, and Scott Nowson.

Few years later begun the research in personality recognition and perception from multimodal and social signals, such as recorded meetings<ref name="Pianesi et al 2008">Pianesi, Fabio, et al. "Multimodal recognition of personality traits in social interactions." Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Multimodal interfaces. ACM, 2008.</ref> and voice calls.<ref name="Mohammadi and Vinciarelli 2012">Mohammadi, Gelareh, and Alessandro Vinciarelli. "Automatic personality perception: Prediction of trait attribution based on prosodic features." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 3.3 (2012): 273-284.</ref>

In the [[2010s]] the research focussed mainly on personality recognition and perception from social media, in particular from [[Facebook]],<ref name="Quercia et al. 2012">Quercia, Daniele, et al.

Scientific works demonstrated the validity of Personality Computing from different digital footprints, in particular from user preferences such as Facebook page likes<ref name="Kosinski et al 2013">Kosinski, Michal, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel. "Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2013): 201218772.</ref> and showed that machines can recognize personality better than humans<ref name="Youyou et al 2015">Youyou, Wu, Michal Kosinski, and David Stillwell.

== Applications ==
Personality computing techniques, in particular personality recognition and perception, have applications in [[Social media marketing]], where they can help reducing the cost of advertising campaigns through psychological targeting<ref name="Matz et al 2017">Matz, S.
