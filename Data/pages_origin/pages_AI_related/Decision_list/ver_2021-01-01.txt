'''Decision lists''' are a representation for Boolean functions which can be easily learnable from examples.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ronald L. Rivest|authorlink=Ronald L.

The language specified by a k-length decision list includes as a subset the language specified by a k-depth [[decision tree]].

Learning decision lists can be used for [[attribute efficient learning]].<ref>Adam R. Klivans and Rocco A.

== Definition ==

A decision list (DL) of length {{mvar|r}} is of the form:

 '''if''' {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>}} '''then''' 
     output {{math|''b''<sub>1</sub>}}
 '''else if''' {{math|''f''<sub>2</sub>}} '''then'''
     output {{math|''b''<sub>2</sub>}}
 ...
 '''else if''' {{mvar|f<sub>r</sub>}} '''then'''
     output {{mvar|b<sub>r</sub>}}

where {{mvar|f<sub>i</sub>}} is the {{mvar|i}}th formula and {{mvar|b<sub>i</sub>}} is the {{mvar|i}}th [[Boolean data type|boolean]] for <math>i \in \{1...r\}</math>.  The last if-then-else is the default case, which means formula {{mvar|f<sub>r</sub>}} is always equal to true. A {{mvar|k}}-DL is a decision list where all of formulas have at most {{mvar|k}} terms.  Sometimes "decision list" is used to refer to a 1-DL, where all of the formulas are either a variable or its [[negation]].
