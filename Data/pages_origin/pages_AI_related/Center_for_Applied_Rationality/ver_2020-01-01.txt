The '''Center for Applied Rationality''' ('''CFAR''') is a nonprofit organization based in [[Berkeley, California]] that hosts workshops on [[rationality]] and [[cognitive bias]]. It was founded in 2012 by [[Julia Galef]], Anna Salamon, Michael Smith and Andrew Critch,<ref name="fast company">{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3037333/most-creative-people/inside-the-rationality-movement-that-has-silicon-valley-buzzing-with-po|title=Inside the Rationality Movement That Has Silicon Valley Buzzing With Positive Thinking|website=Fast Company|publisher=Mansueto Ventures, LLC|last1=Segran|first1=Elizabeth|accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref><ref name="harpers">{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2015/01/come-with-us-if-you-want-to-live/|title=Come With Us If You Want to Live: Among the apocalyptic libertarians of Silicon Valley|last=Frank|first=Sam|date=January 2015|publisher=[[Harper's Magazine]]|accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref> to improve participants' [[rationality]] using "a set of techniques from math and decision theory for forming your beliefs about the world as accurately as possible."<ref name="io9">{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5956962/why-youre-probably-not-as-rational-as-you-think-you-are----and-what-you-can-do-about-it|title=Why you're probably not as rational as you think you are — and what you can do about it|last=Dvorsky|first=George|date=11 February 2012|publisher=[[io9]]|accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref> Its president as of 2016 is Anna Salamon.<ref name=guidestar/>

CFAR's training draws upon fields such as [[psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]] in an effort to improve people's mental habits.

== Sonoma County incident ==

On 15 November 2019, four people dressed in [[Guy Fawkes mask|Guy Fawkes masks]] were arrested for allegedly barricading off a wooded retreat where CFAR was holding an event. According to police, the suspects were uncooperative and spoke incoherently. Flyers found by deputies suggested they were protesting artificial intelligence and CFAR.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Mystery-in-Sonoma-County-after-kidnap-arrests-of-14844155.php | last=Gafni | first=Mattias | date=18 November 2019 | title=Mystery in Sonoma County after arrests of protesters in Guy Fawkes masks and robes | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>
