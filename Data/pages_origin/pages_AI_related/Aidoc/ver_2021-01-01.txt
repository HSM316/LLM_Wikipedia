'''Aidoc''' is an Israeli company that develops [[computer-aided simple triage]] systems.

The systems are in use in more than 300 medical centers, including [[Yale New Haven Hospital]], [[University of Rochester Medical Center]], [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and [[Sheba Medical Center]].<ref name=jpost/>

The [[FDA]] approved the systems for analysing scans of [[stroke]], [[pulmonary embolism]] and [[cervical fracture]].<ref name=jpost>[https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Tel-Aviv-start-up-gets-FDA-approval-for-AI-package-that-spots-strokes-614037 Tel Aviv start-up gets FDA approval for ‘stroke of genius’ AI package], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', January 13, 2020</ref>

The [[pulmonary embolism]] system is [[CE marking|CE marked]].<ref name=CE>[https://www.med-technews.com/news/ai-solution-for-incidental-pulmonary-embolism-given-ce-mark/ AI solution for incidental pulmonary embolism given CE mark], med-technews.com, May 4, 2020</ref>

==History==
Aidoc was founded in 2016 by Elad Walach (CEO),<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web | title=Global Diagnostics Australia Incorporates Artificial Intelligence Into Its Radiology Applications | website=Yahoo Finance | date=August 8, 2019 | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-diagnostics-australia-incorporates-artificial-010000121.html | access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Michael Braginsky (CTO) and Guy Reiner (VP R&D).

In April 2017, the company raised $7M, led by TLV Partners.<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/aidoc-medical/ AIDoc Medical raises $7M to bring AI to medical imaging analysis], ''[[TechCrunch]]'', April 26, 2017</ref>

In April 2019, the company raised $27M, led by Squarepeg capital.<ref>{{cite web | title=Aidoc, the AI solution for medical imaging analysis, raises $27M Series B – TechCrunch | website=TechCrunch | date=17 April 2019 | url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/aidoc-b/ }}</ref> Additional investments make a total of $41.5M invested until April 2019.<ref>[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aidoc#section-overview Aidoc], ''[[Crunchbase]]''</ref>

In August 2018, Aidoc gained FDA clearance for its [[intracranial hemorrhage]] system,<ref>{{cite web | title=August 2018 510(k) Clearances | website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date=7 September 2018 | url=http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/510k-clearances/august-2018-510k-clearances}}</ref> and in May 2019 it received clearance for the [[pulmonary embolism]] system.<ref>{{cite web | title=The meaning of regulatory approval for AI | website=AI Med | date=15 May 2019 | url=https://ai-med.io/the-meaning-of-regulatory-approval-for-ai/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=FDA OKs World's First AI Solution for Flagging Pulmonary Embolism | website=Medical Product Outsourcing | date=16 May 2019 | url=https://www.mpo-mag.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2019-05-16/fda-oks-worlds-first-ai-solution-for-flagging-pulmonary-embolism/ }}</ref>

In January 2020, the system for detecting large-[[Vascular occlusion|vessel occlusion]]s (LVOs) in head CTA examinations got FDA clearance.<ref>{{cite web | title=Aidoc's AI solution for LVOs gains FDA clearance | website=AI in Healthcare | date=January 13, 2020 | url=https://www.aiin.healthcare/topics/medical-imaging/aidocs-ai-solution-lvos-gains-fda-clearance | access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Medical Imaging Startup Aidoc Gets FDA Clearance For AI Solution To Spot Stroke | website=NoCamels Innovation News | date=13 January 2020 | url=https://nocamels.com/2020/01/medical-imaging-ai-fda-clearance-stroke-aidoc/ | access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last= Palmer|first=Whitney J.|title=AI Start-Up Receives FDA Clearance for Comprehensive CT Stroke Package | website=MJH Life Sciences | date=13 January 2020 | url=https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ct/ai-start-receives-fda-clearance-comprehensive-ct-stroke-package | access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

==Products and market==
Aidoc has developed a suite of artificial intelligence products that flag both time-sensitive and time-consuming (for the radiologist) abnormalities across the body. The algorithms are developed with large quantities of data to provide diagnostic aid to a broad set of pathologies. The company offers an array of algorithms that span across the body including Intracranial hemorrhage, spine fractures (C, T & L), free air in the abdomen, pulmonary embolism and more. It developed "Always-on AI", a term coined by Elad Walach which refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is "Always-on" - constantly running in the background and automatically analyzing medical imaging data, identifying urgent findings and sparing radiologists from "drowning" in vast amounts of irrelevant data.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Blum | first1=Brian | last2=Leichman | first2=Abigail Klein | title=AI tool helps radiologists clear dangerous data bottleneck | website=Israel21c | date=11 December 2018 | url=http://www.israel21c.org/ai-tool-helps-radiologists-clear-dangerous-data-bottleneck/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Aidoc releases complete AI package for treatment of stroke | website=NeuroNews International | date=23 September 2019 | url=https://neuronewsinternational.com/aidoc-ai-stroke/ }}</ref>

Aidoc's solutions cover medical conditions prevalent in all settings ([[Emergency department|ED]]/[[inpatient]]/[[outpatient]]), including [[level 1 trauma center]]s, outpatient imaging centers, [[teleradiology]] groups and are set up in over 200 medical centers worldwide. Notable customers include the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Nuance's AI Marketplace Delivers AI at Scale with Industry's First Workflow-Integrated Market for Diagnostic Imaging Algorithms | website=Nuance Communications | date=26 November 2018 | url=https://www.nuance.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2018/Nuances-AI-Marketplace-Delivers-AI-at-Scale-with-Industrys-First-Workflow-Integrated-Market-for-Diagnostic-Imaging-Algorithms.html}}</ref> [[Global Diagnostics]] Australia,<ref>{{cite web | title=Global Diagnostics Australia incorporates artificial intelligence into its radiology applications | website=Global Diagnostics Australia | date=8 August 2019 | url=https://www.globaldiagnostics.com.au/page/about/latest-news/global-diagnostics-australia-incorporates-artificial-intelligence-into-its-radiology-applications/}}</ref> [[Antwerp University]] Hospital, and AZ Maria Middelares hospital. According to the company, Aidoc has deep integrations with numerous PACS and workflow software providers (GE, Agfa, Nuance).

==Clinical Research==
A clinical study on Aidoc’ accuracy of deep [[convolutional neural networks]] for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) was performed by the University Hospital of Basel and presented at the European Congress of Radiology, showing that the Aidoc algorithm reached 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity.<ref>{{cite web | title=Assessment of Artificial Intelligence Technology for Pulmonary Embolism Detection | url=https://events.eventact.com/ProgramView2/Agenda/Lecture?id=203932&code=3874028 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=AI-powered detection of pulmonary embolism in CT pulmonary angiograms: a validation study of the diagnostic performance of prototype algorithms | website=Aidoc | url=https://www.aidoc.com/blog/clinical_study/ai-powered-detection-of-pulmonary-embolism-in-ct-pulmonary-angiograms-a-validation-study-of-the-diagnostic-performance-of-prototype-algorithms/ }}</ref>

Overall, the algorithm achieved a 93% sensitivity (91/98, 7 false-negative) and 97% specificity (93/96, 3 false-positive) in the detection of acute abdominal findings.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Winkel, DJ| last2=Heye | first2=T | last3=Weikert | first3=TJ| last4=Boll | first4=DT|last5=Stieltjes|first5=B.|title=Evaluation of an AI-Based Detection Software for Acute Findings in Abdominal Computed Tomography Scans: Toward an Automated Work List Prioritization of Routine CT Examinations| journal=Investigative Radiology | date=20 November 2019 | volume=54 | issue=1 | pages=55–59 | doi=10.1097/RLI.0000000000000509 | pmid=30199417 | s2cid=52186362 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Evaluation of an AI-Based Detection Software for Acute... : Investigative Radiology | journal=Investigative Radiology | date=20 November 2019 | doi=10.1097/RLI.0000000000000509 | pmid=30199417 | last1=Winkel | first1=D.
