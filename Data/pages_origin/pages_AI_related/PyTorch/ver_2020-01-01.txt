* [[Deep neural networks]] built on a tape-based [[Automatic differentiation|autodiff]] system

==History==
Facebook operates both ''PyTorch'' and ''Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding'' ([[Caffe (software)|Caffe2]]), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange ([[Open Neural Network Exchange|ONNX]]) project was created by Facebook and [[Microsoft]] in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Synced/caffe2-merges-with-pytorch-a89c70ad9eb7|title=Caffe2 Merges With PyTorch|date=2018-04-02}}</ref>

==PyTorch tensors==
PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (<code>torch.Tensor</code>) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to [[NumPy]] Arrays, but can also be operated on a [[CUDA]]-capable [[Nvidia]] GPU. PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/02/pytorch-tutorial/ |title=An Introduction to PyTorch – A Simple yet Powerful Deep Learning Library |website=analyticsvidhya.com |access-date=2018-06-11|date=2018-02-22 }}</ref>

==Modules==
===Autograd module===
PyTorch uses a method called [[automatic differentiation]]. A recorder records what operations have performed, and then it replays it backward to compute the gradients. This method is especially powerful when building neural networks to save time on one epoch by calculating differentiation of the parameters at the forward pass.

===<code>Optim</code> module===
<code>torch.optim</code> is a module that implements various optimization algorithms used for building neural networks. Most of the commonly used methods are already supported, so there is no need to build them from scratch.

===<code>nn</code> module===
PyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients, but raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks. This is where the <code>nn</code> module can help.
