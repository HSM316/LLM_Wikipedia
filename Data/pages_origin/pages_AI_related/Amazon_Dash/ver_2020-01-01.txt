'''Amazon Dash''' is a [[consumer goods]] ordering service which uses proprietary devices and [[API]]s for ordering goods over the Internet.


Amazon Dash consists of multiple components, which include:

* the Amazon Dash Wand, a Wi-Fi connected barcode scanner and [[voice command device]], used to reorder consumer goods around the house, integrating with [[AmazonFresh]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fresh.amazon.com/dash/|title=Amazon Dash|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>
* the Amazon Dash Button, a small consumer electronic device that can be placed around the house and programmed to order a consumer good such as disinfectant wipes or paper towels;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button|title=Amazon Dash Button|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> and
* the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service, which allows manufacturers to add a physical button or auto-detection capability to their devices to reorder supplies from Amazon when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-replenishment-service|title=Amazon Dash Replenishment Service|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>
* Amazon Virtual Dash Buttons, which mimic the appearance and function of physical Dash Buttons, but are displayed on Amazon's website and some smart devices with displays.

== Barcode scanner ==
The Amazon Dash Wand (originally branded simply Amazon Dash) was announced in April 2014. It is a Wi-Fi connected device that allows users to build a shopping list by scanning bar codes and saying product names out loud. It connects directly with [[AmazonFresh]], the company's online grocery delivery service. The website for Amazon Dash highlights benefits such as "never forget an item again" and suggests users keep the device on the kitchen counter or refrigerator so that every member of the family can add items to its grocery list.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Amazon Tests Dash Barcode Scanner For Ordering AmazonFresh Groceries|url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/04/amazon-dash/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-12-01|first = Anthony|last = Ha}}</ref>

The Amazon Dash Wand is Amazon's first [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) device.

The second-generation Amazon Dash Barcode Scanner was announced in October 2016; it replaces the two buttons on the previous model with a single button used for both scanning barcodes and activating the microphone. The new model is also about an inch shorter and magnetic so it can be stuck to a metallic surface, like a refrigerator.

On June 15, 2017, a new version of the scanner was announced by Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/354340/amazon-launches-dash-wand-with-alexa|title=Need Groceries?

== Replenishment service ==
The Dash Button and Dash Replenishment Service (DRS) were introduced by [[Amazon.com]] on March 31, 2015. Due to the timing of the announcement, there were a number of news stories questioning whether the Dash Button was an early [[April Fools joke]].<ref>{{cite news| work=BBC News Magazine| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32144005|date=April 1, 2015|title=April Fool's Day: 10 stories that look like pranks but aren't|author=Kelly, Jon|author2=Parkinson, Justin|author3=de Castella, Tom|author4=Sully, Andrew|last-author-amp=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/31/amazon-dash-ordering-button/70747342/|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2015|title=Amazon's Dash button--Not an April Fools' joke|author=Weise, Elaine}}</ref>

The Amazon Dash Button is a small electronic device designed to make ordering products easy and fast. The Dash buttons come in packs; each device contains an embedded button emblazoned with the name of a frequently ordered product. Users can configure each button to order a specific product and quantity, via the user's Amazon.com account, and mount the buttons, using adhesive tape or a plastic clip, to locations where they use the products. Pressing the button sends a Wi-Fi signal to the Amazon Shopping [[Application software|app]], and orders new stock of whatever product the button is configured to order; the click also sends a message to the user's mobile phone, giving the user a half-hour to cancel.

==Roll-out and response==
Initially, the Dash buttons were made available by invitation to [[Amazon Prime]] members who were invited to request the devices. The devices received mixed reviews from critics and reporters upon release,<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-horror-of-amazons-new-dash-button| work=The New Yorker|title=The Horror of Amazon's New Dash Button|author=Ian Crouch|date=April 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| work=PC World|date=April 2, 2015| title=Don't dash to Dash: new Amazon buttons aid brands, not consumers

It is part of a larger issue between Amazon and Germany, where Amazon battles with unions and is under investigation for attempting to monopolize the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-germany-court-idUSKCN1P42HW|title=Court says Amazon 'Dash' buttons violate German law|date=2019-01-10|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-03-02|language=en}}</ref>

Amazon Dash Buttons initially partnered with more than 100 brands. The most popular Dash Buttons are the Tide, Bounty, and Cottonelle buttons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Top 10|url = http://www.dashbuttondudes.com/top-10/|website = Dash Button Dudes|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}</ref>

==Alternative use==
In May 2016, [[Consumers' Research]] pointed out that Amazon Dash may be reprogrammed to use for other purposes such as ordering pizza, tracking time, and controlling lights and outlets in households configured to respond to such commands. In response, Amazon introduced a programmer-friendly, but more expensive button in the form of an "Internet of Things Dash Button" which allows programmers to make programming modifications to the device.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dolan|first1=Connor|title=Amazon’s New Programmable Dash Button|url=http://consumersresearch.org/amazons-new-programmable-dash-button/|website=Consumers' Research|publisher=Consumers' Research|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>

== End of service ==
On March 1, 2019, Amazon discontinued the series, claiming that it was made unnecessary due to automatic reordering and product subscriptions. Additionally, Amazon claimed that voice-activated shopping on Alexa products would succeed the buttons.<ref>"[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47416440 Amazon scraps Dash buttons]". ''BBC News''.
