The '''Center for Security and Emerging Technology''' ('''CSET''') is a [[think tank]] dedicated to [[policy analysis]] at the intersection of [[national security|national]] and [[international security]] and [[emerging technologies]], based at [[Georgetown University]]'s [[School of Foreign Service]].

Its mission is to study the security impacts of emerging technologies by analyzing data, supporting academic work in security and technology studies, and delivering [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] analysis to the policy community.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 2019 |title=About Us |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/ |accessdate=June 30, 2019 |publisher=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |archive-date=March 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325142713/http://cset.georgetown.edu/about-us/ |url-status=live }}</ref> CSET focuses particularly on the intersection of security and [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref>{{cite web |date=February 28, 2019 |title=Georgetown launches new $55 million center on security & emerging technology |url=https://www.georgetowntech.org/news-fullposts/2019/2/27/february-27-2019-georgetown-launches-new-55-million-center-on-security-amp-emerging-technologies |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630060206/https://www.georgetowntech.org/news-fullposts/2019/2/27/february-27-2019-georgetown-launches-new-55-million-center-on-security-amp-emerging-technologies |archive-date=June 30, 2019 |accessdate=June 30, 2019 |publisher=Institute for Technology, Law and Policy}}</ref> It addresses topics such as national competitiveness,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Compete |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/compete/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US}}</ref> opportunities related to AI,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Applications |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/applications/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US}}</ref> talent and knowledge flows,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Workforce |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/workforce/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US}}</ref> [[AI safety]] assessments,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Assessment |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/assessment/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240923163952/https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/assessment/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and AI applications in [[biotechnology]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bio-Risk |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/bio-risk/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240923163958/https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/bio-risk/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[computer security]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CyberAI |url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/cyberai/ |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=Center for Security and Emerging Technology |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240923164009/https://cset.georgetown.edu/research-topic/cyberai/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 2023, Chinese officials announced that they would be closing some of the access that foreign countries had into their public information as a result of studies from think tanks like CSET, citing concerns about cooperation between the U.S. military and the private sector.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-09 |title=China limits overseas access to data |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2023/05/09/2003799417 |access-date=2023-09-06 |website=[[Taipei Times]] |agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |archive-date=2024-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240923165151/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2023/05/09/2003799417 |url-status=live }}</ref>
