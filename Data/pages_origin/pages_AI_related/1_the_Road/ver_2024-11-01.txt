'''''1 the Road''''' is an experimental novel composed by [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Emulating [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'', Ross Goodwin drove from New York to New Orleans in March 2017 with an AI in a laptop hooked up to various sensors, whose output the AI turned into words that were printed on rolls of [[receipt paper]]. The novel was published in 2018 by Jean Boîte Éditions.

Goodwin left the text unedited. Although he felt the prose was "choppy", and contained typographical errors, he wanted to present the machine-generated text verbatim, for future study. The story begins: "It was nine seventeen in the morning, and the house was heavy".<ref name="singhub">{{cite web|url=https://singularityhub.com/2018/10/25/ai-wrote-a-road-trip-novel-is-it-a-good-read/#sm.00069qmis10ebdl7uan103cdtwnog |author=Thomas Hornigold |title=The First Novel Written by AI Is Here—and It's as Weird as You'd Expect It to Be |publisher=Singularity Hub |date=25 October 2018 |accessdate=26 February 2019 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20181029200310/https://singularityhub.com/2018/10/25/ai-wrote-a-road-trip-novel-is-it-a-good-read/ |archivedate =29 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Concept and execution==
Emulating [[Jack Kerouac]]'s novel ''[[On the Road]]'', Ross Goodwin traveled from New York to New Orleans in March 2017<ref name="atlantic"/> with three sensors, providing real-world input; a surveillance camera mounted on the trunk,<ref name="atlantic"/> trained on the passing scenery; a microphone, picking up conversations inside the car, and additionally the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), tracking the car's location.<ref name="cbcrad"/>

Input from these sources, and the time provided by the computer's internal clock,<ref name="singhub"/> was fed into a [[long short-term memory]] [[recurrent neural network]],<ref name="singhub"/> which in turn generated sentences on rolls of [[receipt paper]].<ref name="cbcrad">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/409-1.4860495/an-ai-and-an-artist-go-on-the-road-the-idea-was-to-write-a-novel-with-a-car-1.4860760 |author=|title=An AI and an artist go on the road. "The idea was to write a novel with a car." |publisher=CBC Radio |date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

The car was a Cadillac; Goodwin explained later he wanted an "authoritative" car (and was unable to get a [[Ford Crown Victoria]]), and worried that people might think him a terrorist if they saw the car with its electronics and wires. [[Google]] paid part of the cost, having become interested in Goodwin's work at [[New York University]].

Accompanying him were five other people (including his sister and his fiancée), and the Cadillac was followed by a film crew which documented the four-day journey; the documentary was directed by Lewis Rapkin.<ref name="atlantic"/>

===Training dataset===
The training dataset included a sample [[fiction]],<ref name="cbcrad"/> consisting of three different [[Text corpus|text corpora]], each with about 20 million words—one with poetry, one with science fiction, and one with "bleak" writing, in Goodwin's words. It had also been fed a data set from [[Foursquare (company)|Foursquare]]; the AI recognized locations from Foursquare, and appended commentaries to them.

The conversations captured inside the car were rendered in mutated fashion. The locations provided by the GPS were outputted verbatim, to open the day's writing.<ref name="atlantic"/>

The novel was generated letter by letter.<ref name="atlantic"/> Due to continual input from the GPS and time clock, the novel often mentions the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and time of day.<ref name="singhub"/> It was printed unedited and thus is "choppy", according to Goodwin; typos were retained, since he wanted to show the text "in its most raw form".<ref name="cbcrad"/>

Goodwin said his main purpose for this novel is to reveal the way machines create words: "In the future when this text becomes more sophisticated it's a warning. If you see patterns like this, it may not have been written by a human".<ref name="cbcrad"/>

==Reviews==
Thomas Hornigold, writing for ''[[Singularity Hub]]'', concluded that the AI is no Jack Kerouac, but that "you might see, in the odd line, the flickering ghost of something like consciousness, a deeper understanding".<ref name="singhub"/> [[Brian Merchant]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' read the entire novel in one sitting. He could not recognize a coherent plot or story arc, but saw "plenty of pixelated poetry in its ragtag assemblage of modern American imagery. And there are some striking and memorable lines".<ref name="atlantic"/>

==Ross Goodwin biography==
Ross Goodwin, a former [[ghostwriter]] for the [[Obama administration]] and a [[Creative technology|creative technologist]],<ref name="atlantic">{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/automated-on-the-road/571345/ |first=Brian|last=Merchant|author-link=Brian Merchant |title=When an AI Goes Full Jack Kerouac |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |date=1 October 2018}}</ref> has often used [[neural network]]s to create poetry and screenplays. Notable works include the short film ''[[Sunspring]]'', starring [[Thomas Middleditch]] and directed by Goodwin's frequent collaborator [[Oscar Sharp]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/|title=Movie written by algorithm turns out to be hilarious and intense|last=Newitz|first=Annalee|date=9 June 2016|website=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> and Word.Camera, an 1885 [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]] camera that outputs poetry about whatever it is pointed at when the button is pressed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futureofstorytelling.org/project/word-camera|title=word.camera|website=FutureofStorytelling|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> His Master's Thesis at [[New York University]] was a project called "Narrated Reality",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2016/project/ross-goodwin|accessdate=24 June 2019|title=Narrated Reality--Ross Goodwin|publisher=[[New York University Tisch School of the Arts]], Interactive Telecommunications Program|year=2016}}</ref> for which he walked around the city with a backpack containing compass, punch clock, and camera; data from these devices was fed into an [[LSTM]] neural network whose output was "weird associative poetry". A year after ''1 the Road'', [[Google]] hired him to work with their [[Artists and Machine Intelligence]] project.<ref name="atlantic"/>

==Quotes==
*"All the time the sun / Is wheeling out of a dark bright ground".<ref name="atlantic"/>
*"The time was one minute past midnight. But he was the only one who had to sit on his way back. The time was one minute after midnight and the wind was still standing on the counter and the little patch of straw was still still and the street was open".<ref name="cbcrad"/>
