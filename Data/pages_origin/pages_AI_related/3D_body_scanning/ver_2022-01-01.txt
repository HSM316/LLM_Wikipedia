==Applications==
While the technology is still developing{{when|date=November 2018}} in its application, the technology has regularly been applied<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.3dbodyscanning.org/cap/papers2016.html |title=List of Papers - 3DBST 2016 |website=www.3dbodyscanning.org |access-date=2 February 2017 |archive-date=3 February 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203074801/http://www.3dbodyscanning.org/cap/papers2016.html}}</ref> in the areas of:

However, despite the potential for the technology to have an impact in made-to-measure and mass customisation of items with ergonomic properties, 3D body scanning has yet to reach an early adopter or early majority stage of [[innovation diffusion]]. This in part due to the lack of ergonomic theory relating to how to identify key landmarks on the body morphology.<ref>Gill, S. (2015), "A review of research and innovation in garment sizing, prototyping and fitting", Textile Progress, Vol. 47 No. 1, pp. 1–85.</ref><ref>Gill, S., Parker, C.J., Hayes, S., Wren, P. and Panchenko, A.

Additionally, a key limitation of 3D body scanning has been the upfront cost of the equipment and the required skills by which to collect data and apply it to scientific and technical fields.

==Scanning protocol==
Although the process has been established for a considerable amount of time with international conferences held annually for industry and academics (e.g. the International Conference and Exhibition on 3D Body Scanning Technologies), the protocol and process of how to scan individuals is yet to be universally formalised.<ref>Chi, L. and Kennon, R. (2006), 'Body scanning of dynamic posture', International Journal of Clothing Science and Technology, Vol. 18 No. 3, pp. 166–178.</ref> However, earlier research <ref>{{cite book|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Hayes|first2=S|last3=Parker|first3=Christopher J.|title=3D Body Scanning: Towards Shared Protocols for Data Collection|journal=IWAMA 2016: 6th International Workshop of Advanced Manufacturing and Automation|date=2016|pages=281–284|doi=10.2991/iwama-16.2016.53|url=http://toc.proceedings.com/32122webtoc.pdf|isbn=978-94-6252-243-5|access-date=5 November 2017|archive-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030617/http://toc.proceedings.com/32122webtoc.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
has proposed a standardised protocol of body scanning based on research and practice that demonstrates how non-standardised protocol and posture significantly influences body measurements;<ref>Mckinnon, L. and Istook, C.L. (2002), ‘Body scanning: The effects of subject respiration and foot positioning on the data integrity of scanned measurements’, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, Vol. 6 No. 2, pp. 103–121.</ref> including the hip.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=Scan posture definition and hip girth measurement: the impact on clothing design and body scanning|journal=Ergonomics|date=2017|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1123–1136|doi=10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|pmid=27764997|s2cid=23758581|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/33471|access-date=16 September 2021|archive-date=22 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022102411/https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Scan_posture_definition_and_hip_girth_measurement_the_impact_on_clothing_design_and_body_scanning/9347600|url-status=live}}</ref>

The standard scanning protocol, however, produces no measurements that fail to meet the precision of manual measurement methods or ISO 20685:2010's<ref>[https://www.iso.org/standard/54909.html ISO 20685:2010]</ref> tolerances.
