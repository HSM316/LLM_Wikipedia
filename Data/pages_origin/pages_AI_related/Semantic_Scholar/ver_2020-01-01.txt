'''Semantic Scholar''' is a project developed at the [[Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence]]. Publicly released in November 2015, it is designed to be an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-backed search engine for [[scientific journal|scientific journal]] articles.<ref name="MyUser_The_Washington_Post_November_3_2015c">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/11/02/paul-allens-ai-research-group-unveils-program-that-aims-to-shake-up-how-we-search-scientific-knowledge-give-it-a-try/ |title=Paul Allen's AI research group unveils program that aims to shake up how we search scientific knowledge.

As of January 2018, following a 2017 project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries, the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from [[computer science]] and [[biomedicine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/ai2-semantic-scholar-biomedicine/|title=AI2 scales up Semantic Scholar search engine to encompass biomedical research|date=2017-10-17|work=GeekWire|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In March 2018, Doug Raymond, who developed [[machine learning]] initiatives for the [[Amazon Alexa]] platform, was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/tech-moves-allen-institute-hires-amazon-alexa-machine-learning-leader-microsoft-chairman-takes-new-investor-role/|publisher=GeekWire|title=Tech Moves: Allen Instititue Hires Amazon Alexa Machine Learning Leader; Microsoft Chairman Takes on New Investor Role; and More|date=2018-05-02}}</ref> As of August 2019, the number of included papers had grown to more than 173 million<ref>{{cite web |title=main page |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/ |website=Semantic Scholar |accessdate=11 August 2019}}</ref> after the addition of the [[Microsoft Academic Graph]] records<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-08-25|title=AI2 joins forces with Microsoft Research to upgrade search tools for scientific studies|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/ai2-joins-forces-microsoft-upgrade-search-tools-scientific-research/|date=2018-12-05|website=GeekWire}}</ref>.
