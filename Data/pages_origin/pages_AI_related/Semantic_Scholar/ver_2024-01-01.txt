'''Semantic Scholar''' is a research tool for scientific literature powered by [[artificial intelligence]]. It is developed at the [[Allen Institute for AI]] and was publicly released in November 2015.<ref name="Eunjung Cha 3Nov2015">{{Cite news |first1=Ariana |last1=Eunjung Cha |date=3 November 2015 |title=Paul Allen's AI research group unveils program that aims to shake up how we search scientific knowledge.

Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of [[computer science]], [[geoscience]], and [[neuroscience]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Fricke|first=Suzanne|date=2018-01-12|title=Semantic Scholar|url=http://jmla.pitt.edu/ojs/jmla/article/view/280|journal=[[Journal of the Medical Library Association]]|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=145–147|doi=10.5195/jmla.2018.280|s2cid=45802944|issn=1558-9439|doi-access=free}}</ref> In 2017, the system began including [[biomedical literature]] in its corpus.<ref name=":0" /> {{As of|2022|Sep}}, it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matthews |first1=David |title=Drowning in the literature?

== Technology ==
Semantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary of [[scientific literature]]. One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices.<ref name="Grad 24Nov2020">{{Cite news |last=Grad |first=Peter |date=November 24, 2020 |title=AI tool summarizes lengthy papers in a sentence |url=https://techxplore.com/news/2020-11-ai-tool-lengthy-papers-sentence.html |access-date=2021-02-16 |work=Tech Xplore |language=en}}</ref> It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-23 |title=Allen Institute's Semantic Scholar now searches across 175 million academic papers |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/23/allen-institutes-semantic-scholar-now-searches-across-175-million-academic-papers/ |access-date=2021-02-16 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper, generating it through an "abstractive" technique.<ref name="Hao 18Nov2020"/> The project uses a combination of [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[machine vision]] to add a layer of [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] to the traditional methods of [[citation analysis]], and to extract relevant figures, [[table extraction|tables]], entities, and venues from papers.<ref name="Bohannon">{{Cite journal |last=Bohannon |first=John |date=11 November 2016 |title=A computer program just ranked the most influential brain scientists of the modern era |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/computer-program-just-ranked-most-influential-brain-scientists-modern-era |url-status=live |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.aal0371 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429134813/https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/computer-program-just-ranked-most-influential-brain-scientists-modern-era |archive-date=29 April 2020 |access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Q | Q108172042 }}</ref>

Another key AI-powered feature is Research Feeds, an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date. It uses a state-of-the-art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Semantic Scholar {{!}} Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/faq#what-are-research-feeds |url-status=live|archive-date=July 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715223949/https://www.semanticscholar.org/faq#what-are-research-feeds}}</ref>

Semantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader, an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Semantic Scholar {{!}} Semantic Reader |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/semantic-reader |url-status=live |website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230715224159/https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/semantic-reader|archive-date=July 15, 2023}}</ref> Semantic Reader provides in-line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster.

In contrast with [[Google Scholar]] and [[PubMed]], Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ijlls.org/index.php/ijlls/announcement/view/1|title=Semantic Scholar
|website=International Journal of Language and Literary Studies|access-date=2021-11-09}}</ref> The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baykoucheva|first=Svetla|title=Driving Science Information Discovery in the Digital Age|publisher=Chandos Publishing|year=2021|isbn=978-0-12-823724-3|pages=91|language=en}}</ref> Like the previously cited search engines, Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures, which include the [[Microsoft Academic|Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph]], Springer Nature's [[SciGraph]], and the Semantic Scholar Corpus.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jose|first1=Joemon M.|title=Advances in Information Retrieval: 42nd European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2020, Lisbon, Portugal, April 14–17, 2020, Proceedings, Part I|last2=Yilmaz|first2=Emine|last3=Magalhães|first3=João|last4=Castells|first4=Pablo|last5=Ferro|first5=Nicola|last6=Silva|first6=Mário J.|last7=Martins|first7=Flávio|publisher=Springer Nature|year=2020|isbn=978-3-030-45438-8|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=254|language=en}}</ref>

Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique [[identifier]] called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID (abbreviated S2CID). The following entry is an example:

<blockquote>{{Cite journal <!-- Citation bot bypass-->|last1=Liu |first1=Ying |last2=Gayle |first2=Albert A |last3=Wilder-Smith |first3=Annelies |last4=Rocklöv |first4=Joacim |date=March 2020 |title=The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus |journal=Journal of Travel Medicine |volume=27 |issue=2 |pmid=32052846|doi=10.1093/jtm/taaa021 |s2cid=211099356 }}</blockquote>

Semantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines (i.e. [[Google Scholar]]) does not search for material that is behind a [[paywall]].<ref name=":0" />{{citation needed|reason=This source does make this claim, but as a throwaway line by a non-expert. Can we find a better source? The claim seems false.|date=March 2023}}

One study compared the index scope of Semantic Scholar to Google Scholar, and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science, the two indices had comparable coverage, each only missing a handful of the papers.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hannousse|first=Abdelhakim|date=2021|title=Searching relevant papers for software engineering secondary studies: Semantic Scholar coverage and identification role|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1049/sfw2.12011|journal=IET Software|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=126–146|doi=10.1049/sfw2.12011|s2cid=234053002|issn=1751-8814}}</ref>

== Number of users and publications ==
As of January 2018, following a 2017 project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries, the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from [[computer science]] and [[biomedicine]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-10-17 |title=AI2 scales up Semantic Scholar search engine to encompass biomedical research |language=en-US |work=GeekWire |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/ai2-semantic-scholar-biomedicine/ |url-status=live |access-date=2018-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120110/https://www.geekwire.com/2017/ai2-semantic-scholar-biomedicine/ |archive-date=2018-01-19}}</ref> In March 2018, Doug Raymond, who developed [[machine learning]] initiatives for the [[Amazon Alexa]] platform, was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-05-02 |title=Tech Moves: Allen Instititue Hires Amazon Alexa Machine Learning Leader; Microsoft Chairman Takes on New Investor Role; and More |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/tech-moves-allen-institute-hires-amazon-alexa-machine-learning-leader-microsoft-chairman-takes-new-investor-role/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510120907/https://www.geekwire.com/2018/tech-moves-allen-institute-hires-amazon-alexa-machine-learning-leader-microsoft-chairman-takes-new-investor-role/ |archive-date=2018-05-10 |access-date=2018-05-09 |publisher=GeekWire}}</ref> {{As of|2019|Aug}}, the number of included papers metadata (not the actual PDFs) had grown to more than 173 million<ref>{{Cite web |title=Semantic Scholar |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811212806/https://www.semanticscholar.org/ |archive-date=11 August 2019 |access-date=11 August 2019 |website=Semantic Scholar}}</ref> after the addition of the [[Microsoft Academic Graph]] records.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-12-05 |title=AI2 joins forces with Microsoft Research to upgrade search tools for scientific studies |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/ai2-joins-forces-microsoft-upgrade-search-tools-scientific-research/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825181331/https://www.geekwire.com/2018/ai2-joins-forces-microsoft-upgrade-search-tools-scientific-research/ |archive-date=2019-08-25 |access-date=2019-08-25 |website=GeekWire}}</ref> In 2020, a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the [[University of Chicago Press|University of Chicago Press Journals]] made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The University of Chicago Press joins more than 500 publishers working with Semantic Scholar to improve search and discoverability|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/pr/201215|access-date=2021-11-22|website=RCNi Company Limited|language=en}}</ref> At the end of 2020, Semantic Scholar had indexed 190 million papers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dunn|first=Adriana|date=December 14, 2020|title=Semantic Scholar Adds 25 Million Scientific Papers in 2020 Through New Publisher Partnerships|work=Semantic Scholar|url=https://allenai.org/content/docs/Semantic_Scholar_2020_Publisher_Partners.pdf|access-date=November 22, 2021}}</ref>

In 2020, Semantic Scholar reached seven million users per month.<ref name="Grad 24Nov2020"/> It is problematic in that it uses AI, and cannot distinguish therefore between reviews of books and books themselves, frequently listing only the reviews and refusing to include the books reviewed. Furthermore, because it uses science standards—initials plus last name—it cannot distinguish between authors with common names. The field assigned to papers is also not clearly distinguished, listing "History" for Literature papers and similar issues. No citation is necessary for this assertion as users can verify it for themselves: for example, search for "Divine Comedy" (Dante's fourteenth century masterpiece) and get feedback such as a book review appearing as "Art" (see line three, an actual response below).
