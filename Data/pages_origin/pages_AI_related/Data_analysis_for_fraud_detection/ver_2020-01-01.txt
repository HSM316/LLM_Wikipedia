[[Fraud]] is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The [[PwC]] global [[economic crime]] survey of 2018<ref name="Lavion, et al. 2018">{{cite web |last1=Lavion |first1=Didier|display-authors=et al |title=PwC’s Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2018 |url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/forensics/global-economic-crime-and-fraud-survey-2018.pdf |website=PwC.com |accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref> found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind. This is an increase from the [https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/GlobalEconomicCrimeSurvey2016.pdf PwC 2016 study] in which slightly more than a third  of organizations surveyed (36%) had experienced economic crime.

Fraud possibilities co-evolve with technology, esp. [[Information technology]]<ref name="bolton_2002" /> Business reengineering, reorganization or downsizing may weaken or eliminate control, while new [[information system]]s may present additional opportunities to commit fraud.



Traditional methods of [[data analysis]] have long been used to '''detect fraud'''. They require complex and time-consuming investigations that deal with different domains of knowledge like financial, economics, business practices and law. Fraud often consists of many instances or incidents involving repeated transgressions using the same method. Fraud instances can be similar in content and appearance but usually are not identical.<ref name="palshikar_2002" />

The first industries to use data analysis techniques to prevent fraud were the [[telephone companies]], the [[insurance companies]] and the [[bank]]s (Decker 1998). One early example of successful implementation of data analysis techniques in the banking industry is the FICO Falcon fraud assessment system, which is based on a neural network shell.

Retail industries also suffer from fraud at [[point of sale|POS]]. Some supermarkets have started to make use of digitized [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) together with POS data of most susceptible transactions to fraud.


Fraud that involves [[cell phone]]s, [[insurance claim]]s, [[tax return]] claims, [[Credit card fraud|credit card transactions]] etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses, but yet detecting and preventing fraud is not a simple task. Fraud is an adaptive crime, so it needs special methods of intelligent data analysis to detect and prevent it. These methods exist in the areas of [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases]] (KDD), [[Data Mining]], [[Machine Learning]] and [[Statistics]]. They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of fraud crimes.

In general, the primary reason to use data analytics techniques is to tackle fraud since many internal control systems have serious weaknesses. In order to effectively test, detect, validate, correct error and monitor control systems against fraudulent activities, businesses entities and organizations rely on specialized data analytics techniques such as data mining, data matching, sounds like function, Regression analysis, Clustering analysis and Gap.<ref name="English302gmu" />
Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name="palshikar_2002" /> Examples of statistical data analysis techniques are:
* [[Data preprocessing]] techniques for detection, validation, [[error correction]], and filling up of missing or incorrect data.
* Calculation of various statistical parameters such as [[average]]s, [[quantile]]s, performance metrics, probability distributions, and so on. For example, the averages may include average length of call, average number of calls per month and average delays in bill payment.
* Models and probability distributions of various business activities either in terms of various parameters or probability distributions.
* Computing [[user profile]]s.
* Time-series analysis of time-dependent data.
* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] and [[statistical classification|classification]] to find patterns and [[data association|associations]] among groups of data.
* [[Data matching ]] Data matching is used to compare two sets of collected data. The process can be performed based on algorithms or programmed loops. Trying to match sets of data against each other or comparing complex data types. Data matching is used to remove duplicate records and identify links between two data sets for marketing, security or other uses.<ref name="English302gmu" />
* Sounds like Function is used to find values that sound similar. The Phonetic similarity is one way to locate possible duplicate values, or inconsistent spelling in manually entered data. The ‘sounds like’ function converts the comparison strings to four-character American Soundex codes, which are based on the first letter, and the first three consonants after the first letter, in each string.<ref name="English302gmu" />
*[[Regression analysis]] allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. Regression analysis estimates relationships between independent variables and a dependent variable. This method can be used to help understand and identify relationships among variables and predict actual results.<ref name="English302gmu" />
*[[Gap analysis]] is used to determine whether business requirements are being met, if not, what are the steps that should be taken to meet successfully. Referring to the article “Fraud analysis techniques using ACL” [6] gap refers to the space between "where we are" (the present state) and "where we want to be" (the target state).<ref name="English302gmu" />
* [[Pattern matching|Matching algorithm]]s to [[Anomaly detection|detect anomalies]] in the behavior of transactions or users as compared to previously known models and profiles. Techniques are also needed to eliminate [[false alarm]]s, estimate risks, and predict future of current transactions or users.
Some [[forensic accountant]]s specialize in [[Computational forensics|forensic analytics]] which is the procurement and analysis of [[Digital data|electronic data]] to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud.  The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) [[data collection]], (b) [[data preparation]], (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting.  For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's [[purchasing card]] activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.  Forensic analytics might be used to review the invoicing activity for a vendor to identify fictitious vendors, and these techniques might also be used by a franchisor to detect fraudulent or erroneous sales reports by the franchisee in a [[franchising]] environment.<ref>{{cite web| last =  Nigrini| first =  Mark| title = Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations| publisher = John Wiley & Sons Inc.| location = Hoboken, NJ| ISBN = 978-0-470-89046-2| date = June 2011| url =  http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470890460.html}}</ref>

Fraud detection is a knowledge-intensive activity. The main AI techniques used for fraud detection include:
* [[Data mining]] to classify, cluster, and segment the data and automatically find associations and rules in the data that may signify interesting patterns, including those related to fraud.
* [[Expert system]]s to encode expertise for detecting fraud in the form of rules.
* [[Pattern recognition]] to detect approximate classes, clusters, or patterns of suspicious behavior either automatically (unsupervised) or to match given inputs.
* Machine learning techniques to automatically identify characteristics of fraud.
* Neural networks that can learn suspicious patterns from samples and used later to detect them.

Other techniques such as [[link analysis]], [[Bayesian networks]], [[decision theory]], and [[Pattern matching|sequence matching]] are also used for fraud detection.<ref name="palshikar_2002" /> A new and novel technique called System properties approach has also been employed where ever rank data is available. <ref>{{cite web| last =  Vani| first =  G. K.| title = How to detect data collection fraud using System properties approach| journal = Multilogic in Science| issn=2277-7601| issue= SPECIAL ISSUE ICAAASTSD-2018|volume=VII|date = February 2018| url =  http://www.ycjournal.net/Multilogicinscience/ResearchPapers.aspx|access-date=February 2, 2019}}</ref>

Statistical analysis of research data is the most comprehensive method for determining if data fraud exists. Data fraud as defined by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) includes fabrication, falsification and plagiarism. The first peer reviewed published paper on data fraud is currently being reviewed. Once published, it will become the standard for scientific and legal/court analysis. The statistical work was performed by Drs. Mark S. Kaiser and Alicia L. Carriquiry of Iowa State University and Dr. Gordon M Harrington of the University of Northern Iowa, where they showed that data thought to be fabricated [HI data] was in fact real, while another set of data [Hansen data] was reported to the statisticians as being fabricated was in fact falsified and plagiarized from the HI data set. <Fleming RM, Fleming MR, Chaudhuri TK.

The younger companies in the fraud prevention space tend to rely on systems that have been based around machine learning, rather than later incorporating machine learning into an existing system.

==Machine learning and data mining==
{{Main|Machine learning|Data mining}}

Early data analysis techniques were oriented toward extracting quantitative and statistical data characteristics. These techniques facilitate useful data interpretations and can help to get better insights into the processes behind the data. Although the traditional data analysis techniques can indirectly lead us to knowledge, it is still created by human analysts.<ref name="michalski_1998" />

To go beyond, a data analysis system has to be equipped with a substantial amount of background knowledge, and be able to perform reasoning tasks involving that knowledge and the data provided.<ref name="michalski_1998" /> In effort to meet this goal, researchers have turned to ideas from the machine learning field. This is a natural source of ideas, since the machine learning task can be described as turning background knowledge and examples (input) [[knowledge extraction|into knowledge]] (output).

If data mining results in discovering meaningful patterns, data turns into information. Information or patterns that are novel, valid and potentially useful are not merely information, but knowledge. One speaks of discovering knowledge, before hidden in the huge amount of data, but now revealed.

The machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions may be classified into two categories: 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning. These methods seek for accounts, customers, suppliers, etc. that behave 'unusually' in order to output suspicion scores, rules or visual anomalies, depending on the method.<ref name="bolton_2002" />

Whether supervised or unsupervised methods are used, note that the output gives us only an indication of fraud likelihood. No stand alone statistical analysis can assure that a particular object is a fraudulent one, but they can identify them with very high degrees of accuracy.

=== Supervised learning ===
{{Main|Supervised learning}}

In supervised learning, a random sub-sample of all records is taken and manually classified as either 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent'. Relatively rare events such as fraud may need to be over sampled to get a big enough sample size.<ref name="dal2014learned" /> These manually classified records are then used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm. After building a model using this training data, the algorithm should be able to classify new records as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Supervised neural networks, fuzzy neural nets, and combinations of neural nets and rules, have been extensively explored and used for detecting fraud in mobile phone networks and financial statement fraud.<ref name="green_1997" /><ref name="estevez_2006" />

Bayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud.<ref name="Bhowmik">{{cite web|last1=Bhowmik|first1=Rekha Bhowmik|title=35    Data Mining Techniques in Fraud Detection|url=http://ojs.jdfsl.org/index.php/jdfsl/article/viewFile/180/108|website=Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law|publisher=University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref>

Hybrid knowledge/statistical-based systems, where expert knowledge is integrated with statistical power, use a series of data mining techniques for the purpose of detecting cellular clone fraud. Specifically, a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behaviour from a large database of customer transactions is implemented.<ref name="fawcett_1997" />

Cahill et al. (2000) design a fraud signature, based on data of fraudulent calls, to detect telecommunications fraud. For scoring a call for fraud its probability under the account signature is compared to its probability under a fraud signature. The fraud signature is updated sequentially, enabling event-driven fraud detection.

[[Link analysis]] comprehends a different approach. It relates known fraudsters to other individuals, using record linkage and social network methods.<ref name="phua_2005" /><ref name="cortes_2002" />

This type of detection is only able to detect frauds similar to those which have occurred previously and been classified by a human. To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

===Unsupervised learning===
{{Main|Unsupervised learning}}

In contrast, unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records.

Some important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand<ref name="bolton_2001" /> use [[Peer Group Analysis]] and [[Break Point Analysis]] applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand<ref name="bolton_2001" /> develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.

Also, Murad and Pinkas<ref name="murad_1999" /> focus on behavioural changes for the purpose of fraud detection and present three-level-profiling. Three-level-profiling method operates at the account level and points to any significant deviation from an account's normal behaviour as a potential fraud. In order to do this, 'normal' profiles are created based on data without fraudulent records (semi supervised). In the same field, also Burge and Shawe-Taylor<ref name="burge_2001" /> use behaviour profiling for the purpose of fraud detection. However, using a recurrent neural network for prototyping calling behaviour, unsupervised learning is applied.

Cox et al.<ref name="cox_1997" /> combines human [[pattern recognition]] skills with automated data algorithms. In their work, information is presented visually by domain-specific interfaces, combining human pattern recognition skills with automated data algorithms (Jans et al.)<!--http://www.acc.ncku.edu.tw/chinese/faculty/shulc/courses/cas/articles/internal-fraud-risk-reduction.pdf ? -->.
