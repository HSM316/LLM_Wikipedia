== Details ==

The INGENIAS approach based on MDE supports research in different areas characterized by the use of modeling languages and requiring flexibility to adapt these to new requirements. In particular, it has been very successful in the areas of [[Software agent|Software Agents]] and [[Agent-based model|Agent-based simulation]].<ref name="fuentes2012metamodels">{{cite journal

The [[Software agent|agent paradigm]] uses the concept of ''agent'' as the basis to develop complex software systems. The field is fairly fragmented with different approaches on how to apply agents and perspectives on the agent concept itself. In this context, INGENIAS emerged as an integrative approach able to support the simultaneous use of different works.<ref name=gomez2002metodologia /> This use is based in the facilities to develop new version of its modeling language. The addition, modification, or deletion of concepts just requires modifying its meta-models and then regenerating the development tools using INGENME.<ref name=gomez2010ingenme /> This allows researchers focusing on the theoretical tasks of deciding what are the relevant concepts, relationships and attributes of their work, as the infrastructure generates the support tools for their application.

This flexibility has facilitated that INGENIAS addressed new extensions over the years. Two of them are of particular relevance. INGENIAS development process has been one of the few processes of agent-oriented [[Software development methodologies|methodologies]] in having their development process formally specified with [[SPEM]], a language of the Object Management Group ([[Object Management Group|OMG]]). Currently, there is one development process based on the [[Unified Process]] and another based on [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]].<ref name=garcia2009ingenias>{{cite book

It also incorporated research on [[requirements elicitation]] from an organizational perspective. This work adopts the [[Activity Theory]] framework from [[Social Sciences]] to develop a modeling language for requirements with a holistic perspective of organizations and their systems, as well as several semi-automated processes for the elicitation and validation of these requirements.<ref name="fuentes2004teoria">{{cite thesis

The continuous revision of the INGENIAS modeling language and the tools for its application have made of it one of the most popular methodologies in the literature and actually applied by researchers and engineers. It has been repeatedly included in relevant surveys and comparisons in the field (according to [[Google Scholar]], Elsevier's [[Scopus]] and Thomson ISI's [[Web of Knowledge]]), e.g., Brian Henderson-Sellers and Paolo Giorgini (2005) or Beydoun et al. (2009).<ref name=henderson2005agent>{{cite book
