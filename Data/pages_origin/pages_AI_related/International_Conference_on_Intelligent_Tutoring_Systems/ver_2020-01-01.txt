The International Conference on [[Intelligent tutoring system|Intelligent Tutoring Systems]] (ITS) is the oldest conference series in the field of intelligent educational systems. It was established in 1988 by Claude Frasson. The first several events were held every four years and, while engaging a broad international audience, were always located in [[Montreal]], Canada. The growth of the field encouraged the transformation into a biannual internationally-organized event, which was originally held every other year, opposite the [[International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education]]. Since 1992, the Proceedings of the conference are being published by [[Springer Publishing|Springer]] in the popular [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] series.<ref>{{cite book| author = Claude Frasson |author2=Gilles Gauthier| title = Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Second International Conference, ITS '92, Montreal, Canada, June 10-12, 1992.
