'''DAYDREAMER''' is a [[Intelligent agent#Goal-based agents|goal-based agent]] and [[cognitive architecture]] developed at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] by Erik Mueller. It models the human stream of thought and its triggering and direction by emotions, as in human [[daydream]]ing.<ref name = "Turner">Turner, Scott R. (1994).

University of California Press, 1 May 2010 </ref> The architecture is implemented as 12,000 lines of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] code.

==History==
DAYDREAMER was begun by Erik Mueller in 1983 while he was studying under [[Michael G. Dyer]] in the [[UCLA]] Computer Science Department.<ref name ="Dyer">Dyer, Michael G. (1994).

''Contemplating Minds: A Forum for Artificial Intelligence'', p. 262. MIT Press</ref> It was completed in 1987 and was followed by the ThoughtTreasure program, which was started in 1993.
