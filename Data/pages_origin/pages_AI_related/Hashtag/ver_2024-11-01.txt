A '''hashtag''' is a [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tag]] that is prefaced by the [[Number sign|hash symbol]], '''''#'''''. On [[social media]], hashtags are used on [[microblogging]] and [[photo sharing|photo-sharing]] services such as [[Twitter]] or [[Tumblr]] as a form of [[user-generated content|user-generated]] tagging that enables [[cross-referencing]] of content by topic or theme.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Hsia-Ching |last2=Iyer |first2=Hemalata |title=Trends in Twitter – Hashtag Applications: Design Features for Value-Added Dimensions to Future Library Catalogues |journal=Library Trends |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=248–258 |doi=10.1353/lib.2012.0024 |issn=1559-0682 |year=2012 |s2cid=34506239}}</ref> For example, a search within [[Instagram]] for the hashtag ''#bluesky'' returns all posts that have been tagged with that term.

== Origin and acceptance ==
[[File:Chris Messina - South by Southwest 2010 (1).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25 |alt=Chris Messina proposed the use of hashtags in his famous 2007 tweet. |[[Chris Messina (open-source advocate)|Chris Messina]] suggested using hashtags on Twitter]]
The [[Number sign|number sign or hash symbol]], ''#'', has long been used in [[information technology]] to highlight specific pieces of text. In 1970, the number sign was used to denote ''immediate'' [[address mode]] in the [[assembly language]] of the [[PDP-11]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://programmer209.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/the-pdp-11-assembly-language/ |title=PDP-11 assembly language |publisher=Programmer209.wordpress.com |date=August 3, 2011 |access-date=August 25, 2014}}</ref> when placed next to a symbol or a number, and around 1973, '#' was introduced in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] to indicate special keywords that the [[C preprocessor]] had to process first.<ref>{{cite book |title=The C Programming Language |author1=B.&nbsp;W.

{{quote |1=How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? |author = Chris Messina |source = ("factoryjoe"), August 23, 2007<ref name="the tweet" />}}

According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for lay users without specialized knowledge of search protocols to find specific relevant content. Therefore, the hashtag "was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=Kate |date=May 1, 2015 |title=The pragmatics of hashtags: Inference and conversational style on Twitter |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |volume=81 |pages=8–20 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2015.03.015 |url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/31291/1/Scott-K-31291.pdf}}</ref>

The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings" by Stowe Boyd,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stoweboyd.com/post/39877198249/hash-tags-twitter-groupings |title=Stowe Boyd, Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings |publisher=Stoweboyd.com |access-date=September 19, 2013 |archive-date=September 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915192357/http://stoweboyd.com/post/39877198249/hash-tags-twitter-groupings |url-status=dead }}</ref> on August 26, 2007, according to [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] [[Ben Zimmer]], chair of the [[American Dialect Society]]'s New Words Committee.

Messina's suggestion to use the hashtag was not immediately adopted by Twitter, but the convention gained popular acceptance when hashtags were used in tweets relating to the [[2007 California wildfires#San Diego County|2007 San Diego forest fires]] in Southern California.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ What is hashtag?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425141850/http://mashable.com/2013/10/08/what-is-hashtag/ |date=April 25, 2016 }}, Mashable, 8 October 2013.</ref><ref name="factoryjoe">{{cite web |url=https://factoryjoe.com/2007/10/22/twitter-hashtags-for-emergency-coordination-and-disaster-relief/ |title=Twitter hashtags for emergency coordination and disaster relief |website=Factory Joe |access-date=September 16, 2017 |date=2007-10-23}}</ref> The hashtag gained international acceptance during the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]; Twitter users used both English- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-language hashtags in communications during the events.<ref>{{cite news |title=The story of the hashtag began with Iranians |url=http://www.dw.de/حکایت-هشتگی-که-ایرانیان-آغاز-کردند/g-18012627 |access-date=March 12, 2015 |publisher=Deutsche Welle Persian |date=2009}}</ref>

Hashtags have since played critical roles in recent [[hashtag activism|social movements]] such as [[Je Suis Charlie|#jesuischarlie]], [[Black Lives Matter|#BLM]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277852/blackout-tuesday-posts-hiding-information-blm-black-lives-matter-hashtag |title=Blackout Tuesday posts are drowning out vital information shared under the BLM hashtag |first=James |last=Vincent |date=June 2, 2020 |work=[[The Verge]]}}</ref> and [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=#MeToo and more — five hashtags for equality |date=2019-10-15 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/metoo-and-more-five-hashtags-for-equality/a-50838357 |access-date=2020-09-03 |website=[[DW.com]] |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Brown |first=Dalvin |title=19 million tweets later: A look at #MeToo a year after the hashtag went viral |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/13/metoo-impact-hashtag-made-online/1633570002/ |access-date=2020-09-03 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular, and the significance of trending hashtags has become so great that the company makes significant efforts to foil attempts to [[spamming|spam]] the trending list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |title=The Secret of Twitter's Trending Hashtags With Insight and Tips |publisher=AllISayIs.com |access-date=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141532/http://www.allisayis.com/the-secret-of-twitters-trending-hashtags-with-insight-and-tips/ |archive-date=May 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the 2010 World Cup, Twitter explicitly encouraged the use of hashtags with the temporary deployment of "hashflags", which replaced hashtags of [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3|three-letter country codes]] with their respective national flags.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |title=Twitter Supports World Cup Fever with Hashflags |publisher=Ryanseacrest.com |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=August 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129201517/http://ryanseacrest.com/2010/06/11/twitter-supports-world-cup-fever-with-hashflags/ |archive-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>

Other platforms such as [[YouTube]] and [[Gawker Media]] followed in officially supporting hashtags,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/10/got-a-tip-gawker-media-opens-tag-pages-to-masses-expecting-chaos/ |title = Got a #tip? Gawker Media opens tag pages to masses, expecting "chaos" |author = Zachary M. Seward |publisher = Nieman Journalism Lab |date = October 15, 2009 <!-- 8 a.m. -->}}</ref> and real-time search aggregators such as [[Google Real-Time Search]] began supporting hashtags.

== Format ==
A hashtag must begin with a hash (#) character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space or the end of the line. Some platforms may require the # to be preceded with a space. Most or all platforms that support hashtags permit the inclusion of letters (without [[diacritics]]), numerals, and underscores.{{r|charset}} Other characters may be supported on a platform-by-platform basis. Some characters, such as & are generally not supported as they may already serve other search functions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eden |first=Terence |author-link=Terence Eden |date=25 February 2010 |title=Hashtag Standards |url=https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2010/02/hashtag-standards/ |access-date=21 September 2017 |website=Terence Eden's Blog}}</ref> Hashtags are not case sensitive (a search for "#hashtag" will match "#HashTag" as well), but the use of embedded capitals (i.e., [[CamelCase]]) increases legibility and improves accessibility.

Languages that do not use [[word divider]]s handle hashtags differently. In China, microblogs [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Tencent Weibo]] use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between [[Chinese characters]] necessitates a closing tag. [[Twitter]] uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and [[orthographies]] with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g., '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你')<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Rick|title=Twitter Rolls Out Hashtag Support for Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian|url=https://www.techinasia.com/twitter-hashtag-languages/|access-date=March 5, 2015|publisher=Tech in Asia|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> or by [[zero-width non-joiner]] characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我‌#爱‌你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).<ref>{{cite news|last1=International services team|title=Right-to-left languages on Twitter|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|access-date=March 5, 2015|publisher=Twitter|date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172013/https://blog.twitter.com/2012/right-to-left-languages-on-twitter|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Etiquette and regulation===
Some communities may limit, officially or unofficially, the number of hashtags permitted on a single post.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a (#) Hashtag?|url=http://www.hashtags.org/how-to/history/what-is-a-hashtag/|publisher=Hashtags.org|date=24 June 2012|access-date=February 22, 2014}}</ref>

Misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation can filter an account from search results, or suspend the account.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Twitter Rules|url=https://support.twitter.com/groups/56-policies-violations/topics/236-twitter-rules-policies/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|access-date=September 22, 2017|quote=if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # ...}}</ref>

Individual platforms may deactivate certain hashtags either for being too generic to be useful, such as #photography on Instagram, or due to their use to facilitate illegal activities.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24842750 |title=Instagram banned hashtags | date = November 7, 2013|work=[[BBC.co.uk]] |access-date=November 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Olszanowski |first=M. |date=2014 |title=Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship{{sic|hide=y}} |journal=[[Visual Communication Quarterly]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=83–95 |access-date=February 8, 2015 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15551393.2014.928154 |url-access=subscription |doi=10.1080/15551393.2014.928154|s2cid=145667227 }}</ref>

== Function ==

Hashtags are particularly useful in unmoderated forums that lack a formal [[ontological]] organization. Hashtags help users find content similar interest. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, and that the accepted meaning of a hashtag can change with time.

Hashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become "trending topics" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there must be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.

Hashtags may be used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. Hashtags may thus serve as a reflexive meta-commentary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linguistics.fi/julkaisut/SKY2014/Wikstrom.pdf|title=#srynotfunny: Communicative Functions of Hashtags on Twitter|last=Wikström|first=Peter|date=2014|work=SKY Journal of Linguistics|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>

This can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. "My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with "It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.skase.sk/Volumes/JTL28/pdf_doc/05.pdf|title=The 'hashtag': A new word or a new rule?|last=Caleffi|first=Paola-Maria|website=Skase Journal of Theoretical Linguistics}}</ref>

=== Co-optation by other industries ===
Companies, businesses, and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.

In the early 2010s, some [[television]] broadcasters began to employ hashtags related to programs in [[Digital on-screen graphic|digital on-screen graphics]], to encourage viewers to participate in a [[backchannel]] of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Michael Schneider|date=April 21, 2011<!-- 3:25 PM-->|title=New to Your TV Screen: Twitter Hashtags|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/New-TV-Screen-1032111.aspx|magazine=TV Guide}}</ref> [[Television commercial]]s have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Wasserman|date=December 3, 2012|title=McDonald's Releases First TV Ad With Twitter Hashtag|url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/03/mcdonalds-tv-ad-twitter-hashtag/|publisher=Mashable}}</ref>

The increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded "[[Index term|keywords]]" by [[AOL]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/10/twitter-hashtag-pages-aol-keywords/|title = Twitter's Hashtag Pages Could Be The New AOL Keywords — But Better|author = Ryan Lawler|date = June 10, 2012|publisher = Techcrunch}}</ref>

Organized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.

Since the 2012–13 season, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/11/15/2014-nba-all-star-ballot-official-release/|title=NBA and Sprint tip off NBA All-Star Balloting 2014|website=[[NBA.com]]|date=November 15, 2013}}</ref>

Political protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as [[Occupy Wall Street|#OccupyWallStreet]] and [[2011 Libyan civil war|#LibyaFeb17]], have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags are frequently employed to either show support or opposition towards political figures. For example, the hashtag [[Make America Great Again|#MakeAmericaGreatAgain]] signifies support for Trump, whereas [[Communication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic|#DisinfectantDonnie]] expresses ridicule of Trump.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Wan |first=Ming Feng |date=2024-03-12 |title=The role of syntax in hashtag popularity |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0051/html |journal=[[Linguistics Vanguard]] |language=en |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2023-0051 |issn=2199-174X}}</ref> Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] officially titled the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] as the "#HELSINKI2018 Meeting".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://um.fi/helsinki2018|title=#HELSINKI2018 - Ministry for Foreign Affairs|website=um.fi|access-date=2018-07-11|archive-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710075902/https://um.fi/helsinki2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hashtags have been used to gather customer criticism of large companies. In January 2012, [[McDonald's]] created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain, but the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when critical tweets outnumbered praising ones.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alexis | last = Akwagyiram | title = Are Twitter and Facebook changing the way we complain? | date = May 17, 2012 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18081651 | work = BBC News | access-date = June 12, 2012}}</ref>

In 2017, the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] hashtag became viral in response to the sexual harassment accusations against [[Harvey Weinstein]]. The use of this hashtag can be considered part of [[hashtag activism]], spreading awareness across eighty-five different countries with more than seventeen million Tweets using the hashtag #MeToo. This hashtag was not only used to spread awareness of accusations regarding Harvey Weinstein but allowed different women to share their experiences of [[sexual violence]]. Using this hashtag birthed multiple different hashtags in connection to #MeToo to encourage more women to share their stories, resulting in further spread of the phenomenon of hashtag activism. The use of hashtags, especially, in this case, allowed for better and easier access to search for content related to this social media movement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lindgren |first=Simon |date=2019-07-29 |title=Movement Mobilization in the Age of Hashtag Activism: Examining the Challenge of Noise, Hate, and Disengagement in the #MeToo Campaign |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.212 |journal=[[Policy & Internet]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=418–438 |doi=10.1002/poi3.212 |issn=1944-2866 |s2cid=201423139}}</ref>

==== Sentiment analysis ====
The use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest [[Prediction|predictor]] of whether or not a statement is [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|title=Who cares about sarcastic tweets?

In education, research on language teachers who engaged in the #MFLtwitterati hashtag demonstrates the uses of hashtags for creating community and sharing teaching resources. The majority of participants reported positive impact on their teaching strategies as inspired by many ideas shared by different individuals in the Hashtag. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosell-Aguilar|first=Fernando|date=2018|title=Twitter: A Professional Development and Community of Practice Tool for Teachers|url=https://oro.open.ac.uk/54356/9/452-3655-1-PB.pdf|journal=Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume=6}}</ref>

Emerging research in communication and learning demonstrates how hashtag practices influence the teaching and development of students. An analysis of eight studies examined the use of hashtags in K–12 classrooms and found significant results. These results indicated that hashtags assisted students in voicing their opinions. In addition, hashtags also helped students understand self-organisation and the concept of space beyond place. {{clarify|date=April 2021}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellen|first=Watson|date=2020|title=Education: The Potential Impact of Social Media and Hashtag Ideology on the Classroom.

In 2014 [[Bird's Eye]] foods released "Mashtags", a [[mashed potato]] product with pieces shaped either like 
{{char|@}} or {{char|#}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Birds Eye launches Mashtags – social media potato shapes|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fmcg/birds-eye-launches-mashtags-potato-shapes/354514.article|work=The Grocer}}</ref>

== Linguistic analysis ==
Linguists argue that hashtagging is a morphological process and that hashtags function as [[Word|words]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Calude |first=Andreea S. |last2=Long |first2=Maebh |last3=Burnette |first3=Jessie |date=2024-06-07 |title=#AreHashtagsWords? Structure, position, and syntactic integration of hashtags in (English) tweets |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0044/html |journal=[[Linguistics Vanguard]] |language=en |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2023-0044 |issn=2199-174X}}</ref> 

The popularity of a hashtag is influenced less by its conciseness and clarity, and more by the presence of preexisting popular hashtags with similar syntactic formats. This suggests that, similar to [[word formation]], users may see the syntax of an existing viral hashtag as a blueprint for creating new ones. For instance, the viral hashtag [[Je suis Charlie|#JeSuisCharlie]] gave rise to other popular indicative mood hashtags like #JeVoteMacron and #JeChoisisMarine.<ref name=":1" />
