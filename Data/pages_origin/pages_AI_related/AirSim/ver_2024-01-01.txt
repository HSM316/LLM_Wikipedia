'''AirSim''' ('''A'''erial '''I'''nformatics and '''R'''obotics '''Sim'''ulation) is an [[open-source]], cross platform simulator for drones, ground vehicles such as cars and various other objects, built on [[Epic Games]]’ proprietary [[Unreal Engine 4]] as a platform for [[AI]] research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/microsoft-ai-simulator-includes-autonomous-car-research/article/508552|title=Microsoft AI simulator includes autonomous car research|date=November 26, 2017|website=www.digitaljournal.com}}</ref> It is developed by [[Microsoft]] and can be used to experiment with [[deep learning]], [[computer vision]] and [[reinforcement learning]] algorithms for [[autonomous vehicle]]s.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/README.md | title=Open source simulator for autonomous vehicles built on Unreal Engine / Unity, from Microsoft AI & Research: Microsoft/AirSim| website=[[GitHub]]| date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/airsim/|title=Microsoft AirSim, a Simulator for Drones and Robots|website=InfoQ}}</ref> This allows testing of autonomous solutions without worrying about real-world damage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62202118|title=Microsoft launches simulator to train drone AI systems|author-first=Chris|author-last=Vallance|work=BBC News |date=18 July 2022 |access-date=20 July 2022}}</ref>

AirSim provides some 12 kilometers of roads with 20 city blocks and [[application programming interface|API]]s to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way. The APIs are accessible via a variety of programming languages, including [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. AirSim supports [[hardware-in-the-loop]] with [[Racing wheel|driving wheels]] and [[Joystick|flight controllers]] such as PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. The platform also supports common robotic platforms, such as [[Robot Operating System]] (ROS).<ref>{{cite web |title=Aerial Informatics and Robotics Platform |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/aerial-informatics-robotics-platform/ |website=Microsoft Research}}</ref> It is developed as an Unreal [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] that can be dropped into any Unreal environment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aerial Autonomy: Project AirSim |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/autonomous-systems-project-airsim |website=Microsoft AI |language=en-us}}</ref> An experimental release for a [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] plug-in is also available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/11/14/airsim-on-unity-experiment-with-autonomous-vehicle-simulation/|title=AirSim on Unity: Experiment with autonomous vehicle simulation|date=November 14, 2018|website=blogs.unity3d.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/14/microsofts-open-source-airsim-platform-comes-to-unity/|title=Microsoft's open source AirSim platform comes to Unity|date=November 14, 2018|website=VentureBeat}}</ref>
