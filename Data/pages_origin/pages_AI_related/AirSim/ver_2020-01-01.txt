'''AirSim''' ('''A'''erial '''I'''nformatics and '''R'''obotics '''Sim'''ulation) is an [[open-source]], cross platform simulator for drones, ground vehicles such as cars and various other objects, built on [[Epic Games]]’ [[Unreal Engine 4]] as a platform for [[AI]] research.<ref>[http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/technology/microsoft-ai-simulator-includes-autonomous-car-research/article/508552 Microsoft AI simulator includes autonomous car research]</ref> It is developed by [[Microsoft]] and can be used to experiment with [[deep learning]], [[computer vision]] and [[reinforcement learning]] algorithms for [[autonomous vehicle]]s.<ref>https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/README.md</ref><ref>[https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/02/airsim/ Microsoft AirSim, a Simulator for Drones and Robots]</ref> This allows testing of autonomous solutions without worrying about real-world damage.

AirSim provides some 12 kilometers of roads with 20 city blocks and [[application programming interface|API]]s to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way. The APIs are accessible via a variety of programming languages, including [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. AirSim supports [[hardware-in-the-loop]] with [[Racing wheel|driving wheels]] and [[Joystick|flight controllers]] such as PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. The platform also supports common robotic platforms, such as [[Robot Operating System]] (ROS). It is developed as an Unreal [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] that can be dropped into any Unreal environment. An experimental release for a [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] plug-in is also available.<ref>[https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/11/14/airsim-on-unity-experiment-with-autonomous-vehicle-simulation/ AirSim on Unity: Experiment with autonomous vehicle simulation – Unity Blog]</ref><ref>[https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/14/microsofts-open-source-airsim-platform-comes-to-unity/ Microsoft's open source AirSim platform comes to Unity | VentureBeat]</ref>
