'''Argument mining''', or '''argumentation mining''', is a research area within the [[natural-language processing]] field. The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from [[natural language]] text with the aid of computer programs.<ref name=lippi2016/> Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse.<ref name=IJCAI_tutorial/><ref name=ACL_tutorial/> The Argument Mining workshop series is the main research forum for argument mining related research.<ref name=argmining2018/>

== Applications ==
Argument mining has been applied in many different genres including the qualitative assessment of [[social media]] content (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), where it provides a powerful tool for policy-makers and researchers in social and political sciences.<ref name=lippi2016/> Other domains include legal documents, product reviews, scientific articles, online debates, newspaper articles and dialogical domains.

== Challenges ==
Given the wide variety of text genres and the different research perspectives and approaches, it has been difficult to reach a common and objective evaluation scheme.<ref name=unshared_task/> Many annotated data sets have been proposed, with some gaining popularity, but a consensual data set is yet to be found. 
Annotating argumentative structures is a highly demanding task. There have been successful attempts to delegate such annotation tasks to the crowd but the process still requires a lot of effort and carries significant cost. Initial attempts to bypass this hurdle were made using the weak supervision approach.<ref name=levy2017/>
