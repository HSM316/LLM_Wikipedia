{{Machine learning|Problems}}
'''Feature engineering''' is the process of using [[domain knowledge]] to extract [[Feature (machine learning)|features]] (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw [[data]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Machine Learning and AI via Brain simulations | url =https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/slides/DeepLearning-Mar2013.pptx  | website =Stanford University | access-date =2019-08-01 }}</ref>  The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a [[machine learning]] process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.

== Process  ==
The feature engineering process is:<ref>{{cite web|title=Big Data: Week 3 Video 3 - Feature Engineering|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUToKxEAUA|website=youtube.com}}</ref>

=== Typical engineered features ===
The following list<ref>{{Cite web|title=Creating Features|url=https://kaggle.com/ryanholbrook/creating-features|access-date=2021-09-30|website=kaggle.com|language=en}}</ref> provides some typical ways to engineer useful features
* Numerical transformations (like taking fractions or scaling)
* Category encoder like one-hot or target encoder (for [[Categorical variable|categorical data]])<ref>{{Cite web|title=Category Encoders — Category Encoders 2.2.2 documentation|url=https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/index.html|access-date=2021-10-01|website=contrib.scikit-learn.org}}</ref>
* Clustering 
* Group aggregated values
* Principal component analysis (for numerical data)

== Relevance ==
Features vary in significance.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring10/cos424/slides/18-feat.pdf|title = Feature Engineering|date = 2010-04-22|access-date = 12 November 2015}}</ref> Even relatively insignificant features may contribute to a model. [[Feature selection]] can reduce the number of features to prevent a model from becoming too specific to the training data set (overfitting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/294-fall09/lectures/feature/slides.pdf|title=Feature engineering and selection|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=Alexandre Bouchard-Côté|access-date=12 November 2015}}</ref>

== Explosion ==
Feature explosion occurs when the number of identified features grows inappropriately. Common causes include:

* Feature templates - implementing feature templates instead of coding new features
* Feature combinations - combinations that cannot be represented by a linear system

Feature explosion can be limited via techniques such as: [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]], [[kernel method]]s, and [[feature selection]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~zabokrtsky/courses/npfl104/html/feature_engineering.pdf|title = Feature engineering in Machine Learning|access-date = 12 November 2015|publisher = Zdenek Zabokrtsky|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112056/https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~zabokrtsky/courses/npfl104/html/feature_engineering.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>

== Automation ==
Automation of feature engineering is a research topic that dates back to the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book| chapter-url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-48247-5_46.pdf | chapter = Multi-relational Decision Tree Induction| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-48247-5_46| title = Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery| volume = 1704| pages = 378–383| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 1999| last1 = Knobbe| first1 = Arno J.| last2 = Siebes| first2 = Arno| last3 = Van Der Wallen| first3 = Daniël| isbn = 978-3-540-66490-1}}</ref> Machine learning software that incorporates automated feature engineering has been commercially available since 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|website=Reality AI Blog|title=Its all about the features|date=September 2017|url=https://reality.ai/it-is-all-about-the-features/}}</ref> Related academic literature can be roughly separated into two types:

* Multi-relational decision tree learning (MRDTL) uses a supervised algorithm that is similar to a [[decision tree]]. 
* Deep Feature Synthesis uses simpler methods.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

=== Multi-relational decision tree learning (MRDTL) ===
MRDTL generates features in the form of SQL queries by successively adding clauses to the queries.<ref>{{Cite journal| title = A Comparative Study Of Multi-Relational Decision Tree Learning Algorithm |citeseerx = 10.1.1.636.2932}}</ref> For instance, the algorithm might start out with

<syntaxhighlight lang="sql">
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ATOM t1 LEFT JOIN MOLECULE t2 ON t1.mol_id = t2.mol_id GROUP BY t1.mol_id
</syntaxhighlight>

The query can then successively be refined by adding conditions, such as "WHERE t1.charge <= -0.392".<ref>{{Cite document |first1=Hector |last1=Leiva |first2=Anna |last2=Atramentov |first3=Vasant |last3=Honavar | url = http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/Papers/kddmrdmpaperfinal.pdf | title = Experiments with MRDTL – A Multi-relational Decision Tree Learning Algorithm |date=2002 }}</ref>

However, most  MRDTL studies base implementations on relational databases, which results in many redundant operations. These redundancies can be reduced by using tricks such as tuple id propagation.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Xiaoxin |last1=Yin |first2=Jiawei |last2=Han |first3=Jiong |last3=Yang |first4=Philip S. |last4=Yu |title=Proceedings. 20th International Conference on Data Engineering |chapter = CrossMine: Efficient Classification Across Multiple Database Relations |journal=Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering |year=2004 |pages=399–410 |doi=10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320014 |isbn=0-7695-2065-0 |s2cid=1183403 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| chapter = A Method for Multi-relational Classification Using Single and Multi-feature Aggregation Functions | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-74976-9_43 | title = Knowledge Discovery in Databases: PKDD 2007 | volume = 4702 | pages = 430–437 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year = 2007 | last1 = Frank | first1 = Richard | last2 = Moser | first2 = Flavia | last3 = Ester | first3 = Martin | isbn = 978-3-540-74975-2 }}</ref> Efficiency can be increased by using incremental updates, which eliminates redundancies.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://get.ml/resources/how-getml-works | title = How automated feature engineering works - The most efficient feature engineering solution for relational data and time series | access-date=2019-11-21 }}</ref>{{Promotional source|date=January 2020}}

== Feature stores ==
{{Advert|section|a disguised advert; Feast is maintained by former Uber engineers that where working on Michelangelo; they are effectively advertising themselves|date=June 2021}}
A feature store includes the ability to store code used to generate features, apply the code to raw data, and serve those features to models upon request. Useful capabilities include feature versioning and policies governing the circumstances under which features can be used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phaseai.com/resources/intro-to-feature-stores|title=An Introduction to Feature Stores|access-date=2021-04-15}}</ref>

Feature stores can be standalone software tools or built into machine learning platforms. For example, ''Feast''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://feast.dev/|title=Feast: Feature Store for Machine Learning|access-date=2021-04-15}}</ref> is an open source feature store, while platforms like Uber's Michelangelo use feature stores as a component.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/|title=Meet Michelangelo: Uber's Machine Learning Platform|date=5 September 2017|access-date=2021-04-15}}</ref>
