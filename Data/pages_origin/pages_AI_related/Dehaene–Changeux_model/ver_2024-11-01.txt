{{Short description|Theory of consciousness}}

The '''Dehaene–Changeux model''' ('''DCM'''), also known as the '''global neuronal workspace''', or '''global cognitive workspace model''', is a part of [[Bernard Baars]]'s [[Global workspace theory|global workspace model]] for consciousness.

It is a [[computer model]] of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] programmed as a [[neural network]]. It attempts to reproduce the [[swarm behaviour]] {{clarify|date=November 2011}} of the [[brain]]'s ''higher cognitive functions'' such as [[consciousness]], [[decision-making]]<ref>Dehaene S, Changeux JP. "Reward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making". ''Prog Brain Res''. 2000;126:217-29.</ref> and the central [[executive functions]]. It was developed by cognitive neuroscientists [[Stanislas Dehaene]] and [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] beginning in 1986.<ref>Dehaene S, Changeux JP. "Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing". ''Neuron''. 2011 Apr 28;70(2):200-27.</ref> It has been used to provide a predictive framework to the study of [[inattentional blindness]] and the solving of the [[Tower of London test]].<ref>Changeux JP, Dehaene S. "Hierarchical neuronal modeling of cognitive functions: from synaptic transmission to the Tower of London".

''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A''. 1987 May;84(9):2727-31.</ref>

==History==
The Dehaene–Changeux model was initially established as a [[spin glass]] neural network attempting to represent [[learning]] and to then provide a stepping stone towards [[machine learning|artificial learning]] among other objectives. It would later be used to predict observable reaction times within the [[Priming (psychology)|priming paradigm]]<ref>Epub 2010 Jan 25. Van den Bussche E, Hughes G, Humbeeck NV, Reynvoet B "The relation between consciousness and attention: an empirical study using the priming paradigm". ''Conscious Cogn''. 2010 Mar;19(1):86–97.</ref> and in inattentional blindness.

==Structure==

===General structure===
The Dehaene–Changeux model is a meta neural network (i.e. a network of neural networks) composed of a very large number of [[integrate-and-fire]] [[neuron]]s programmed in either a [[stochastic]] or deterministic way. The neurons are organised in complex [[Thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits|thalamo-cortical columns]] with long-range connexions and a critical role {{clarify|date=November 2011}} played by the interaction between [[Constantin von Economo|von Economo's areas]]. Each thalamo-cortical column is composed of [[pyramidal cell]]s and [[Interneuron|inhibitory interneurons]] receiving a long-distance excitatory [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] which could represent [[noradrenergic]] input.

===A swarm and a multi-agent system composed of neural networks===
{{Synthesis|section|date=November 2011}}
Among others Cohen & [[Donna Hudson|Hudson]] (2002) had already used "meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis".<ref>Cohen, M.E.; [[Donna Hudson|Hudson, D.L.]]. "Meta neural networks as intelligent agents for diagnosis". Neural Networks, 2002. IJCNN '02. Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference, 233–238.</ref> Similarly to Cohen & Hudson, Dehaene & Changeux have established their model as an interaction of meta-neural networks (thalamocortical columns) themselves programmed in the manner of a "hierarchy of neural networks that together act as an intelligent agent", in order to use them as a system composed of a large scale of inter-connected intelligent agents for predicting the self-organized behaviour of the neural correlates of consciousness. Jain et al. (2002) had already clearly identified [[spiking neuron]]s as intelligent agents<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Jain |editor1-first=Lakhmi C. |editor2-last=Chen |editor2-first=Zhengxin |editor3-last=Ichalkaranje |editor3-first=Nikhil |date=2002 |title=Intelligent agents and their applications |series=Studies in fuzziness and soft computing |volume=98 |location=Heidelberg; New York |publisher=Physica-Verlag |isbn=3790814695 |oclc=49285672 |doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-1786-7}}</ref> since the lower bound for computational power of networks of [[Artificial neuron|spiking neurons]] is the capacity to simulate in real-time for boolean-valued inputs any [[Turing machine]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maass |first=Wolfgang |date=January 1996 |title=Lower bounds for the computational power of networks of spiking neurons |journal=Neural Computation |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–40 |doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.1.1 |citeseerx=10.1.1.55.933}}</ref> The DCM being composed of a very large number of interacting sub-networks which are themselves intelligent agents, it is formally a [[multi-agent system]] programmed as a [[swarm]] or neural networks and ''a fortiori'' of spiking neurons.

==Behavior==
The DCM exhibits several surcritical {{clarify|date=November 2011}} [[Emergence|emergent behaviors]] such as [[multistability]] and a [[Hopf bifurcation]] between two very different regimes which may represent either [[sleep]] or [[arousal]] with a various [[all-or-none]] behaviors which Dehaene et al. use to determine a testable taxonomy between different states of consciousness.<ref>Dehaene S, Changeux JP, Naccache L, Sackur J, Sergent C.

==Scholarly reception==

===Self-organized criticality===
The Dehaene–Changeux model contributed to the study of [[nonlinearity]] and [[self-organized criticality]] in particular as an explanatory model of the brain's emergent behaviors, including consciousness. Studying the brain's phase-locking and large-scale synchronization, Kitzbichler et al. (2011a) confirmed that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.<ref>Kitzbichler MG, Smith ML, Christensen SR, Bullmore E. "Broadband criticality of human brain network synchronization". ''PLoS Comput. Biol''. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000314. Epub 2009 Mar 20. {{open access}}</ref>

Furthermore, exploring the neural dynamics of cognitive efforts after, ''inter alia'', the Dehaene–Changeux model, Kitzbichler et al. (2011b) demonstrated how cognitive effort breaks the [[modularity of mind]] to make human brain functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration.<ref>Kitzbichler MG, Henson RN, Smith ML, Nathan PJ, Bullmore ET. "Cognitive effort drives workspace configuration of human brain functional networks". ''J Neurosci''. 2011 Jun 1;31(22):8259-70.</ref> Werner (2007a) used the Dehaene–Changeux global neuronal workspace to defend the use of statistical physics approaches for exploring phase transitions, scaling and universality properties of the so-called "Dynamic Core" of the brain, with relevance to the macroscopic electrical activity in [[EEG]] and [[Electromyography|EMG]].<ref>Werner G. [http://cogprints.org/5275/1/BrainDynamics.pdf "Brain dynamics across levels of organization"]. ''J Physiol Paris''. 2007 Jul–Nov;101(4–6):273-9. Epub 2008 Jan 8.</ref> Furthermore, building from the Dehaene–Changeux model, Werner (2007b) proposed that the application of the twin concepts of scaling and universality of the theory of non-equilibrium phase transitions can serve as an informative approach for elucidating the nature of underlying neural-mechanisms, with emphasis on the dynamics of recursively [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|reentrant]] activity flow in intracortical and cortico-subcortical neuronal loops. [[Karl Friston|Friston]] (2000) also claimed that "the nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays a role in functional integration that may be as important as synchronous interactions".<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=1692735 | pmid=10724457 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0560 | volume=355 |issue = 1394| title=The labile brain.

===States of consciousness and phenomenology===
It contributed to the study of phase transition in the brain under sedation, and notably GABA-ergic sedation such as that induced by propofol (Murphy et al. 2011, Stamatakis et al. 2010).<ref>Murphy M, Bruno MA, Riedner BA, Boveroux P, Noirhomme Q, Landsness EC, Brichant JF, Phillips C, Massimini M, Laureys S, Tononi G, Boly M.

''PLoS One''. 2010 Dec 2;5(12):e14224. {{open access}}</ref> The Dehaene–Changeux model was contrasted and cited in the study of [[collective consciousness]] and its pathologies (Wallace et al. 2007).<ref>Wallace RM, Fullilove MT, Fullilove RE, Wallace DN.

(2007) used the model for a reverse somatotopic study, demonstrating a correlation between baseline brain activity and somatosensory perception in humans.<ref>Boly M, Balteau E, Schnakers C, Degueldre C, Moonen G, Luxen A, Phillips C, Peigneux P, Maquet P, Laureys S.

(2008) also used the DCM in a study of the baseline state of consciousness of the human brain's [[default network]].<ref>Boly M, Phillips C, Tshibanda L, Vanhaudenhuyse A, Schabus M, Dang-Vu TT, Moonen G, Hustinx R, Maquet P, Laureys S.
