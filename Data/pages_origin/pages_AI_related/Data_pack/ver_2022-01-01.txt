A '''data pack''' (or fact pack) is a pre-made [[database]] that can be fed to a software, such as [[software agent]]s, [[game]], [[Internet bot]]s or [[chatterbot]]s, to teach information and facts, which it can later look up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/datapacks|title=Datapacks|website=Census|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> In other words, a data pack can be used to feed minor updates into a [[system]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = What is data package? definition and meaning|url = http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-package.html|website = BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>

== Introduction ==
Common data packs may include [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[lexicon]]s and technical data, such as [[country code]]s, [[List of RFCs|RFCs]], [[List of file formats|filename extensions]], [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|TCP and UDP port numbers]], [[List of country calling codes|country calling codes]], and so on.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Data packs may come in formats of [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] and [[SQL]] that can easily be parsed or imported into a [[database management system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Comma Separated Values (CSV) Standard File Format|url=http://edoceo.com/utilitas/csv-file-format|publisher=edoceo|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>

The database may consist of a key-value pair, like an [[association list]].

Data packs are commonly used within the [[video game industry]] to provide minor updates within their games. When a user [[download]]s an update for a game they will be downloading loads of data packs which will contain updates for the game such as minor bug fixes or additional content.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Konami is sorry for PES 2016 Data Pack missing transfers - PES 2016 for PS4 News|url = http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/pes_2016/news/konami_is_sorry_for_pes_2016_data_pack_missing_transfers.html|website = VideoGamer.Com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref> An example of a data pack used to update a game can be found on the references.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title = PES 2016 Data Pack 1.00 Version 1.02.00|url = http://www.pes-patch.com/2015/10/pes-2016-data-pack-1-00-version-1-02-00.html|website = PES Patch|date = 29 October 2015|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>

== Mobile data packs ==
When you refer to the word data pack it can come in many forms such as a mobile data pack. A mobile data pack refers to an add-on which can enable you to boost the amount of data which you can use on your mobile phone. The rate at which you use your data can also be monitored, so you know how much data you have left. Mobile data is a service which provides a similar service to [[Wi-Fi]] and allows you to connect to the [[Internet]]. So the purpose of a data pack is to increase the amount of data that your mobile has access to.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title = Data Pack Add-On FAQs {{!}} Plans & Services FAQs {{!}} Boost Mobile|url = http://www.boostmobile.com/support/faq/plans-services/data-pack-add-on/|website = www.boostmobile.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027082950/https://www.boostmobile.com/support/faq/plans-services/data-pack-add-on/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> An example of a mobile data pack can be found on the references.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|title = About packs|url = http://shop.ee.co.uk/price-plans/pay-as-you-go/about-packs|website = EE|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>
