==Technology==

Bird is a device that is worn on the index finger and allows users to engage and interact with their digital content. The wearable device uses [[motion detection|motion sensing]] technology to turn a TV or projected image into an interactive display â€“ from up close like a touchscreen or remotely.<ref name=ars>{{cite web|publisher=ArsTechnica| url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/10/this-startup-wants-to-bring-a-minority-report-style-interface-to-your-living-room/| title=This startup want to bring a Minority Report-style interface to your living room| author=Cyrus Farivar| date=October 12, 2015| accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=chip/> Up to five Bird devices can be used on the same surface.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Etcentric| url=http://www.etcentric.org/israeli-startup-debuts-index-finger-device-to-replace-mouse/| title=Israeli Startup Debuts Index-Finger Device to Replace Mouse| author=Debra Kaufman| date=October 14, 2015| accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=Fox News| url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/10/16/bird-gadget-lets-control-drone-with-your-finger.html| title='Bird' gadget lets you control a drone with your finger| author=John Brandon| date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref> The device operates through ten different sensors, including [[accelerometer]], [[Motion detection|motion]], and [[proximity sensor]]s.

Bird's various features allow the user to interact with the display in diverse ways. Remote touch is used to control content remotely like a remote mouse from up to 100 feet away. The device's touchpad allows the user to scroll up, down, left, and right. Bird's gesture control allows a user to control content using large hand gestures to make presentations more engaging.  The touch feature turns any surface into a touchscreen. Bird can also be used as a smart controller for smart appliances including smart light bulbs and thermostats and as a control for drones using gestures.<ref name=wired>{{cite web| publisher=Wired| url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-10/13/bird-gesture-based-tech| title=Meed BIRD, a gesture controller for your entire home| author=Becca Caddy| date=October 13, 2015| accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=journal/>
