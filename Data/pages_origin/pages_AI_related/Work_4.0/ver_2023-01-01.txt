== Conceptual Framework==

Conceptually, Work 4.0 reflects the current fourth phase of work relations, having been preceded by the birth of industrial society and the first workers' organizations in the late 18th century (Work 1.0), the beginning of mass production and of the welfare state in the late 19th century (Work 2.0), and the advent of [[globalization]], [[digital transformation|digitalization]] and the transformation of the [[social market economy]] since the 1970s (Work 3.0). By contrast, Work 4.0 is characterized by a high degree of integration and cooperation, the use of digital technologies (e.g. the [[internet]]), and a rise in flexible work arrangements.<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: Green Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 33-5.</ref> Its drivers include [[digital transformation|digitalization]], [[globalization]], [[demographic change]] (ageing, [[Human migration|migration]]), and cultural change.<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 18-41.</ref> Challenges include 
* (i) the transformation of economic sectors and activities and its effect on employment,
* (ii) the creation of new markets and new forms of work through digital platforms,
* (iii) the issues associated with [[Big Data]] (e.g. data protection),
* (iv) the relationship between the use of human and machine labour (upskilling vs. deskilling, devaluation of experience, individual support vs. behavioural monitoring),
* (v) the possibility of flexible work conditions regarding time and location, and 
* (vi) profound changes in the structures of organizations.<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 42-91.</ref> 

In response to these challenges, the BMAS has developed a "vision for quality jobs in the digital age", based on policies such as moving from [[unemployment insurance|unemployment]] to [[employment insurance]], the promotion of self-determined flexible working time arrangements, improvements in the working conditions of the service sector, new ergonomic approaches to [[occupational health and safety]], high standards in employee [[data protection]], the co-determination and participation of social partners in employment relations, better social protection for self-employed persons, and the beginning of a European dialogue on the future of the welfare state.<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 98-187.</ref>

==[[World Bank]] Analysis==
The [[World Development Report]] 2019 argues that a new social contract is needed to address longer work transitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref> Authors [[Simeon Djankov]] and Federica Saliola documents examples of countries and companies that have created new ways to deliver social insurance.

== [[World Economic Forum]] debate ==
Work 4.0 has also emerged as a core topic of discussion for the WEF during its annual meetings in [[Davos]]. Referring to this phenomenon as the [[Fourth Industrial Revolution]], it integrates concepts from [[Synthetic biology]], [[Artificial intelligence]], and [[Additive Manufacturing]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Fourth Industrial Revolution, by Klaus Schwab|url=https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab/|access-date=2020-07-27|website=World Economic Forum|language=en}}</ref> However, some speculate that this push to automate is less a technological edict and more a hidden agenda by corporations to replace laborers with [[Industrial automation]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Roose|first=Kevin|date=2019-01-25|title=The Hidden Automation Agenda of the Davos Elite|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/automation-davos-world-economic-forum.html|access-date=2020-07-27|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Min|first=Jeehee|last2=Kim|first2=Yangwoo|last3=Lee|first3=Sujin|last4=Jang|first4=Tae-Won|last5=Kim|first5=Inah|last6=Song|first6=Jaechul|date=2019-12-01|title=The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Its Impact on Occupational Health and Safety, Worker's Compensation and Labor Conditions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2093791119304056|journal=Safety and Health at Work|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=400–408|doi=10.1016/j.shaw.2019.09.005|issn=2093-7911|doi-access=free}}</ref>
