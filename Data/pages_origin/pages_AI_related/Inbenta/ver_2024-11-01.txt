We were unaware of this, and would have advised against doing so had we known, as it presents a point of vulnerability". 

On November 13, 2020, the Information Commissioner's Office fined Ticketmaster UK Limited £1.25 million for failing to protect customers' payment details. According to the ICO, "It was because of Ticketmaster's business decision to include the [Inbenta] chat bot on its payment page that the chat bot was able to unlawfully process the personal data of customers."<ref>https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2618609/ticketmaster-uk-limited-mpn.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>
