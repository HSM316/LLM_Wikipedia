{{About||the documentary film about the Google DeepMind Challenge Match with Lee Sedol|AlphaGo (film)}}

'''AlphaGo''' is a [[computer program]] that plays the [[board game]] [[Go (game)|Go]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35785875|title=Artificial intelligence: Google's AlphaGo beats Go master Lee Se-dol|work=BBC News|date=12 March 2016|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref> It was developed by [[DeepMind]] Technologies<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far |title=DeepMind AlphaGO|work=DeepMind Artificial Intelligence AlphaGo }}</ref> a subsidiary of [[Google]] (now [[Alphabet Inc.]]). Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name [[AlphaGo Master|Master]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AlphaGo {{!}} DeepMind |url=https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/ |website=DeepMind}}</ref> After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as [[AlphaGo Zero]], which was completely self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as [[AlphaZero]], which played additional games, including [[chess]] and [[shogi]].  AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as [[MuZero]] which learns without being taught the rules.

AlphaGo and its successors use a [[Monte Carlo tree search]] algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously acquired by [[machine learning]], specifically by an [[artificial neural network]] (a [[deep learning]] method) by extensive training, both from human and computer play.<ref name="DeepMindnature2016"/> A neural network is trained to identify the best moves and the winning percentages of these moves. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in stronger move selection in the next iteration.

In October 2015, in a match against [[Fan Hui]], the original AlphaGo became the first [[computer Go]] program to beat a human [[professional Go player]] without [[Go handicaps|handicap]] on a full-sized 19×19 board.<ref name="googlego">{{cite web |url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html|title=Research Blog: AlphaGo: Mastering the ancient game of Go with Machine Learning |date=27 January 2016 |work=Google Research Blog}}</ref><ref name="bbcgo" /> In March 2016, it beat [[Lee Sedol]] in [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|a five-game match]], the first time a computer Go program has beaten a [[Go ranks and ratings|9-dan]] professional without handicap.<ref name="leesedolwin">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFr3K2DORc8&t=1h57m |title=Match 1 – Google DeepMind Challenge Match: Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo |date=8 March 2016}}</ref> Although it lost to Lee Sedol in the fourth game, Lee resigned in the final game, giving a final score of 4 games to 1 in favour of AlphaGo. In recognition of the victory, AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9-dan by the [[Korea Baduk Association]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/googles-alphago-gets-divine-go-ranking|title=Google's AlphaGo gets 'divine' Go ranking|newspaper=The Straits Times|publisher=[[straitstimes.com]]|date=15 March 2016|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref> The lead up and the challenge match with Lee Sedol were documented in a documentary film also titled ''AlphaGo'',<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.alphagomovie.com/|title=AlphaGo Movie|website=AlphaGo Movie}}</ref> directed by Greg Kohs.

At the 2017 [[Future of Go Summit]], the [[AlphaGo Master|Master]] version of AlphaGo beat [[Ke Jie]], the number one ranked player in the world at the time, in a [[AlphaGo versus Ke Jie|three-game match]], after which AlphaGo was awarded professional 9-dan by the [[Chinese Weiqi Association]].<ref name="AlphaGo 9-dan">{{cite web|url=http://sports.sohu.com/20170527/n494734669.shtml|title=中国围棋协会授予AlphaGo职业九段 并颁发证书|language=zh|publisher=[[Sohu.com]]|date=27 May 2017|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

==History==
Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win than other games such as [[chess]], because its much larger [[branching factor]] makes it prohibitively difficult to use traditional AI methods such as [[alpha–beta pruning]], [[tree traversal]] and [[heuristic]] search.<ref name="googlego" /><ref>{{citation|title=Temporal Difference Learning of Position Evaluation in the Game of Go|first1=Nicol N.|last1=Schraudolph|first2=Peter Dayan|last2=Terrence|first3=J.|last3=Sejnowski|url=http://www.variational-bayes.org/~dayan/papers/sds94.pdf}}</ref>

Almost two decades after IBM's computer [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] beat world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]] in the [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|1997 match]], the strongest Go programs using [[artificial intelligence]] techniques only reached about [[Go professional#Pro and amateur dan|amateur 5-dan]] level,<ref name="DeepMindnature2016"/> and still could not beat a professional Go player without a [[Go handicaps|handicap]].<ref name="googlego" /><ref name="bbcgo" /><ref name="CNN0128">{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/01/28/technology/google-computer-program-beats-human-at-go/index.html |title=Computer scores big win against humans in ancient game of Go |publisher=CNN| date=28 January 2016 |access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the software program [[Zen (software)|Zen]], running on a four PC cluster, beat [[Masaki Takemiya]] ([[Go professional|9p]]) twice at five- and four-stone handicaps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gogameguru.com/zen-computer-go-program-beats-takemiya-masaki-4-stones/|title=Zen computer Go program beats Takemiya Masaki with just 4 stones!|work=Go Game Guru|access-date=28 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201162313/https://gogameguru.com/zen-computer-go-program-beats-takemiya-masaki-4-stones/|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2013, [[Crazy Stone (software)|Crazy Stone]] beat [[Yoshio Ishida]] (9p) at a four-stone handicap.<ref>{{cite web|title=「アマ六段の力。天才かも」囲碁棋士、コンピューターに敗れる 初の公式戦 |url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/life/news/130320/igo13032020420000-n1.htm |publisher=MSN Sankei News |access-date=27 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324221549/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/life/news/130320/igo13032020420000-n1.htm |archive-date=24 March 2013 }}</ref>

==Versions==
An early version of AlphaGo was tested on hardware with various numbers of [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, running in asynchronous or distributed mode. Two seconds of thinking time was given to each move. The resulting [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]]s are listed below.<ref name="DeepMindnature2016"/> In the matches with more time per move higher ratings are achieved.

==Algorithm==
As of 2016, AlphaGo's algorithm uses a combination of [[machine learning]] and [[tree search]] techniques, combined with extensive training, both from human and computer play. It uses [[Monte Carlo tree search]], guided by a "value network" and a "policy network," both implemented using [[deep neural network]] technology.<ref name="googlego" /><ref name="DeepMindnature2016" /> A limited amount of game-specific feature detection pre-processing (for example, to highlight whether a move matches a [[List of Go terms#Nakade|nakade]] pattern) is applied to the input before it is sent to the neural networks.<ref name="DeepMindnature2016" /> The networks are [[convolutional neural networks]] with 12 layers, trained by [[reinforcement learning]].<ref>{{cite journal | ref = none

The system's neural networks were initially bootstrapped from human gameplay expertise. AlphaGo was initially trained to mimic human play by attempting to match the moves of expert players from recorded historical games, using a database of around 30 million moves.<ref name=MetzWired2016/> Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency, it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself, using [[reinforcement learning]] to improve its play.<ref name="googlego"/> To avoid "disrespectfully" wasting its opponent's time, the program is specifically programmed to resign if its assessment of win probability falls beneath a certain threshold; for the match against Lee, the resignation threshold was set to 20%.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Cade Metz|title=Go Grandmaster Lee Sedol Grabs Consolation Win Against Google's AI|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/go-grandmaster-lee-sedol-grabs-consolation-win-googles-ai/|access-date=29 March 2016|work=[[Wired News]]|date=13 March 2016}}</ref>
