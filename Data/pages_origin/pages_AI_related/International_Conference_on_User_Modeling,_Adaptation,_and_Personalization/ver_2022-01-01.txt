The '''International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization''' (UMAP) is the oldest international conference for researchers and practitioners working on various kinds of user-adaptive computer systems such as [[Adaptive hypermedia]] systems, [[Recommender system]]s, [[Adaptive website]]s, [[Adaptive learning]], [[Personalized learning]] and [[Intelligent tutoring system]]s and [[Personalized search]] systems. All of these systems adapt to their individual users, or to groups of users (i.e., [[Personalization]]). 
To achieve this goal, they collect and represent information about users or groups (i.e., [[User modeling]]).

The UMAP conferences have historically been organized under the auspices of User Modeling Inc.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.um.org/|title=User Modeling Inc}}</ref> a professional organization of User Modeling researchers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.um.org/|title=User Modeling Inc.|website=www.um.org|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref> Until 2015, the conference proceedings were published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/conference/ah|title=International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization {{!}} SpringerLink|website=link.springer.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-09}}</ref> In 2016, the UMAP conference series became affiliated with the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sigchi.org/conferences/conference-history/umap/|title=UMAP|work=ACM SIGCHI|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}</ref> where it is supported by [[ACM SIGWEB]] and [[ACM SIGCHI]].

UMAP is the successor of the biennial conference series on [[User modeling|User Modeling]] and [[Adaptive hypermedia|Adaptive Hypermedia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/conference/ah|title=Springer Timeline of "International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization"}}</ref> The User Modeling series started in 1986 as the First International Workshop on User Modeling (UM)<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/602|title=First International Workshop on User Modeling|journal=AI Magazine|volume=8|issue=3|pages=71|date=1987-09-15|doi=10.1609/aimag.v8i3.602|last1=Carberry|first1=Sandra|doi-broken-date=31 October 2021}}</ref> at Maria Laach, [[Germany]] and was first officially called a conference at the Fourth International Conference on User Modeling<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Fourth International Conference on User Modeling|journal=AI Magazine|volume=17|issue=1|pages=96|date=1996-03-15|doi=10.1609/aimag.v17i1.1219|last1=Litman|first1=Diane|last2=Kobsa|first2=Alfred|last3=Goodman|first3=Brad}}</ref> in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]].

For several years between 2000 and 2008, UM and AH ran biennially in alternate years. In 2009, the conference series merged into a single annual series under the UMAP designation. The first UMAP conference was in 2009.<ref>{{Cite book|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|volume=5535|last=UMAP 2009|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=978-3-642-02246-3|location=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-02247-0|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02247-0|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|s2cid=29765322|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4736889}}</ref>
