'''Matroid''' is a [[Computer vision|Computer Vision]] company that gives typical computer users the ability to scan video. Matroid was founded in 2016 in Palo Alto, California.

== Product ==
The Matroid Product is a studio for creating and using detectors that scan video for faces, actions, places, and other objects. Example applications include determining when former President Barack Obama appears on TV or how often a man holding a gun is recorded in security footage. Users can create custom detectors to find specific people or objects, or they can pick from a library of pre-programmed detectors designed by other users of the platform.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-25/this-ai-company-can-tell-you-what-and-who-appears-in-your-videos|title=This AI Company Can Tell You What and Who Appears in Your Videos|date=2017-03-25|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-lifes-ambition-matroid-launches-1490614201|title=A Life’s Ambition, Matroid Launches|last=Martin|first=Scott|date=2017-03-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-13|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/25/matroid-can-watch-videos-and-detect-anything-within-them/|title=Matroid can watch videos and detect anything within them|last=Mannes|first=John|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3069264/congress-fbi-face-recognition-real-time-street-lineup|title=The Vast, Secretive Face Database That Could Instantly ID You In A Crowd|date=2017-03-30|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-04-23|language=en-US}}</ref>

Matroid is initially focused on analyzing television appearances and scanning surveillance video. In the first case, a firm may want to track which political candidates got more TV time or which brand of car appears more often on a particular show or television network.

Product features include a video player with computer at its core, a tight feedback loop for detector iteration, an extensive API, stream monitoring, and work-sharing amongst users in a library of public detectors.
