The '''International Conference on Machine Learning''' ('''ICML''') is the leading international [[academic conference]] in [[machine learning]]. Along with [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NeurIPS]] and [[International Conference on Learning Representations|ICLR]], it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] research.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-07|title=Artificial Intelligence - Google Scholar Metrics|url=https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence|access-date=2020-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007212857/https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence|archive-date=2020-10-07}}</ref> It is supported by the [http://www.machinelearning.org/ International Machine Learning Society] ([[International Machine Learning Society|IMLS]]). Precise dates vary from year to year, but paper submissions are generally due at the end of January, and the conference is generally held during the following July. The first ICML was held 1980 in [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~icml2009/past.html</ref>
