The '''International Conference on Machine Learning''' (ICML) is an international [[academic conference]] on [[machine learning]]. Along with the [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems]], it is one of the two primary conferences of high impact in machine learning and [[artificial intelligence]] research. It is supported by the [[International Machine Learning Society]].

==History==
The first ICML was held 1980 in [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~icml2009/past.html</ref> The conference completed its 25th anniversary in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi/index.shtml|title=icml2008@helsinki.fi -- ICML 2008, the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning|website=icml2008.cs.helsinki.fi}}</ref>
