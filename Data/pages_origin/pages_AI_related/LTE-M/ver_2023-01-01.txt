'''LTE-M''' or '''LTE-MTC''' ("[[Long-Term Evolution]] Machine Type Communication"), is a type of [[low-power wide-area network]] [[radio communication]] technology standard developed by [[3GPP]] for [[machine-to-machine]] and [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/solutions/test-and-measurement/wireless-communication/iot-m2m/lte-m/lte-m-theme_234034.html|title=LTE-M – the new GSM}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://halberdbastion.com/technology/iot/iot-protocols/emtc-lte-cat-m1|title=eMTC (LTE Cat-M1)}}</ref> LTE-M includes '''eMTC''' ("enhanced Machine Type Communication"), also known as '''LTE Cat-M1''', whose specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 ([[LTE Advanced Pro]]), in June 2016.<ref name="3GPP">{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1805-iot_r14|title=Standards for the IoT}}</ref> 

Competing 3GPP IoT technologies include [[NB-IoT]] and [[EC-GSM-IoT]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/extended-coverage-gsm-internet-of-things-ec-gsm-iot |title=Extended Coverage - GSM - Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT) |date=May 11, 2016 |website=gsma.com |publisher=[[GSMA]] |pages=1 |access-date=October 17, 2016 }}</ref> 
The advantage of LTE-M over NB-IoT is its comparatively higher data rate, mobility, and [[Voice over LTE|voice over the network]], but it requires more bandwidth, is more costly, and cannot be put into [[guard band]] portion of the [[frequency band]] for now.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://accent-systems.com/blog/differences-nb-iot-lte-m/|title=Differences between NB-IOT and LTE-M}}</ref>  Compared to LTE Release 12 Cat-0 modem, an LTE-M model is claimed to be 80% less expensive (in terms of the bill of materials), support up to 18 dB better coverage, and a battery lifetime that can last up to several years.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842206|chapter=Reducing the Modem Complexity and Achieving Deep Coverage in LTE for Machine-Type Communications|title=2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)|year=2016|last1=Saxena|first1=Vidit|last2=Bergman|first2=Johan|last3=Blankenship|first3=Yufei|last4=Wallen|first4=Anders|last5=Razaghi|first5=Hazhir Shokri|pages=1–7|isbn=978-1-5090-1328-9|s2cid=5206557}}</ref> In March 2019, the [[Global Mobile Suppliers Association]] reported that over 100 operators had deployed/launched either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.<ref name="GSA">{{cite web|website=GSA|url=https://gsacom.com/paper/global-narrowband-iot-lte-m-networks-march-2019/|title=Global Narrowband IoT – LTE-M networks|date=March 2019|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref>
