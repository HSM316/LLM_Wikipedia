'''Turi''' is a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]]-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in [[C++]]. The GraphLab project was started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. It is an open source project using an Apache License. While GraphLab was originally developed for [[Machine Learning]] tasks, it has found great success at a broad range of other data-mining tasks; out-performing other abstractions by orders of magnitude.<ref>Joseph Gonzalez, Yucheng Low, Haijie Gu, Danny Bickson, Carlos Guestrin (2012).

== Motivation ==
As the amounts of collected data and computing power grows (multicore, GPUs, clusters,
clouds), modern datasets no longer fit into one computing node. Efficient distributed/parallel
algorithms for handling large scale data are required.  The GraphLab framework is a parallel programming abstraction targeted for sparse [[Iterative algorithm|iterative]]
graph algorithms. GraphLab provides a high level programming interface, allowing a rapid deployment of distributed machine learning algorithms.<ref>Y. Low, J. Gonzalez, A. Kyrola, D. Bickson, C. Guestrin and J. Hellerstein. GraphLab: A New Framework for Parallel Machine Learning. In the 26th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), Catalina Island, USA, 2010</ref> The main design considerations behind the design of GraphLab are:
* Sparse data with local dependencies
* Iterative algorithms
* Potentially asynchronous execution

Main features of GraphLab are:
* A unified multicore and distributed API: write once run efficiently in both shared and distributed memory systems
* Tuned for performance: optimized C++ execution engine leverages extensive multi-threading and asynchronous IO
* Scalable: GraphLab intelligently places data and computation using sophisticated new algorithms
* [[Apache_Hadoop#HDFS|HDFS]] Integration
* Powerful Machine Learning Toolkits

== GraphLab Toolkits ==
On top of GraphLab, several implemented libraries of algorithms:
* [[Topic modeling]] - contains applications like [[Latent Dirichlet allocation|LDA]] which can be used to cluster documents and extract topical representations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.graphlab.org/topic_modeling.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604121019/http://docs.graphlab.org/topic_modeling.html |archive-date=2013-06-04 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>
* Graph analytics - contains application like [[pagerank]] and [[triangle counting]] which can be applied to general [[graph theory|graphs]] to estimate [[community structure]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.graphlab.org/graph_analytics.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218113155/http://docs.graphlab.org/graph_analytics.html |archive-date=2013-02-18 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>
* Clustering - contains standard [[data clustering]] tools such as [[Kmeans]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab/clustering.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221020836/http://www.select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab/clustering.html |archive-date=2016-12-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>
* [[Collaborative filtering]] - contains a collection of applications used to make predictions about users interests and [[matrix factorization|factorize large matrices]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab/pmf.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220221110/http://www.select.cs.cmu.edu/code/graphlab/pmf.html |archive-date=2016-12-20 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>
* [[Graphical model]]s - contains tools for making joint predictions about collections of related random variables.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.graphlab.org/graphical_models.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512053636/http://docs.graphlab.org/graphical_models.html |archive-date=2013-05-12 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>
