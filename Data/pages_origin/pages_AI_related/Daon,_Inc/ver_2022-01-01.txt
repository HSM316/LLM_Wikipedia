'''Daon''' (pronounced day-on) is an international [[biometrics]] and identity assurance software company founded in 1999 by Irish entrepreneur [[Dermot Desmond]]. The name, Daon, was chosen because it stems from the Celtic word for human being, duine daonna.<ref>http://www.irishdictionary.ie/dictionary?language=irish&word=daonna.</ref> Daon is headquartered just miles outside of Washington, DC in Fairfax, VA. Daon also has major operations in [[Dublin]], located in the [[International Financial Services Center]] (IFSC). It has an additional office in Canberra, Australia.

== History ==
In 2006, Daon and the [[American Association of Airport Executives]] (AAAE) entered into a joint venture to create the Security Biometric Clearing Network (SBCN) to provide services for biometric identity management, including enrollment, background checking, secure biometric and biographic information storage, and card issuance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}
