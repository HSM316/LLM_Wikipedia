== Available operating systems ==

=== GoDroid ===
GoDroid is an [[Android KitKat]] 4.4.4.<ref name="hwtrek.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.hwtrek.com/profile/marconi-jiang.4176#biography |title=Marconi Jiang |work=HWTrek |accessdate=18 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152358/https://www.hwtrek.com/profile/marconi-jiang.4176 |archivedate=22 December 2015 }}</ref> based optimized operating system for GoWarrior platform. In addition to original Android functionalities, GoDroid pre-integrates some useful [[middleware]] components and libraries, as well as some self-developed function blocks, which makes it also a [[software development kit]] for [[Android application package|Android applications]].<ref name="prog3.com">{{cite web|url=http://prog3.com/article/2015-11-19/2826270-GoWarrior-interview-jinjiang|title=The "Carpenter" Ali GoWarrior: -PROG3.COM computing hardware and software platform for a comprehensive open source|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>

==== Features ====

===== Booting option =====

GoDroid supports booting from NAND Flash or from MicroSD card that contains the boot code and image files.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeboard.com/evaluation/tigerboard/|title=让你无法抗拒折腾的开源硬件板——TigerBoard评测 - 爱板网|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>

===== Multimedia =====
By replacing Android native media engine [[Stagefright (bug)|StageFright]] with [[GStreamer]] and utilizing [[hardware acceleration]] facilities, GoDroid supports various audio/video/[[Container format (digital)|container]] hardware decoding and multiple [[network protocols]] including [[Microsoft Smooth Streaming Protocol|Microsoft Smooth Streaming]], [[HTTP Live Streaming]] and [[Kodi (software)|KODI]] 14.2 has variety of supported video/audio plug-ins.<ref name="seeedstudio.com"/>

===== Wireless display standards =====
Besides the [[Screen Mirroring|screen mirroring]] function of Android [[Miracast]], GoDroid also implements [[Digital Living Network Alliance|DLNA]] system service for sharing digital media among multimedia devices. DMR, DMS and DMP are supported.<ref name="prog3.com"/>

===== Programming language =====
In addition to [[C/c++|C/C++]]/[[Java (programming language)|Java]], GoDroid also integrates QPython2engine for [[Python (programming language)|Python 2]] programming on Android.<ref name="hwtrek.com"/>

===== Inter-connection with other OSH platform =====
TIGER Board provides 2 sets of 40-pin [[Pin header|expansion headers]], one of which is compatible to Raspberry Pi connector. Raspberry Pi Python applications can be ported and run on GoDroid.<ref name="livejournal.com"/>

===== Integrated development environment =====
GoDroid supports [[Android Studio]] as application [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]. With [[Application programming interface|API]] level 19 configuration to match GoDroid provides the availability of not only original Android API, but also proprietary extended API, such as GPIO/IC2/SPI/PWM.<ref name="raffaeletranquillini"/>

===== Debugging =====
GoDroid supports standard [[Android Debug Bridge|ADB]] debugging via Ethernet, Wi-Fi and USB.<ref name="cnx-software.com"/>

=== GoBian ===
GoBian is a [[Linux Embedded|Linux-embedded]] operating system running on TIGER Board for the GoWarrior platform.

GoBian is developed based on [[Raspbian]] which is from [[Debian]] 7 wheezy armhf, and differs from Raspbian for the extra features, for example, GoBian encapsulates the RPi.gpio and other I/O libraries to facilitate transplanting projects which use the related libraries from Raspberry Pi to TIGER Board. Furthermore, GoBian provides support for multimedia by integrating GOF, [[Kodi (software)|KODI]] and other middle-ware modules and applications out-of-the-box.

==== Features ====

===== Networking & remote access =====
GoBian enables the Internet connection through Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] through the [[Ethernet port]] and Wi-Fi module on TIGER Board, and thus supports various methods to access the projects and transfer data, such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]].

===== Timekeeping =====
GoBian automatically synchronizes the system time with Internet time servers using the [[Ntpd|NTP]] protocol.

===== File system =====
GoBian integrates a built-in file system for data management.

===== Built-in programming environments =====
[[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], and [[shell script]].

===== I/O interfaces =====
GoBian lets you call the GPIO/I2C/UART/SPI interfaces directly in your projects with the built-in RPi.gpio and other libraries.

===== Multimedia =====
GoBian makes it easy for the secondary development of multimedia applications with the customized GOF middle-ware for TIGER Board.

===== Multitasking =====
The on-board M3733-AFAAA processor makes GoBian a multitasking system with good performance.

===== Linux software =====
The software programs that are available for Debian are basically compatible with GoBian.

===== Low-power sleep mode =====
GoBian supports the ultra-power-saving sleep mode (PMU Standby), with the entire board power consumption as low as 0.35W.

===== Multi-screen sharing =====
GoBian integrates with [[Digital Living Network Alliance|DLNA]] to fully support the multimedia sharing and multi-screen interaction.

===== Community support =====
The GoWarrior community is already launched to support your projects with GoBian.

== CloudQ ==
CloudQ is a comprehensive back-end community support to help users easily build up their projects.<ref name="seeedstudio.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=6444 |title=Seeedstudio Forum • View topic - GoWarrior: TIGER Board First Boot and Kodi Settings |publisher= |accessdate=18 December 2015 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
