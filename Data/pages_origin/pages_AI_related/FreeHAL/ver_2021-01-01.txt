'''FreeHAL''' is a [[distributed computing]] project to build a self-learning [[Chatterbot|chatbot]]. This project is no longer active.<ref name="FreeHAL stats">{{cite web | url = http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=freehal | title = BOINC Stats&nbsp;â€” FreeHAL | publisher = [[BOINC]] | date = 2011-08-04 | accessdate = 2014-02-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120501220035/http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=freehal | archive-date = 2012-05-01 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

== Name ==
First, the program was called ''JEliza'' referring to the chatbot [[ELIZA]] by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]].
The ''J'' stood for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] because JEliza has first been programmed in Java. In May 2008, the program has been renamed to ''FreeHAL'' because the programming language has changed. Since that time the name is related to the computer in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.

==Functionality==
FreeHAL uses a [[semantic network]] and technologies like [[pattern recognition]], [[stemming]], part of speech databases and [[Hidden Markov Model]]s in order to imitate a human behaviour.
FreeHAL learns autonomously. While communicating by keyboard the program extends its database.
Currently, English and German are supported.

==FreeHAL@home==
By using the [[BOINC]] infrastructure,  new semantic networks for the program are built. FreeHAL@home appears to have terminated operations.

==Awards==
In 2008, the program won the first prize in the category "Most Popular" at the [[Chatterbox Challenge]], a yearly competition between different similar chatbots.

==Publications==
There was an article about FreeHAL in the ''[[Linux Magazine]]'', Issue 97 from December 2008. In the German magazine ''com!'', the program was on the CD/DVD and in the list of the Top-10-Open-Source programs of the month.
