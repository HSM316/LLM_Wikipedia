==Plot==
Two years has passed since the [[Gundam Build Divers|EL-Diver Incident]], an event that almost destroyed the Gundam Battle Nexus Online Game until being resolved by the force group known as "Build Divers". In order to make the game secure, a newer version of the game was rolled out in order to prevent the same incident from happening again and with newer experiences that would make the gameplay more immersive to players. The story focuses on Hiroto Kuga, a high schooler who is a rogue mercenary diver for hire, who goes in the game being hired by other forces and divers without being affiliated with other forces. Despite his solo diver status and always wanders alone in game, he yearns for one day that he can find the childhood friend that he once befriended several years ago. But after a special request mission, Hiroto was united with other active divers in a strange world named "Eldora" and formed the Force group "BUILD DiVERS" in what appears to be just another GBN gamespace event, until they learn the truth about Eldora and its consequences not only for GBN, but for the entire world.

| ShortSummary        = Gunpla Battle Nexus Online is upgraded to version 1.78, which adds numerous new features to the game. After clearing a difficult enemy by himself, Hiroto is approached by another player named Kazami, who wants to team up with him. However, Hiroto refuses since he's not interested in Gunpla battles. In the real world, it's revealed that Hiroto is in fact searching for a girl he had met in the game. Meanwhile, his friend Hinata decides to apply for a job at the Gundam cafe near his local Gunpla store. When Hiroto logs back into the game, he's recruited by Kazami to investigate a secret mission that can take them to an unexplored part of the game. They along with two other players, May and Parviz, discover a dog-like NPC named Freddie requesting help, and they accept the mission. While the group initially has trouble fighting the enemies, Hiroto's intervention eventually secures their victory. The game then automatically requests to register their group as "BUILD DIVERS", with them quickly changing the name to "BUILD DiVERS" to differentiate themselves from the original BUILD DIVERS.

| ShortSummary        = The next day, it is revealed that May is working with Magee to investigate the secret missions. When Hiroto logs into GBN, he and the rest of the Build Divers are transported back to the secret Dimension, having been summoned by Freddie once again. Parviz theorizes that they have triggered a special story quest which requires them to complete a chain of missions in order to clear. Freddie leads the Build Divers to his village where his sister Maiya and their father, the village elder, live. The village elder explains that an army of hostile machines called the One-Eyes have recently appeared and begun attacking villages, with the villagers' only options being to flee or hope for help from the Resistance. The Build Divers agree to help protect the village from an expected One-Eyes attack, though Parviz has reservations due to his inexperience in Gunpla battle. Hiroto is only interested in continuing since he might find the girl he is looking for in the secret Dimension. Hiroto prepares a special training simulation to prepare for the mission, but they are only barely able to complete it after multiple tries. That evening, Hiroto is uncomfortable at the thought of being unable to fully protect the village, but receives reassurance from Hinata who reminds him that he always finds a way out of trouble.

Instead of splitting their team to defend two entrances simultaneously, the Build Divers decide to block one of the entrances and funnel the One-Eyes through the other. The villagers reluctantly accept the plan. It's later revealed that Hiroto's determination to protect the village stems from his meeting with the girl in his past, who told him that even though GBN's world is artificial, it's still something worth protecting. That night, the One-Eyes assault the village. The Build Divers are able to hold them back after a tough battle, but a One-Eyes unit is able to penetrate their defenses and attack the village. Hiroto is able to intercept the One-Eyes by switching to his Mars Armor, which is specialized in close combat, and destroys the One-Eyes while causing minimal collateral damage to the village. Afterwards, a Resistance squad led by Freddie and Maiya's older brother Jed arrives, and they are shocked at the presence of the Build Divers. Kazami remarks to Hiroto that they must have unlocked the next story mission. Meanwhile, a mysterious entity observes the Build Divers.

However, the base is protected with an impenetrable barrier and the only entrance is heavily guarded. The Build Divers agree to return in 3 days, which is the time needed for the Resistance to organize. Jed decides to recruit Freddie into the Resistance since only he knows how to summon the Build Divers, which angers Maiya. The next day, the Build Divers take on a regular mission to train for the battle. While pursuing the enemy, Parviz hesitates when he tries to fly, resulting in Hiroto having to save him. It is later revealed that even though the Valkylander is capable of flight, Parviz refuses to fly due to his fear of heights. On the day of the mission, Hiroto, Kazami, and May gather, but Parviz does not appear.

Kazami opposes Parviz's decision while Hiroto and May remain indifferent. The team is summoned to the village before a final decision can be made, as Jed's team is ready to assault the One-Eyes base. Parviz still remains reluctant to participate, afraid of being a burden to the team, so Hiroto suggests a compromise. Parviz will focus on protecting Jed and his team while rest of the Build Divers distract the base guard. The plan goes well initially, with the Build Divers managing to distract the advanced base guard while Jed's team infiltrates the base. Jed successfully demolishes the base, but battle is further complicated with the appearance of a second base guard and a trio of flying One-Eyes units. Realizing everybody is in danger, Parviz finally overcomes his fear and transforms Valkylander into its true form, Morgiana. With Parviz's help, the Build Divers are able to eliminate all of the One-Eyes units. Meanwhile, another Resistance team is apparently wiped out by a mysterious Gundam.

| ShortSummary        = While Parviz experienced great growth in the previous mission, Kazami alone is resentful at his own inability to distinguish himself. Meanwhile, the Build Divers head for the Resistance base where they meet one of the Resistance leaders, Gorus. Gorus informs them that they want the Build Divers to help them move to a safer location for their base. Kazami is openly frustrated since that would mean there is little chance for any fighting where he can distinguish himself. Another Resistance leader, Muran, expresses his distrust of the Build Divers but both Jed and Freddie vouch for their loyalty. Gorus then warns them about the Seltsam, a unique One-Eyes unit that resembles a Gunpla. In order to prepare for the transport mission, Parviz suggests that they join a player vs player match to simulate the unpredictability of an ambush. They then encounter Kazami's old team led by Gojo, who are surprised Kazami is still playing GBN and are willing to challenge them. However, the Build Divers are easily defeated by Gojo's team when Kazami falls for a feint and charges out of position. Gojo observes that Kazami still hasn't changed, and that Hiroto doesn't appear to trust his own team due to his lack of communication with them. Hiroto then visits Hinata, who points out to him that people don't like to be ignored, even if the attention they get can be negative.

Suddenly, the One-Eyes attack the Resistance base, forcing the Resistance to evacuate early. Muran takes Freddie in his truck, but separates from the main convoy in an attempt to elude the One-Eyes. Kazami, unaware Freddie is with Muran, considers leaving Muran to his fate due to his dislike of him. However, remembering Gojo's words to him, Kazami orders Hiroto to protect Muran. While Hiroto save Freddie and Muran, the rest of the Build Divers work to protect the convoy. Kazami is quickly overwhelmed by the One-Eyes and his Gunpla is critically damaged. At his lowest point, Kazami remembers a lesson from his hero, Captain Zeon, telling him that he should follow his own passion for Gunpla in his heart. Inspired, Kazami decides to keep fighting just as Hiroto returns, and with his help, Kazami is able to score his first destruction point. However, their victory is short lived when the Seltsam arrives, destroys the abandoned Resistance base, and then attacks the Build Divers, who are heavily outmatched and are barely able to escape. When they rendezvous with the Resistance, they are entrusted with a mysterious locket by Muran, which according to him is supposed to be the key to turning the tide against the One-Eyes.

Despite Magee's prodding, May claims that the Build Divers really aren't a team in the traditional sense, but admits that she may find what she's looking for if she stays with them. The Build Divers then meet up for the next stage in the story mission. They arrive at the Resistance's new headquarters at the island city of Seguri, which is protected by an energy shield. The commander of the Resistance, Abiree, welcomes them while Gorus tells them their next mission is to engage an undersea monster so the Resistance can scout the Silver Tower, an important One-Eyes stronghold. Parviz suggests they take the Grand Dive Challenge to practice underwater combat. Meanwhile, May asks Hiroto what his motivation is, and he merely tells her he is searching for something that can't be found. The next day, the Build Divers start the Grand Dive Challenge, where they must get a Haro past team Granada Bleu while underwater. Kazami and Parviz are easily eliminated and Hiroto is only able to clear the challenge by using his Mercuone armor and leaving May behind as a decoy. Seeing how the rest of the team aren't suited for underwater battle, Hiroto decides to take on the story mission by himself. May concedes it is the most efficient plan, but asks if it's really enough, which reminds Hiroto of a similar question the mysterious girl in his past asked him.

| ShortSummary        = Despite May's skepticism, Hiroto is still determined to complete the mission on his own. As the rest of team talks with Freddie, they wonder why an experienced player like Hiroto tries to avoid team battles so much. As they near the Silver Tower, they realize it's an orbital elevator connecting to space. They are then attacked by a massive aquatic One-Eyes unit. Meanwhile, Hinata decides to investigate what caused Hiroto to become so antisocial, and connects the timing of his attitude change to the day of the Second Coalition of Volunteers battle. Meanwhile, Hiroto has difficulty fighting the One-Eyes unit and is knocked unconscious, where he has a flashback of where he attempted to fight a rogue boss by himself. While successful, the entire surrounding city was destroyed in the battle. May rescues Hiroto and advises that they all work as a team to defeat the One-Eyes unit. Together, they are able to pull the One-Eyes out of the water with a harpoon and destroy it in a combined attack. At that moment, Hiroto is reminded of how the girl in his past pointed out that he should fight for someone he cares about, not for the sake of fighting. Suddenly, the Seltsam attacks and corners Hiroto, but is saved again by May, who reveals that she is an EL-Diver.

With the mission cleared, the Resistance seizes the base of the Silver Tower, giving them access to outer space. May admits she is one of the 87 EL-Divers discovered after Sarah. Back in the real world, Hiroto appears to carry over a head injury he suffered during the previous battle. Hinata becomes more worried about Hiroto's relationship with the girl in his past. The next night, the Build Divers celebrate the annual Space Crossing festival at the village. The festival concludes with the villagers releasing lanterns into the sky to commemorate those that passed away and to honor the spirits watching over them. Hiroto then asks May whether an EL-Diver dies permanently if they disappear, and May guesses that what Hiroto is searching for is another EL-Diver.

Upon reaching the top of the space elevator, the Build Divers are led to a facility on the surface of Eldora's moon. Entering the facility, the encounter an artificial intelligence called Alus, which explains it is protecting Eldora while it waits for its creators to return.

| ShortSummary        = Amidst the news that an energy surge originated from a planet 30 light years away from Earth was responsible for the malfunction of communications, May arranges a meeting with the other Build Divers in person. She introduces them to Masaki Shidou, a veteran Diver who is in coma for six months and there is no record of him logging out of GBN, implying that his mind is still connected in the system. May also reveals that he is the pilot of the Seltsam and shows them a picture of him with other Eldorians. In addition, the GBN administrators confirmed to May that Eldora is not part of the game. The other Build Divers come to the realization that Eldora is not part of GBN, but a real planet, and that they were risking their lives in a real war. With this revelation, Hiroto, Kazami and Parviz lose their resolve to keep fighting with May and she bids farewell to them. However, once access to GBN is reestablished, May is about to return to Eldora when her fellow Build Divers appear to join her, each deciding to continue for their own reasons. Suddenly, Freddie contacts the Build Divers asking for help, and they depart together to assist him.
