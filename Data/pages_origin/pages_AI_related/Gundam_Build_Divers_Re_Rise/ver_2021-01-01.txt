==Plot==
Two years has passed since the [[Gundam Build Divers|EL-Diver Incident]], an event that almost destroyed the Gundam Battle Nexus Online Game until it was resolved by the force group known as "Build Divers". In order to make the game secure, a newer version of the game was rolled out in order to prevent the same incident from happening again and with newer experiences that would make the gameplay more immersive to players. The story focuses on Hiroto Kuga, a high schooler who is a rogue mercenary diver for hire, who goes in the game being hired by other forces and divers without being affiliated with anyone. Despite his solo diver status he always wanders alone in game, yearning for a mysterious girl from his past. But after a special request mission, Hiroto is united with three other active divers in a strange world named "Eldora" and forms the Force group "BUILD DiVERS" in what appears to be just another GBN gamespace event, until they learn the truth about Eldora and its consequences not only for GBN, but for the entire world.

==Characters==
===BUILD DiVERS===
;{{nihongo|Hiroto Kuga|クガ・ヒロト|Kuga Hiroto}} / {{nihongo|Hiroto|ヒロト|Hiroto}}
:{{voiced by|Chiaki Kobayashi|Billy Kametz}}<ref name="cast">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-25/gundam-build-divers-re-rise-anime-reveals-cast-theme-song-artists-october-10-debut/.150394|title=Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE Anime Reveals Cast, Theme Song Artists, October 10 Debut|website=Anime News Network}}</ref>
:A teenage build diver and a former member of the Force group Avalon, who lives in Yokohama. Now known as a rogue diver for hire after leaving Avalon, he wanders the GBN gamespace alone. He is very calm and a man of few words, usually refusing others' reward and help, especially on joining other forces. But when a special mission done by Freddie united him with Kazami, May and Parviz, they accidentally formed the force group named "BUILD DiVERS" to protect the Eldorans from the One-Eyes army.
:Hiroto uses the '''PFF-X7 Core Gundam''' as his main Gunpla, based on the RX-78-2 Gundam from the original ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' series. Its special armament system called "Planets System", allows the Core Gundam to be equipped with various types of armor, each for a different situation. Hiroto later upgrades his Gunpla into the '''PFF-X7II Core Gundam II'''. This new Core Gundam can transform into the "Core Flyer", in a similar fashion to the original Gundam's FF-X7 Core Fighter for increased mobility and like its predecessor, it can also use the Planets System:
*[[Earth]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/E3 Earthree Gundam'''): Core Gundam's default, blueish all-around armor.
*[[Mars]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/M4 MarsFour Gundam'''): A red armor whose focus is close quarters combat.
*[[Venus]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/V2 VeeTwo Gundam'''): A green armor whose focus is ranged combat.
*[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/M1 MercuOne Gundam'''): A dark blue armor whose focus is underwater combat.
*[[Jupiter]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/J5 Jupitive Gundam'''): A white armor whose focus is orbital combat.
*[[Uranus]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/U7 Uraven Gundam'''): An indigo armor focused on reconnaissance and sniping.
*[[Saturn]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/S6 Saturnix Gundam'''): An orange armor focused in close combat without beam weapons, originally developed to counter [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans characters#Gundam-Frame Suits|Gundam Frames]].
*[[Neptune]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/N8 Nepteight Gundam'''): A mint-colored armor equipped with the Volture Lumiere system from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer]]'', but was used for launching into orbit instead of maneuvering in deep space.
*'''PFF-X7II/BUILD DiVERS Re:Rising Gundam''': A special combination of the Core Gundam II with the WoDom Pod + and parts from the Gundam Aegis Knight and the EX Valkylander, armed with the Grand Cross Cannon.
:In one occasion, Hiroto changes his avatar to a Haro to pilot the Mobile Builder '''Haro Loader''' to help with the repairs on Cuadorn. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified '''ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex''' from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans]]''.

;{{nihongo|May|メイ|Mei}}
:{{voiced by|[[Mai Fuchigami]]|[[Lauren Landa]]}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A female diver who prefers to play solo, she is a very calm and no-nonsense girl whose interest is in battles alone. However, she is not a fan on those that clash their opponents head on and prefers to implement a strategic approach. Later in the series, she is revealed to be one of the 87 EL-Divers who were saved after the EL-Diver incident two years ago and was given her own Mobile Doll body similar to Sarah. In the final episode, she is revealed to be created from the remnant data originating from Eve, another EL-Diver Hiroto met a few years ago and carries her earring on her armband.
:May uses the '''JMA0530-MAY WoDom Pod''' as her main Gunpla, which is a customized JMA-0530 Walking Dome from ''[[Turn A Gundam]]''. In the later episodes, the mobile suit is revealed to be a disguise for its true form, the '''HER-SELF Mobile Doll May'''. May later upgrades her WoDom Pod into the '''JMA0530-MAYBD WoDom Pod +'''. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, she uses her Mobile Doll (albeit with a new color scheme) along with an unmodified '''NZ-999 II Neo Zeong''' mobile armor from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative]]''.

;{{nihongo|Kazami Torimachi|トリマチ・カザミ|Torimachi Kazami}} / {{nihongo|Kazami|カザミ|Kazami}}
:{{voiced by|Masaaki Mizunaka|[[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]]}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A diver who was a former member of the diver group "Mu Dish". He is a very energetic diver who fancies himself as a hero and seeks to make a name for himself in GBN. Though he enjoys the game, he also has been a long fan of the G-TUBER Captain Zeon on his success in several battles, but this obsession drove his former teammates to losing and soon left the group. It was at that time he met Hiroto and the others to form the new BUILD DiVERS group to prove his sense of justice. In real life, Kazami is a teenager with a scrawny body and the son of a fisherman.
:Kazami uses '''ZGMF-X19AK Gundam Justice Knight''' as his main Gunpla, which is a ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny]]'' customized with knight motif and limited armament. He also possesses a modified Petit'gguy called the '''Justi'gguy'''. Kazami later uses the '''GAT-X303K Gundam Aegis Knight''' as his main Gunpla, inspired from the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', which is also customized with knight motif and limited armament, especially its larger shield that can combine with its other weapons to form a large beam sword, the "Keraunos Hyper Beam Sword", when it assumes "King Mode" and a transformable Assault Mode similar to the original Aegis.  During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified '''ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam''' also from ''SEED Destiny''.

:A novice diver whose avatar has fox-like features, he is the younger brother of Shahryar, one of the characters of the original series. He usually takes on playing the game after taking advice from his older brother, but due to his shy and often timid personality, he had problems making friends. In real life, Patrick is a wheelchair-bound teenager and is also a foreigner from a wealthy Middle Eastern family, just like his brother. He was left paralyzed after his glider crashed in the middle of a storm; said incident caused him to have a fear of heights.
:Parviz uses the '''Valkylander''', which he nicknamed "Morgiana", as his main Gunpla, a customized Super Deformed [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|GNY-001F Gundam Astraea Type-F]] with elements from the [[Gundlander]] series in which first appears as a dragon and can transform into its SD Mobile Suit form when in battle. On some occasions, it carries the "Avalanche Rex Buster", a cannon which can also combine with the Gunpla itself. It also has its own version of the Trans-Am system from the ''00'' series called "Gundrans-Am". Parviz later upgrades his Gunpla into the '''EX Valkylander''', based on the [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|GNY-001 Gundam Astraea]] and its design elements based on the Sacred Beast Cuadorn. In one occasion, Parviz changes his avatar to a Haro to pilot the Mobile Builder '''Haro Fitter''' to help with the repairs on Cuadorn. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified version of the '''XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero''' from ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz]]''.

:A cat-like person, who is part of the Eldora Resistance. He has once known Masaki Shido when he first appeared in Eldora before Alus brainwashed him and turned him against his group. With him the surviving member of his division, he had developed a dislike towards the BUILD DiVERS, but slowly trusts them sooner and later. After Jed's death, he leads a new platoon for the Resistance to assist the BUILD DiVERS.

;{{nihongo|Cuadorn|クアドルン|Kuadorun}}
:{{voiced by|Takaya Hashi}}
:A giant biomechanical dragon that existed in the Legends of Eldora for centuries. Once created by the Ancients, he helped them with protecting Eldora from outside threats eons ago until they decided to depart from space to search for new planets to colonize. He soon fell into a deep sleep, watching over the "New People" that flourished the planet after the Ancients' departure. After Masaki stumbled into Eldora, he assisted him with fighting against the One-Eyes until it was injured. Since then, it took refuge in Milagg Mountain until it was awakened once more by Freddie and Parviz to help Hiroto and May repel back Alus's attack against them. Reluctant to accept the BUILD DiVERS' help at first, Cuadorn agrees to ally with them after realizing their will to protect their friends in Eldora. Cuadorn's wing is later restored with some spare Gunpla parts provided by Parviz. He and Masaki later assist the BUILD DiVERS in destroying Alus' satellite cannon and, upon its destruction, destroy its mainframe to prevent Alus from retreating back to Eldora. After the final battle, Cuadorn is seen with some New Eldorans on Milagg Mountain which was relocated in the crater where Seguri City once stood.

===One-Eyes===
;{{nihongo|Masaki Shido|シドー・マサキ|Shidō Masaki}} / {{nihongo|Masked Man|仮面の男|Kamen no Otoko}} / {{nihongo|Sid|シド|Shido}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sōma Saitō]]|Griffin Burns}}
:A veteran S-Ranked Diver who May has been searching for since his disappearance. In real life, Masaki is bed-ridden at the city's general hospital after falling into a coma while logged in to GBN half a year prior to the events of the series. Later, it is revealed that he is brainwashed by the One-Eyes, becoming a masked man who served Alus and sided with them to terrorize Eldora. May recognized him as such despite his appearance in Eldora. However, his extended time in Eldora plus the brainwashing from the One-Eyes caused a serious deterioration on his real life self and his health condition. But due to the BUILD DiVERS' efforts, Masaki is freed from Alus' control and returns to his body back in the real world. With his sister's consent, Masaki returns to Eldora and teams up with Cuadorn again to assist the BUILD DiVERS in the final battle against Alus. He and Cuadorn later destroy the satellite cannon's mainframe to prevent Alus from returning to Eldora.
:Masaki uses the '''MSF-007TE Gundam Tertium''' as his main Gunpla, a heavily customized MSF-007 Gundam Mark-III from ''Z-MSV''. After being brainwashed by Alus, his Gunpla is converted into the '''MSF-007SS Gundam Seltsam''' equipped with the massive Seltsam Arm, which gives the Gunpla a demonic look while displaying massive strength. After Masaki is finally released from Alus's control, his Gunpla is converted into the '''Gundam Advanced Tertium''', now equipped with the Tertium Arms for space combat.

;{{nihongo|Alus|アルス|Arusu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|Austin Lee Matthews}}
:The series's main antagonist, an [[Artificial Intelligence]] entity residing in Eldora's moon which was created by the Ancients to protect the planet from outside threats. After the Ancients left the ravaged planet after a long war, Alus entered into a long slumber. Once he reawakened, he mistook the current inhabitants of Eldora for invaders and started attacking them, using his vast knowledge and resources. After having his satellite cannon and mobile units destroyed by the BUILD DiVERS, he angrily decided to invade GBN as a last resort to destroy them, the game and all Divers in it. In the end, he and his entire fleet, alongside his mobile suits, were defeated and sank down by the BUILD DiVERS, the Third Coalition of Volunteers and many other Divers in GBN, with Alus being deleted by both Hiroto and Riku. After the final battle, he is reincarnated as an infant EL-Diver carrying a pendant resembling a Guard Eye.
:Due to Alus's vast access to GBN through Masaki, he was able to create and build mechanical puppets based on Gunpla seen in GBN Online. In the second season, Alus develops the '''AGP-X1 Alus Core Gundam''', a more powerful replica of Hiroto Kuga's Core Gundam with more upgraded specifications and weaponry to fight the BUILD DiVERS. It utilizes an armor system like the original Core Gundam's Planets System allowing it to be equipped with several armor made by Alus himself. 
*'''AGP-X1/E3 Alus Earthree Gundam''': An armor based on the Core Gundam's Earth Armor. A variant of this is created when Alus steals the original Earth Armor from Hiroto during the final battle against him.

| ShortSummary        = Gunpla Battle Nexus Online is upgraded to version 1.78, which adds numerous new features to the game. After clearing a difficult enemy by himself, Hiroto is approached by another player named Kazami, who wants to team up with him. However, Hiroto refuses since he's not interested in Gunpla battles. In the real world, it's revealed that Hiroto is in fact searching for a girl he had met in the game. Meanwhile, his friend Hinata decides to apply for a job at the Gundam cafe near his local Gunpla store. When Hiroto logs back into the game, he's recruited by Kazami to investigate a secret mission that can take them to an unexplored part of the game. They along with two other players, May and Parviz, discover a dog-like NPC named Freddie requesting help, and they accept the mission. While the group initially has trouble fighting the enemies, Hiroto's intervention eventually secures their victory. The game then automatically requests to register their group as "BUILD DIVERS", with May quickly changing the name to "BUILD DiVERS" to differentiate themselves from the original BUILD DIVERS.

| ShortSummary        = The next day, it is revealed that May is working with Magee to investigate the secret missions. When Hiroto logs into GBN, he and the rest of the BUILD DiVERS are transported back to the secret Dimension, having been summoned by Freddie once again. Parviz theorizes that they have triggered a special story quest which requires them to complete a chain of missions in order to clear. Freddie leads the BUILD DiVERS to his village where his sister Maiya and their father, the village elder, live. The village elder explains that an army of hostile machines called the One-Eyes have recently appeared and begun attacking villages, with the villagers' only options being to flee or hope for help from the Resistance. The BUILD DiVERS agree to help protect the village from an expected One-Eyes attack, though Parviz has reservations due to his inexperience in Gunpla battle. Hiroto is only interested in continuing since he might find the girl he is looking for in the secret Dimension. Hiroto prepares a special training simulation to prepare for the mission, but they are only barely able to complete it after multiple tries. That evening, Hiroto is uncomfortable at the thought of being unable to fully protect the village, but receives reassurance from Hinata who reminds him that he always finds a way out of trouble.

| ShortSummary        = Hiroto revises the plan to defend the village. Instead of splitting their team to defend two entrances simultaneously, the BUILD DiVERS decide to block one of the entrances and funnel the One-Eyes through the other. The villagers reluctantly accept the plan. It's later revealed that Hiroto's determination to protect the village stems from his meeting with the girl in his past, who told him that even though GBN's world is artificial, it's still something worth protecting. That night, the One-Eyes assault the village. The BUILD DiVERS are able to hold them back after a tough battle, but a One-Eyes unit is able to penetrate their defenses and attack the village. Hiroto is able to intercept the One-Eyes by switching to his Mars Armor, which is specialized in close combat, and destroys the One-Eyes while causing minimal collateral damage to the village. Afterwards, a Resistance squad led by Freddie and Maiya's older brother Jed arrives, and they are shocked at the presence of the BUILD DiVERS. Kazami remarks to Hiroto that they must have unlocked the next story mission. Meanwhile, a mysterious entity observes the BUILD DiVERS.

However, the base is protected with an impenetrable barrier and the only entrance is heavily guarded. The BUILD DiVERS agree to return in 3 days, which is the time needed for the Resistance to organize. Jed decides to recruit Freddie into the Resistance since only he knows how to summon the BUILD DiVERS, which angers Maiya. The next day, the BUILD DiVERS take on a regular mission to train for the battle. While pursuing the enemy, Parviz hesitates when he tries to fly, resulting in Hiroto having to save him. It is later revealed that even though the Valkylander is capable of flight, Parviz refuses to fly due to his fear of heights. On the day of the mission, Hiroto, Kazami, and May gather, but Parviz does not appear.

Kazami opposes Parviz's decision while Hiroto and May remain indifferent. The team is summoned to the village before a final decision can be made, as Jed's team is ready to assault the One-Eyes base. Parviz still remains reluctant to participate, afraid of being a burden to the team, so Hiroto suggests a compromise. Parviz will focus on protecting Jed and his team while rest of the BUILD DiVERS distract the base guard. The plan goes well initially, with the BUILD DiVERS managing to distract the advanced base guard while Jed's team infiltrates the base. Jed successfully demolishes the base, but the battle is further complicated with the appearance of a second base guard and a trio of flying One-Eyes units. Realizing everybody is in danger, Parviz finally overcomes his fear and transforms his Valkylander into its true form, its Dragon Fusion Mode. With Parviz's help, the BUILD DiVERS are able to eliminate all of the One-Eyes units. Meanwhile, another Resistance team is apparently wiped out by a mysterious Gundam.

| ShortSummary        = While Parviz experienced great growth in the previous mission, Kazami alone is resentful at his own inability to distinguish himself. Meanwhile, the BUILD DiVERS head for the Resistance base where they meet one of the Resistance leaders, Gorus. Gorus informs them that they want the BUILD DiVERS to help them move to a safer location for their base. Kazami is openly frustrated since that would mean there is little chance for any fighting where he can distinguish himself. Another Resistance leader, Muran, expresses his distrust of the BUILD DiVERS but both Jed and Freddie vouch for their loyalty. Gorus then warns them about the Seltsam, a unique One-Eyes unit that resembles a Gunpla. In order to prepare for the transport mission, Parviz suggests that they join a player vs player match to simulate the unpredictability of an ambush. They then encounter Kazami's old team led by Gojo, who are surprised Kazami is still playing GBN and are willing to challenge them. However, the BUILD DiVERS are easily defeated by Gojo's team when Kazami falls for a feint and charges out of position. Gojo observes that Kazami still hasn't changed, and that Hiroto doesn't appear to trust his own team due to his lack of communication with them. Hiroto then visits Hinata, who points out to him that people don't like to be ignored, even if the attention they get can be negative.

Suddenly, the One-Eyes attack the Resistance base, forcing the Resistance to evacuate early. Muran takes Freddie in his truck, but separates from the main convoy in an attempt to elude the One-Eyes. Kazami, unaware Freddie is with Muran, considers leaving Muran to his fate due to his dislike of him. However, remembering Gojo's words to him, Kazami orders Hiroto to protect Muran. While Hiroto save Freddie and Muran, the rest of the BUILD DiVERS work to protect the convoy. Kazami is quickly overwhelmed by the One-Eyes and his Gunpla is critically damaged. At his lowest point, Kazami remembers a lesson from his hero, Captain Zeon, telling him that he should follow his own passion for Gunpla in his heart. Inspired, Kazami decides to keep fighting just as Hiroto returns, and with his help, Kazami is able to score his first destruction point. However, their victory is short lived when the Seltsam arrives, destroys the abandoned Resistance base, and then attacks the BUILD DiVERS, who are heavily outmatched and are barely able to escape. When they rendezvous with the Resistance, they are entrusted with a mysterious locket by Muran, which according to him is supposed to be the key to turning the tide against the One-Eyes.

Despite Magee's prodding, May claims that the BUILD DiVERS really aren't a team in the traditional sense, but admits that she may find what she's looking for if she stays with them. The BUILD DiVERS then meet up for the next stage in the story mission. They arrive at the Resistance's new headquarters at the island city of Seguri, which is protected by an energy shield. The commander of the Resistance, Abiree, welcomes them while Gorus tells them their next mission is to engage an undersea monster so the Resistance can scout the Silver Tower, an important One-Eyes stronghold. Parviz suggests they take the Grand Dive Challenge to practice underwater combat. Meanwhile, May asks Hiroto what his motivation is, and he merely tells her he is searching for something that can't be found. The next day, the BUILD DiVERS start the Grand Dive Challenge, where they must get a Haro past team Granada Bleu while underwater. Kazami and Parviz are easily eliminated and Hiroto is only able to clear the challenge by using his Mercuone armor and leaving May behind as a decoy. Seeing how the rest of the team aren't suited for underwater battle, Hiroto decides to take on the story mission by himself. May concedes it is the most efficient plan, but asks if it's really enough, which reminds Hiroto of a similar question the mysterious girl in his past asked him.

As they near the Silver Tower, they realize it's an orbital elevator connecting to space. They are then attacked by a massive aquatic One-Eyes unit. Meanwhile, Hinata decides to investigate what caused Hiroto to become so antisocial, and connects the timing of his attitude change to the day of the Second Coalition of Volunteers' battle. Meanwhile, Hiroto has difficulty fighting the One-Eyes unit and is knocked unconscious, where he has a flashback of when he attempted to fight a rogue boss by himself. While successful, the entire surrounding city was destroyed in the battle. May rescues Hiroto and advises that they all work as a team to defeat the One-Eyes unit. Together, they are able to pull the One-Eyes out of the water with a harpoon and destroy it in a combined attack. At that moment, Hiroto is reminded of how the girl in his past pointed out that he should fight for someone he cares about, not for the sake of fighting. Suddenly, the Seltsam attacks and corners Hiroto, but is saved again by May, who reveals that she is an EL-Diver.

The next night, the BUILD DiVERS celebrate the annual Space Crossing festival at the village. The festival concludes with the villagers releasing lanterns into the sky to commemorate those that passed away and to honor the spirits watching over them.

Upon reaching the top of the space elevator, the BUILD DiVERS are led to a facility on the surface of Eldora's moon. Entering the facility, they encounter an artificial intelligence called Alus, which explains it is protecting Eldora while it waits for its creators to return. Freddie then pleads with Alus to stop the One-Eyes' attacks on his people, but Alus instead turns hostile and targets Seguri for destruction. The BUILD DiVERS evacuate the facility and discover the moon is actually an orbital cannon. They are then met by a massive army of One-Eyes led by the Seltsam.

| ShortSummary        = The BUILD DiVERS fight the One-Eyes army and the Seltsam while desperately trying to stop the orbital cannon. In the occasion, Hiroto confronts the Seltsam and learns to his surprise that it is piloted by a human. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent the cannon from firing at Seguri, obliterating the city along with Jed and most of the Resistance. Hiroto and the others are blasted away by the cannon's beam and are barely able to return safely to the surface. Back at the village, they reveal to the others what happened to the city and the villagers mourn Jed's death. While wondering why the story mode did not end as they failed their mission, Kazami realizes that the villagers are truly suffering and that their situation is not part of a game, but real. Suddenly, all GBN users are forcibly logged out from the system, including the BUILD DiVERS. Back in the real world, Hiroto learns that servers are mysteriously shutting down across the globe, interfering with communications worldwide.

| ShortSummary        = Amidst the news that an energy surge originated from a planet 30 light years away from Earth was responsible for the malfunction of communications worldwide, May arranges a meeting with the other BUILD DiVERS in person. She introduces them to Masaki Shidoh, a veteran Diver who has been in a coma for six months. There is no record of him logging out of GBN, implying that his mind is still connected in the system. May also reveals that he is the pilot of the Seltsam and shows them a picture of him with other Eldorans. In addition, the GBN administrators confirmed to May that Eldora is not part of the game. The other BUILD DiVERS come to the realization that Eldora is not part of GBN, but a real planet, and that they were risking their lives in a real war. With this revelation, Hiroto, Kazami and Parviz lose their resolve to keep fighting with May and she bids farewell to them. However, once access to GBN is reestablished, May is about to return to Eldora when her fellow BUILD DiVERS appear to join her, each deciding to continue for their own reasons. Suddenly, Freddie contacts the BUILD DiVERS asking for help, and the four depart together to assist him.

| ShortSummary        = Before meeting the BUILD DiVERS, Freddie used to explore the nearby ruins when one day, he managed to establish contact with GBN, and since then he regularly returned there to watch the exploits of the original Build Divers. One day, he and Stola stumbled across a scout unit of the One-Eyes and the villagers concluded that an attack from them was imminent. When the One-Eyes finally set their eyes on the village, Freddie ran to the ruins where he managed to contact Hiroto and the others and enlist their help. Back to the present, after the destruction of Seguri City, access to the ruins was blocked and he could not contact the BUILD DiVERS anymore. Knowing that the One-Eyes army will eventually return, and with the Resistance destroyed, Freddie digs his way back into the ruins and reestablishes contact with Hiroto and his friends, asking for their help once more. Meanwhile, a massive creature awakens in another temple.

| ShortSummary        = The BUILD DiVERS are summoned back to Eldora, but are shocked to discover that their Gunpla have not been fully summoned, with only the base forms of Hiroto and May's Gunpla being summoned and Kazami and Parviz's failing to appear at all. Freddie explains that all along, the BUILD DiVERS were being summoned by the "Shining Sand", which is only found at the temple and would construct their bodies and Gunpla. However, Alus' satellite attack damaged the temple and blew away all the Shining Sand. They return to the village where they encounter Muran, who managed to escape the destruction of Seguri. Muran points the BUILD DiVERS to three other temples they may find more Shining Sand at. Hiroto correctly guesses that Muran knew Masaki and his initial distrust of the BUILD DiVERS stems from Masaki's apparent betrayal. Hiroto and May head to the northern temple, Kazami and Maiya head to the southern temple, and Parviz, Freddie, and Muran head to the eastern temple. Hiroto and May defeat a trio of upgraded One-Eyes units but find no Shining Sand at the northern temple. Hiroto observes that the One-Eyes actively avoid damaging the temples. Kazami feels guilty for being partially responsible for Jed's death, and is conflicted on whether to tell Maiya or not. Muran explains to Parviz and Freddie that the eastern temple actually floats in the sky and serves as the home of the sacred beast Cuadorn, which is supposed to be Eldora's protector. Muran provides a hot air balloon to Parviz and Freddie and instructs them to meet Cuadorn personally. Meanwhile, Masaki appears to be going berserk as he begins attacking One-Eyes units.

Kazami finally admits his partial fault in the destruction of Seguri and Jed's death, but Maiya forgives him. Hiroto and May then arrive, where they encounter Stola and Resistance remnants, who are protecting a nearby village. However, the village is discovered by a One-Eyes scout, meaning an attack will arrive in three days. Since the village is full of refugees who are in no condition to evacuate, Hiroto, May, and Kazami head for the eastern temple but are ambushed by a One-Eyes unit controlled directly by Alus, which has also copied the Core Change system Hiroto's Gunpla uses. Meanwhile, Parviz and Freddie ride the balloon and manage to reach the eastern temple which is still intact and full of Shining Sand. They also meet Cuadorn, who Parviz notices is visibly damaged. Cuadorn summons a lightning storm that forces Alus to withdraw and then lands the eastern temple, allowing the rest of the BUILD DiVERS and Muran to meet him as well. In the real world, Hinata meets her senior classmate Mizuki Shidoh, who is also Masaki's sister. Back at the eastern temple, even though Cuadorn acknowledges he owes a debt to the "people of the Gunpla", he asks the BUILD DiVERS to leave.

| ShortSummary        = Cuadorn reveals that Alus is an artificial intelligence developed by the ancient people of Eldora to protect the planet, but after a war that devastated the planet, Alus was put into hibernation while the Ancients left to find a new home. Ages later, Alus awakened and believed that the current inhabitants of Eldora are intruders, so it started attacking them. In response, Cuadorn summoned Masaki to assist him against Alus, and Alus accessed GBN's data to create the One-Eyes' mobile suits to counter them, before capturing and brainwashing Masaki. Cuadorn also reveals that the Shining Sand was part of a system the Ancients originally developed to digitally transfer themselves back to Eldora, which has somehow proved compatible with GBN. Despite learning the truth, the BUILD DiVERS refuse to leave and reaffirm their will to protect their friends on Eldora, convincing Cuadorn to accept their help. They send Muran to instruct the villagers to take refuge at the ancient ruins, which the One-Eyes units will not attack, while making plans to confront Alus before he fires his satellite cannon again. The BUILD DiVERS decide to return to Earth to prepare and promise to return to Eldora in two days. While Hiroto and his friends are preparing themselves for the next battle, Hinata learns about Masaki's condition, and is worried about Hiroto's safety.

When Kazami spots Freddie and Stola run around the battlefield while helping a civilian to escape, he jumps in to protect them and Hiroto takes advantage of the situation to pinpoint Alus' location and launch a counterattack, while the other BUILD DiVERS keep protecting the refugees. Hiroto confronts and defeats Alus, but while his friends celebrate, Hiroto himself is disheartened because he broke a promise he made to Eve in the past.

| ShortSummary        = A few years ago, when GBN was about to be launched, Hiroto, answering a request from his friends, participated in a Gunpla Duel piloting a hastily built Speed Grade RX-78-2 Gundam against a veteran player using a Perfect Grade GAT-X105 Strike Gundam, but despite the huge disadvantage, he won by making use of the parts of other Gunpla destroyed by the enemy. This inspired him to develop the Core Gundam, but during his first time piloting it in GBN, the Gunpla malfunctioned and he made a forced landing. In the occasion, he met Eve and the two became close. Inspired by Eve's encouragement, Hiroto developed additional armors for the Core Gundam, thus creating the Planets System. Afterwards, he joined a Force by her suggestion and became a member of Avalon. However, some time later, Hiroto was surprised by Eve, who requested for him to erase her.

| ShortSummary        = Eve revealed to Hiroto that she was an EL-Diver and that she was absorbing the bugs Sarah was inadvertently creating, but after the First Coalition of Volunteers battle, she had reached her limit and the bugs risked being released, which would destroy GBN. Hiroto reluctantly allowed his Core Gundam to give her a fatal shot, but before fading, Eve asked Hiroto to always be someone who helps others, and to help Sarah, who was captured by Avalon. Afterwards, Hiroto joined the Second Coalition of Volunteers against the original Build Divers, but just when he was about to shoot down Riku's battered Gundam 00 Sky, he remembered his promise to Eve and refrained, redirecting his shot. After telling the whole story to his friends, Hiroto voices his regret over not doing his best to help others like he promised to Eve, and is comforted by May who encourages him to cry freely. Hiroto later apologizes to Freddie for pretending that he and the others were the real Build Divers. Freddie, on the other hand, reassures Hiroto that he kept his promise to Eve by helping the Eldorans against the One-Eyes and is happy for meeting them. Elsewhere, a deranged Masaki fights his brainwashing while defending the Eldorans against the One Eyes' forces while his health back in the real world begins to decline.

| ShortSummary        = Hiroto and the others have an offline meeting to make plans for their imminent confrontation with Alus. In the occasion, Kazami asks for help to create a new Gunpla and Parviz comes up with an idea to fix Cuadorn's broken wing with Gunpla parts. At Eldora, they hear from Muran that the Seltsam was seen fighting the One-Eyes and Cuadorn theorizes that the damage the BUILD DiVERS inflicted on the Seltsam in the space battle damaged the system Alus was using to control Masaki, allowing him to resist his brainwashing. The BUILD DiVERS decide to face Masaki once more in order to help him fully break away from Alus' control. Afterwards, while accompanying Hiroto after school, Hinata is informed by Mizuki that her brother's condition is worsening, and upon learning this, Hiroto reveals the truth to her, promising to rescue Masaki and return safely. Back at Eldora, Kazami reveals his new Gunpla, the Aegis Knight, and departs with Hiroto and May to look for Masaki, while Parviz stays behind to finish repairs on Cuadorn.

| ShortSummary        = As Masaki's condition in the real world deteriorates, Hiroto, May, and Kazami leave to confront the Seltsam while Parviz remains behind to repair Cuadorn's wing. Hiroto's group soon encounters the Seltsam battling a large One-Eyes force, and a vicious three way battle commences. During the battle, Masaki pleads for Hiroto to kill him, as he feels immense guilt over being forced to betray Cuadorn and the New Eldorans. Alus himself then intervenes with his Core Gundam in its Earthree armor as well as copies of the Nu and Arche Gundams, intent on retrieving Masaki. With his wing repaired, Cuadorn then arrives on the field with Parviz and manages to disable the Seltsam. He then prepares to destroy the Seltsam and kill Masaki to end his suffering, but Hiroto and May intervene, convincing him that Masaki can still be saved. Cuadorn then shifts to distracting Alus while Hiroto and Kazami work together to take down the Seltsam, with Hiroto being able to remove the corrupted parts. Alus then retreats, wondering why he keeps losing in his encounters with Hiroto's team. Masaki is finally freed from Alus' control and his consciousness returns to his body in the real world, where he finally recovers from his coma. Meanwhile, Magee publicizes information about the BUILD DiVERS' exploits to the GBN population under the guise of seeking assistance to clear a game mission, which immediately begins receiving offers of help.

Mizuki appears soon after and asks them to not have her brother involved with their battle anymore. At Eldora, the BUILD DiVERS discuss ways to reach the moon without using the space elevator, when May points out that Alus should not be destroyed, given that he is simply following his programming and does not know any better. The group agrees to try to stop Alus without destroying him, despite Muran's reservations. While the team develops new equipment for the upcoming battle in space, May introduces the others to Magee, who had publicized the BUILD DiVERS' exploits which has garnered them a huge amount of public sympathy and support within GBN. With many Forces volunteering to help the BUILD DiVERS train for their upcoming battle against Alus, Magee arranges a special event for the BUILD DiVERS to face off against GBN's most elite divers, including members from Avalon and the original Build Divers.

During the Lotus Challenge, the BUILD DiVERS face off against not only Riku and the Build Divers, but also Rommel and his 7th Panzer Division, Ogre and Hyakki, and Kyouya and Avalon. Meanwhile, Mizuki watches Kazami's records of the BUILD DiVERS' exploits on Eldora, and comes to understand Masaki's plight a little more. She convinces the hospital to release Masaki early and gives him her blessing to help the BUILD DiVERS on the condition he return home safely. Back in GBN, on their 40th try, the BUILD DiVERS are finally able to break through the opposition and beat the Lotus Challenge after unlocking their team's Special Move. The participants celebrate afterwards, with it being implied that Rommel is actually Captain Zeon. May arranges for Hiroto to meet Riku and Sarah, having already told them about Eve. Riku apologizes to Hiroto, but the latter insists that he holds no grudge against him or Sarah, since it was Eve's wish to ensure that they would both be happy and help GBN flourish. They then promise to battle each other again in the future. After returning to the real world, Hiroto has a talk with Hinata, where they promise to support each other in their own ways as Hiroto prepares to return to Eldora and Hinata prepares for an important bow ritual.

While the Resistance stages a diversionary attack on the Silver Tower, Hiroto uses his new Nepteight armor to carry the BUILD DiVERS into orbit, catching Alus off guard. The BUILD DiVERS clash with the One-Eyes forces as Masaki and Cuadorn join in to help. All the while, Kazami is live-streaming the battle so that the general public can spectate it as well, including Mizuki and Hiroto's parents. The BUILD DiVERS are eventually able to break through the One-Eyes' forces and contribute parts of their own Gunpla to Hiroto to form the Re:Rising Gundam. With his new Gundam, Hiroto is able to destroy Alus' orbital cannon while at the same time back on Earth, Hinata hits her target and succeeds in completing the bow ritual. Realizing that the Divers will continue to interfere with his plans, Alus angrily decides to directly destroy them all by forcefully uploading himself and his massive warfleet into GBN, intent on destroying the game. However, he is immediately met by the Third Coalition of Volunteers, who are already prepared for battle.

Back in GBN, Hiroto attempts to form the Earthree Gundam but Alus steals the Earth Armor and equips it onto one of his own Gundams instead. In response, Hiroto equips his Core Gundam II with parts from the other armors at his disposal to fight back. Surprised by the Volunteers' fierce resistance, Alus launches an attack to take down GBN's systems, but is prevented when the Game Master and Miss Tori arrive to install a security patch and revert the damage. After his forces are almost destroyed by the Divers with more of them joining the battle, Alus launches one last desperate attack to destroy GBN, but is stopped by Sarah and May, before being ultimately defeated by Riku and Hiroto. After the battle, Alus reincarnates into an infant EL-Diver that May takes in, during which, Hiroto notices the earring he gave to Eve with her, realizing that Eve reincarnated into May as well. In a real-world meeting, Miss Tori points out that Alus' energy signature is similar to some issues that occurred in GBN during its development, implying that the EL-Divers are in fact ancient Eldorans who got new life in GBN. Some time later, Masaki is finally discharged from hospital, and the BUILD DiVERS, with Hinata as their newest member, return to Eldora to help the people rebuild.
