==Plot==
Two years has passed since the [[Gundam Build Divers|EL-Diver Incident]], an event that almost destroyed the Gundam Battle Nexus Online Game until it was resolved by the force group known as "Build Divers", and soon after more EL-Divers were discovered. In order to make the game secure, a newer version of the game was rolled out in order to prevent the same incident from happening again and with newer experiences that would make the gameplay more immersive to players. The story focuses on Hiroto Kuga, a high schooler who is a rogue mercenary diver for hire, who goes in the game being hired by other forces and divers without being affiliated with anyone. Despite his solo diver status he always wanders alone in game, yearning for a mysterious girl from his past named Eve, who was in fact the very first EL-Diver to appear in the game. But after a special request mission, Hiroto is united with three other active divers in a strange world named "Eldora" and forms the Force group "BUILD DiVERS" in what appears to be just another GBN gamespace event, until they learn the truth about Eldora and its consequences not only for GBN, but for the entire world.

:The main protagonist of the series and a high-school builder, veteran diver, and a former ace member of the Force group Avalon, who lives in Yokohama. He was the friend Kyoya was referring to who couldn't make it in episode 3 of ''[[Gundam Build Divers]]'' when Riku and his friends first met Kyoya and was active and unseen for some major events. Now working as a rogue diver for hire after leaving Avalon, he wanders the GBN gamespace alone, and keeps his identity that he is the one who discovered that the EL-Diver Sarah was not alone a secret. He is very calm and a man of few words, usually refusing others' reward and help, especially on joining other forces. But when a special mission done by Freddie united him with Kazami, May and Parviz, they accidentally formed the force team named "BUILD DiVERS" to protect the Eldorans from the One-Eyes army. Currently he is the ace of his unit and the leader of the overall force.
:Hiroto uses the '''PFF-X7 Core Gundam''' as his main Gunpla, based on the RX-78-2 Gundam from the original ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' series. Its special armament system called the "core-change" gimmick and his first theme invented from that gimmick is the "Planets System". This allows the Core Gundam to be equipped with various types of armor and weapons, each for a different situation named after the eight planets. Hiroto later upgrades his Gunpla into the '''PFF-X7II Core Gundam II'''. This new Core Gundam can transform into the "Core Flyer", in a similar fashion to the original Gundam's FF-X7 Core Fighter for increased mobility and like its predecessor, it can also use the Planets System:
*[[Earth]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/E3 Earthree Gundam'''): Core Gundam's default blue armor, focused on traditional all-around combat.
*[[Mars]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/M4 Marsfour Gundam'''): A red armor whose focus is on fragments of four styles of close combat, hence "Cross-Combat". 
*[[Venus]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/V2 Veetwo Gundam'''): A green armor whose focus is commando style ranged and bombardment combat.
*[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/M1 Mercuone Gundam'''): A navy armor whose focus is underwater combat.
*[[Jupiter]] Armor ('''PFF-X7/J5 Jupitive Gundam'''): A white armor whose focus is fast orbital combat.
*[[Uranus]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/U7 Uraven Gundam'''): An indigo armor focused on reconnaissance and high powered sniping.
*[[Saturn]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/S6 Saturnix Gundam'''): An orange armor focused in demolition style close combat without beam weapons, originally developed to counter [[List of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans characters#Gundam-Frame Suits|Gundam Frames]].
*[[Neptune]] Armor ('''PFF-X7II/N8 Nepteight Gundam'''): An aqua-green armor equipped with a customized Volture Lumiere system similar to the one from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer]]'', intended to be used for traveling through GBN's space in a short amount of time, but was used for launching into orbit instead of maneuvering in deep space. It is ultimately discarded in Eldora's orbit due to the strain of leaving Eldora's gravitational field.  
*'''PFF-X7II/BUILD DiVERS Re:Rising Gundam''': A special combination of the Core Gundam II with the WoDom Pod + and parts from the Gundam Aegis Knight and the EX Valkylander, armed with two giant beam sabers, eight miracle wings born from Eve's blessings, and the "Grand Cross Cannon", Hiroto's first special move, made with the help of his team.
:In one occasion, Hiroto changes his avatar to a Haro to pilot the Mobile Builder '''Haro Loader''' to help with the repairs on Cuadorn by making a prosthetic wing out of gunpla parts. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified '''ASW-G-08 Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex''' from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans]]''.  
:In Battlelogue, it is revealed that he has made a second Core Gundam II that he leaves on Eldora with the colors of the [[Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam|Gundam MK-II Titan]]. Another variant of this Gunpla sports the old "Gundam G3" colors with his team's personal crest, which is most likely to represent Sarah since the color of her hair, eyes, and dress embody Hiroto's time with Eve before they joined Avalon and to symbolize how he has officially befriended the original Build Divers. Each of the two units have unique advancements, the Titan color specializes in ground and underwater combat and the G3 color specializes in aerial and space combat.

;{{nihongo|May|メイ|Mei}}
:{{voiced by|[[Mai Fuchigami]]|[[Lauren Landa]]}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A seemingly late teens female diver who prefers to play solo, she is a very calm and no-nonsense girl whose interest is in battles alone. However, she is not a fan of those who engage their opponents head on and prefers to implement a strategic approach. She is mature and has a strong sense of justice, and can be impulsive rushing into situations, especially for those in danger. Later in the series, she is revealed to be one of the 87 EL-Divers, however she was not one of those who were saved after the EL-Diver incident two years ago, she was born shortly after. After she was born she was given her own Mobile Doll body similar to Sarah, that is when she first met her, Koichi, Tsukasa, and Nanami. During the Lotus Challenge Eldoran style rehearsal battle it is revealed that she, as a new sister of Sarah, addresses the latter as the older since Sarah is chronologically older, regardless of her maturity. In the final episode, she is revealed to have been born with the remnant data originating from Eve, the first born EL-Diver who Hiroto befriended and fell in love with several years ago, and carries Eve's earring on her armband. In Battlelogue, it's implied that she is currently living with Hiroto IRL and in GBN is his bodyguard.
:May uses the '''JMA0530-MAY WoDom Pod''' as her main Gunpla, which is a customized JMA-0530 Walking Dome from ''[[Turn A Gundam]]''. In the later episodes, the mobile suit is revealed to be a disguise for its true form, the '''HER-SELF Mobile Doll May'''. May later upgrades her WoDom Pod into the '''JMA0530-MAYBD WoDom Pod +'''. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, she uses her Mobile Doll (albeit with a new color scheme and the Gundam Base logo) along with an unmodified '''NZ-999 II Neo Zeong''' mobile armor from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative]]''.

;{{nihongo|Kazami Torimachi|トリマチ・カザミ|Torimachi Kazami}} / {{nihongo|Kazami|カザミ|Kazami}}
:{{voiced by|Masaaki Mizunaka|[[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]]}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A diver who was a former member of the diver group "Mu Dish". He is a very energetic diver who fancies himself as a hero and seeks to make a name for himself in GBN. Though he enjoys the game, he also has been a long fan of the G-TUBER Captain Zeon on his success in several battles, but this obsession drove his former teammates to losing and soon left the group. It was at that time he met Hiroto and the others to form the new BUILD DiVERS group to prove his sense of justice, and be the leader of their team, although he doesn't mind Hiroto being the team's ace and hero. In real life, Kazami is a teenager with a scrawny body and the son of a fisherman. Currently he is the leader of the latter unit, the left hand sub-leader of the overall force and the poster guy for their G-tube channel.
:Kazami uses '''ZGMF-X19AK Gundam Justice Knight''' as his main Gunpla, which is a ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny]]'' customized with knight motif and limited armament. He also possesses a modified Petit'gguy called the '''Justi'gguy'''. Kazami later uses the '''GAT-X303K Gundam Aegis Knight''' as his main Gunpla, inspired from the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', which is also customized with knight motif and limited armament, especially its larger shield that can combine with its other weapons to form the bigger "Keraunos Hyper Beam Sword", when it assumes "King Mode" and a transformable Assault Mode similar to the original Aegis. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified '''ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam''' also from ''SEED Destiny''.

;{{nihongo|Patrick Alexandre Leonard Arge|パトリック・アレクサンドル・レオナルド・アルジェ|Patorikku Arekusandoru Reonarudo Aruje}} / {{nihongo|Parviz|パルヴィーズ|Paruvīzu}}
:{{voiced by|Mayu Minami|[[Laura Stahl]]}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A novice diver and builder whose avatar has fox-like features, inspired from being the younger brother of Shahryar, one of the characters of the previous series. He usually takes on playing the game after taking advice from his older brother, but due to his shy and often timid personality, thus had problems making friends. In real life, Patrick is a wheelchair-bound boy teenage foreigner from a wealthy Middle Eastern family, just like his brother. He was left paralyzed after his glider crashed in the middle of a storm; said incident caused him to have a fear of heights, even though he doesn't want to be and eventually breaks through it.
:Parviz uses the '''Valkylander''', which he nicknamed "Morgiana", as his main Gunpla, a customized Super Deformed [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|GNY-001F Gundam Astraea Type-F]] with elements from the [[Gundlander]] series in which first appears as a dragon and can transform into its SD Mobile Suit form when in battle. On some occasions, it carries the "Avalanche Rex Buster", a cannon which can also combine with the Gunpla itself. It also has its own version of the Trans-Am system from the ''00'' series called "Gundrans-Am". Parviz later makes another version his Gunpla called the '''EX Valkylander''', based on the [[Mobile Suit Gundam 00|GNY-001 Gundam Astraea]] and its design elements based on the Sacred Beast Cuadorn, including bigger wings for itself and the '''Re:Rising Gundam''' where they grow into miracle wings. In one occasion, Parviz changes his avatar to a Haro to pilot the Mobile Builder '''Haro Fitter''' to help with the repairs on Cuadorn. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified version of the '''XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero''' from ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz]]''.

:{{voiced by|[[Shion Wakayama]]|Lisa Reimold}}<ref name="cast"/>
:Hiroto's classmate who practices archery and childhood friend who lives next door and works at the same Gundam Base where he logs into GBN. She cares deeply about him, even knowing his heart belongs to another. She witnessed him coming home in the rain and crying on the day that Eve was sacrificed and becomes more worried upon learning that he is risking his life in a real war. In the final episode, she joins GBN as a new member of Hiroto's team and meets Freddie along with the New Eldorans. Her diver avatar is a shrine priestess.
:The only known gunpla she has is a pink Petit'gguy that she built with Hiroto's supervision from back when they were in elementary school.

===People of Eldora===
;{{nihongo|Freddie|フレディ|Furedi}}
:{{voiced by|[[Ai Kakuma]]|Elizabeth Freeman}}<ref name="cast"/>
:A preteen anthropomorphic dog boy who lived on Planet Eldora, considered to be one of the "New People" after the departure of the Ancients eons ago. He is very cheerful and shows a lot of respect to the BUILD DiVERS, often calling them Creators. He is also the one who can summon them through the temples left behind by the Ancients. He saw many of the Build Divers' accomplishments on the GBN live stream via the ruins and would go to the ruins everyday just to watch them. He originally planned to use the ruins to summon the original Build Divers, but ended up making a new team of Build Divers instead, and initially thought they were part of them, with two of the members, Hiroto and May, having a connection to Sarah and one, Parviz, having an indirect connection to her. Like Sarah, he usually rides in a Gunpla as a passenger, mostly with Hiroto. He initially served as the BUILD DiVERS' motivator, but is now the Eldoran representative member of the team and later on the entire Build Diver force. It is revealed that his ancient ancestral genes came from a dog that belonged to one of Alus's creators who's face Eve merited.
:After Alus's defeat Hiroto eventually leaves a copy of the Saturn armor on Eldora for the latter to test-fly on.

:Two members of the Eldora Resistance, who survived the Satellite Cannon firing on Seguri alongside Stola. During the final episode, they come across a surviving Guard Eye unit and take it under their care.

;{{nihongo|Muran|ムラン|}}
:{{voiced by|[[Shinji Kawada]]|Jordan Reynolds}}
:A cat-like person, who is part of the Eldora Resistance. He has once known Masaki Shido when he first appeared in Eldora before Alus brainwashed him and turned him against his group. With him the surviving member of his division, he had developed a dislike towards the BUILD DiVERS, but slowly trusts them sooner and later. After Jed's death, he leads a new platoon for the Resistance to assist the BUILD DiVERS.

;{{nihongo|Cuadorn|クアドルン|Kuadorun}}
:{{voiced by|[[Takaya Hashi]]|[[Bob Carter (voice actor)|Bob Carter]]}}
:A giant biomechanical dragon that existed in the Legends of Eldora for centuries. Once created by the Ancients, he helped them with protecting Eldora from outside threats eons ago until they decided to depart from space to search for new planets to colonize. He soon fell into a deep sleep, watching over the "New People" that flourished the planet after the Ancients' departure. After Masaki stumbled into Eldora, he assisted him with fighting against the One-Eyes until it was injured. Since then, it took refuge in Milagg Mountain until it was awakened once more by Freddie and Parviz to help Hiroto and May repel back Alus's attack against them. Reluctant to accept the BUILD DiVERS' help at first, Cuadorn agrees to ally with them after realizing their will to protect their friends in Eldora. Cuadorn's wing is later restored with some spare Gunpla parts provided by Parviz, with the beast later joining the BUILD DiVERS on their mission to rescue Masaki. He and Masaki later assist the BUILD DiVERS in destroying Alus' satellite cannon and, upon its destruction, destroy its mainframe to prevent Alus from retreating back to Eldora. After the final battle, Cuadorn is seen with some New Eldorans on Milagg Mountain which was relocated in the crater where Seguri City once stood.
:His new wing was built primarily using loose gunpla parts from the '''XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero''' from ''[[Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz]]'' and '''RX-104 Penelope''' from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway's Flash]]''.

===One-Eyes===
;{{nihongo|Masaki Shido|シドー・マサキ|Shidō Masaki}} / {{nihongo|Masked Man|仮面の男|Kamen no Otoko}} / {{nihongo|Sid|シド|Shido}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sōma Saitō]]|Griffin Burns}}
:A veteran S-Ranked Diver who May has been searching for since his disappearance. In real life, Masaki is bed-ridden at the city's general hospital after falling into a coma while logged in to GBN half a year prior to the events of the series. Later, it is revealed that he is brainwashed by the One-Eyes, becoming a masked man who served Alus and sided with them to terrorize Eldora. May recognized him as such despite his appearance in Eldora. However, his extended time in Eldora plus the brainwashing from the One-Eyes caused a serious deterioration on his real life self and his health condition. But due to the BUILD DiVERS' efforts, Masaki is freed from Alus' control and returns to his body back in the real world. With his sister's consent, Masaki returns to Eldora and teams up with Cuadorn again to assist the BUILD DiVERS in the final battle against Alus. He and Cuadorn later destroy the satellite cannon's mainframe to prevent Alus from returning to Eldora.
:Masaki uses the '''MSF-007TE Gundam Tertium''' as his main Gunpla, a heavily customized MSF-007 Gundam Mark-III from ''Z-MSV''. After being brainwashed by Alus, his Gunpla is converted into the '''MSF-007SS Gundam Seltsam''' equipped with the massive Seltsam Arm, which gives the Gunpla a demonic look while displaying massive strength. After Masaki is finally released from Alus's control, his Gunpla is converted into the '''Gundam Advanced Tertium''', now equipped with the Tertium Arms for space combat.

;{{nihongo|Alus|アルス|Arusu}}
:{{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|Austin Lee Matthews}}
:The series's main antagonist, an [[Artificial Intelligence]] entity residing in Eldora's moon which was created by the Ancients to protect the planet from outside threats. After the Ancients left the ravaged planet after a long war, Alus entered into a long slumber. Once he reawakened, he mistook the current inhabitants of Eldora for invaders and started attacking them, using his vast knowledge and resources. After having his orbital cannon and mobile units destroyed by the BUILD DiVERS, he angrily decided to invade GBN as a last resort to destroy them, the game and all Divers in it. In the end, he and his entire fleet, alongside his mobile suits, were defeated and sank down by the BUILD DiVERS, the Third Coalition of Volunteers and many other Divers in GBN, with Alus being deleted by both Hiroto and Riku, during which, he passes on after seeing a vision of two Ancient Eldorans resembling Eve and Sarah. After the final battle, his feelings and some of his data are reincarnated as an infant EL-Diver carrying a pendant resembling a Guard Eye, making him the 88th EL-Diver.
:Due to Alus's vast access to GBN through Masaki, he was able to create and build mechanical puppets based on Gunpla seen in GBN Online. In the second season, Alus develops the '''AGP-X1 Alus Core Gundam''', a more powerful replica of Hiroto Kuga's Core Gundam with more upgraded specifications and weaponry to fight the BUILD DiVERS. It utilizes a similar core-change gimmick like the original Core Gundam, allowing it to be equipped with several armors made by Alus himself.
*'''AGP-X1/E3 Alus Earthree Gundam''': An armor based on the Core Gundam's Earth Armor with the Uraven Gundam's Rifle. A variant of this is created when Alus steals the original Earth Armor from Hiroto during the final battle against him.  
*'''AGP-X1/NU Fake ν Gundam''': An armor based on the RX-93 ν Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack]]''. 
*'''Dubious Arche Gundam''': An armor based on the GNW-20000 Arche Gundam from ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]''. 
*'''Reverse Turn X''': An armor based on the CONCEPT-X 6-1-2 Turn X from ''[[Turn A Gundam]]''.
:The Nu, Arche and Turn X copies were first defeated by the BUILD DiVERS in their second attempt to destroy Alus's orbital cannon. Said copies, along with Alus's Earthree and Core Gundams, were all permanently destroyed by the same team assisted by a few other Divers in GBN during Alus's failed invasion on the game.

;{{nihongo|Guard Eyes|ガードアイ|Gādo Ai}}
:The Guard Eyes are unmanned machines that pilot the larger, One-Eyes mecha. Guard Eyes are usually sent alone as scouts prior to their attacks on Eldoran settlements. In the final episode, one of them remains under the care of Calico and Zabun after Alus's downfall. In ''Battlelogue'', said unit is revealed to be friendly with the people of Freddie's village who accepted it and is able to express emotions through the trembling of its iris and body language.

He was shocked and apologetic over Hiroto's loss before the battle with the Second Coalition of Volunteers, May having told him, Sarah, and his team about it. Only Sarah went with him when he went to reconcile and resolve things with Hiroto, considering he needed to offer to return her to him. However, Hiroto, remembering he already has May and having no real grudge against him, ended up thanking him and Sarah instead, knowing she has been in good hands all along and assured that Eve's loss was her own choice.

Due to Hiroto's nightmare in his back story and why she kept her Pet, Mol, close, the latter knew about Eve, but didn't know she was her sister.

After that, he is given a Gunpla as a body with the help from both Koichi Nanase and Tsukasa Shiba; however, the body he inhabits in the real world is not a Mobile Doll, but a Gunpla based on Hiroto's Core Gundam that Tetsu built after he saw it in the game, got impressed and told Tetsu how to build it.

:A mysterious blonde girl who befriended Hiroto a few years before the events of ''[[Gundam Build Divers]]''; this friendship between the two soon escalated into romance. Since her disappearance, Hiroto has been searching for her throughout the game. It is later revealed that she is the first to exist of the 87 EL-Divers and Sarah's older sister, although through the few years she spent together with Hiroto and those close to him she kept her EL-Diver identity a secret, and she was seemingly affiliated with Avalon. She had many personality traits and abilities that Sarah has and more, most notably having empathic senses for people and gunpla. Her existence also caused glitch bugs in the game, but small ones that were not that harmful. However, a few years later, she could no longer contain Sarah's bugs due to the backlash from the Break-Decal incident. Before the events of the battle between the original Build Divers and the second Coalition of Volunteers, she pleaded with Hiroto to mercifully sacrifice her using the Core Gundam and promise to her that he will still be the same caring person to help others in need, especially her sister, also mentioning that she would only pass on into GBN's Sea of Data. Despite his plead to stop her, she ended up a sacrifice right before Hiroto's eyes and her form faded out of existence. This incident traumatized Hiroto greatly, which led him to blame Riku and the Build Divers before ultimately sparing him in order to save Sarah's life and leaving Avalon to become a rouge diver, but kept a vow to never blame Sarah.

After clearing a difficult enemy by himself, Hiroto is approached by another player named Kazami, who wants to team up with him. However, Hiroto refuses since he's not interested in Gunpla battles. In the real world, it's revealed that Hiroto is in fact searching for a girl he had met in the game several years ago before the Build Divers existed, recoiling at their name. Meanwhile, his friend Hinata decides to apply for a job at the Gundam cafe near his local Gunpla store. When Hiroto logs back into the game, he's recruited by Kazami to investigate a secret mission that can take them to an unexplored part of the game. They along with two other players, May and Parviz, discover a dog-like NPC named Freddie requesting help, and they accept the mission. While the group initially has trouble fighting the enemies, Hiroto's intervention eventually secures their victory. The game then automatically requests to register their group as "BUILD DIVERS", with May quickly changing the name to "BUILD DiVERS" to differentiate themselves from the original BUILD DIVERS.

When Hiroto logs into GBN, he and the rest of the BUILD DiVERS are transported back to the secret Dimension, having been summoned by Freddie once again. Parviz theorizes that they have triggered a special story quest which requires them to complete a chain of missions in order to clear. Freddie leads the BUILD DiVERS to his village where his sister Maiya and their father, the village elder, live. The village elder explains that an army of hostile machines called the One-Eyes have recently appeared and begun attacking villages, with the villagers' only options being to flee or hope for help from the Resistance. The BUILD DiVERS agree to help protect the village from an expected One-Eyes attack, though Parviz has reservations due to his inexperience in Gunpla battle. Hiroto is only interested in continuing since he might find the girl he is looking for in the secret Dimension. Hiroto prepares a special training simulation to prepare for the mission, but they are only barely able to complete it after multiple tries. That evening, Hiroto is uncomfortable at the thought of being unable to fully protect the village, but receives reassurance from Hinata who reminds him that he always finds a way out of trouble.

Instead of splitting their team to defend two entrances simultaneously, the BUILD DiVERS decide to block one of the entrances and funnel the One-Eyes through the other. The villagers reluctantly accept the plan. It's later revealed that Hiroto's determination to protect the village stems from his meeting with the girl in his past, who told him that even though GBN's world is artificial, it's still something worth protecting. That night, the One-Eyes assault the village. The BUILD DiVERS are able to hold them back after a tough battle, but a One-Eyes unit is able to penetrate their defenses and attack the village. Hiroto is able to intercept the One-Eyes by switching to his Mars Armor, which is specialized in close combat, and destroys the One-Eyes while causing minimal collateral damage to the village. Afterwards, a Resistance squad led by Freddie and Maiya's older brother Jed arrives, and they are shocked at the presence of the BUILD DiVERS. Kazami remarks to Hiroto that they must have unlocked the next story mission. Meanwhile, a mysterious entity observes the BUILD DiVERS.

However, the base is protected with an impenetrable barrier and the only entrance is heavily guarded.

It is later revealed that even though the Valkylander is capable of flight, Parviz refuses to fly due to his fear of heights. On the day of the mission, Hiroto, Kazami, and May gather, but Parviz does not appear.

| ShortSummary        = On the day of the operation, Parviz is late to arrive. Lamenting his previous incompetence, he tells the other BUILD DiVERS that he wants to quit. Kazami opposes Parviz's decision while Hiroto and May remain indifferent. The team is summoned to the village before a final decision can be made, as Jed's team is ready to assault the One-Eyes base. Parviz still remains reluctant to participate, afraid of being a burden to the team, so Hiroto suggests a compromise after having a pep-talk with him and sharing a familiar philosophy about feelings and gunpla. Parviz will focus on protecting Jed and his team while rest of the BUILD DiVERS distract the base guard. The plan goes well initially, with the BUILD DiVERS managing to distract the advanced base guard while Jed's team infiltrates the base. Jed successfully demolishes the base, but the battle is further complicated with the appearance of a second base guard and a trio of flying One-Eyes units. Realizing everybody is in danger, Parviz finally overcomes his fear and transforms his Valkylander into its true form, its Dragon Fusion Mode. With Parviz's help, the BUILD DiVERS are able to eliminate all of the One-Eyes units. Meanwhile, another Resistance team is apparently wiped out by a mysterious Gundam.

| ShortSummary        = While Parviz experienced great growth in the previous mission, Kazami alone is resentful at his own inability to distinguish himself. Meanwhile, the BUILD DiVERS head for the Resistance base where they meet one of the Resistance leaders, Gorus. Gorus informs them that they want the BUILD DiVERS to help them move to a safer location for their base. Kazami is openly frustrated since that would mean there is little chance for any fighting where he can distinguish himself. Another Resistance leader, Muran, expresses his distrust of the BUILD DiVERS but both Jed and Freddie vouch for their loyalty. Gorus then warns them about the Seltsam, a unique One-Eyes unit that resembles a Gunpla. In order to prepare for the transport mission, Parviz suggests that they join a player vs player match to simulate the unpredictability of an ambush. They then encounter Kazami's old team led by Gojo, who are surprised Kazami is still playing GBN and are willing to challenge them. However, the BUILD DiVERS are easily defeated by Gojo's team when Kazami falls for a feint and charges out of position. Gojo observes that Kazami still hasn't changed, and that Hiroto doesn't appear to trust his own team due to his lack of communication with them. Hiroto then visits Hinata, who points out to him that people don't like to be ignored, even if the attention they get can be negative.

Hiroto wonders why he is where he is and mentions the girl in his past name, which is "Eve".  Suddenly, the One-Eyes attack the Resistance base, forcing the Resistance to evacuate early. Muran takes Freddie in his truck, but separates from the main convoy in an attempt to elude the One-Eyes. Kazami, unaware Freddie is with Muran, considers leaving Muran to his fate due to his dislike of him. However, remembering Gojo's words to him, Kazami orders Hiroto to protect Muran. While Hiroto save Freddie and Muran, the rest of the BUILD DiVERS work to protect the convoy. Kazami is quickly overwhelmed by the One-Eyes and his Gunpla is critically damaged. At his lowest point, Kazami remembers a lesson from his hero, Captain Zeon, telling him that he should follow his own passion for Gunpla in his heart. Inspired, Kazami decides to keep fighting just as Hiroto returns, and with his help, Kazami is able to score his first destruction point. However, their victory is short lived when the Seltsam arrives, destroys the abandoned Resistance base, and then attacks the BUILD DiVERS, who are heavily outmatched and are barely able to escape. When they rendezvous with the Resistance, they are entrusted with a mysterious locket by Muran, which according to him is supposed to be the key to turning the tide against the One-Eyes.

Despite Magee's prodding, May claims that the BUILD DiVERS really aren't a team in the traditional sense, but admits that she may find what she's looking for if she stays with them. The BUILD DiVERS then meet up for the next stage in the story mission. They arrive at the Resistance's new headquarters at the island city of Seguri, which is protected by an energy shield. The commander of the Resistance, Abiree, welcomes them while Gorus tells them their next mission is to engage an undersea monster so the Resistance can scout the Silver Tower, an important One-Eyes stronghold. Parviz suggests they take the Grand Dive Challenge to practice underwater combat. Meanwhile, May asks Hiroto what his motivation is, and he merely tells her he is searching for something that can't be found. The next day, the BUILD DiVERS start the Grand Dive Challenge, where they must get a Haro past team Granada Bleu while underwater. Kazami and Parviz are easily eliminated and Hiroto is only able to clear the challenge by using his Mercuone armor and leaving May behind as a decoy. Seeing how the rest of the team aren't suited for underwater battle, Hiroto decides to take on the story mission by himself. May concedes it is the most efficient plan, but asks if it's really enough, which reminds Hiroto of a similar question that Eve asked him in the past, realizing she could be an EL-Diver.

Meanwhile, Hinata decides to investigate what caused Hiroto to become so antisocial, and connects the timing of his attitude change to the day of the Second Coalition of Volunteers' battle. Meanwhile, Hiroto has difficulty fighting the One-Eyes unit and is knocked unconscious, where he has a flashback of when he attempted to fight a rogue boss by himself. While successful, the entire surrounding city was destroyed in the battle. May rescues Hiroto and advises that they all work as a team to defeat the One-Eyes unit. Together, they are able to pull the One-Eyes out of the water with a harpoon and destroy it in a combined attack. Hiroto thanks everyone for the support and apologizes for any misudertandings he may have caused, saving May for last.  From May's response, Hiroto is reminded of how Eve in his past pointed out that he should fight for someone he cares about, not for the sake of fighting. Suddenly, the Seltsam attacks and corners Hiroto, but is saved again by May, who reveals that she is an EL-Diver, with his hunch about her being right.

In a flash back he is shown to have been in Avalon and might have been the friend that Kyoya was referring to when Kyoya first met Riku and was about to shoot Riku's 00 Sky down with a mystery weapon.

She introduces them to Masaki Shidoh, a veteran Diver who has been in a coma for six months. There is no record of him logging out of GBN, implying that his mind is still connected in the system. May also reveals that he is the pilot of the Seltsam and shows them a picture of him with other Eldorans. In addition, the GBN administrators confirmed to May that Eldora is not part of the game. The other BUILD DiVERS come to the realization that Eldora is not part of GBN, but a real planet, and that they were risking their lives in a real war. With this revelation, Kazami and Parviz lose their resolve to keep fighting with May and she bids farewell to them.

Freddie explains that all along, the BUILD DiVERS were being summoned by the "Shining Sand", which is only found at the temple and would construct their bodies and Gunpla, basically like giant molding machine. However, Alus' satellite attack damaged the temple and blew away all the Shining Sand. They return to the village where they encounter Muran, who managed to escape the destruction of Seguri. Muran points the BUILD DiVERS to three other temples they may find more Shining Sand at. Hiroto correctly guesses that Muran knew Masaki and his initial distrust of the BUILD DiVERS stems from Masaki's apparent betrayal. Hiroto and May head to the northern temple, Kazami and Maiya head to the southern temple, and Parviz, Freddie, and Muran head to the eastern temple. Hiroto and May defeat a trio of upgraded One-Eyes units but find no Shining Sand at the northern temple. Hiroto observes that the One-Eyes actively avoid damaging the temples. Kazami feels guilty for being partially responsible for Jed's death, and is conflicted on whether to tell Maiya or not. Muran explains to Parviz and Freddie that the eastern temple actually floats in the sky and serves as the home of the sacred beast Cuadorn, which is supposed to be Eldora's protector. Muran provides a hot air balloon to Parviz and Freddie and instructs them to meet Cuadorn personally. Meanwhile, Masaki appears to be going berserk as he begins attacking One-Eyes units.

Hiroto and May then arrive, where they encounter Stola and Resistance remnants, who are protecting a nearby village. However, the village is discovered by a One-Eyes scout, meaning an attack will arrive in three days. Since the village is full of refugees who are in no condition to evacuate, Hiroto, May, and Kazami head for the eastern temple but are ambushed by a One-Eyes unit controlled directly by Alus, which has also copied the Core Change system Hiroto's Gunpla uses. Meanwhile, Parviz and Freddie ride the balloon and manage to reach the eastern temple which is still intact and full of Shining Sand. They also meet Cuadorn, who Parviz notices is visibly damaged. Cuadorn summons a lightning storm that forces Alus to withdraw and then lands the eastern temple, allowing the rest of the BUILD DiVERS and Muran to meet him as well. In the real world, Hinata meets her senior classmate Mizuki Shidoh, who is also Masaki's sister. Back at the eastern temple, even though Cuadorn acknowledges he owes a debt to the "people of the Gunpla", he asks the BUILD DiVERS to leave.

Ages later, Alus awakened and believed that the current inhabitants of Eldora are intruders, so it started attacking them. In response, Cuadorn summoned Masaki to assist him against Alus, and Alus accessed GBN's data to create the One-Eyes' mobile suits to counter them, before capturing and brainwashing Masaki. Cuadorn also reveals that the Shining Sand was part of a system the Ancients originally developed to digitally transfer themselves back to Eldora, which has somehow proved compatible with GBN. Despite learning the truth, the BUILD DiVERS refuse to leave and reaffirm their will to protect their friends on Eldora, convincing Cuadorn to accept their help. They send Muran to instruct the villagers to take refuge at the ancient ruins, which the One-Eyes units will not attack, while making plans to confront Alus before he fires his satellite cannon again. The BUILD DiVERS decide to return to Earth to prepare and promise to return to Eldora in two days. The team make preparations with Hiroto taking out a sealed armor, the Uranus armor, inspired by a pep-talk from his father.

When Kazami spots Freddie and Stola run around the battlefield while helping a civilian to escape, he jumps in to protect them and Hiroto takes advantage of the situation to pinpoint Alus' location and launch a counterattack, while the other BUILD DiVERS keep protecting the refugees.

| ShortSummary        = Several years ago, when GBN was about to take over Gunpla Battle completely, Hiroto, answering to a request from his friends, participated in a Gunpla Duel piloting a hastily built Speed Grade RX-78-2 Gundam against a veteran player using a Perfect Grade GAT-X105 Strike Gundam. Despite the huge disadvantage, Hiroto won by utilising the parts of other Gunpla destroyed by the enemy. This inspired him to develop the Core Gundam, but during his first time piloting it in GBN, the Gunpla malfunctioned and he made a forced landing. In the occasion, he met Eve and the two became close. Their adventures began when Hiroto decided to make a gunpla that could customize parts while in battle using armor and Eve would take him to explore landscapes and scenery to inspire his sense of aesthetics. They kept doing so including doing missions to develop additional armors for the Core Gundam, thus creating the core-change gimmick, and the Planets System. One night Hiroto had a nightmare of Eve's highly possible fate, where he saw a slightly older version of Eve absorbing the bugs from Sarah, causing Eve much pain. Not long afterwards, he joined a Force by her suggestion and became a member of Avalon, by Kyoya's invitation when he stumbled across Hiroto training out in the open and was amazed by his Gunpla's gimmick and his skills in handling it. Both Hiroto and Eve came closer together in GBN, with Hiroto giving Eve an earring and the two taking a memorial photograph. A few years went by where they made many happy memories together, until one day when Eve requested Hiroto to erase her...

Hiroto, despite his pleas to Eve against dying, reluctantly allowed his Core Gundam to give her a fatal shot remotely by borrowing her EL-Diver power.   As she was fading, Eve asked Hiroto to always be someone who helps others, and to help EL-Divers like her, espeically her little sister, Sarah, who was captured by Avalon, his own force, the day after. On the night Riku called out to Sarah and right after he left, it's revealed that Sarah and Hiroto spotted each other briefly before she went back inside, with Hiroto unaware the way that was found to save Sarah involved something Eve would have rejected. Hiroto later joined the Second Coalition of Volunteers battle against the original Build Divers right when Hyakki joined in for third party reasons. Hiroto, completely withstanding the giant impact, aims and locks on Riku. Just when he was about to snipe Riku's battered Gundam 00 Sky, he remembered his promise to Eve and her last words, and thus refrained, redirecting his shot into the ground. After telling the whole story to his friends, Hiroto voices his regret over not doing his best to help others like he promised to Eve, and is comforted by May, who encourages him to cry freely. Hiroto later apologizes to Freddie for pretending that he and the others were the real Build Divers. Freddie, on the other hand, reassures Hiroto that he kept his promise to Eve by helping his people against the One-Eyes and is happy for meeting them. May reminds Hiroto that Sarah and all the other EL-Divers could flourish in GBN because of his choice; upon hearing May, Hiroto realises he was not only keeping his promise to Eve, but that all of his actions benefited everyone one way or another. Elsewhere, a deranged Masaki fights his brainwashing while defending the Eldorans against the One Eyes' forces while his health back in the real world begins to decline.

The BUILD DiVERS decide to face Masaki once more in order to help him fully break away from Alus' control.

| ShortSummary        = Hiroto's group is visited by Masaki, who apologizes to them for all the trouble he caused under Alus' control, and thanks them for rescuing him, while explaining that the satellite cannon was damaged during their previous fight there, thus it will take longer for it to become fully operational again. Mizuki appears soon after and asks them to not have her brother involved with their battle anymore. At Eldora, the BUILD DiVERS discuss ways to reach the moon without using the space elevator, when May points out that Alus should not be destroyed, given that he is simply following his programming and does not know any better. The group agrees to try to stop Alus without destroying him, despite Muran's reservations. While the team develops new equipment for the upcoming battle in space, May introduces the others to Magee, who had publicized the BUILD DiVERS' exploits which has garnered them a huge amount of public sympathy, praise, and support within GBN. With many Forces volunteering to help the BUILD DiVERS train for their upcoming battle against Alus, Magee arranges a special event for the BUILD DiVERS to face off against GBN's most elite divers, including members from Avalon and suggests the original Build Divers should be a part of it as well.

| ShortSummary        = As the BUILD DiVERS prepare for their training match in the form of an updated Lotus Challenge, Hiroto briefly reunites with his former Avalon forcemates and they are formally introduced to the original Build Divers. The BUILD DiVERS proceed with the challenge with the additional condition that they will instantly fail if even one of them is shot down. During the Lotus Challenge, the BUILD DiVERS face off against not only Riku and the Build Divers, but also Rommel and his 7th Panzer Division, Ogre and Hyakki, and Kyouya and Avalon. Meanwhile, Mizuki watches Kazami's records of the BUILD DiVERS' exploits on Eldora, and comes to understand Masaki's plight a little more. She convinces the hospital to release Masaki early and gives him her blessing to help the BUILD DiVERS on the condition he return home safely. Back in GBN, on their 40th try, the BUILD DiVERS are finally able to break through the opposition and beat the Lotus Challenge after unlocking their team's Special Move, with everyone surprised at seeing something they haven't seen since the First Coalition of Volunteers Battle. The participants celebrate afterwards, with it being implied that Rommel is actually Captain Zeon. May, knowing deep down Hiroto is still not quite comfortable, arranges for Hiroto to meet Riku and Sarah privately, having just told the Build Divers about Eve and what happened behind the scenes and the true nature of how more EL-Divers got discovered, with Kyoya bringing logs and old photos since she knows that Hiroto knows they weren't deleted. Riku desperately apologizes to Hiroto, but Hiroto insists that he holds no grudge against Riku and his team, also telling them it was Eve's wish for Sarah's survival, to ensure that they would both be happy, and help GBN flourish. Hiroto thanks them for helping him keep his promise, and both Riku and Sarah accept him as a part of the Build Divers family. The two aces of both teams promise to continue having Gunpla battles and rise back up together by trading each other's wishes as Hiroto gains closure. After returning to the real world, Hiroto has a talk with Hinata, where they promise to support each other in their own ways as Hiroto prepares to return to Eldora and Hinata prepares for an important bow ritual.

| ShortSummary        = Both Hiroto and Hinata head out to take on their own challenges. Hinata prepares for her bow ceremony, with Mizuki and Hiroto's parents present to cheer her on. Meanwhile, Hiroto and the BUILD DiVERS return to Eldora, with Masaki unexpectedly joining them. While the Resistance stages a diversionary attack on the Silver Tower, Hiroto uses his new Nepteight Gundam to carry the BUILD DiVERS into orbit, catching Alus off guard. The BUILD DiVERS clash with the One-Eyes forces as Masaki and Cuadorn join in to help. All the while, Kazami is live-streaming the battle so that the general public can spectate it as well, including Mizuki and Hiroto's parents. The BUILD DiVERS are eventually able to break through the One-Eyes' forces and contribute parts of their own Gunpla to Hiroto to form the Re:Rising Gundam, which is what was used to defeat the Eldoran style Lotus Challenge. With his new Gundam, Hiroto is able to destroy Alus' orbital cannon while at the same time back on Earth, Hinata hits her target and succeeds in completing the bow ritual. Realizing that the Divers will continue to interfere with his plans, Alus angrily decides to directly destroy them all by forcefully uploading himself and his massive warfleet into GBN, intent on destroying the game. However, he is immediately met by the Third Coalition of Volunteers, who are all lying in wait at Avalon's force nest.

| ShortSummary        = The Third Coalition of Volunteers fight Alus' forces, later joined by the BUILD DiVERS, while Cuadorn and Masaki stay behind at Eldora to destroy the Satellite Cannon's mainframe and prevent Alus from returning. Back in GBN, Hiroto attempts to form the Earthree Gundam but Alus steals the Earth Armor and equips it onto one of his own Gundams instead. In response, Hiroto equips his Core Gundam II with parts from the other armors at his disposal to fight back. Surprised by the Volunteers' fierce resistance, Alus launches an attack to take down GBN's systems, but is prevented when the Game Master and Miss Tori arrive to install a security patch and revert the damage. After his forces are almost destroyed by the Divers with more of them joining the battle, Alus launches one final desperate attack to destroy GBN, but is stopped by Sarah, May, and Eve's spirit before being ultimately defeated by Riku and Hiroto. After the battle, Alus's feelings reincarnate into a new infant EL-Diver that May takes in, during which, Hiroto discovers Eve's earring reincarnated as a pendant and was in May's possession all along, realizing some of Eve's lost data was also involved in May's creation. In a real-world meeting, Miss Tori points out that Alus' energy signature is similar to some issues that occurred in GBN during its development, implying that it was actually the Ancient Eldorans' last piece of dormant data entering the system, which could have been the final triggering factor that enabled life to be born in GBN. Some time later, Masaki is finally discharged from hospital, and the BUILD DiVERS, with Hinata as their newest member, return to Eldora to help the New Eldorans rebuild.
