'''Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations''' ('''AIOps''') is a practice that uses [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] to enhance and automate various aspects of IT operations. It is designed to optimize IT environments by analyzing large volumes of data generated by complex IT systems, including system logs, performance metrics, and network data. AIOps aims to streamline IT workflows, predict potential issues, automate incident response, and ultimately improve the performance and efficiency of enterprise IT environments.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |last=China |first=Chrystal R. |date=August 12, 2024 |title=AIOps vs. MLOps: Harnessing big data for "smarter" ITOPs |url=https://www.ibm.com/blog/aiops-vs-mlops/ |access-date=August 19, 2024 |website=[[IBM]]}}</ref>
==Definition==
The term refers to the multi-layered complex technology platforms which enhance and automate IT operations by using machine learning and analytics to analyze the large amounts of data collected from various ITOps devices and tools, automatically identifying and responding to issues in real-time.{{Cn|date=August 2024}}

With AIOps, you must shift from isolated IT data to aggregated observational data (e.g., job logs and monitoring systems) and interaction data (such as ticketing, events, or incident records) within a big data platform.{{Cn|date=August 2024}}

AIOps then applies machine learning and analytics to this data. The result is continuous visibility, which, combined with the implementation of automation, can lead to ongoing improvements. s.{{Cn|date=August 2024}}

AIOps connects three IT disciplines—automation, service management, and performance management—to achieve continuous visibility and improvement. This new approach in modern, accelerated, and hyperscaled IT environments leverages advances in machine learning and big data to overcome previous limitations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Was ist AIOps?

==Keys==
AI can optimize [[IT]] operations in five key ways: First, intelligent monitoring powered by AI helps identify potential issues before they cause outages, improving metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) by 15-20%. Second, performance data analysis and insights enable quick decision-making by ingesting and analyzing large data sets in real time. Third, AI-driven automated infrastructure optimization efficiently allocates resources and reduces cloud costs. Fourth, enhanced IT service management reduces critical incidents by over 50% through AI-driven end-to-end service management. Lastly, intelligent task automation accelerates problem resolution and automates remedial actions with minimal human intervention.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 14, 2024 |title=AIOps: The Secret Engine Behind Next-Gen IT Performance |url=https://www.wavestone.com/en/insight/aiops-the-secret-engine-behind-next-gen-it-performance/ |access-date=August 19, 2024 |website=Wavestone}}</ref>
==AIOPS vs. MLOps==
AIOps tools use big data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and [[predictive analytics]] to detect anomalies, correlate events, and provide proactive insights. This automation reduces the burden on IT teams, allowing them to focus on strategic tasks rather than routine operational issues. AIOps is widely used by IT operations teams, [[DevOps]], network administrators, and [[IT service management]] (ITSM) teams to enhance visibility and enable quicker incident resolution in hybrid cloud environments, data centers, and other IT infrastructures.<ref name="auto"/>

In contrast to [[MLOps]] (Machine Learning Operations), which focuses on the lifecycle management and operational aspects of machine learning models, AIOps focuses on optimizing IT operations using a variety of analytics and AI-driven techniques. While both disciplines rely on AI and data-driven methods, AIOps primarily targets IT operations, whereas MLOps is concerned with the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Maffeo |first=Lauren |date=February 25, 2021 |title=AIOps vs. MLOps: What's the difference? &#124; Opensource.com |url=https://opensource.com/article/21/2/aiops-vs-mlops |access-date=August 19, 2024 |website=OpenSource}}</ref>
