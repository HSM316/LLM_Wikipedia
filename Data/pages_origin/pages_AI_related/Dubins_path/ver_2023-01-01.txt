In [[geometry]], the term '''Dubins path''' typically refers to the shortest curve that connects two points in the two-dimensional [[Euclidean plane]] (i.e. ''x-y'' plane) with a constraint on the [[curvature]] of the path and with prescribed initial and terminal [[tangents]] to the path, and an assumption that the vehicle traveling the path can only travel forward. If the vehicle can also travel in reverse, then the path follows the Reeds–Shepp curve.<ref>{{cite journal

In other words, the shortest path will be made by joining circular arcs of maximum curvature and straight lines.

The Dubins path is commonly used in the fields of [[robotics]] and [[control theory]] as a way to plan paths for wheeled robots, airplanes and underwater vehicles. There are simple geometric<ref>{{cite report|last=Anisi|first=David|title=Optimal Motion Control of a Ground Vehicle|date=July 2003|publisher=Swedish Research Defence Agency|id=1650-1942|url=https://people.kth.se/~anisi/articles/foi-r-0961-se.pdf}}</ref> and analytical methods<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Bui|first1=Xuan-Nam |last2=Boissonnat|first2=J.-D.|author-link2=Jean-Daniel Boissonnat |last3=Soueres |first3=P. |last4=Laumond |first4=J.-P. |title=Shortest Path Synthesis for Dubins Non-Holonomic Robot|volume=1|book-title=IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation|date=May 1994|pages=2–7|location=San Diego, CA|doi=10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351019}}</ref> to compute the optimal path.

For example, in the case of a wheeled robot, a simple kinematic car model (also known as Dubins' car) for the systems is:
<math display=block>
\begin{align}
\dot x &= V \cos (\theta) \\
\dot y &= V \sin (\theta) \\
\dot \theta &= u
\end{align}
</math>
where <math>(x,y)</math> is the car's position, <math>\theta</math> is the heading, the car is moving at a constant speed <math> V </math>, and the turn rate control <math> u </math> is bounded. In this case the maximum turning rate corresponds to some minimum [[turning radius]] (and equivalently maximum curvature). The prescribed initial and terminal tangents correspond to initial and terminal [[Direction (geometry)|headings]]. The Dubins' path gives the shortest path joining two oriented points that is feasible for the wheeled-robot model.

The optimal path type can be described using an analogy with cars of making a 'right turn (R)' , 'left turn (L)' or driving 'straight (S).' An optimal path will always be at least one of the six types: RSR, RSL, LSR, LSL, RLR, LRL. For example, consider that for some given initial and final positions and tangents, the optimal path is shown to be of the type 'RSR.' Then this corresponds to a right-turn arc (R) followed by a straight line segment (S) followed by another right-turn arc (R). Moving along each segment in this sequence for the appropriate length will form the shortest curve that joins a starting point A to a terminal point B with the desired tangents at each endpoint and that does not exceed the given curvature. <gallery>

==Dubins Interval Problem==
Dubins interval problem is a key variant of the Dubins path problem, where an interval of heading directions are specified at the initial and terminal points. The tangent direction of the path at initial and final points are constrained to lie within the specified intervals. One could solve this using geometrical analysis,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manyam|first1=Satyanarayana|last2=Rathinam|first2=Sivakumar|title=On Tightly Bounding the Dubins Traveling Salesman's Optimum|journal=Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control|volume=140|issue=7|pages=071013|date=2016|arxiv=1506.08752|doi=10.1115/1.4039099|s2cid=16191780 }}</ref> or using Pontryagin's minimum principle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manyam | first1=Satyanarayana G. | last2=Rathinam | first2=Sivakumar | last3=Casbeer | first3=David | last4=Garcia | first4=Eloy |title=Tightly Bounding the Shortest Dubins Paths Through a Sequence of Points|year=2017|journal=Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems|volume=88|issue=2–4|pages=495–511|doi=10.1007/s10846-016-0459-4|doi-access=free|s2cid=30943273 }}</ref>
