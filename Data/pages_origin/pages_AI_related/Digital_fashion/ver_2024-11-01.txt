'''Digital Fashion''' is a field of [[fashion design]] that relies on [[3D computer graphics|3D software]] or [[artificial intelligence]] to produce hyper-realistic, data-intensive digital 3D garment simulations that are digital-only products or digital models for physical products.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17543266.2021.1991005 | doi=10.1080/17543266.2021.1991005 | title='Just hit a button!' – fashion 4.0 designers as cyborgs, experimenting and designing with generative algorithms | date=2022 | last1=Särmäkari | first1=Natalia | last2=Vänskä | first2=Annamari | journal=International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=211–220 }}</ref> Digital garments can be worn and presented in virtual environments, social media, online gaming, [[virtual reality]] (VR), and [[augmented reality]] (AR) platforms. <ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Digital Fashion: The Way Forward for Sustainability? |url=https://www.textileconsult.co.uk/2023/07/31/digital-fashion-the-way-forward-for-sustainability/ |access-date=May 11, 2024 |website=Textile Consult|date=31 July 2023 }}</ref> The field contributes to the development of a more sustainable future for the fashion industry It has often been praised as an answer to ethical and creative concerns of traditional fashion by promoting innovation, reducing waste, and encouraging conscious consumption.<ref name=":4" />

Digital fashion is also the interplay between [[digital electronics|digital technology]] and couture. [[Artificial intelligence|Human AI]] is an intersection of technology and human representation. Where human value is emphasized and enhanced by technology and the possibilities of discovering design. [[Information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) have been deeply integrated both into the [[fashion industry]], as well as within the experience of clients and prospects. Such interplay has happened at three main levels.
# ICTs are used to design and produce fashion products, while also the industry organization leverages onto digital technologies.
# ICTs impact marketing, distribution and sales.
# ICTs are extensively used in communication activities with all relevant stakeholders, and contribute to co-create the fashion world.
The fashion industry in general has paved the way for digital fashion to be introduced with more technology being in the industry like virtual dressing rooms and the [[gamification]] of the fashion industry. Digital fashion is also seen in many different online fashion retail websites. It may be seen on common websites you shop on. This evolution in the fashion industry has called for more education and research of digital fashion which will also be discussed in this article'''.'''

== Design, production, and organization ==
Among the many applications available to fashion designers to model the fusion of creativity with digital avenues, the [[Digital textile printing|Digital Textile Printing]] can be mentioned here.

===Digital textile printing===
Digital textile printing has brought together the worlds of fashion, technology, art, chemistry, and printing to produce a new process for printing textiles on clothing.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Moltchanova |first=Julia |date=23 June 2011 |title=Digital Textile Printing |url=https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/33821/DTP_JMoltchanova.pdf?...1 |journal=Theseus.fi |via=Metropolia}}</ref>

Digital printing is a process in which prints are directly applied to [[Textile|fabrics]] with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing [[Textile|textile waste.]] The main advantage of digital printing is the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fashion-marketer.com/2014/06/12/digital_printing/ |title=Fashion Marketer |access-date=2014-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210424/http://fashion-marketer.com/2014/06/12/digital_printing/ |archive-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Digital Textile printing also offers other benefits such fast printing speeds that help the time and space needed to print different patterns on garments of choice.<ref name=":2" />

== Marketing, distribution, and sales ==
While all digital channels can be used in order to market and sell fashion completely online ([[eCommerce]]), they usually are implemented in connection with offline channels (so-called "[[Omnichannel|omni-channel]]"). Here, [[Virtual reality|virtual]] and [[augmented reality]] is playing a crucial role.

The fashion industry has faced its own problems [[environmental impact of fashion|including pollution and fabric waste]], which has resulted in a shift to more sustainable methods like digital fashion. The industry is also constantly being intertwined with digital media and has allowed for the use of digital tools within the business itself and with consumers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Noris|first1=Alice|last2=Nobile|first2=Tekila Harley|last3=Kalbaska|first3=Nadzeya|last4=Cantoni|first4=Lorenzo|date=2021-01-02|title=Digital Fashion: A systematic literature review. A perspective on marketing and communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20932685.2020.1835522|journal=Journal of Global Fashion Marketing|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=32–46|doi=10.1080/20932685.2020.1835522|s2cid=230600615 |issn=2093-2685}}</ref> Two of the ways digital fashion is utilized with consumers is through [[virtual dressing room]]s and virtual cosmetic counters.

Prospects and clients can use ICTs - own computers, tablets and smartphones - to virtually simulate fitting rooms and cosmetics counters, and see how they look in specific outfits and makeup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/new-tech-lets-retailers-give-head-to-toe-virtual-makeovers/|title=New tech lets retailers give head-to-toe virtual makeovers|date=October 3, 2011|website=www.retailcustomerexperience.com}}</ref> Customers can give any look and decide on what to suits and buy products.

Oftentimes beauty retailers will feature virtual fitting rooms to allow users to experience the look of their product before committing to a purchase. Some examples are color contact retailers Freshlook, which allows users to simulate contact lens wear in their color contacts studio before purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshlookcontacts.com/color-studio/|title=Freshlook ® Color Studio &#124; freshlookcontactscom|website=www.freshlookcontacts.com}}</ref> Colorful Eyes also offers a virtual color contact lens try on room.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://colorfuleyes.org/eye-color-changer/|title=Eye Color Changer &#124; Upload Your Pic &#124; Try On Eye Colors|date=20 September 2016 }}</ref> 

===Virtual dressing room===
A [[virtual dressing room]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=LA Times on virtual dressing room |url=https://www.stylar.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715034511/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/13/business/la-fi-virtual-dressing-room-20120714 |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> (also often referred to as virtual fitting room and virtual changing room although they do perform different functions) is the online equivalent of the near-ubiquitous in-store [[changing room]] – that is, it enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.

Fashion retailer [[Topshop]] installed a [[Kinect]]-powered virtual fitting room at its [[Moscow]] store. Created by AR Door, the Augmented Fitting Room system overlays 3D augmented reality clothes on the customer. Simple gestures and on-screen buttons let users "try on" different outfits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kinect-dressing-room_n_860740|title=WATCH: Ladies' Virtual Dressing Room Is Powered By Kinect|first=Thomas|last=Houston|date=May 12, 2011|website=HuffPost}}</ref> However, the high variability of virtual fit platforms to predict consumer clothes sizes called into question the accuracy of these systems in their current form.<ref name=OVF_1>{{cite book| chapter=Online Virtual Fit Is Not Yet Fit For Purpose: An Analysis Of Fashion e-Commerce Interfaces| last1=Januszkiewicz|first1=M.|last2=Parker|first2=C.J.|last3=Hayes|first3=S.G.|last4=Gill|first4=S.| title=Proceedings of 3DBODY.TECH 2017 - 8th International Conference and Exhibition on 3D Body Scanning and Processing Technologies, Montreal QC, Canada, 11-12 Oct. 2017| chapter-url=https://www.3dbody.tech/cap/papers/2017/17210januszkiewicz.pdf| publisher=3DBODY.TECH| date=October 2017| pages=210–217| access-date=11 January 2024| doi=10.15221/17.210| isbn=978-3-033-06436-2}}</ref>

=== Communication and experience co-creation ===
Fashion is also a matter of socially negotiating what is "in" or "out", fashionable or not. In other words, fashion items do not only play on the economic market of physical goods, but also - and sometimes even more importantly - on the semiotic market of the production of social tastes and customs.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trukhan |first=Tatiana |date=2023-05-22 |title=QR codes on clothing |url=https://phygitalnew.com/industries/qr-codes-in-fashion/ |access-date=2023-09-08 |website=PG |language=en}}</ref> Thanks to social media, and to all services offered by the so-called [[Web 2.0|web2.0]], laypeople can contribute to co-create the fashion world, shaping tastes, customs, and fashion-related values.

Social media in general has catapulted the impact fashion has on our everyday lives and values. Fashion has taken a central role is mass production and is constantly evolving due to the ever-lasting digital transformation.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Noris |first1=Alice |last2=Nobile |first2=Tekila Harley |last3=Kalbaska |first3=Nadzeya |last4=Cantoni |first4=Lorenzo |date=2021-01-02 |title=Digital Fashion: A systematic literature review. A perspective on marketing and communication |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20932685.2020.1835522 |journal=Journal of Global Fashion Marketing |language=en |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=32–46 |doi=10.1080/20932685.2020.1835522 |s2cid=230600615 |issn=2093-2685}}</ref>

Social media has also helped evolved to a point where not only can brands reach consumers, but consumers can reach brands as well. [[TikTok]] for example started a trend in 2020 with #GucciModelChallenge.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dazed |date=2020-08-25 |title=Teens are turning themselves into Gucci models on TikTok |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/50237/1/tiktok-gucci-model-fashion-challenge-new-trend-alessandro-michele |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=Dazed |language=en}}</ref> This creates a space where the brand is gaining awareness from their consumers in the ever-changing [[Digital Age|digital age]].

=== Gamification ===
[[File:United Colors Fall 2015 Runway Show.png|thumb|Virtual runway show in the game [[Second Life]]|350x350px]]
[[Video game|Gaming]] has played an important role in fostering digital aspects of the fashion world, first beginning with dress up games that used [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] and allowed players to select garments. Nevertheless, it seems it will now move on to the real world and start using avatars of real people.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Becca|date=2020-11-25|title=Will Video Games Replace the Fashion Show?|url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/a33959906/gaming-fashion-animal-crossing-louis-vuitton-moschino/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=CR Fashion Book|language=en-US}}</ref>

Garments from luxurious brands have been copied and adapted into the aesthetics of games such as the quarantine-released [[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]] and [[The Sims]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Iluyomade|first=Simi|date=2020-04-22|title=How The Sims Became a Hub for Digital Fashion|url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/a32186609/the-sims-game-custom-fashion-mugler-saint-laurent/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=CR Fashion Book|language=en-US}}</ref> As to the former, users found themselves filled with time during the COVID-19 [[Quarantine|confinement]] and recreated outfits from a great variety of fashion brands, including [[Chanel]], [[Gucci]] and [[Versace]]. Moreover, it became a platform for users to showcase their costume designs.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-21|title='It's a way to live out fantasies': how Animal Crossing became fashion's new catwalk|url=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/21/its-a-way-to-live-out-fantasies-how-animal-crossing-became-fashions-new-catwalk|access-date=2020-12-19|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

In April 2019, [[Moschino]] collaborated with simulation game The Sims in a capsule collection that featured signature [[Jeremy Scott]] garments.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Arts|first=Electronic|date=2019-04-16|title=Introducing Moschino x The Sims|url=https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/moschino-collection?setLocale=en-us|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Electronic Arts Inc.|language=en}}</ref> The collection was made available to shop and the campaign was set against the backdrop of a Sims-like atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shaw|first=Sophie|date=2019-04-15|title=Virtual and Reality Merge in Moschino X The Sims Capsule Collection|url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/a27149290/moschino-the-sims-capsule-collection/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=CR Fashion Book|language=en-US}}</ref> Furthermore, in May 2019, Nike partnered up with [[Fortnite]] to include their iconic [[Air Jordan|Jordan]] sneakers. In similar fashion, in May 2020, [[Marc Jacobs]] designed 6 of the brand's favorite looks for Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons in a partnership with Instagram user [https://www.instagram.com/AnimalCrossingFashionArchive/ @AnimalCrossingFashionArchive].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dazed|date=2020-05-05|title=Marc Jacobs drops six cute looks on Animal Crossing|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/49114/1/marc-jacobs-drops-six-cute-looks-animal-crossing-valentino-instagram|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Dazed|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Marc Jacobs (@marcjacobs) posted on Instagram • May 2, 2020 at 6:16pm UTC|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sfj81jrOp/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/B_sfj81jrOp |archive-date=2021-12-24 |url-access=registration|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Instagram|language=en}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They were made available to download. 

Similarly the other luxury brands mentioned, [[Louis Vuitton]] partnered with game [[League of Legends]] to create skins for characters within the game.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nguyen |first=Terry |date=2022-01-21 |title=What's the point of digital clothes? |url=https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22893254/digital-fashion-metaverse-real-clothes |access-date=2022-04-21 |website=Vox |language=en}}</ref> Digital fashion in various different video games allow users to express themselves beyond their avatar and combine the self-expression of fashion into the digital gaming realm.

== Digital fashion education and research ==
Nowadays, the fashion industry needs experts in digital fashion, equipped with the above-sketched knowledge and competences. Several [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and [[Master's degree|Master]] programs in Fashion have in recent years integrated Digital Fashion courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalfashion.ch/list-of-masters/|title=Master Programmes {{!}} Digital Fashion Communication Research|website=digitalfashion.ch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref>

An example is [[Ravensbourne University London|Ravensbourne University]]'s 'Digital Technology for Fashion Pathway,' launching October 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/ravensbourne-university-london-digital-technology-for-fashion-course-1234786838|title=Ravensbourne To Launch Digital Technology for Fashion Course|date=24 March 2021 |language=en-UK|access-date=2021-03-24}}</ref> This new pathway will offer BA Fashion students the option to specialise in digital fashion with a focus on emerging technologies within this field. The Ravensbourne BA Fashion Class of 2020 paved the way for this new offering by collaborating with the gaming department and launching a digital fashion game live and in partnership with [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] in July 2020, and featured in [[Forbes]] as 'Visionary.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookerobertsislam/2020/07/13/visionary-fashion-university-creates-interactive-online-game-to-showcase-graduates-collections/?sh=19554e85298a|title=Visionary Fashion University Creates Visionary Online Game to Showcase Graduates Collections|website=[[Forbes]] |language=en-US|access-date=2020-07-13}}</ref>

In 2021, [[University for the Creative Arts]] became the first major arts university to launch a new postgraduate higher education degree in Digital Fashion, the first Master's course of its kind in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/feb/23/digital-fashion-designers-uk-degree-digital-couture-gaming-tech|title=Digital fashion designers sought for UK's first degree in virtual couture|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=23 February 2021 |language=en-US|access-date=2021-02-23}}</ref> This new course allows creative researchers to learn how to create garments which are completely free from the material world, and how to fit them digitally to a client – whether they are a model for a virtual catwalk, a social media influencer looking to boost their reach, a gaming avatar in need of a fashion edge or a movie character being given a bespoke costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/courses/ma-digital-fashion/|title=Digital Fashion MA University for the Creative Arts|language=en-US|access-date=2021-02-23}}</ref>

While there are not (yet) dedicated scientific journals devoted to the topic, several research activities have been done in the field. Among them, a dedicated conference has taken place in 2015 in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. SComS - Studies in Communication Sciences, a Swiss-based Communication Journal, has published a special thematic section on ''Fashion communication: Between tradition and digital transformation''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hope.uzh.ch/scoms/issue/view/177|title=Fashion communication: Between tradition and digital transformation|website=www.hope.uzh.ch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> In July 2019, a conference titled ''FACTUM19 - Fashion Communication: between tradition and future digital developments'' has taken place in [[Ascona]] ([[Switzerland]]), whose proceedings are published by [[Springer Publishing|Springer]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030154356|title=Fashion Communication in the Digital Age|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> During FACTUM19, a document titled "Fashion Communication Research.

Fashion is closely related with [[Art]] and Heritage. Several museums related to fashion have started to make their appearance in the past thirty years. Examples are the Museum Christian Dior Granville, the Museum Cristobal Balenciaga, The Armani Silos, The Museum Audemars Piguet.<ref>Noris, A., & Cantoni, L. (29 Aug. 2022). Digital Fashion Communication. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill. doi: https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004523555</ref> Among the most important initiatives to digitize [[History of fashion design|fashion history]], thus making such heritage available to researchers, practitioners and all interested people, two projects can be mentioned: Europeana Fashion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion|title=Europeana Fashion|website=www.europeana.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref> and We Wear Culture<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/project/fashion|title=We Wear Culture - Google Arts & Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en}}</ref> by [[Google Arts & Culture|Google Arts and Culture]].

== The rise of digital fashion during COVID-19 ==
Since the beginning of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|2020 pandemic]], the fashion industry has suffered strong economic losses, as sales plummeted and jobs were lost, but it has since learned to digitally recover through virtual clothing, catwalks, and showrooms.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2020-09-25 |title=What will the fashion industry look like post-Covid 19 |url=https://www.stylar.com/ |access-date=2020-12-19 |website=i-D |language=en}}</ref>

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, fashion is among the industries that have been forced to adapt their commercial and creative strategies to better suit the [[social distancing]] measures.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roberts-Islam|first=Brooke|title=Virtual Catwalks And Digital Fashion: How COVID-19 Is Changing The Fashion Industry|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookerobertsislam/2020/04/06/virtual-catwalks-and-digital-fashion-how-covid-19-is-changing-the-fashion-industry/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> Therefore, the digital channel has since seen a rise in use, offering live shopping and has been highlighted as the only way to overcome physical barriers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Faria|first1=Ana Paula|last2=Providência|first2=Bernardo|last3=Cunha|first3=Joana|title=Advances in Design and Digital Communication |chapter=The Foreseeable Future of Digital Fashion Communication After Coronavirus: Designing for Emotions |date=2021|editor-last=Martins|editor-first=Nuno|editor2-last=Brandão|editor2-first=Daniel|series=Springer Series in Design and Innovation|volume=12 |language=en|location=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=510–515|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-61671-7_47|isbn=978-3-030-61671-7|doi-access=|s2cid=226336704 }}</ref> It is also believed that these changes will prevail in years to come, as reported by WGSN.<ref name=":0" />

Among these circumstances, new digital fashion houses were born, looking to push the boundaries of design, innovation and sustainability: [[Tribute Brand]], The Fabricant, Auroboros and RTFKT.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Menon |first=Maya |date=2021-08-17 |title=Cyber couture: 8 digital fashion houses to shop for virtual clothing now |url=https://vogue.sg/digital-fashion-houses/ |access-date=2024-05-11 |website=Vogue Singapore |language=en-US}}</ref>

Once events only attended by selected people, catwalks and showrooms have become more accessible through live streaming and virtual fashion shows. Thus, they have resulted in high fashion becoming more procurable to the general public. [[Milan Fashion Week]] was renamed “Milan Digital Fashion Week”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Milan Digital Fashion Week 2020|url=https://milanofashionweek.cameramoda.it/en/|access-date=2020-12-19|website=milanofashionweek.cameramoda.it}}</ref> and the [[New York Fashion Week|New York version]] prioritized outdoor spaces to further prevent the spread and set the maximum capacity at 50.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-25|title=Governor Cuomo Announces New York Fashion Week to Take Place in September with Limited or No Spectators|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-fashion-week-take-place-september-limited-or-no-spectators|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Governor Andrew M.

In 2021, big virtual fashion events are becoming more common. An example of this is the International digital Fashion Week. With this event, there is the largest virtual fashion show being held with over 100 designers in the fashion industry being represented. This has occurred as a result to the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=FWO|date=2020-09-02|title=International Digital Fashion Week Launches the World's Largest Fashion Week|url=https://fashionweekonline.com/international-digital-fashion-week-launches-the-worlds-largest-fashion-week|access-date=2021-10-18|website=Fashion Week Online®|language=en-US}}</ref> However, now digital fashion has a chance to thrive in a new technology and fashion fusion industry.

The importance of fashion films has also been stressed as a medium to creatively show designers' upcoming collections. As a result, methods that were only used by digital focused houses such as The Fabricant are expected to become the norm. Therefore, 3D experiences have gained momentum. As a matter of fact, high-profile models such as [[Bella Hadid]] have already incorporated such advanced and revolutionary practices into their curriculum, as seen in an [[Instagram]] post that displays the star getting a full body [[3D scanning|3D scan]]&nbsp;for a [[Mugler]] Spring Summer 2021 film.{{citation needed| reason=link to instagram|date=January 2024}}<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yotka|first=Steff|title=Meet Digi-Bella—Bella Hadid's Virtual Avatar Stars in Mugler's New Film|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-virtual-avatar-stars-in-mugler-spring-2021-film|access-date=2020-12-19|website=Vogue|date=22 October 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> The video shows her in a gold outfit as [[Pegasus]], against the backdrop of a fantasy-filled world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mugler Spring Summer 2021 Part 01 Film - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8363wCXV0&ab_channel=Mugler|access-date=2020-12-19|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

One advantage of the digitalization of fashion is being eco-friendly, as it reduces fabric waste.

== The Emergence of the NFT Clothes Industry ==
[[Non-fungible token|NFTs]], unique digital assets that use blockchain technology to verify ownership and provenance, have been embraced by various industries for their ability to create, trade, and tokenize digital content. The NFT clothes industry is a natural extension of this trend, applying the same concept to digital fashion items. As virtual worlds, gaming platforms, and online social spaces become increasingly popular, the demand for customizable digital avatars and unique virtual outfits has grown. NFT clothes cater to this demand, offering users a way to stand out in the digital crowd.<ref>{{Cite web |last=WW |first=FashionNetwork com |title=NFTs in the fashion industry |url=https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Nfts-in-the-fashion-industry,1372225.html |access-date=2023-03-21 |website=FashionNetwork.com |language=en-WW}}</ref>{{citation needed| reason=blog link|date=January 2024}}

The rise of the NFT clothes industry presents both opportunities and challenges for the traditional fashion sector. On the one hand, it allows designers to explore new creative possibilities without the constraints of physical materials and production costs. This opens up the potential for collaborations with digital artists and programmers, paving the way for more innovative designs and a broader audience reach.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-22 |title=Is the Indian fashion industry ready to tackle the metaverse on a global scale? |url=https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/is-the-indian-fashion-industry-ready-to-tackle-the-metaverse-on-a-global-scale |access-date=2023-03-21 |website=Vogue India |language=en-IN}}</ref>
