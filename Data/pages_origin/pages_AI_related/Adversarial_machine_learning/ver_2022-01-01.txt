'''Adversarial machine learning''' is a [[machine learning]] technique that attempts to exploit models by taking advantage of obtainable model information and using it to create malicious attacks.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Kianpour|first1=Mazaher|title=Intelligent Systems and Applications|last2=Wen|first2=Shao-Fang|date=2020|isbn=978-3-030-29515-8|series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|volume=1037|pages=111–125|language=en|chapter=Timing Attacks on Machine Learning: State of the Art|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_10|s2cid=201705926}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|eprint=1611.01236|class=cs.CV|first1=Samy|last1=Bengio|first2=Ian J.|last2=Goodfellow|title=Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale|date=2017|last3=Kurakin|first3=Alexey}}</ref><ref name="LimTaeihagh20192">{{Cite journal|last1=Lim|first1=Hazel Si Min|last2=Taeihagh|first2=Araz|date=2019|title=Algorithmic Decision-Making in AVs: Understanding Ethical and Technical Concerns for Smart Cities|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=11|issue=20|pages=5791|arxiv=1910.13122|bibcode=2019arXiv191013122L|doi=10.3390/su11205791|s2cid=204951009|doi-access=free}}</ref> The most common reason is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model.

Most machine learning techniques were designed to work on specific problem sets in which the training and test data are generated from the same statistical distribution ([[Independent and identically distributed random variables|IID]]). When those models are applied to the real world, adversaries may supply data that violates that statistical assumption. This data may be arranged to exploit specific vulnerabilities and compromise the results.<ref name="LimTaeihagh20192" /><ref name="GoodfellowMcDaniel20182">{{cite journal|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian|last2=McDaniel|first2=Patrick|last3=Papernot|first3=Nicolas|date=25 June 2018|title=Making machine learning robust against adversarial inputs|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/7/229030-making-machine-learning-robust-against-adversarial-inputs/fulltex|journal=Communications of the ACM|language=en|volume=61|issue=7|pages=56–66|doi=10.1145/3134599|issn=0001-0782|access-date=2018-12-13|doi-access=free}}</ref> The four most common adversarial machine learning strategies are evasion, poisoning, model stealing (extraction), and inference.<ref name=":3">{{Citation|title=Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) v1.8|date=2021-10-23|url=https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox|publisher=Trusted-AI|access-date=2021-10-23}}</ref>

== History ==
In ''[[Understand (story)]]'' (1991), the main character, who over the course of the story transforms into a self-improving intelligence, falls prey to an adversarial sample leading to his annihilation. In ''[[Snow Crash]]'' (1992), the author offered scenarios of technology that was vulnerable to an adversarial attack. In ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010), a character dons a t-shirt decorated in a way that renders him invisible to electronic surveillance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vincent|first1=James|date=12 April 2017|title=Magic AI: these are the optical illusions that trick, fool, and flummox computers|language=en|work=The Verge|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15271874/ai-adversarial-images-fooling-attacks-artificial-intelligence|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>

In 2004, Nilesh Dalvi and others noted that [[linear classifier]]s used in [[Email filtering|spam filters]] could be defeated by simple "[[Evasion (network security)|evasion]] attacks" as spammers inserted "good words" into their spam emails. (Around 2007, some spammers added random noise to fuzz words within "image spam" in order to defeat [[Optical character recognition|OCR]]-based filters.) In 2006, Marco Barreno and others published "Can Machine Learning Be Secure?", outlining a broad taxonomy of attacks. As late as 2013 many researchers continued to hope that non-linear classifiers (such as [[support vector machine]]s and [[neural networks]]) might be robust to adversaries, until Battista Biggio and others demonstrated the first gradient-based attacks on such machine-learning models (2012<ref name="Poisoning Attacks against Support V">{{cite arxiv|eprint=1206.6389|class=cs.LG|first1=Battista|last1=Biggio|first2=Blaine|last2=Nelson|title=Poisoning Attacks against Support Vector Machines|date=2013-03-25|last3=Laskov|first3=Pavel}}</ref>-2013<ref name="Springer">{{Cite book|last1=Biggio|first1=Battista|last2=Corona|first2=Igino|last3=Maiorca|first3=Davide|last4=Nelson|first4=Blaine|last5=Srndic|first5=Nedim|last6=Laskov|first6=Pavel|last7=Giacinto|first7=Giorgio|last8=Roli|first8=Fabio|date=2013|chapter=Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time|title=ECML PKDD|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=7908|publisher=Springer|pages=387–402|arxiv=1708.06131|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_25|isbn=978-3-642-38708-1|s2cid=18716873}}</ref>). In 2012, [[Deep learning|deep neural networks]] began to dominate computer vision problems; starting in 2014, Christian Szegedy and others demonstrated that deep neural networks could be fooled by adversaries, again using a gradient-based attack to craft adversarial perturbations.<ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=1312.6199|class=cs.CV|first1=Christian|last1=Szegedy|first2=Wojciech|last2=Zaremba|title=Intriguing properties of neural networks|date=2014-02-19|last6=Goodfellow|first7=Rob|last7=Fergus|first6=Ian|first3=Ilya|last5=Erhan|first4=Joan|last4=Bruna|last3=Sutskever|first5=Dumitru}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{cite journal|last1=Biggio|first1=Battista|last2=Roli|first2=Fabio|date=December 2018|title=Wild patterns: Ten years after the rise of adversarial machine learning|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=84|pages=317–331|arxiv=1712.03141|bibcode=2018PatRe..84..317B|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2018.07.023|s2cid=207324435}}</ref>

Recently, it was observed that adversarial attacks are harder to produce in the practical world due to the different environmental constraints that cancel out the effect of noises.<ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=1607.02533|class=cs.CV|first1=Alexey|last1=Kurakin|first2=Ian|last2=Goodfellow|title=Adversarial examples in the physical world|last3=Bengio|first3=Samy|year=2016}}</ref><ref>Gupta, Kishor Datta, Dipankar Dasgupta, and Zahid Akhtar.

In addition, researchers such as Google Brain's Nicholas Frosst point out that it is much easier to make self-driving cars miss stop signs by physically removing the sign itself, rather than creating adversarial examples.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Synced|date=2019-11-21|title=Google Brain's Nicholas Frosst on Adversarial Examples and Emotional Responses {{!}} Synced|url=https://syncedreview.com/2019/11/21/google-brains-nicholas-frosst-on-adversarial-examples-and-emotional-responses/|access-date=2021-10-23|website=syncedreview.com|language=en-US}}</ref> Frosst also believe that the adversarial machine learning community incorrectly assumes models trained on a certain data distribution will also perform well on a completely different data distribution. He suggests that a new approach to machine learning should be explored, and is currently working on a unique neural network that has characteristics more similar to human perception than state of the art approaches.<ref name=":2" />

While adversarial machine learning continues to be heavily rooted in academia, large tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have begun curating documentation and open source code bases to allow others to concretely assess the robustness of machine learning models and minimize the risk of adversarial attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Responsible AI practices|url=https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/|access-date=2021-10-23|website=Google AI|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=amarshal|title=Failure Modes in Machine Learning - Security documentation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning|access-date=2021-10-23|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us}}</ref>

==Attack modalities==
===Taxonomy===
Attacks against (supervised) machine learning algorithms have been categorized along three primary axes:<ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_22">{{Cite journal|last1=Barreno|first1=Marco|last2=Nelson|first2=Blaine|last3=Joseph|first3=Anthony D.|last4=Tygar|first4=J. D.|year=2010|title=The security of machine learning|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-010-5188-5.pdf|journal=Machine Learning|volume=81|issue=2|pages=121–148|doi=10.1007/s10994-010-5188-5|doi-access=free|s2cid=2304759}}</ref> influence on the classifier, the security violation and their specificity.

* Classifier influence: An attack can influence the classifier by disrupting the classification phase. This may be preceded by an exploration phase to identify vulnerabilities. The attacker's capabilities might be restricted by the presence of data manipulation constraints.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikos|first=Leslie F.|title=AI in Cybersecurity|publisher=Springer|year=2019|isbn=978-3-319-98841-2|series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library|volume=151|location=Cham|page=50|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98842-9}}</ref>
* Security violation: An attack can supply malicious data that gets classified as legitimate. Malicious data supplied during training can cause legitimate data to be rejected after training.
* Specificity: A targeted attack attempts to allow a specific intrusion/disruption. Alternatively, an indiscriminate attack creates general mayhem.

This taxonomy has been extended into a more comprehensive threat model that allows explicit assumptions about the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, capability of manipulating the input data/system components, and on attack strategy.<ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A2">B.

=== Strategies ===
Below are some of the most commonly encountered attack scenarios:

====Evasion ====
Evasion attacks<ref name="Springer"/><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A2" /><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A2" /><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_36A2">B. Nelson, B. I. Rubinstein, L. Huang, A. D. Joseph, S. J. Lee, S. Rao, and J. D. Tygar. "[http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/nelson12a/nelson12a.pdf Query strategies for evading convex-inducing classifiers]". J. Mach. Learn. Res., 13:1293–1332, 2012</ref> are the most prevalent type of attack. For instance, spammers and hackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of spam emails and [[malware]]. Samples are modified to evade detection; that is, to be classified as legitimate. This does not involve influence over the training data. A clear example of evasion is [[Image spam|image-based spam]] in which the spam content is embedded within an attached image to evade textual analysis by anti-spam filters. Another example of evasion is given by spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.<ref name="RodriguesLing20092" />

Evasion attacks can be generally split into two different categories: [[Black box|black box attacks]] and [[White box (software engineering)|white box attacks]].<ref name=":3" />

====Poisoning====
Poisoning is adversarial contamination of training data. Machine learning systems can be re-trained using data collected during operations. For instance, [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection systems (IDSs)]] are often re-trained using such data. An attacker may poison this data by injecting malicious samples during operation that subsequently disrupt retraining.<ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_4A2" /><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_5A2" /><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_22" /><ref name="Adversarial Machine Learning_15A2">B.

==== Model stealing ====
Model stealing (also called model extraction) involves an adversary probing a black box machine learning system in order to either reconstruct the model or extract the data it was trained on.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-06|title=How to steal modern NLP systems with gibberish?|url=http://cleverhans.io/2020/04/06/stealing-bert.html|access-date=2020-10-15|website=cleverhans-blog|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{cite arxiv|eprint=2009.06112|class=cs.CR|first1=Xinran|last1=Wang|first2=Yu|last2=Xiang|title=Information Laundering for Model Privacy|date=2020-09-13|last3=Gao|first3=Jun|last4=Ding|first4=Jie}}</ref>  This can cause issues when either the training data or the model itself is sensitive and confidential. For example, model stealing could be used to extract a proprietary stock trading model which the adversary could then use for their own financial benefit.

==== Inference ====
Inference attacks, leverages over-generalization on training data, a common weakness of [[Supervised machine learning|supervised machine learning models]], in order to identify data used during model training.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Dickson|first=Ben|date=2021-04-23|title=Machine learning: What are membership inference attacks?|url=https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/04/23/machine-learning-membership-inference-attacks/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=TechTalks|language=en-US}}</ref> For attackers, this can be done even without knowledge or access to a target model's parameters, raising security concerns for models trained on sensitive data, including but not limited to medical records and/or personally identifiable information. With the emergence of [[transfer learning]] and public accessibility of many state of the art machine learning models, tech companies are increasingly drawn to create models based on public ones, giving attackers freely accessible information to the structure and type of model being used.<ref name=":6" /> However, membership inference relies heavily on [[overfitting]] resulting from poor machine learning practices, meaning a model that generalizes well to the real distribution of data should theoretically be more secure to membership inference attacks.<ref name=":6" />

== Specific attack types ==
There are a large variety of different adversarial attacks that can be used against machine learning systems. Many of these work on both [[deep learning]] systems as well as traditional machine learning models such as [[Support vector machine|SVMs]]<ref name="Poisoning Attacks against Support V"/> and  [[linear regression]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jagielski|first1=Matthew|last2=Oprea|first2=Alina|last3=Biggio|first3=Battista|last4=Liu|first4=Chang|last5=Nita-Rotaru|first5=Cristina|last6=Li|first6=Bo|date=May 2018|title=Manipulating Machine Learning: Poisoning Attacks and Countermeasures for Regression Learning|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/sp.2018.00057|journal=2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)|publisher=IEEE|pages=19–35|arxiv=1804.00308|doi=10.1109/sp.2018.00057|isbn=978-1-5386-4353-2|s2cid=4551073}}</ref> A high level sample of these attack types include:

=== Adversarial examples ===
An adversarial example refers to specially crafted input which is design to look "normal" to humans but causes misclassification to a machine learning model.  Often, a form of specially designed "noise"  is used to elicit the misclassifications. Below are some current techniques for generating adversarial examples in the literature (by no means an exhaustive list).

==== Black Box Attacks ====
Black box attacks in adversarial machine learning assumes that the adversary can only get outputs for provided inputs and has no knowledge of the model structure or parameters.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Sensen|last2=Zhao|first2=Jinxiong|last3=Li|first3=Xiaoyu|last4=Duan|first4=Junhong|last5=Mu|first5=Dejun|last6=Jing|first6=Xiao|date=2021-04-24|title=A Black-Box Attack Method against Machine-Learning-Based Anomaly Network Flow Detection Models|journal=Security and Communication Networks|language=en|volume=2021|pages=e5578335|doi=10.1155/2021/5578335|issn=1939-0114|doi-access=free}}</ref> In this case, the adversarial example is generated either using a model created from scratch, or without any model at all (excluding the ability to query the original model). In either case, the objective of these attacks are to create adversarial examples that are able to transfer to the black box model in question.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Gomes|first=Joao|date=2018-01-17|title=Adversarial Attacks and Defences for Convolutional Neural Networks|url=https://medium.com/onfido-tech/adversarial-attacks-and-defences-for-convolutional-neural-networks-66915ece52e7|access-date=2021-10-23|website=Onfido Tech|language=en}}</ref>

===== Square Attack =====
The Square Attack was introduced in 2020 as a black box evasion adversarial attack based on querying classification scores without the need of gradient information.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Andriushchenko|first1=Maksym|last2=Croce|first2=Francesco|last3=Flammarion|first3=Nicolas|last4=Hein|first4=Matthias|date=2020|editor-last=Vedaldi|editor-first=Andrea|editor2-last=Bischof|editor2-first=Horst|editor3-last=Brox|editor3-first=Thomas|editor4-last=Frahm|editor4-first=Jan-Michael|title=Square Attack: A Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attack via Random Search|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58592-1_29|journal=Computer Vision – ECCV 2020|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=12368|language=en|location=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=484–501|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-58592-1_29|arxiv=1912.00049|isbn=978-3-030-58592-1|s2cid=208527215}}</ref> As a score based black box attack, this adversarial approach is able to query probability distributions across model output classes, but has no other access to the model itself. According to the paper's authors, the proposed Square Attack required less queries than when compared to state of the art score based black box attacks at the time.<ref name=":7" />

To describe the function objective, the attack defines the classifier as <math display="inline">f:[0, 1]^d \rightarrow \reals^K</math>, with <math display="inline">d</math> representing the dimensions of the input and <math display="inline">K</math> as the total number of output classes. <math display="inline">f_k(x)</math> returns the score (or a probability between 0 and 1) that the input <math display="inline">x</math> belongs to class <math display="inline">k</math>, which allows the classifier's class output for any input <math display="inline">x</math> to be defined as <math display="inline">argmax_{k=1,...,K}f_k(x)</math>. The goal of this attack is as followed:<ref name=":7" />

<math>argmax_{k = 1,...,K}f_k(\hat{x}) \neq y, ||\hat{x} - x||_p \leq \epsilon \text{ and } \hat{x} \in [0, 1]^d</math><ref name=":7" />

In other words, finding some perturbed adversarial example <math display="inline">\hat{x}</math> such that the classifier incorrectly classifies it to some other class under the constraint that <math display="inline">\hat{x}</math> and <math display="inline">x</math> are similar. The paper then defines [[Loss functions for classification|loss]] <math display="inline">L</math> as <math display="inline">L(f(\hat{x}), y) = f_y(\hat{x}) - \max_{k \neq y}f_k(\hat{x})</math> and proposes the solution to finding adversarial example <math display="inline">\hat{x}</math> as solving the below [[constrained optimization problem]]:<ref name=":7" />

<math>\min_{\hat{x} \in [0, 1]^d}L(f(\hat{x}), y), \text{ s.t. } ||\hat{x} - x||_p \leq \epsilon</math><ref name=":7" />

The result in theory is an adversarial example that is highly confident in the incorrect class but is also very similar to the original image. To find such example, Square Attack utilizes the iterative [[random search]] technique to randomly perturb the image in hopes of improving the objective function. In each step, the algorithm perturbs only a small square section of pixels, hence the name Square Attack, which terminates as soon as an adversarial example is found in order to improve query efficiency. Finally, since the attack algorithm uses scores and not gradient information, the authors of the paper indicate that this approach is not affected by gradient masking, a common technique formerly used to prevent evasion attacks.<ref name=":7" />

===== HopSkipJump Attack =====
This black box attack was also proposed as a query efficient attack, but one that relies solely on access to any input's predicted output class. In other words, the HopSkipJump attack does not require the ability to calculate gradients or access to score values like the Square Attack, and will require just the model's class prediction output (for any given input). The proposed attack is split into two different settings, targeted and untargeted, but both are built from the general idea of adding minimal perturbations that leads to a different model output. In the targeted setting, the goal is to cause the model to misclassify the perturbed image to a specific target label (that is not the original label). In the untargeted setting, the goal is to cause the model to misclassify the perturbed image to any label that is not the original label. The attack objectives for both are as followed where <math display="inline">x</math> is the original image, <math display="inline">x^\prime</math> is the adversarial image, <math display="inline">d</math> is a distance function between images, <math display="inline">c^*</math> is the target label, and <math display="inline">C</math> is the model's classification class label function:

<math>\textbf{Targeted: } \min_{x^\prime}d(x^\prime, x) \text{ subject to } C(x^\prime) = c^* </math><ref name=":8">{{Citation|title=HopSkipJumpAttack: A Query-Efficient Decision-Based Attack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkCifg2rp34|language=en|access-date=2021-10-25|last1 = Chen|first1 = Jianbo|last2 = Jordan|first2 = Michael I.|last3 = Wainwright|first3 = Martin J.|year = 2019|arxiv = 1904.02144}}</ref>

<math>\textbf{Untargeted: } \min_{x^\prime}d(x^\prime, x) \text{ subject to } C(x^\prime) \neq C(x) </math><ref name=":8" />

To solve this problem, the attack proposes the following boundary function <math display="inline">S</math> for both the untargeted and targeted setting:

<math>S(x^\prime):= \begin{cases} max_{c \neq C(x)}{F(x^\prime)_c} - F(x^\prime) _{C(x)} , & \text{(Untargeted)} \\ F(x^\prime) _{c^*} - max_{c \neq c^*}{F(x^\prime)_c}, & \text{(Targeted)} \end{cases} </math><ref name=":8" />

This can be further simplified to better visualize the boundary between different potential adversarial examples:

<math>S(x^\prime) > 0 \iff \begin{cases} argmax_cF(x^\prime) \neq C(x) , & \text{(Untargeted)} \\ argmax_cF(x^\prime) = c^*, & \text{(Targeted)} \end{cases} </math><ref name=":8" />

With this boundary function, the attack then follows an iterative algorithm to find adversarial examples <math display="inline">x^\prime</math> for a given image <math display="inline">x</math> that satisfies the attack objectives.

# Initialize <math display="inline">x</math> to some point where <math display="inline">S(x) > 0</math>
# Iterate below
## Boundary search
## Gradient update
##* Compute the gradient
##* Find the step size

Boundary search uses a modified [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]] to find the point in which the boundary (as defined by <math display="inline">S</math>) intersects with the line between <math display="inline">x</math> and <math display="inline">x^\prime</math>. The next step involves calculating the gradient for <math display="inline">x</math>, and update the original <math display="inline">x</math> using this gradient and a pre-chosen step size. HopSkipJump authors prove that this iterative algorithm will converge, leading <math display="inline">x</math> to a point right along the boundary that is very close in distance to the original image.<ref name=":8" />

However since HopSkipJump is a proposed black box attack and the iterative algorithm above requires the calculation of a gradient in the second iterative step (which black box attacks do not have access to), the authors propose a solution to gradient calculation that requires only the model's output predictions alone.<ref name=":8" /> By generating many random vectors in all directions, denoted as <math display="inline">u_b</math>, an approximation of the gradient can be calculated using the average of these random vectors weighted by the sign of the boundary function on the image <math display="inline">x^\prime + \delta_{u_b}</math>, where <math display="inline">\delta_{u_b}</math> is the size of the random vector perturbation:

<math>\nabla S(x^\prime, \delta) \approx \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^{B}\phi(x^\prime + \delta_{u_b}) u_b </math><ref name=":8" />

The result of the equation above gives a close approximation of the gradient required in step 2 of the iterative algorithm, completing HopSkipJump as a black box attack.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Andriushchenko|first1=Maksym|last2=Croce|first2=Francesco|last3=Flammarion|first3=Nicolas|last4=Hein|first4=Matthias|date=2020-07-29|title=Square Attack: a query-efficient black-box adversarial attack via random search|class=cs.LG|eprint=1912.00049}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-21|title=Black-box decision-based attacks on images|url=https://davideliu.com/2020/06/21/black-box-decision-based-attacks-on-images/|access-date=2021-10-25|website=KejiTech|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":8" />

==== White Box Attacks ====
White box attacks assumes that the adversary has access to model parameters on top of being able to get labels for provided inputs.<ref name=":4" />

===== Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) =====
One of the very first proposed attacks for generating adversarial examples was proposed by Google researchers Ian J. Goodfellow, Jonathon Shlens, and Christian Szegedy.<ref name=":9">{{cite arxiv|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last2=Shlens|first2=Jonathon|last3=Szegedy|first3=Christian|date=2015-03-20|title=Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples|class=stat.ML|eprint=1412.6572}}</ref> The attack was called fast gradient sign method, and it consists of adding a linear amount of in-perceivable noise to the image and causing a model to incorrectly classify it. This noise is calculated by multiplying the sign of the gradient with respect to the image we want to perturb by a small constant epsilon. As epsilon increases, the model is more likely to be fooled, but the perturbations become easier to identify as well. Shown below is the equation to generate an adversarial example where <math display="inline">x</math> is the original image, <math display="inline">\epsilon</math> is a very small number, <math display="inline">\Delta_x</math> is the gradient function, <math display="inline">J</math> is the loss function, <math display="inline">\theta</math> is the model weights, and <math display="inline">y</math> is the true label.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|last=Tsui|first=Ken|date=2018-08-22|title=Perhaps the Simplest Introduction of Adversarial Examples Ever|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/perhaps-the-simplest-introduction-of-adversarial-examples-ever-c0839a759b8d|access-date=2021-10-24|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref>

<math>adv_x = x + \epsilon \cdot sign(\Delta_xJ(\theta, x, y))</math><ref name=":11">{{Cite web|title=Adversarial example using FGSM {{!}} TensorFlow Core|url=https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/adversarial_fgsm|access-date=2021-10-24|website=TensorFlow|language=en}}</ref>

One important property of this equation is that the gradient is calculated with respect to the input image since the goal is to generate an image that maximizes the loss for the original image of true label <math display="inline">y</math>. In traditional [[gradient descent]] (for model training), the gradient is used to update the weights of the model since the goal is to minimize the loss for the model on a ground truth dateset. The Fast Gradient Sign Method was proposed as a fast way to generate adversarial examples to evade the model, based on the hypothesis that neural networks cannot resist even linear amounts of perturbation to the input.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":11" /><ref name=":9" />

===== Carlini & Wagner (C&W) =====
In an effort to analyze existing adversarial attacks and defenses, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, Nicholas Carlini and David Wagner in 2016 propose a faster and more robust method to generate adversarial examples.<ref name=":5">{{cite arxiv|last1=Carlini|first1=Nicholas|last2=Wagner|first2=David|date=2017-03-22|title=Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks|class=cs.CR|eprint=1608.04644}}</ref>

The attack proposed by Carlini and Wagner begins with trying to solve a difficult non-linear optimization equation:

<math>\min(||\delta||_{p}) \text{ subject to } C(x + \delta) = t, x + \delta \in [0, 1]^n</math><ref name=":12" />

Here the objective is to minimize the noise (<math display="inline">\delta</math>), added to the original input <math display="inline">x</math>, such that the machine learning algorithm (<math display="inline">C</math>) predicts the original input with delta (or <math display="inline">x + \delta</math>) as some other class <math display="inline">t</math>. However instead of directly the above equation, Carlini and Wagner propose using a new function <math display="inline">f</math> such that:

<math>C(x + \delta) = t \iff f(x + \delta) \leq 0</math><ref name=":12" />

This condenses the first equation to the problem below:

<math>\min(||\delta||_{p}) \text{ subject to } f(x + \delta) \leq 0, x + \delta \in [0, 1]^n</math><ref name=":12" />

and even more to the equation below:

<math>\min(||\delta||_{p} + c \cdot f(x + \delta)), x + \delta \in [0, 1]^n</math><ref name=":12" />

Carlini and Wagner then propose the use of the below function in place of <math display="inline">f</math> using <math display="inline">Z</math>, a function that determines class probabilities for given input <math display="inline">x</math>. When substituted in, this equation can be thought of as finding a target class that is more confident than the next likeliest class by some constant amount:

<math>f(x) = ([\max_{i \neq t}Z(x)_i] - Z(x)_t)^{+}</math><ref name=":12" />

When solved using gradient descent, this equation is able to produce stronger adversarial examples when compared to fast gradient sign method that is also able to bypass defensive distillation, a defense that was once proposed to be effective against adversarial examples.<ref>{{Cite web|title=carlini wagner attack|url=http://richardjordan.com/ucdfk/carlini-wagner-attack|access-date=2021-10-23|website=richardjordan.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Plotz|first=Mike|date=2018-11-26|title=Paper Summary: Adversarial Examples Are Not Easily Detected: Bypassing Ten Detection Methods|url=https://medium.com/@hyponymous/paper-summary-adversarial-examples-are-not-easily-detected-bypassing-ten-detection-methods-faf040e54e93|access-date=2021-10-23|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":12" />
