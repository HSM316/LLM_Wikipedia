'''Sourcegraph, Inc.''' is a [[software]] company headquartered in [[San Francisco]]. Sourcegraph’s eponymous code search and code intelligence tool semantically indexes and analyzes large codebases so that developers can find, navigate, and understand code across commercial, [[Open source|open-source]], local, and cloud-based [[Information repository|repositories]].<ref name="lwn">{{Cite web |last=Hoyt |first=Ben |date=2020-08-17 |title=Searching code with Sourcegraph |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/828748/ |access-date=2022-10-03 |website=LWN.net}}</ref> Sourcegraph supports all major programming languages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-3.0 |title=Announcing Sourcegraph 3.0 |last=Slack |first=Quinn |date=2019-02-08 |website=Sourcegraph official website |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref>

== Applications ==
In research, Sourcegraph has been applied to develop [[data mining]] methods for [[Downstream (software development)|downstream]] [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]]<ref>{{Citation |last1=Thiede |first1=Christoph |last2=Limberger |first2=Daniel |last3=Scheibel |first3=Willy |last4=Döllner |first4=Jürgen | contribution=Augmenting Library Development by Mining Usage Data from Downstream Dependencies | year=2022 |title=17th International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering |publisher=ENASE | contribution-url=https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=cXF3UOIDuTY=&t=1}}</ref> and to aid in the refactoring and translation of a program into its equivalent in a different programming language.<ref>{{Cite thesis |type=MSc |last= Haavisto |first= Juuso |date=2020 |title=Leveraging APL and SPIR-V languages to write network functions to be deployed on Vulkan compatible GPUs |publisher=Université de Lorraine |url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03155647/document |access-date=2022-12-15}}</ref>

Sourcegraph is used in the [[CERN]] Accelerator Control software community to index code, quickly search through it, and create statistics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Voirin |first1=R. |last2=Vanden Eynden |first2=M. |last3= Oulevey |first3=T. |date=2022 |title=The State of Containerization in CERN Accelerator Controls |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2809570 |journal=JACoW |volume=ICALEPCS |issue=2021 |pages=829-834 |doi=10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-THBL03 |access-date=2022-12-15}}</ref>

In [[Computer security|cybersecurity]], Sourcegraph has been used for better insights into source code during penetration tests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rehberger |first=Johann |year=2020 |title=Cybersecurity Attacks – Red Team Strategies: A practical guide to building a penetration testing program having homefield advantage |publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd |page=216-224 |isbn=9781838825508}}</ref>

== Services ==
The core Sourcegraph product has two versions:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sourcegraph Enterprise vs. Sourcegraph Open Source (Sourcegraph OSS) |url=https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/ce-support/ce/onboarding/enterprise-vs-oss/ |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=Sourcegraph Handbook}}</ref> 
* Sourcegraph Open Source (Sourcegraph OSS), which is free to use and only includes Sourcegraph’s universal code search functionality.
* Sourcegraph Enterprise (previously Sourcegraph Data Center<ref name="dc">{{Cite web |url=https://devclass.com/2018/10/02/sourcegraph-becomes-open-source-project/ |title=Sourcegraph pulls back the curtain, becomes open source project |last=Schmidt |first=Julia |date=2018-10-02 |website=DevClass |access-date=2022-11-21}}</ref>), which includes the Sourcegraph code intelligence platform and has a free tier for a limited number of users.

Code can be searched and navigated from the Sourcegraph web [[User interface|UI]] or using browser and [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] extensions and [[text editor]] plugins.<ref name="lwn"/> Sourcegraph supports over 30 programming languages and integrates with GitHub and GitLab for code hosting, Codecov for code coverage, and Jira Software for project management.<ref name="auto5"/>

=== Code Search ===
Sourcegraph's "universal code search" tool is used to search, explore, and understand code.<ref name="vb1"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Liu |first=Beyang |date=2020-01-15 |title=Sourcegraph: Universal code search and intelligence |url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3514213/sourcegraph-universal-code-search-and-intelligence.html |website=InfoWorld |access-date=2022-12-05}}</ref> Search can be implemented across multiple repositories and code hosting platforms. Search can be [[Literal (computer programming)|literal]], [[regular expression]], or structural. Structural search syntax is language-aware and handles nested expressions and multi-line statements better than regular expressions.<ref name="lwn"/> Sourcegraph's Code Search uses a variation of Google's [[PageRank]] algorithm to rank results by relevance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yegge |first=Steve |date=2022-11-08 |title=Rethinking search results ranking on Sourcegraph.com |url=https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/new-search-ranking |website=Sourcegraph |access-date=2022-12-06}}</ref>

=== Code Navigation ===
Sourcegraph's Code Navigation feature can be used to jump to the definition of a variable or function, or find all references to it in a codebase.<ref name="lwn"/>

=== Batch Changes ===
Sourcegraph's Batch Changes feature allows developers and companies to automate and track large-scale code changes across repositories and code hosts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sawers |first=Paul |date=2021-03-24 |title=Sourcegraph now lets enterprises automate large-scale code changes across repositories |url=https://venturebeat.com/business/sourcegraph-now-lets-enterprises-automate-large-scale-code-changes-across-repositories/ |access-date=2022-10-03 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Code Insights ===
Sourcegraph's Code Insights feature extracts data from a codebase to provide detailed analytics and visualizations to track the state and progress of a code project.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sawers |first=Paul |date=2022-03-10 |title=With Code Insights, Sourcegraph gives developers a better understanding of their codebase |url=https://venturebeat.com/dev/with-code-insights-sourcegraph-gives-developers-a-better-understanding-of-their-codebase/ |access-date=2022-10-03 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Growth ==
Sourcegraph has raised a total of almost $225 million in financing to date. Its most recent $125 million Series D investment in 2021 valued the company at $2.625 billion, a 300% growth from its previous valuation in 2020.<ref name="tc"/>
