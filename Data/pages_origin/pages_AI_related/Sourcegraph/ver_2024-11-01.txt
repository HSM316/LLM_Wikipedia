'''Sourcegraph Inc.''' is a company developing code search and code intelligence tool that semantically indexes and analyzes large codebases so that they can be searched across commercial, [[Open source|open-source]], local, and cloud-based [[Information repository|repositories]].<ref name="lwn">{{Cite web |last=Hoyt |first=Ben |date=2020-08-17 |title=Searching code with Sourcegraph |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/828748/ |access-date=2022-10-03 |website=LWN.net}}</ref>

The company has two products available: Cody and Code Search. Code Search was initially released in 2013 under the name Sourcegraph, but was rebranded to Code Search when the company unveiled Cody in 2023. Both products support all major programming languages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-3.0 |title=Announcing Sourcegraph 3.0 |last=Slack |first=Quinn |date=2019-02-08 |website=Sourcegraph official website |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref>

In 2023 Sourcegraph Inc. unveiled their new product Cody, and rebranded Sourcegraph to Code Search.

== Products ==
The company has two major products: Cody and Code Search.

=== Sourcegraph Cody ===
Cody is a free and open-source AI coding assistant that can help users write, fix, and maintain your code. It works by understanding an entire codebase and using that knowledge to provide context-aware assistance. including code generation, debugging, commenting, documentation, explaining, and answering questions regarding the code. Cody is available for Microsoft Visual Studio Code and most JetBrains IDEs.

=== Sourcegraph Code Search ===
