Sourcegraph is composed of a local editor and a server<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.finsmes.com/2017/10/sourcegraph-raises-20m-in-series-a-funding.html|title=Sourcegraph Raises $20M in Series A Funding|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2017|website=Finsmes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> that It integrates with multiple code hosts, editors, and code review tools.<ref name=":0" /> The local editor is based on [[Visual Studio Code]].

It is designed to allow developers to check if someone is already fixing a bug or working on a feature. Sourcegraph CEO explains that it allow developers to better understand how the development has progressed by "getting everyone on the same page".<ref name=":2" /> Sourcegraph’s goal is to immerse developers into a more real-time experience, which keeps them up to date and working on the most important things they need to develop.<ref name=":2" />

Sourcegraph was co-founded by stanford graduates Quinn Slack, CEO, and Beyang Liu, CTO in line with their effort to build tools that can help them better read and understand poorly documented open-source code.<ref name=":0" /> It achieved 300,000 direct product users until Jan 30, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2017/01/03/30-under-30-2017-the-young-innovators-transforming-enterprise-tech/|title=30 Under 30 2017: The Young Innovators Transforming Enterprise Tech|last=Chaykowski|first=Kathleen|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en}}</ref> and raised $20 million on october 2017 via Scott Raney of Redpoint Ventures, and Dan Friedland of Goldcrest Capital who joined the board of directors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.finsmes.com/2017/10/sourcegraph-raises-20m-in-series-a-funding.html|title=Sourcegraph Raises $20M in Series A Funding|date=2017-10-06|work=FinSMEs|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-US}}</ref>
