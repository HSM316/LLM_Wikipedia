The '''Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance (IoBT-CRA)''', also known as the Internet of Battlefield Things Research on Evolving Intelligent Goal-driven Networks (IoBT REIGN), is a collaborative research alliance between government, industry, and university researchers for the purposes of developing a fundamental understanding of a dynamic, goal-driven [[Internet of Military Things|Internet of Military Things (IoMT)]] known as the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=3050|title=Internet of Battlefield Things (IOBT)|last=|first=|date=February 7, 2017|website=CCDC Army Research Laboratory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/pages/3050/IOBT_CRA-Overview_20170327.pdf|title=Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) Opportunity Day|last=Russell|first=Stephen|date=March 27, 2017|website=U.S. Army RDECOM|format=PDF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> It was first established by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] to investigate the use of [[machine intelligence]] and smart technology on the battlefield as well as strengthen the collaboration between [[Autonomous agent|autonomous agents]] and human soldiers in combat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/sri-international-leading-security-research-us-army-research-lab-initiative|title=SRI International Leading Security Research for U.S. Army Research Lab Initiative to Develop and Secure the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT)|last=|first=|date=February 21, 2018|website=SRI International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> An initial grant of $25 million was provided by ARL in October 2017 to fund the first five years of this potential 10-year research program.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.afcea.org/content/army-research-laboratory-developing-secure-iobt|title=Army Research Laboratory Developing Secure IoBT|last=|first=|date=February 22, 2018|work=SIGNAL Magazine|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://foxillinois.com/news/local/25-million-grant-to-develop-internet-of-battlefield-things|title=$25 million grant to develop Internet of Battlefield Things|last=McGee|first=Nikki|date=November 15, 2017|work=Fox Illinois|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

The research effort is a collaboration between ARL and [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of Massachusetts]], the [[University of Southern California]], [[Georgetown University]], and [[SRI International]] with the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)]] acting as the consortium lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.photonics.com/a62689|title=UIUC, Penn to Lead Research in IoBT|last=|first=|date=December 6, 2017|website=Photonics Media|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army-technology.com/news/sri-support-security-research-us-arls-internet-battlefield-things/|title=SRI to support security research for US ARL’s internet of battlefield things|last=|first=|date=February 23, 2018|website=Army Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2018/03/05/internet-of-battlefield-things.aspx|title=Developing and protecting the internet of battlefield things|last=Marshall|first=Patrick|date=March 5, 2018|work=GCN|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

== Goals ==
The IoBT-CRA was created as part of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]’s long-term plans to keep up with technological advances in commercial industry and better prepare for future [[electronic warfare]] against more technologically sophisticated adversaries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.meritalk.com/articles/army-takes-on-wicked-problems-with-the-internet-of-battlefield-things/|title=Army Takes on Wicked Problems With the Internet of Battlefield Things|last=|first=|date=January 30, 2019|work=MeriTalk|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref> In light of this objective, the IoBT-CRA focuses on exploring the capabilities of intelligent battlefield systems and large-scale heterogeneous sensor networks that dynamically evolve in real-time in order to adapt to Army mission needs.<ref name=":1" /> Part of the CRA research is dedicated to enhancing modern intelligent sensor and actuator capacity, allowing them to be compatible with secure military-owned networks, less trustworthy civilian networks, and adversarial networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.c4isrnet.com/special-reports/military-it-modernization/2018/08/03/the-internet-of-things-will-depend-on-modernized-networks/|title=The internet of battlefield things will depend on modernized networks|last=Stone|first=Adam|date=August 3, 2018|work=C4ISRNET|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

ARL identified six areas of research that the IoBT-CRA should strive to develop as part of its program:<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iobt.illinois.edu/research/|title=Research|last=|first=|date=|website=IoBT REIGN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 31, 2019}}</ref>

* '''Agile Synthesis:''' Theoretical models and methods of autonomic complex systems that provide the capacity to enable fast and effective command over military, adversary, and civilian networks.
* '''Reflexes:''' Theoretical models and methods for structuring dynamic IoBTs that perform adaptive, autonomic, and self-aware behavior at varying ranges of scale, distribution, resource constraints, and heterogeneity.
* '''Intelligent Battlefield Services:''' Scientific theories that will help improve the fundamental run-time capabilities of IoBTs with tasks such as information collection, predictive processing, and data anomaly detection.
* '''Security:''' Methods of increasing the defenses of IoBTs such that the system is resilient to attacks and tampering from adversaries and is able to continue operating under less-than-ideal situations.
* '''Dependability:''' Fundamental models related to asset composition, system adaptation, and intelligent services that are all aimed to increase the reliability of IoBTs in largely uncertain environments.
* '''Experimentation:''' The architectural foundations for the IoBT seek to evaluate how well theories, algorithms, and technologies perform under various military-related scenarios for the purpose of addressing issues regarding scale, composability, and compatibility.
