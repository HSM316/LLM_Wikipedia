Precise dates vary from year to year, but paper submissions are generally due at the end of August to beginning of September, and the conference is generally held during the following February. The first AAAI was held in 1980 at [[Stanford University]], Stanford [[California]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=AAAI-80: First National Conference on Artificial Intelligence|url=https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai80.php|access-date=2021-09-28|website=www.aaai.org}}</ref>

During AAAI-20 conference AI pioneers and 2018 [[Turing Award]] winners [[Yann LeCun]] and [[Yoshua Bengio]] among eight other researchers were honored as the AAAI 2020 Fellows.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Synced|date=2019-12-24|title=Deep Learning Pioneers Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio Elected as AAAI-20 Fellows {{!}} Synced|url=https://syncedreview.com/2019/12/24/deep-learning-pioneers-yann-lecun-and-yoshua-bengio-elected-as-aaai-20-fellows/|access-date=2021-09-28|website=syncedreview.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

Along with other conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI uses artificial intelligence algorithm to assign papers to reviewers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AI conferences use AI to assign papers to reviewers|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-conferences-use-ai-assign-papers-reviewers|access-date=2021-09-28|website=www.science.org|language=en}}</ref>
