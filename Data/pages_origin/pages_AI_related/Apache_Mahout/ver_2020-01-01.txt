'''Apache Mahout''' is a project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]] to produce [[free software|free]] implementations of [[distributed computing|distributed]] or otherwise [[Scalability|scalable]] [[machine learning]] algorithms focused primarily on linear algebra. In the past, many of the implementations use the [[Apache Hadoop]] platform, however today it is primarily focused on [[Apache Spark]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mahout/ |title=Introducing Apache Mahout |work=ibm.com |year=2011  |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/04/mahout |title=InfoQ: Apache Mahout: Highly Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms |work=infoq.com |year=2011 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref> Mahout also provides Java/Scala libraries for common maths operations (focused on linear algebra and statistics) and primitive Java collections. Mahout is a work in progress; a number of algorithms have been implemented,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mahout.apache.org/users/basics/algorithms.html |title=Algorithms - Apache Mahout - Apache Software Foundation|work=cwiki.apache.org |year=2011 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref>.

While Mahout's core algorithms for [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], classification and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the [[MapReduce|map/reduce]] paradigm, it does not restrict contributions to Hadoop-based implementations. Contributions that run on a single node or on a non-Hadoop cluster are also welcomed. For example, the 'Taste' collaborative-filtering recommender component of Mahout was originally a separate project and can run stand-alone without Hadoop.

Starting with the release 0.10.0, the project shifted its focus to building a backend-independent programming environment, code named "Samsara".<ref>{{Cite web

Supported algebraic platforms are [[Apache Spark]], H2O, and [[Apache Flink]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Support for [[MapReduce]] algorithms started being gradually phased out in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web
