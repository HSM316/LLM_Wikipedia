The '''artificial intelligence (AI) industry in [[China]]''' is a rapidly developing multi-billion dollar industry. As of 2021, the [[artificial intelligence]] market is worth about [[Renminbi|RMB]] 150 billion (US$23.196 billion), and is projected to reach RMB 400 billion (US$61.855 billion) by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/artificial-intelligence-china-shenzhen-first-local-ai-regulations-key-areas-coverage/|title=Artificial Intelligence in China: Shenzhen Releases First Local Regulations |website=china-briefing |date=29 July 2021 |first=Alexander |last=Chipman Koty}}</ref> The roots of China's AI development started in the late 1970s following [[Economic reform in China|economic reform]]s emphasizing [[Science and technology in China|science and technology]] as the country's primary productive force. 

The early stages of China's AI development were slow and faced serious challenges due to a lack of resources and talent. At the beginning China was behind most [[Western world|Western countries]] in terms of AI development. A majority of the research was led by scientists who had received [[higher education]] abroad.

Since 2006, China has steadily developed a national agenda for artificial intelligence development and emerged as one of the leading nations in artificial intelligence research and development.<ref name="yujia">{{Cite book|last=Yujia He|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/publication/how_china_is_preparing_for_ai_powered_future.pdf|title=How China is preparing for an AI-powered Future|publisher=The Wilson Center|year=2017}}</ref> During the late 2010s, China announced in its thirteenth [[Five-year plans of China|Five-Year Plan]] its aim to become a global AI leader by 2030 and to increase the worth of its AI industry to over 1 trillion RMB in the same year.<ref name="State" />

China set this goal in three stages, setting benchmarks for 2020, 2025, and 2030 respectively, as well as releasing a handful of policies, including 'Internet + AI' and 'New Generation AI Development Plan' to incentivize industry growth. Analysts estimated that China's AI development would contribute an annual growth rate of approximately 0.8% to 1.4% to China's economy.<ref name="Barton, D. 2017" />

[[State Council of the People's Republic of China|China's central government]] has a list of "national AI teams" including fifteen China-based companies, including [[Baidu]], [[Tencent]], [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], [[SenseTime]], and [[iFlytek]]. Each company should lead the development of a designated specialized AI sector in China, such as [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]], [[software]]/[[Computer hardware|hardware]], and [[Speech recognition|voice intelligence]]. China's rapid AI development has significantly impacted Chinese society in many areas, including the socio-economic, [[People's Liberation Army|military]], and political spheres. [[Agriculture]], [[Transport|transportation]], accommodation and [[Foodservice|food services]], and manufacturing are the top industries that would be the most impacted by further AI deployment.

However, scholars have warned of potential negative impacts on China's [[Labour economics|labor market]] and disproportionate benefits between [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] areas, coastal and inland regions, and among different income groups.<ref name=":3" /> The private sector, university laboratories, and the military are working collaboratively in many aspects as there are few current existing boundaries.<ref name=":0" /> As China continues expanding its AI industry, there are [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|ethical]] and regulatory concerns yet to be addressed, such as data control and user privacy. In 2021, China published the [[Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China]], its first national law addressing AI-related ethical concerns. In October 2022, the United States federal government announced a series of export controls and trade restrictions intended to restrict China's access to advanced [[Integrated circuit|computer chips]] for AI applications.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Gregory |title=Choking off China's Access to the Future of AI |url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai |website=Center for Strategic and International Studies |date=11 October 2022 |publisher=CSIS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Gregory C. |last2=Benson |first2=Emily |date=2023-03-01 |title=Clues to the U.S.-Dutch-Japanese Semiconductor Export Controls Deal Are Hiding in Plain Sight |url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/clues-us-dutch-japanese-semiconductor-export-controls-deal-are-hiding-plain-sight |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
The research and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in China started in the 1980s, with the announcement by Deng Xiaoping of the importance of science and technology for China's economic growth. Despite starting relatively late, Chinese AI development has achieved significant milestones in recent years, making it a notable contributor in both research and application of the AI field. It is noteworthy that Chinese policies have played a crucial role in driving AI advancement from the beginning, with AI being a significant part of China's national technology plan.

=== Late 1970s to early 2010s ===
Artificial intelligence research and development did not start until the late 1970s after [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]]s when [[Deng Xiaoping]] announced his famous phrase, "science and technology are primary productive forces" (科技是第一生产力). Deng's speech demonstrated China's commitment to [[technological innovation]]. While there was a lack of AI-related research between the 1950s and 1960s, some scholars believe this is due to the influence of [[cybernetics]] from the Soviet Union despite the [[Sino-Soviet split]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="kjdb.org">Cai, Zixing蔡自兴. '中国人工智能40年' (Forty Years of Artificial Intelligence in China), ''Science and Technology Review'' (科技导报), 2016, 34(15): 12 - 32. http://www.kjdb.org/CN/abstract/abstract13768.shtml</ref> In the 1980s, a group of Chinese scientists launched AI research led by [[Qian Xuesen]] and [[Wu Wenjun]].<ref name="kjdb.org" /> However, during the time, China's society still had a generally conservative view towards AI.<ref name="kjdb.org" /> Early AI development in China was difficult so China's government approached these challenges by sending Chinese scholars overseas to study AI and further providing government funds for research projects. The Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) was founded in September 1981 and was authorized by [[Ministry of Civil Affairs|the Ministry of Civil Affairs]].<ref name="ReferenceA">"Introduction to the Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence". ''中国人工智能学会''.</ref> Even now, CAAI is still the only national academic association in China that specializes in technology and intelligence science.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The first chairman of the executive committee was Qin Yuanxun, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Harvard University]]. In 1987, China's first research publication on artificial intelligence was published by [[Tsinghua University]]. Beginning in 1993, smart automation and intelligence have been part of China's national technology plan.<ref>Cai, Guoxing, '中国人工智能40年' (Forty Years of Artificial Intelligence in China), ''Science and Technology Review'' (科技导报), 2016, 34(15): 12 - 32 [http://www.kjdb.org/CN/abstract/abstract13768.shtml]</ref> 

Since the 2000s, China has further expanded its [[Research and development|R&D]] funds for AI and the number of government-sponsored research projects has dramatically increased. In 2001, Xinhua News Agency released a report titled "China's artificial intelligence research has entered a new era," announcing that China's AI research had transitioned from following foreign research to independent research after the 2001 National Conference of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence. The advancements presented during the conference have demonstrated China's ability to innovate in the field of AI and marked a new era of Chinese AI research.<ref>{{Cite web |title=我国人工智能研究进入新时期----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/ky/kyjz/200112/t20011211_1030998.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn}}</ref>

In 2006, China announced a policy priority for the development of artificial intelligence, which was included in the National Medium and Long Term Plan for the Development of Science and Technology (2006–2020), released by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].<ref name="yujia" />In the same year, artificial intelligence was also emphasized during the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan". In the guideline, the plan emphasized the need for systematic and in-depth research on information acquisition, processing, transmission, storage, reproduction, security, and utilization, as well as on the basic components of information systems, information processing environments, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, control theory, and other aspects, in order to provide a solid theoretical and technological foundation for China's information industry to achieve leapfrog development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=关于印发《国家重点基础研究发展计划（973计划）"十一五"发展纲要》的通知-中华人民共和国科学技术部 |url=https://www.most.gov.cn/xxgk/xinxifenlei/fdzdgknr/qtwj/qtwj2010before/200811/t20081129_65756.html |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.most.gov.cn}}</ref>

In 2011, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) established a branch in Beijing, China.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=【人民网】世界人工智能国际联合大会今秋将首次在中国举行----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/xw/cmsm/201302/t20130205_3761701.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn}}</ref> At same year, the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Award was founded in honor of Chinese mathematician Wu Wenjun, and it became the highest award for Chinese achievements in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The first award ceremony was held on May 14, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=科学网—首届吴文俊人工智能科学技术奖颁奖 |url=https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2012/5/264046.shtm |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=news.sciencenet.cn}}</ref> In 2013, the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) was held in Beijing, marking the first time the conference was held in China. This event coincided with the Chinese government's announcement of the "Chinese Intelligence Year," a significant milestone in China's development of artificial intelligence.<ref name=":2" />

=== Late 2010s to early 2020s ===
The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]] issued "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on 20 July 2017. In the document, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CCP Central Committee]] and the State Council urged governing bodies in China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the plan described AI as a strategic technology that has become a "focus of international competition".<ref name="State" /><sup>:2</sup> The document urged significant investment in a number of strategic areas related to AI and called for close cooperation between the state and private sectors. On the occasion of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the first plenary meeting of the Central Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee (CMCFDC), scholars from the [[National Defense University]] wrote in the ''[[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]]'' that the "transferability of social resources" between economic and military ends is an essential component to being a great power.<ref name="llcfr">{{cite web |last1=Laskai |first1=Lorand |title=Civil-Military Fusion: The Missing Link Between China's Technological and Military Rise |url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/civil-military-fusion-missing-link-between-chinas-technological-and-military-rise |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |date=29 January 2018}}</ref> During the Two Sessions 2017,"artificial intelligence plus" was proposed to be elevated to a strategic level.<ref>{{Cite web |title=【中国科学报】"人工智能+"应上升为国家战略----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/cm/201703/t20170308_4592629.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn}}</ref> The same year witnessed the emergence of multiple application-level usages in the medical field according to reports.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=【人民网】强强联合建医疗"阿尔法狗" 人工智能将问诊肿瘤----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/cm/201707/t20170710_4607962.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn}}</ref> Furthermore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) established their AI processor chip research lab in Nanjing, and introduced their first AI specialization chip 'Cambrian'.

In 2019, the application of Artificial Intelligence expanded to various fields such as quantum physics, geography, and medical research. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, at the beginning of 2020, Chinese researchers began developing their own LLM. One such example is the multimodal large model called 'Zidongtaichu.'<ref>{{Cite web |title=自动化所研发出跨模态通用人工智能平台"紫东太初"----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/syky/202107/t20210712_4798152.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn}}</ref> Several Chinese companies and academic institutions are actively involved in LLM research, including Baidu's Ernie.

=== Future projection ===
By 2025, the State Council aims for China to make fundamental contributions to basic AI theory and to solidify its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims for AI to become "the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of the core AI industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" /> By 2030, the State Council aims to have China be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of core AI industries to be worth 1 trillion [[Renminbi|RMB]], with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" />

=== Industry Readiness ===
Industry-wise, China's large population generates a massive amount of accessible data for companies and researchers, which offers a crucial advantage in the race of big data. For instance, [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] is one of the most widely AI applications in China. Collecting these large amounts of data from its residents helps further train and expand AI capabilities. China's market is not only conducive and valuable for corporations to further AI R&D but also offers tremendous economic potential attracting both international and domestic firms to join the AI market. The drastic development of the [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology]] (ICT) industry and AI chipsets in recent years are two examples of this.<ref>Li, D., Tong, T.

==China's AI Research & Development==
China's AI research and development crosses different sectors and organizations including private-public collaborations, academia-private collaborations, government-led projects, and many others. Many scholars believe China has adopted a 'catch-up' approach for its AI development, which is also apparent through policy documents.<ref>''Deciphering China's AI Dream''. (n.d.). University of Oxford. https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Deciphering_Chinas_AI-Dream.pdf</ref> For public AI R&D spending, China has outspent the U.S. government over the past few years.

Recent Chinese achievements in the field demonstrate China's potential to realize its goals for AI development. In 2015, China's leading AI company, [[Baidu]], created AI software capable of surpassing human levels of language recognition, almost a year in advance of [[Microsoft]], the nearest U.S. competitor.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Inside Baidu's Bid to Lead the AI Revolution {{!}} Backchannel|language=en|magazine=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/story/inside-baidu-artificial-intelligence/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920125930/https://www.wired.com/story/inside-baidu-artificial-intelligence/|archive-date=2019-09-20|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> In 2016 and 2017, Chinese teams won the top prize at the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, an international competition for [[computer vision]] systems.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tilley|first=Aaron|title=China's Rise In The Global AI Race Emerges As It Takes Over The Final ImageNet Competition|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2017/07/31/china-ai-imagenet/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528133046/https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2017/07/31/china-ai-imagenet/|archive-date=2019-05-28|access-date=2020-04-30|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> Many of these systems are now being integrated into China's [[Mass surveillance in China|domestic surveillance network]] and [[Social Credit System]], which aims to monitor, and based on social behavior, "grade" every Chinese citizen by 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Beijing to Judge Every Resident Based on Behavior by End of 2020|work=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-21/beijing-to-judge-every-resident-based-on-behavior-by-end-of-2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516173631/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-21/beijing-to-judge-every-resident-based-on-behavior-by-end-of-2020|archive-date=2020-05-16}}</ref>

In China, the majority of peer-reviewed AI publications are associated with academia, which made up approximately 95.4% of the total number in 2019 which is similar to the European Union.<ref name="Daniel Zhang 2021">Daniel Zhang, Saurabh Mishra, Erik Brynjolfsson, John Etchemendy, Deep Ganguli, Barbara Grosz, Terah Lyons, James Manyika, Juan Carlos Niebles, Michael Sellitto, Yoav Shoham, Jack Clark, and Raymond Perrault, "The AI Index 2021 Annual Report," AI Index Steering Committee, Human-Centered AI Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, March 2021.</ref> Interdisciplinary collaborations play an essential role in China's AI R&D, including academic-corporate collaboration, public-private collaborations, and international collaborations and projects with corporate-government partnerships are the most common.<ref name="Daniel Zhang 2021" /> The government incentivizes firms' [[technological innovation]] through policies, funding, and national endorsements.

==Industrial Impacts==

=== Economic Impact ===
According to McKinsey's 2017 report, China's economic growth would have approximately 0.8% - 1.4% annual growth rate from AI-led automation and increases in domestic productivity benefiting food services, agriculture, [[manufacturing]], and accommodation industries.<ref name="Barton, D. 2017">Barton, D., Woetze, J., Seong, J., & Tian, Q. (2017, April). Artificial Intelligence: Implications for China. McKinsey Global Institute.</ref> Other sources report slightly varied figures, such as Accenture whom estimated that AI would add 1.6% [[economic growth]] to China by 2035.<ref name=":3">Purdy, M., Qiu, S.

Most agencies hold optimistic views about AI's economic impact on China's long-term economic growth. In the past, traditional industries in China have struggled with the increase in labor costs due to the growing aging population in China and the low birth rate. With the deployment of AI, operational costs are expected to reduce while an increase in efficiency generates revenue growth.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=How China Is Using AI to Fuel the Next Industrial Revolution|url=https://time.com/6084158/china-ai-factory-future/|access-date=2022-02-04|magazine=Time|language=en}}</ref> Some highlight the importance of a clear policy and governmental support in order to overcome adoption barriers including costs and lack of properly trained technical talents and AI awareness.<ref name="Barton, D. 2017"/> However, there are concerns about China's deepening income inequality and the ever-expanding imbalanced labor market in China. Low- and medium-income workers might be the most negatively impacted by China's AI development because of rising demands for laborers with advanced skills.<ref name="Barton, D. 2017"/> Furthermore, China's economic growth might be disproportionately divided as a majority of AI-related industrial development is concentrated in coastal regions rather than inland.<ref name="Barton, D. 2017"/>

=== Military Impact ===
China is researching various types of air, land, sea, and [[Underwater environment|undersea]] autonomous vehicles. In the spring of 2017, a civilian Chinese university with ties to the military demonstrated an AI-enabled swarm of 1,000 uninhabited [[Aircraft|aerial vehicles]] at an airshow. A media report released afterwards showed a [[computer simulation]] of a similar [[Swarm behaviour|swarm]] formation finding and destroying a [[Rocket launcher|missile launcher]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Kania|first=Elsa B.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1029611044|title=Battlefield singularity : artificial intelligence, military revolution, and China's future military power|year=2017|location=Washington D.C|language=English|oclc=1029611044}}</ref><sup>:23</sup> Open-source publications indicated that China is also developing a suite of AI tools for [[Cyberwarfare|cyber operations]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>:27</sup><ref name=":1" /> Chinese development of military AI is largely influenced by China's observation of U.S. plans for defense innovation and fears of a widening "generational gap" in comparison to the U.S. military. Similar to U.S. military concepts, China aims to use AI for exploiting large troves of intelligence, generating a common operating picture, and accelerating [[battlefield]] decision-making.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:12-14</sup><ref name=":1" />

China's management of its AI ecosystem contrasts with that of the United States.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:6</sup> In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university [[Research institute|research laboratories]], the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties the Chinese government created a [[Military-Civil Fusion]] Development Commission which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military in January 2017.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:19</sup><ref name="yujia"/> In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to [[data collection]] and lower costs of [[Labeled data|data labeling]] to create the large databases on which AI systems train.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China's AI Awakening中国 人工智能 的崛起|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/10/148284/chinas-ai-awakening/|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> According to one estimate, China is on track to possess 20% of the world's share of data by 2020, with the potential to have over 30% by 2030.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:12</sup><ref name=":1" />

=== Academia ===
Although in 2004, [[Peking University]] introduced the first academic course on AI which led other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline, especially since China faces challenges in recruiting and retaining AI engineers and researchers.<ref name="Nature" /> Over half of the data scientists in the United States have been working in the field for over 10 years, while roughly the same proportion of data scientists in China have less than 5 years of experience. As of 2017, fewer than 30 Chinese Universities produce AI-focused [[Expert|experts]] and research products.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Barton|first1=Dominic|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/China/Artificial%20intelligence%20Implications%20for%20China/MGI-Artificial-intelligence-implications-for-China.ashx|title=Artificial Intelligence: Implications for China|last2=Woetzel|first2=Jonathan|last3=Seong|first3=Jeongmin|last4=Tian|first4=Qinzheng|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|year=2017|access-date=2020-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421231712/https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/China/Artificial%20intelligence%20Implications%20for%20China/MGI-Artificial-intelligence-implications-for-China.ashx|archive-date=2020-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref><sup>:8</sup> Although China surpassed the United States in the number of research papers produced from 2011 to 2015, the quality of its published papers, as judged by peer citations, ranked 34th globally.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Which countries and universities are leading on AI research?|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/data-bites/which-countries-and-universities-are-leading-ai-research|date=2017-05-22|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302023847/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/data-bites/which-countries-and-universities-are-leading-ai-research|archive-date=2020-03-02|url-status=live}}</ref> China especially want to address military applications and so the [[Beijing Institute of Technology]], one of China's premier institutes for [[Weapon|weapons]] research, recently established the first children's educational program in military AI in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China's brightest children recruited to develop AI 'killer bots'|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2172141/chinas-brightest-children-are-being-recruited-develop-ai-killer|date=2018-11-08|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109181819/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2172141/chinas-brightest-children-are-being-recruited-develop-ai-killer|archive-date=2020-01-09|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

=== Ethical Concerns ===
For the past years, there are discussions about AI safety and ethical concerns in both private and public sectors. In 2021, China's Ministry of Science and Technology published the first national ethical guideline, '<nowiki/>''the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Ethics Code''' on the topic of AI with specific emphasis on user protection, data privacy, and [[security]].<ref name="scmp.com">{{Cite web|date=2021-10-03|title=Chinese AI has new ethical guidelines that curb Big Tech's algorithms|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3150789/chinese-ai-gets-ethical-guidelines-first-time-aligning-beijings-goal|access-date=2022-02-04|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref> This document acknowledges the power of AI and quick technology adaptation by the big corporations for user engagements.

[[Data security]] has been the most common topic in AI ethical discussion worldwide, and many national governments have established legislation addressing [[Information privacy|data privacy]] and security. The [[Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China]] was enacted in 2017 aiming to address new challenges raised by AI development. This document includes sections about cybersecurity promotion, network operation security, [[information security]], emergency responses, and legal responsibility.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Translation: Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China (Effective June 1, 2017)|url=https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/|access-date=2022-02-04|website=DigiChina|language=en}}</ref> In 2021, China's new [[Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China|Data Security Law]] (DSL) was passed by the PRC congress, setting up a regulatory framework classifying all kinds of [[data collection]] and [[Storage (memory)|storage]] in China.<ref name="Horwitz">{{Cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|date=2021-08-27|title=China's coming data laws leave firms with more questions than answers|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-coming-data-laws-leave-firms-with-more-questions-than-answers-2021-08-27/|access-date=2022-02-04}}</ref> This means all tech companies in China are required to classify their data into categories listed in Digital.
