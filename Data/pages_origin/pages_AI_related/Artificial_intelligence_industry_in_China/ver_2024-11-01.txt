The '''artificial intelligence''' '''industry in China''' is a rapidly developing multi-billion dollar industry. The roots of China's AI development started in the late 1970s following [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Economic reform in China|economic reform]]s emphasizing [[Science and technology in China|science and technology]] as the country's primary productive force.

The initial stages of China's AI development were slow and encountered significant challenges due to  lack of resources and talent. At the beginning China was behind most [[Western world|Western countries]] in terms of AI development. A majority of the research was led by scientists who had received [[higher education]] abroad.<ref name=":9">{{Citation |last1=Chang |first1=Huey-Meei |title=Foreign support, alliances, and technology transfer |date=2022-06-22 |work=Chinese Power and Artificial Intelligence |pages=36–54 |edition=1 |place=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |language=en |doi=10.4324/9781003212980-4 |isbn=978-1-003-21298-0 |last2=Hannas |first2=William C.}}</ref>

==History==
The research and development of artificial intelligence in China started in the 1980s, with the announcement by [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the importance of science and technology for China's economic growth.<ref name=":10">{{Citation |last1=Luong |first1=Ngor |title=State plans, research, and funding |date=2022-06-22 |work=Chinese Power and Artificial Intelligence |pages=3–18 |edition=1 |place=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |language=en |doi=10.4324/9781003212980-2 |isbn=978-1-003-21298-0 |last2=Fedasiuk |first2=Ryan}}</ref>

=== Late 1970s to early 2010s ===
Artificial intelligence research and development did not start until the late 1970s after Deng Xiaoping's [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]]s.<ref name=":10" /> While there was a lack of AI-related research between the 1950s and 1960s, some scholars believe this is due to the influence of [[cybernetics]] from the Soviet Union despite the [[Sino-Soviet split]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="kjdb.org">{{Cite journal |last=蔡自兴 |title=中国人工智能40 年 |url=http://www.kjdb.org/CN/abstract/abstract13768.shtml |journal=科技导报 |date=13 August 2016 |language=zh |volume=34 |issue=15 |pages=12–32 |doi=10.3981/j.issn.1000-7857.2016.15.001 |doi-broken-date=2024-09-17 |issn=1000-7857 |access-date=2022-02-07 |archive-date=2022-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120214140/http://www.kjdb.org/CN/abstract/abstract13768.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 1980s, a group of Chinese scientists launched AI research led by [[Qian Xuesen]] and [[Wu Wenjun]].<ref name="kjdb.org" /> However, during the time, China's society still had a generally conservative view towards AI.<ref name="kjdb.org" /> Early AI development in China was difficult so China's government approached these challenges by sending Chinese scholars overseas to study AI and further providing government funds for research projects. The Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) was founded in September 1981 and was authorized by [[Ministry of Civil Affairs|the Ministry of Civil Affairs]].<ref name="ReferenceA">"Introduction to the Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence".

=== Late 2010s to early 2020s ===
The State Council of China issued "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on 20 July 2017. In the document, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CCP Central Committee]] and the State Council urged governing bodies in China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the plan described AI as a strategic technology that has become a "focus of international competition".<ref name="State" /><sup>:2</sup> The document urged significant investment in a number of strategic areas related to AI and called for close cooperation between the state and private sectors. On the occasion of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the first plenary meeting of the Central Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee (CMCFDC), scholars from the [[National Defense University]] wrote in the ''[[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]]'' that the "transferability of social resources" between economic and military ends is an essential component to being a great power.<ref name="llcfr">{{cite web |last1=Laskai |first1=Lorand |title=Civil-Military Fusion: The Missing Link Between China's Technological and Military Rise |url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/civil-military-fusion-missing-link-between-chinas-technological-and-military-rise |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |date=29 January 2018 |access-date=3 June 2020 |archive-date=18 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200718153255/https://www.cfr.org/blog/civil-military-fusion-missing-link-between-chinas-technological-and-military-rise |url-status=live }}</ref> During the Two Sessions 2017,"artificial intelligence plus" was proposed to be elevated to a strategic level.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web |title=【中国科学报】"人工智能+"应上升为国家战略----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/cm/201703/t20170308_4592629.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn |archive-date=2023-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230504102031/https://www.cas.cn/cm/201703/t20170308_4592629.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> The same year witnessed the emergence of multiple application-level usages in the medical field according to reports.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=【人民网】强强联合建医疗"阿尔法狗" 人工智能将问诊肿瘤----中国科学院 |url=https://www.cas.cn/cm/201707/t20170710_4607962.shtml |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.cas.cn |archive-date=2023-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230504102029/https://www.cas.cn/cm/201707/t20170710_4607962.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS) established their AI processor chip research lab in Nanjing, and introduced their first AI specialization chip, Cambrian.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

==Government goals==
According to a February 2019 publication by the [[Center for a New American Security]], [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] – believes that being at the forefront of AI technology will be critical to the future of global military and economic power competition.<ref name=":5">{{Cite report |url=https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/understanding-chinas-ai-strategy |title=Understanding China's AI Strategy: Clues to Chinese Strategic Thinking on Artificial Intelligence and National Security |last=Allen |first=Gregory C. |date=2019 |publisher=[[Center for a New American Security]] |jstor=resrep20446 |access-date=2019-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207153440/https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/understanding-chinas-ai-strategy |archive-date=2019-02-07 |url-status=live |jstor-access=free}}</ref> By 2025, the State Council aims for China to make fundamental contributions to basic AI theory and to solidify its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims for AI to become "the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time.<ref name="State" /> By 2030, the State Council aims to have China be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system."<ref name="State" />

According to academics Karen M. Sutter and Zachary Arnold, the Chinese government "seeks to meld state planning and control while some operational flexibility for firms. In this context, China's AI firms are hybrid players. The state guides their activity, funds, and shields them from foreign competition through domestic market protections, creating asymmetric advantages as they expand offshore."<ref>{{Citation |last1=Sutter |first1=Karen M. |title=China's AI companies: Hybrid players |date=2022-06-22 |work=Chinese Power and Artificial Intelligence |pages=19–35 |edition=1 |place=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |language=en |doi=10.4324/9781003212980-3 |isbn=978-1-003-21298-0 |last2=Arnold |first2=Zachary}}</ref>

The CCP's [[fourteenth five-year plan]] reaffirmed AI as a top research priority and ranks AI first among "frontier industries" that the Chinese government aims to focus on through 2035.<ref name=":10" /> The AI industry is a strategic sector often supported by [[China Government Guidance Fund|China's government guidance funds]].<ref name=":622">{{Cite book |last=Lan |first=Xiaohuan |title=How China Works: An Introduction to China's State-led Economic Development |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2024 |isbn=978-981-97-0079-0 |translator-last=Topp |translator-first=Gary |doi=10.1007/978-981-97-0080-6}}</ref>{{Rp|page=167}}
