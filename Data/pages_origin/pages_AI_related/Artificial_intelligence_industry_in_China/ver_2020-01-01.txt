In 2017 China issued a [[Artificial intelligence industry in China#New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan|plan]] to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.

==History==
China's State Council issued the "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CCP Central Committee]] and the State Council urge the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council plans to spend $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in [[Mentougou District|Mentougou district]].<ref name="Nature" /> In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments.<ref name="State">{{cite web|title=State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan|url=https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf|publisher=New America|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}</ref>

Some of stated motivations that the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has given for pursuing its AI strategy include the potential of artificial intelligence for industrial transformation, better social governance and maintaining social stability.<ref name="State" />

==Plan==
The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy.{{fact|date=May 2019}} By 2020, the State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" /> By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that "AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" /> And by 2030, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" />

==Reception==
An article published by the [[Center for a New American Security]] concluded that "Chinese government officials demonstrated remarkably keen understanding of the issues surrounding AI and international security...this includes knowledge of U.S. AI policy discussions." and recommended that "the U.S. policymaking community similarly prioritize cultivating expertise and understanding of AI developments in China" and "funding, focus, and a willingness among U.S. policymakers to drive large-scale necessary change."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/understanding-chinas-ai-strategy|title=Understanding China's AI Strategy|last=Allen|first=Gregory|date=February 6, 2019|website=www.cnas.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> An article in the [[MIT Technology Review]] similarly concluded: "China might have unparalleled resources and enormous untapped potential, but the West has world-­leading expertise and a strong research culture. Rather than worry about China’s progress, it would be wise for Western nations to focus on their existing strengths, investing heavily in research and education."<ref name="Knight">{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=China's AI Awakening|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609038/chinas-ai-awakening/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|agency=MIT|publisher=Technology Review|date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>
