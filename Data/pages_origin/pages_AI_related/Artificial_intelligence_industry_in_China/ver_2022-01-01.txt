The '''artificial intelligence industry in China''' is a rapidly developing multi-billion dollar industry. As of 2021, the market of artificial intelligence is worth about [[Renminbi|RMB]] 150 billion (US$23.196 billion), and the figure is projected to reach RMB 400 billion (US$61.855 billion) by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/artificial-intelligence-china-shenzhen-first-local-ai-regulations-key-areas-coverage/|title=Artificial Intelligence in China: Shenzhen Releases First Local Regulations |website=china-briefing |date=29 July 2021 |first=Alexander |last=Chipman Koty}}</ref> Since 2006, China has steadily developed a national agenda for artificial intelligence development, and has emerged as one of the leading nations in artificial intelligence research and development.<ref name="yujia">{{Cite book|last=Yujia He|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/publication/how_china_is_preparing_for_ai_powered_future.pdf|title=How China is preparing for an AI-powered Future|publisher=The Wilson Center|year=2017}}</ref>

==History==
In 2006, China announced the policy priority in development of artificial intelligence, which is included in the National Medium and Long Term Plan for the Development of Science and Technology (2006-2020), released by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].<ref name="yujia" />

The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]] issued the "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CCP Central Committee]] and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] urged the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the plan describes AI as a “strategic technology” that has become a “focus of international competition”.<ref name="State" /><sup>:2</sup> The document urges significant investment in a number of strategic areas related to AI and calls for close cooperation between the state and private sector. On the occasion of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's speech at the first plenary meeting of the CMCFDC, scholars from the [[National Defense University]] in their analysis of the integration of military and civilian development wrote in the [[People's Liberation Army Daily|PLA Daily]] that the "transferability of social resources" between economic and military ends is an essential component to being a great power.<ref name="llcfr">{{cite web |last1=Laskai |first1=Lorand |title=Civil-Military Fusion: The Missing Link Between China's Technological and Military Rise |url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/civil-military-fusion-missing-link-between-chinas-technological-and-military-rise |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |date=29 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, the State Council budgeted $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in [[Mentougou District|Mentougou district]].<ref name="Nature" /> In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments.<ref name="State">{{cite web|title=State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan|url=https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf|publisher=New America|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413022950/https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf|archive-date=April 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some of the stated motivations that the State Council has given for pursuing its AI strategy include the potential of artificial intelligence for industrial transformation, better social governance and maintaining social stability.<ref name="State" /> The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy.<ref name="State" /> By 2020, the State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" />

By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that "AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" />

By 2030, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.<ref name="State" />

China is researching various types of air, land, sea, and undersea autonomous vehicles. In the spring of 2017, a civilian Chinese university with ties to the military demonstrated an AI-enabled swarm of 1,000 uninhabited aerial vehicles at an airshow. A media report released after the fact showed a computer simulation of a similar swarm formation finding and destroying a missile launcher.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Kania, Elsa B., author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1029611044|title=Battlefield singularity : artificial intelligence, military revolution, and China's future military power|oclc=1029611044}}</ref><sup>:23</sup> Open-source publications indicate that China is also developing a suite of AI tools for [[Cyberwarfare|cyber operations]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>:27</sup> <ref name=":1" />

Chinese development of military AI is influenced in large part by China's observation of U.S. plans for defense innovation and fears of a widening “generational gap” in comparison to the U.S. military. Similar to U.S. military concepts, the Chinese aim to use AI for exploiting large troves of intelligence, generating a common operating picture, and accelerating battlefield decision-making.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:12-14</sup><ref name=":1" />

China's management of its AI ecosystem contrasts with that of the United States.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:6</sup> In general, few boundaries exist between Chinese commercial companies, university research laboratories, the military, and the central government. As a result, the Chinese government has a direct means of guiding AI development priorities and accessing technology that was ostensibly developed for civilian purposes. To further strengthen these ties, the Chinese government created  in January 2017 a [[Military-Civil Fusion]] Development Commission, which is intended to speed the transfer of AI technology from commercial companies and research institutions to the military.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:19</sup><ref name=yujia>{{Cite book|last=Yujia He|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/publication/how_china_is_preparing_for_ai_powered_future.pdf|title=How China is preparing for an AI-powered Future|publisher=The Wilson Center|year=2017}}</ref> In addition, the Chinese government is leveraging both lower barriers to [[data collection]] and lower costs to [[Labeled data|data labeling]] to create the large databases on which AI systems train.<ref>{{Cite web|title=China's AI Awakening中国 人工智能 的崛起|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/10/148284/chinas-ai-awakening/|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> According to one estimate, China is on track to possess 20% of the world's share of data by 2020, with the potential to have over 30% by 2030.<ref name=":0" /><sup>:12</sup><ref name=":1" />

Some experts believe that China's intent to be the first to develop military AI applications may result in comparatively less safe applications, as China will likely be more risk-acceptant throughout the development process. These experts stated that it would be unethical for the U.S. military to sacrifice safety standards for the sake of external time pressures, but that the United States’ more conservative approach to AI development may result in more capable systems in the long run.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Congressional Research Service|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R45178.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence and National Security|publisher=Congressional Research Service|year=2019|location=Washington, DC|access-date=2020-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200508062631/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R45178.pdf|archive-date=2020-05-08|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><sup>:23</sup>
