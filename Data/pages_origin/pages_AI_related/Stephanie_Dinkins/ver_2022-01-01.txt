Dinkins was born in [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] to [[African Americans|Black American]] parents who raised her in Staten Island, New York.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Conversation With Stephanie Dinkins|url=http://www.conversationprojectnyc.com/blog/2018/12/21/a-conversation-with-stephanie-dinkins|last=Brett|first=Wallace|date=December 21, 2018|website=Conversation Project NYC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref> She credits her grandmother with teaching her how to think about art as a social practice, saying "my grandmother . . . was a gardner and the garden was her art . . . that was a community practice."<ref>{{Citation|last=Grass|first=A.

== Activism ==
Dinkins advocates for co-creation within a [[Social practice (art)|social practice art]] framework, so that vulnerable communities understand how to use technology to their advantage, instead of being subjected to their use.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cizek|first=Katerina|title=Part 6: Media Co-Creation with Non-Human Systems|date=2019-06-03|url=https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6|work=Collective Wisdom|publisher=MIT Press|access-date=2020-02-25|last2=Uricchio|first2=William|last3=Wolozin|first3=Sarah}}</ref> This is exemplified in her works such as ''Project al-Khwarzmi'', a series of workshops entitled ''PAK POP-UP'' at the nonprofit community center Recess in Brooklyn, NY. The workshops involved collaborating with youth in the [[criminal justice]] system and uplifting the voices of vulnerable communities in determining how technologies are created and utilized.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=Robots, Race, and Algorithms: Stephanie Dinkins at Recess Assembly|url=http://magazine.art21.org/2017/11/07/robots-race-and-algorithms-stephanie-dinkins-at-recess-assembly/|website=Art21 Magazine|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recessart.org/stephaniedinkins/|title=Stephanie Dinkins|year=2017|website=Recess Art|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> Dinkins warns of the dangers to members of minority groups that are absent from the creation of the computer algorithms that now affect their lives.<ref name="Thackara">{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artist-working-artificial-intelligence-white|title=Human Biases Are Built into AI—this Artist Is Helping to Change That|last=Thackara|first=Tess|date=2018-05-15|website=Artsy|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-10-19|title=Five Artificial Intelligence Insiders in Their Own Words|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/business/five-artificial-intelligence-insiders-in-their-own-words.html|access-date=2021-03-31|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

== Art ==
Dinkins's practice employs technologies including, but not limited to [[New media art|new media]] such as [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]]. Dinkins uses [[oral history]] techniques of interviewing to craft community-authored narratives and databases which inform the subjects of her work and serve as acts of social intervention or protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stonybrook.edu/magazine/visualizing-equality-in-ai/|title=Visualizing Equality in AI {{!}}|date=2020-03-02|website=SBU News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>

=== Conversations with Bina48 (2014-present) ===
''Conversations with Bina48'' is a series of recorded conversations with [[BINA48]], a social robot that resembles a middle-aged black woman.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Future Perfect: Flux Factory’s Intersectional Approach to Technology|url=https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/future-perfect-a-call-for-intersectional-technology-at-flux-factory-58475/|last=Small|first=Zachary|date=2017-04-07|website=ARTnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2018/07/artseen/Multiply-Identify-Her|title=Multiply, Identify, Her|first=Anna|last=Dunn|date=July 11, 2018|website=The Brooklyn Rail}}</ref> Dinkins [[mirroring|mirrors]] Bina48 while they discuss identity and [[technological singularity]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.art21.org/2017/11/07/robots-race-and-algorithms-stephanie-dinkins-at-recess-assembly/|title=Robots, Race, and Algorithms: Stephanie Dinkins at Recess Assembly|website=Art21 Magazine}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Hanson Robotics]], an engineering and robotics company known for its development of humanoid robots, developed and released [[BINA48]]. Bina48 is a robot modeled after the memories, beliefs, attitudes, commentary and mannerisms of Bina Aspen Rothblatt,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hansonrobotics.com/bina48-9/|title=BINA48|website=Hanson Robotics|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> the spousal partner of [[Martine Rothblatt]]. Both Bina and Martine Rothblatt own Bina48 under their organization, the [[Terasem Movement]] Foundation.

Five years after Bina48 was released, Dinkins came across a [[YouTube]] video of Bina48. She asked, "how did a black woman become the most advanced of the technologies at the time?" Her questioning led her to travel to [[Lincoln, Vermont]] (the site of the Terasem Movement Foundation) where she conducted a series of interviews with Bina48 and engaged the robot in conversations pertaining to race, intimacy and the nature of being.<ref name="Thackara"/><ref>{{Cite web|title="Uncanny Valley" Advocates a Sensual Understanding of Digital Life|url=https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/aia-reviews/uncanny-valley-de-young-artificial-intelligence-1202683466/|last=Karl|first=Brian|date=2020-04-09|website=ARTnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref>

The conversations suggest opportunities for complementing human existence with artificially intelligent agents that have an identity and history, but also show artificial intelligence's current limitations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kunstforum.de/artikel/stephanie-dinkins/|title=Stephanie Dinkins|website=www.kunstforum.de}}</ref> Although it is based on a black woman, Dinkins found that Bina48 was shaped by the biases of its white, male creators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interactive: Art(ificial intelligence)|url=https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/living-with-artificial-intelligence/art-ificial-intelligence/|last=Ramani|first=Madvi|date=2018-05-22|website=www.wilsonquarterly.com|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>

=== Project al Kwarizmi (PAK) (2017-present) ===
''Project al Kwarizmi (PAK)'' was a series of pop up workshops in Brooklyn, NY at [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] and [[Recess Activities|Recess]]; [[Manhattan]], New York at [[Google]]; and [[Durham, North Carolina]] at [[Duke University]]. The workshops were centered for "communities of color that use art as a vehicle to help citizens understand how algorithms, the artificially intelligent systems they underpin, and big data impact their lives and empowers them to do something about it. Project al-Khwarizmi uses art and aesthetics as the common language to help citizens understand what algorithms and artificial intelligent systems are, and where these systems already impact our daily lives."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Stephanie Dinkins|url=https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

=== Not the Only One (N'TOO) (2018-present) ===
''Not the only one (N’TOO)'' is a voice-interactive [[chatbot]] that was trained with data from members of her family to tell a multi-generational story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://garage.vice.com/en_us/article/43kdnm/stephanie-dinkins-is-turning-memoir-into-ai|title=Stephanie Dinkins Is Turning Memoir Into AI|first=Tatum|last=Dooley|date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> Dinkins described Not The Only One (NTOO or N'TOO) as an "experimental" multigenerational memoir of one [[African Americans|Black American]] family told from the "mind" of an artificial intelligence of evolving intellect. N'TOO uses a [[recursive neural network]], a [[deep learning]] algorithm.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC Radio 4 - New Ways of Seeing, Digital Justice|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0004mc4|publisher=BBC|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> It is a voice-interactive AI robot designed, trained, and aligned with the needs and ideals of black and brown people who are drastically underrepresented in the tech sector. NTOO can also be described as a "physically embodied artificially intelligent agent that senses and acts on its world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiartists.org/stephanie-dinkins|title=Stephanie Dinkins – Artist Profile (Photos, Videos, Exhibitions)|website=AIArtists.org|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>
