{{Short description|Science fiction theme}}
'''Simulated consciousness,''' '''synthetic consciousness''', etc. is a theme of a number of works in [[science fiction]]. The theme is one step beyond the concept of the "[[brain in a vat]]"/"[[simulated reality]]" in that not only the perceived reality but the [[brain]] and its [[consciousness]] are simulations themselves.

[[Stanislaw Lem]]'s [[professor Corcoran]] (met by [[Ijon Tichy]] during his interstellar travels, first published by Lem in 1961<ref name="corc">{{cite book|last=Lem|first=Stanislaw|title=Memoirs of a Space Traveler: Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DNVzphAHD0C&pg=PA39|access-date=29 July 2013|date=1 February 2000|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-1732-7|page=39}}</ref>) simulated conscious agents (personoids) to actually test the viability of the "[[simulation hypothesis]]" of the reality, i.e., the idea of [[solipsism]].<ref name="Swirski2006">{{cite book|last=Swirski|first=Peter|title=The Art and Science of Stanislaw Lem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8bPGfcFI40C&pg=PA118|access-date=29 July 2013|date=27 July 2006|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-7507-3|page=118}}</ref>

In the 1954 story ''[[The Tunnel under the World]]'' by [[Frederik Pohl]], a whole city was simulated in order to run tests of the efficiency of advertising campaigns, and the plot evolves from the point when one "simulacrum" suddenly notices that every day is June 15.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stratmann|first=H.

Galouye]] (alternative title: ''Counterfeit World''), which tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes. In this city the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Tom A.|title=Echoes of Other Worlds: Sound in Virtual Reality: Past, Present and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbszDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA141|year=2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-65708-0|page=141}}</ref>

Furthermore, various novels by [[Greg Egan]] such as ''[[Permutation City]]'' (1994), ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' (1997) and ''[[Schild's Ladder]]'' (2002) explore the concept of simulated consciousness.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Interview With Greg Egan {{!}} Counting Backwards From Infinity |url=http://eidolon.net/eidolon_magazine/issue_15/15_egan.htm |journal=Eidolon Magazine |volume=15 |date=July 1994 |pages=42â€“45 |access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref>
