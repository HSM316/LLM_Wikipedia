The '''unique name assumption''' is a simplifying assumption made in some [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] languages and [[description logic]]s. In logics with the unique name assumption, different names always refer to different entities in the world.<ref>{{Cite AIMA |edition=2 |pages=333}}</ref>
It was included in [[Ray Reiter]]'s discussion of the [[closed-world assumption]] often tacitly included in Database Management Systems (e.g. SQL)  in his 1984 article "Towards a logical reconstruction of relational database theory" (in M. L. Brodie, J. Mylopoulos, J. W. Schmidt (editors), Data Modelling in Artificial Intelligence, Database and Programming Languages, Springer, 1984, pages 191â€“233). 

The standard ontology language [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] does not make this assumption, but provides explicit constructs to express whether two names denote the same or distinct entities.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Jiao |last1=Tao |first2=Evren |last2=Sirin |first3=Jie |last3=Bao |first4=Deborah L. |last4=McGuinness |title=Integrity constraints in OWL |conference=Proc.

* <code>owl:sameAs</code> is the OWL property that asserts that two given names or identifiers (e.g., URIs) refer to the same individual or entity.
* <code>owl:differentFrom</code> is the OWL property that asserts that two given names or identifiers (e.g., URIs) refer to different individuals or entities.
