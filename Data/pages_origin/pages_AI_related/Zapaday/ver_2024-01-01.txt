'''Zapaday''' is a global [[news]] [[calendar]]. The website publishes upcoming news headlines per day and per topic as a resource for journalists, bloggers, political analysts, marketers, event organisers, public relation professionals, scientists and travellers. Zapaday uses both [[Internet bot|bots]] and [[human]] [[editor]]s to monitor over 4,000 news sites and calendars for future news stories, publishing its findings as news events on categorized calendars.

Users can create and publish their own events and calendars, re-using events and calendars of others for personal use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejc.net/resources/article/zapaday/|title=About Zapaday section on Zapaday site|publisher=European Journalism Centre|date=October 5, 2011}}</ref> On March 6, 2014, Zapaday launched a new subscription service with paid premium news calendars. The company also announced a new marketplace where journalists can syndicate curated news calendars as premium content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zapaday.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/20140306-Zapaday-Premium-and-Syndicated-Calendars-EN1.pdf |title=Zapaday launches Premium News Calendars, offers new Revenue Opportunity to Journalists |date=March 6, 2014}}</ref> The new model invites journalists and content creators to publish premium calendars and receive 50 per cent of earnings, while Zapaday will receive 20 per cent for hosting and handling. The remaining 30 per cent go to the seller, who can be either the content creator themselves, Zapaday, or one of the news agencies or other resellers that offer a [[white-label]] version of Zapaday to their clients.

Calendar events from Zapaday can be exported to a user's [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[Google Calendar]], or a mobile phone at any time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appvita.com/2012/03/23/zapaday-a-wiki-style-events-calendar//|title=Zapaday – A Wiki-Style Events Calendar|publisher=Appvita|date=March 23, 2012}}</ref>
