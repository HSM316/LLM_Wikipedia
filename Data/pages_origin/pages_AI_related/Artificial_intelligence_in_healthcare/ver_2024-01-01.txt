{{Artificial intelligence}}
'''Artificial intelligence in healthcare''' is a term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software, or [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data, or to exceed human capabilities by providing new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-11 |title=Developing an aging clock using deep learning on retinal images |url=https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/developing-aging-clock-using-deep.html |access-date=2023-06-01 |website=ai.googleblog.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullainathan S, Obermeyer Z | title = Solving medicine's data bottleneck: Nightingale Open Science | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 897–899 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 35534570 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-022-01804-4 | s2cid = 248668494 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data.

The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between clinical data and patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guide to medical informatics, the Internet and telemedicine.|vauthors=Coiera E|date=1997|publisher=Chapman & Hall, Ltd.}}</ref> AI programs are applied to practices such as [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Medical guideline|treatment protocol]] development, [[drug development]], [[personalized medicine]], and [[patient monitoring]] and care. What differentiates AI technology from traditional technologies in healthcare is the ability to gather larger and more diverse data, process it, and produce a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through [[machine learning]] [[algorithms]] and [[deep learning]]. Because radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Scott J. |last2=Henderson |first2=Robert D.

To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are [[black box]]es; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used.<ref name="Luca_2016">{{cite news | vauthors = Luca M, Kleinberg J, Mullainathan S |date=January–February 2016 |url=https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too |title=Algorithms Need Managers, Too  |work=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>

== Systems applications ==

=== Disease diagnosis ===

An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are several types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases, such as support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees. Each of these techniques is described as having a "training goal" so "classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible…".

To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases including using [[Artificial neural network|artificial neural networks (ANN)]] and [[Bayesian network]]s (BN). It was found that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Through the use of machine learning classifiers (MLC's), artificial intelligence has been able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the manipulation of mass [[electronic health record]]s (EHR's).<ref name="Liang_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang H, Tsui BY, Ni H, Valentim CC, Baxter SL, Liu G, Cai W, Kermany DS, Sun X, Chen J, He L, Zhu J, Tian P, Shao H, Zheng L, Hou R, Hewett S, Li G, Liang P, Zang X, Zhang Z, Pan L, Cai H, Ling R, Li S, Cui Y, Tang S, Ye H, Huang X, He W, Liang W, Zhang Q, Jiang J, Yu W, Gao J, Ou W, Deng Y, Hou Q, Wang B, Yao C, Liang Y, Zhang S, Duan Y, Zhang R, Gibson S, Zhang CL, Li O, Zhang ED, Karin G, Nguyen N, Wu X, Wen C, Xu J, Xu W, Wang B, Wang W, Li J, Pizzato B, Bao C, Xiang D, He W, He S, Zhou Y, Haw W, Goldbaum M, Tremoulet A, Hsu CN, Carter H, Zhu L, Zhang K, Xia H | display-authors = 6 | title = Evaluation and accurate diagnoses of pediatric diseases using artificial intelligence | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–438 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30742121 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-018-0335-9 | s2cid = 59945159 }}</ref> Medical conditions have grown more complex, and with a vast history of electronic medical records building, the likelihood of case duplication is high.<ref name="Liang_2019" /> Although someone today with a rare illness is less likely to be the only person to have had any given disease, the inability to access cases from similarly symptomatic origins is a major roadblock for physicians.<ref name="Liang_2019" /> The implementation of AI to not only help find similar cases and treatments, such as through early predictors of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Q, Yang X, Xu J, Guo Y, He X, Hu H, Lyu T, Marra D, Miller A, Smith G, DeKosky S, Boyce RD, Schliep K, Shenkman E, Maraganore D, Wu Y, Bian J | display-authors = 6 | title = Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias using real-world electronic health records | journal = Alzheimer's & Dementia | pages = 3506–3518 | date = February 2023 | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pmid = 36815661 | doi = 10.1002/alz.12967 | s2cid = 257101613 | doi-access = free }}</ref> but also factor in chief symptoms and help the physicians ask the most appropriate questions helps the patient receive the most accurate diagnosis and treatment possible.<ref name="Liang_2019" />

Recent developments in [[statistical physics]], [[machine learning]], and [[inference]] algorithms are being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches.<ref name="pmid33228143">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramezanpour A, Beam AL, Chen JH, Mashaghi A | title = Statistical Physics for Medical Diagnostics: Learning, Inference, and Optimization Algorithms | journal = Diagnostics | location = Basel, Switzerland | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | date = November 2020 | page = 972 | pmid = 33228143 | pmc = 7699346 | doi = 10.3390/diagnostics10110972 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Combining the skills of medical professionals and machines can help overcome decision-making weaknesses in medical practice. To do so, one needs precise disease definitions and a probabilistic analysis of symptoms and molecular profiles. Physicists have been studying similar problems for years, using microscopic elements and their interactions to extract macroscopic states of various physical systems. Physics inspired machine learning approaches can thus be applied to study disease processes and to perform biomarker analysis.

=== Telemedicine ===
[[File:Elderly_Man_Using_Pulse_Oximeter.jpg|thumb|An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels]]
The increase of [[Telehealth|telemedicine]], the treatment of patients remotely, has shown the rise of possible AI applications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamet P, Tremblay J | title = Artificial intelligence in medicine | journal = Metabolism | volume = 69S | pages = S36–S40 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28126242 | doi = 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.01.011 | series = Insights Into the Future of Medicine: Technologies, Concepts, and Integration }}</ref> AI can assist in caring for patients remotely by monitoring their information through sensors.<ref name="Pivovarov_2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pivovarov R, Elhadad N | title = Automated methods for the summarization of electronic health records | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 938–947 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25882031 | pmc = 4986665 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocv032 | s2cid = 1452 }}</ref> A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of.<ref name="Pivovarov_2015" />

Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on [[Artificial intelligence in mental health|chatbots for mental healthcare]] does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kretzschmar K, Tyroll H, Pavarini G, Manzini A, Singh I | title = Can Your Phone Be Your Therapist?

Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations.<ref name="Pouke_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pouke M, Häkkilä J | title = Elderly healthcare monitoring using an avatar-based 3D virtual environment | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 7283–7298 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24351747 | pmc = 3881167 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph10127283 | s2cid = 18535954 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person's regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal.<ref name="Pouke_2013" /> Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person's privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions.<ref name="Pouke_2013" />

=== Electronic health records ===
Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, the next step is to use artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.<ref name="Ferrante_2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrante FE | title = Evolving telemedicine/ehealth technology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 370–383 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16035932 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2005.11.370 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> For example, the term heart attack and [[myocardial infarction]] mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the over based on personal preferences.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> Other applications use [[concept processing]] to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details.<ref>Garza-Galicia, M., Sosa, M., Low, R., & Simini, F.

== Industry ==
The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms.

A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the [[clinical decision support system]]s. As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions.<ref name="Pisarchik_2019"/> Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of [[big data]] in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of "data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry.<ref name="Quan_2018">{{cite journal| vauthors = Quan XI, Sanderson J |date=December 2018|title=Understanding the Artificial Intelligence Business Ecosystem|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540793|journal=IEEE Engineering Management Review|volume=46|issue=4|pages=22–25|doi=10.1109/EMR.2018.2882430|s2cid=59525052|issn=0360-8581}}</ref>

The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare:

* IBM's [[IBM Watson|Watson]] Oncology is in development at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Cleveland Clinic]]. IBM is also working with [[CVS Health]] on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with [[Johnson & Johnson]] on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began a joint project entitled [https://idea.rpi.edu/research/projects/heals Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS)], to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare.
* [[Microsoft]]'s Hanover project, in partnership with [[Oregon Health & Science University]]'s Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective [[cancer]] drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells.
* [[Google]]'s DeepMind platform is being used by the UK [[National Health Service]] to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves the analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues.
* [[Tencent]] is working on several medical systems and services. These include [https://www.tencent.com/en-us/articles/2201092.html AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS)], an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork
* Intel's venture capital arm [[Intel Capital]] recently invested in startup Lumiata which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options.
[[File:Elon Musk and the Neuralink Future.jpg|thumb|Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip]]
*[[Neuralink]] has come up with a next-generation [[Neuroprosthetics|neuroprosthetic]] which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain.<ref name="Pisarchik_2019"/> Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in the place of a chunk of a skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury .<ref name="Pisarchik_2019"/>

Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Use plain English#Buzzwords|buzzword]]] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders).

[[IFlytek]] launched a service robot "Xiao Man", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH ("Cruzr") and [[Softbank]] Robotics ("Pepper").

The Indian startup [[Haptik]] recently developed a [[WhatsApp]] chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly [[coronavirus]] in [[India]].

With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies.<ref name="Quan_2018" /> Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well.<ref name="Quan_2018" /> Companies such as [[BMW]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Toyota]], and [[Volvo]] all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances or in emotional distress.<ref name="Quan_2018" />

==Expanding care to developing nations==
Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.&nbsp; Many new technology companies such as [[SpaceX]] and the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]] have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before.<ref name="Abou-Zahra_2018">{{cite book| vauthors = Abou-Zahra S, Brewer J, Cooper M |title=Proceedings of the 15th International Web for All Conference |chapter=Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Web Accessibility |date=2018-04-23|series=W4A '18|location=Lyon, France|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|pages=1–4|doi=10.1145/3192714.3192834|isbn=978-1-4503-5651-0|s2cid=49863409}}</ref> With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not.<ref name="Abou-Zahra_2018" />

Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care.

==Regulation==

While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as [[algorithmic bias]], [[Do not resuscitate]] implications, and other [[machine morality]] issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Van Kolfschooten H |date=2022-02-01 |title=EU regulation of artificial intelligence: Challenges for patients' rights |url=https://kluwerlawonline.com/api/Product/CitationPDFURL?file=Journals%5CCOLA%5CCOLA2022005.pdf |journal=Common Market Law Review |language=en |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=81–112 |doi=10.54648/COLA2022005 |s2cid=248591427 |issn=0165-0750}}</ref> These challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for [[Regulation of artificial intelligence|regulations]].
[[File:Workshop GDPR compliance at the 2019 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.jpg|thumb|A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit.]]
Currently, there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data. This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]]) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ([[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]]).<ref name="Lacassie_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacassie E, Marquet P, Martin-Dupont S, Gaulier JM, Lachâtre G | title = A non-fatal case of intoxication with foxglove, documented by means of liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 1154–1158 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11005196 | doi = 10.1520/JFS14845J }}</ref> The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data. Similarly, HIPAA protects healthcare data from patient records in the United States.<ref name="Lacassie_2000" /> In May 2016, the [[White House]] announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the [[National Science and Technology Council]] (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of [[health information technology]] is in development stages.

The only agency that has expressed concern is the FDA. Bakul Patel, the Associate Center Director for Digital Health of the FDA, is quoted saying in May 2017:

"We're trying to get people who have hands-on development experience with a product's full life cycle. We already have some scientists who know artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we want complementary people who can look forward and see how this technology will evolve."

=== United Nations (WHO/ITU) ===
The joint [[ITU]]-[[WHO]] [[ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health|Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health]] (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO [[AI for Health Framework]] - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions.

=== US FDA===
[[File:Logo of the United States Food and Drug Administration.svg|thumb|United States Food & Drug Administration<ref>{{Cite web | author = Office of the Commissioner|date=2022-11-30 |title=About FDA |url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda |access-date=2023-04-08 |website=FDA |language=en}}</ref>]]
In January 2021, the [[US]] [[FDA]] published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=2023-10-20 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Software as a Medical Device |url=https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-software-medical-device |journal=FDA |language=en}}</ref> This plan lays out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software. There are five main actions the FDA plans to take to increase regulation: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued guidance on the [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|ethical use of AI]] in healthcare. The guidance outlines four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. Moreover, as of March 2021, the OCR hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the "implementation of the HHS AI strategy".<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2021-12-22 |title=HHS Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy |url=https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/ocio/ai/strategy/index.html |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.hhs.gov |language=en}}</ref> The OCR also has issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals’ health information. These regulations require healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI. The OCR also requires healthcare providers to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. Overall, the U.S. has taken steps to protect individuals’ privacy and ethical issues related to AI in healthcare<ref>{{Cite web | author = Office for Civil Rights (OCR) |date=2015-09-05 |title=Civil Rights for Providers of Health Care and Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/index.html |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=HHS.gov |language=en}}</ref>

The U.S. is not the only country to develop or initiate regulations of data privacy with AI. Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on Data Ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity. The importance of human dignity is stressed, as it is said to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cambridge Core - Journals & Books Online {{!}} Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/ |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=Cambridge Core |language=en}}</ref>

The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency.<ref name="Forcier_2019">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Forcier MB |journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences |date=16 September 2019 |title="Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Health Care through Data Access: Can the GDPR Act as a Beacon for Policymakers?" |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=317–335 |doi=10.1093/jlb/lsz013 |pmid=31666972 |pmc=6813940 }}</ref> With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy.<ref name="Forcier_2019" /> In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sharing and Utilizing Health Data for AI Applications - Hhs.gov. |url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sharing-and-utilizing-health-data-for-ai-applications.pdf.}}</ref>

== Ethical concerns ==

=== Data collection ===
In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology.<ref name="Lacassie_2000" /> The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare.

=== Automation ===
A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic.<ref name="Vo_2023">{{cite journal | first1 = Vinh | last1 = Vo | first2 = Gang | last2 = Chen | first3 = Yves Saint James | last3 = Aquino | first4 = Stacy M. | last4 = Carter | first5 = Quynh Nga | last5 = Do | first6 = Maame Esi | last6 = Woode | name-list-style = vanc | title = Multi-stakeholder preferences for the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare: A systematic review and thematic analysis |journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 338 | issue = 1 | pages = 116357 |  date = November 2023 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116357| pmid = 37949020 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years.<ref name="Davenport_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport T, Kalakota R | title = The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare | journal = Future Healthcare Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–98 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31363513 | pmc = 6616181 | doi = 10.7861/futurehosp.6-2-94 }}</ref> However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction.<ref name="Davenport_2019" />

Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well. It is expected that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not.<ref>U.S News Staff (2018-09-20). "Artificial Intelligence Continues to Change Health Care". US News.

</ref> AI will likely not completely replace healthcare workers but rather give them more time to attend to their patients. AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload

AI will ultimately help contribute to the progression of societal goals which include better communication, improved quality of healthcare, and autonomy.<ref>"AI for Health CareArtificial Intelligence for Health Care".

Recently, there have been many discussions between healthcare experts in terms of AI and elder care. In relation to elder care, AI bots have been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Savage N |date=2022-01-19 |title=Robots rise to meet the challenge of caring for old people |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00072-z |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=601 |issue=7893 |pages=S8–S10 |doi=10.1038/d41586-022-00072-z|pmid=35046591 |bibcode=2022Natur.601S...8S |s2cid=246064292 }}</ref>

=== Bias ===
Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baric-Parker J, Anderson EE | title = Patient Data-Sharing for AI: Ethical Challenges, Catholic Solutions | journal = The Linacre Quarterly | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–481 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 33100395 | pmc = 7551527 | doi = 10.1177/0024363920922690 }}</ref> A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] mapping.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Berdahl CT, Baker L, Mann S, Osoba O, Girosi F |date=2023-02-07 |title=Strategies to Improve the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Health Equity: Scoping Review |url=https://ai.jmir.org/2023/1/e42936 |journal=JMIR AI |language=en |volume=2 |pages=e42936 |doi=10.2196/42936 |s2cid=256681439 |issn=2817-1705|doi-access=free }}</ref>

There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020" />  Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. White males are overly represented in medical data sets.<ref name="Nordling_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordling L | title = A fairer way forward for AI in health care | journal = Nature | volume = 573 | issue = 7775 | pages = S103–S105 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31554993 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-02872-2 | s2cid = 202749329 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2019Natur.573S.103N }}</ref> Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations.<ref name="pmid31682262">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy S, Allan S, Coghlan S, Cooper P | title = A governance model for the application of AI in health care | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 491–497 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 31682262 | pmc = 7647243 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocz192 }}</ref> Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients.<ref name="Nordling_2019" /> In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult.<ref name="Pumplun_2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pumplun L, Fecho M, Wahl N, Peters F, Buxmann P | title = Adoption of Machine Learning Systems for Medical Diagnostics in Clinics: Qualitative Interview Study | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = e29301 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 34652275 | pmc = 8556641 | doi = 10.2196/29301 | s2cid = 238990562 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data.

A final source of bias, which has been called “label choice bias,” arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients.<ref>{{Cite news | vauthors = Evans M, Mathews AW |date=2019-10-24 |title=Researchers Find Racial Bias in Hospital Algorithm |language=en-US |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096 |access-date=2023-06-03 |issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Solutions to the "label choice bias" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program
