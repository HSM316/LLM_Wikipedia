{{Artificial intelligence}}
'''Artificial intelligence in healthcare''' is the [[application of artificial intelligence]] (AI) to copy or exceed human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and healthcare data. It can augment and exceed human capabilities by providing better ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-11 |title=Developing an aging clock using deep learning on retinal images |url=https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/developing-aging-clock-using-deep.html |access-date=2023-06-01 |website=ai.googleblog.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullainathan S, Obermeyer Z | title = Solving medicine's data bottleneck: Nightingale Open Science | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 897–899 | date = May 2022 | pmid = 35534570 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-022-01804-4 | s2cid = 248668494 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Using AI in healthcare has the potential to improve predicting, diagnosing, and treating diseases.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Jimma BL |date=2023-01-16 |title=Artificial intelligence in healthcare: A bibliometric analysis |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2772503023000014 |journal=Telematics and Informatics Reports |language=en |volume=9 |pages=100041 |doi=10.1016/j.teler.2023.100041|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through [[machine learning]] [[algorithms]] and [[deep learning]], AI can analyze large sets of clinical data and [[Electronic health record|electronic health records]], and can help to diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately.<ref name=":0" /> In addition, AI is becoming more relevant in bringing culturally competent healthcare practices to the industry.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Papadopoulos C, Castro N, Nigath A, Davidson R, Faulkes N, Menicatti R, Khaliq AA, Recchiuto C, Battistuzzi L, Randhawa G, Merton L, Kanoria S, Chong NY, Kamide H, Hewson D, Sgorbissa A | title = The CARESSES Randomised Controlled Trial: Exploring the Health-Related Impact of Culturally Competent Artificial Intelligence Embedded Into Socially Assistive Robots and Tested in Older Adult Care Homes | journal = International Journal of Social Robotics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 245–256 | date = 2022-01-01 | pmid = 33907589 | pmc = 8062829 | doi = 10.1007/s12369-021-00781-x }}</ref>

As widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various subdisciplines of medicine and related industries. 

Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as [[Information privacy|data privacy]], automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing [[Algorithmic bias|biases]].<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Floridi L, Luetge C, Pagallo U, Schafer B, Valcke P, Vayena E, Addison J, Hughes N, Lea N, Sage C, Vannieuwenhuyse B |date=2019-09-01|title=Key Ethical Challenges in the European Medical Information Framework |journal=Minds and Machines|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=355–371|doi=10.1007/s11023-018-9467-4|s2cid=49668711|issn=1572-8641|doi-access=free|hdl=2318/1728336|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersson L, Larsson I, Nygren JM, Nilsen P, Neher M, Reed JE, Tyskbo D, Svedberg P | title = Challenges to implementing artificial intelligence in healthcare: a qualitative interview study with healthcare leaders in Sweden | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 850 | date = July 2022 | pmid = 35778736 | pmc = 9250210 | doi = 10.1186/s12913-022-08215-8 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Applications in healthcare systems ==
=== Disease diagnosis ===
Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is still a challenge in healthcare. Recognising medical conditions and their symptoms is a complex problem. AI can assist clinicians with its data processing capabilities to save time and improve accuracy.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Alowais SA, Alghamdi SS, Alsuhebany N, Alqahtani T, Alshaya AI, Almohareb SN, Aldairem A, Alrashed M, Bin Saleh K, Badreldin HA, Al Yami MS, Al Harbi S, Albekairy AM | title = Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice | journal = BMC Medical Education | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 689 | date = September 2023 | pmid = 37740191 | pmc = 10517477 | doi = 10.1186/s12909-023-04698-z | doi-access = free }}</ref> Through the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence can be able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the analyis of mass [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs).<ref name="Liang_2019">{{cite journal |vauthors=Liang H, Tsui BY, Ni H, Valentim CC, Baxter SL, Liu G, Cai W, Kermany DS, Sun X, Chen J, He L, Zhu J, Tian P, Shao H, Zheng L, Hou R, Hewett S, Li G, Liang P, Zang X, Zhang Z, Pan L, Cai H, Ling R, Li S, Cui Y, Tang S, Ye H, Huang X, He W, Liang W, Zhang Q, Jiang J, Yu W, Gao J, Ou W, Deng Y, Hou Q, Wang B, Yao C, Liang Y, Zhang S, Duan Y, Zhang R, Gibson S, Zhang CL, Li O, Zhang ED, Karin G, Nguyen N, Wu X, Wen C, Xu J, Xu W, Wang B, Wang W, Li J, Pizzato B, Bao C, Xiang D, He W, He S, Zhou Y, Haw W, Goldbaum M, Tremoulet A, Hsu CN, Carter H, Zhu L, Zhang K, Xia H |date=March 2019 |title=Evaluation and accurate diagnoses of pediatric diseases using artificial intelligence |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=433–438 |doi=10.1038/s41591-018-0335-9 |pmid=30742121 |s2cid=59945159}}</ref> AI can help early prediction, for example, of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]]s, by looking through large numbers of similar cases and possible treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Q, Yang X, Xu J, Guo Y, He X, Hu H, Lyu T, Marra D, Miller A, Smith G, DeKosky S, Boyce RD, Schliep K, Shenkman E, Maraganore D, Wu Y, Bian J |date=August 2023 |title=Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias using real-world electronic health records |journal=Alzheimer's & Dementia |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=3506–3518 |doi=10.1002/alz.12967 |pmc=10976442 |pmid=36815661 |s2cid=257101613 |doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Doctors' decision making could also be supported by AI in urgent situations, for example in the [[emergency department]]. Here AI algorithms can help prioritise more serious cases and reduce waiting time. [[Decision support system|Decision support systems]] augmented with AI can offer real-time suggestions and faster data interpretation to aid the decisions made by healthcare professionals.<ref name=":1" />

In 2023 a study reported higher satisfaction rates with [[ChatGPT]]-generated responses compared with those from physicians for medical questions posted on [[Reddit]]’s r/AskDocs.<ref name=":2">Ayers JW, Poliak A, Dredze M, et al. Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum. JAMA Intern Med. 2023;183(6):589-596. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838</ref> Evaluators preferred ChatGPT's responses to physician responses in 78.6% of 585 evaluations, noting better quality and empathy. The authors noted that these were isolated questions, not in the context of an established patient-physician relationship.<ref name=":2" />

Recent developments in [[statistical physics]], [[machine learning]], and [[inference]] algorithms are also being explored for their potential in improving medical diagnostic approaches.<ref name="pmid33228143">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramezanpour A, Beam AL, Chen JH, Mashaghi A |date=November 2020 |title=Statistical Physics for Medical Diagnostics: Learning, Inference, and Optimization Algorithms |journal=Diagnostics |volume=10 |issue=11 |page=972 |doi=10.3390/diagnostics10110972 |pmc=7699346 |pmid=33228143 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Electronic health records ===
Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, the next step is to use artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.<ref name="Ferrante_2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferrante FE |date=June 2005 |title=Evolving telemedicine/ehealth technology |journal=Telemedicine Journal and e-Health |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=370–383 |doi=10.1089/tmj.2005.11.370 |pmid=16035932 |doi-access=}}</ref>

One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> For example, the term heart attack and [[myocardial infarction]] mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the over based on personal preferences.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read.<ref name="Ferrante_2005" /> Other applications use [[concept processing]] to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details.<ref>Garza-Galicia, M., Sosa, M., Low, R., & Simini, F.

=== Telemedicine ===
[[File:Elderly_Man_Using_Pulse_Oximeter.jpg|thumb|An elderly man using a pulse oximeter to measure his blood oxygen levels]]

Another application of artificial intelligence is chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on [[Artificial intelligence in mental health|chatbots for mental healthcare]] does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang M |date=October 2021 |title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism'''Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism''' ''Safiya Umoja Noble'' NYU Press, 2018. 256 pp |journal=Science |volume=374 |issue=6567 |pages=35–44 |doi=10.1177/2057047320950636 |pmc=7441483}}</ref>

=== Workload Management ===
AI has the potential to streamline care coordination and reduce the workload. AI algorithms can automate administrative tasks, prioritize patient needs and facilitate seamless communication in a healthcare team.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stokes F, Palmer A | title = Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Nursing: Ethics of Caring as a Guide to Dividing Tasks Between AI and Humans | journal = Nursing Philosophy | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = e12306 | date = October 2020 | pmid = 32609420 | doi = 10.1111/nup.12306 }}</ref> This enables healthcare providers to focus more on direct patient care and ensures the efficient and coordinated delivery of healthcare services.

== Industry ==
The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for the implementation of AI algorithms.

A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the [[clinical decision support system]]s. As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions.<ref name="Pisarchik_2019" /> Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of [[big data]] in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of "data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry.<ref name="Quan_2018">{{cite journal| vauthors = Quan XI, Sanderson J |date=December 2018|title=Understanding the Artificial Intelligence Business Ecosystem|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8540793|journal=IEEE Engineering Management Review|volume=46|issue=4|pages=22–25|doi=10.1109/EMR.2018.2882430|s2cid=59525052|issn=0360-8581}}</ref>

The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare:

* IBM's [[IBM Watson|Watson]] Oncology is in development at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Cleveland Clinic]]. IBM is also working with [[CVS Health]] on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with [[Johnson & Johnson]] on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began a joint project entitled [https://idea.rpi.edu/research/projects/heals Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS)], to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare.
* [[Microsoft]]'s Hanover project, in partnership with [[Oregon Health & Science University]]'s Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective [[cancer]] drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Tung L |date=September 20, 2016 |title=Microsoft's next big AI project?

Digital consultant apps use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Use plain English#Buzzwords|buzzword]]] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders).

[[IFlytek]] launched a service robot "Xiao Man", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH ("Cruzr") and [[Softbank]] Robotics ("Pepper").

The Indian startup [[Haptik]] recently developed a [[WhatsApp]] chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly [[coronavirus]] in [[India]]. Similarly, a software platform [[ChatBot]] in partnership with [[Health_technology|medtech]] [[startup]] Infermedica launched [[COVID-19]] Risk Assessment ChatBot.<ref>{{Cite news | vauthors = Carpenter J |date=2021-04-07 |title=Meet the Chatbots That Might Manage Your Money One Day |language=en-US |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-chatbots-that-might-manage-your-money-one-day-11617811213 |access-date=2022-06-30 |issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies.<ref name="Quan_2018" /> Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well.<ref name="Quan_2018" /> Companies such as [[BMW]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Toyota]], and [[Volvo]] all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances.<ref name="Quan_2018" />

Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.&nbsp; Many new technology companies such as [[SpaceX]] and the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]] have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before.<ref name="Abou-Zahra_2018">{{cite book| vauthors = Abou-Zahra S, Brewer J, Cooper M |title=Proceedings of the 15th International Web for All Conference |chapter=Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Web Accessibility |date=2018-04-23|series=W4A '18|location=Lyon, France|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|pages=1–4|doi=10.1145/3192714.3192834|isbn=978-1-4503-5651-0|s2cid=49863409}}</ref> With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life-threatening disease or not.<ref name="Abou-Zahra_2018" />

Using AI in developing nations that do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient in areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient.<ref name="Guo_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo J, Li B | title = The Application of Medical Artificial Intelligence Technology in Rural Areas of Developing Countries | journal = Health Equity | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–181 | date = 2018-08-01 | pmid = 30283865 | pmc = 6110188 | doi = 10.1089/heq.2018.0037 }}</ref> The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries.<ref name="Guo_2018" />

==Regulation==

While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as [[algorithmic bias]], [[Do not resuscitate]] implications, and other [[machine morality]] issues. AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Van Kolfschooten H |date=2022-02-01 |title=EU regulation of artificial intelligence: Challenges for patients' rights |url=https://kluwerlawonline.com/api/Product/CitationPDFURL?file=Journals%5CCOLA%5CCOLA2022005.pdf |journal=Common Market Law Review |language=en |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=81–112 |doi=10.54648/COLA2022005 |s2cid=248591427 |issn=0165-0750}}</ref> These challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for [[Regulation of artificial intelligence|regulations]].

Currently, there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data. This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]]) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ([[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]]).<ref name="Lacassie_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacassie E, Marquet P, Martin-Dupont S, Gaulier JM, Lachâtre G | title = A non-fatal case of intoxication with foxglove, documented by means of liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 1154–1158 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11005196 | doi = 10.1520/JFS14845J }}</ref> The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data.

In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of [[health information technology]] is in development stages.

There is concern that large language models can overwhelm people with both accurate health information and also misinformation, leading to potential challenges in public health. This calls for the need for policy and user guidance related to health information through AI.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = De Angelis L, Baglivo F, Arzilli G, Privitera GP, Ferragina P, Tozzi AE, Rizzo C | title = ChatGPT and the rise of large language models: the new AI-driven infodemic threat in public health | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 11 | pages = 1166120 | date = 2023-04-25 | pmid = 37181697 | pmc = 10166793 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1166120 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== United Nations (WHO/ITU) ===
The joint [[ITU]]-[[WHO]] [[ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health|Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health]] (FG-AI4H) has built a platform - known as the ITU-WHO [[AI for Health Framework]] - for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions.

=== US FDA===
[[File:Logo of the United States Food and Drug Administration.svg|thumb|United States Food & Drug Administration<ref>{{Cite web | author = Office of the Commissioner|date=2022-11-30 |title=About FDA |url=https://www.fda.gov/about-fda |access-date=2023-04-08 |website=FDA |language=en}}</ref>]]
In January 2021, the [[US]] [[FDA]] published a new Action Plan, entitled Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2023-10-20 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Software as a Medical Device |url=https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-software-medical-device |journal=FDA |language=en}}</ref> This plan lays out the FDA's future plans for regulation of medical devices that would include artificial intelligence in their software. There are five main actions the FDA plans to take to increase regulation: 1. Tailored Regulatory Framework for Ai/M:-based SaMD, 2. Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP), 3. Patient-Centered Approach Incorporating Transparency to Users, 4. Regulatory Science Methods Related to Algorithm Bias & Robustness, and 5. Real-World Performance(RWP). This plan was in direct response to stakeholders' feedback on a 2019 discussion paper also published by the FDA.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued guidance on the [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|ethical use of AI]] in healthcare. The guidance outlines four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. Moreover, as of March 2021, the OCR hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the "implementation of the HHS AI strategy".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-22 |title=HHS Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy |url=https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/ocio/ai/strategy/index.html |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.hhs.gov |language=en}}</ref> The OCR also has issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals’ health information. These regulations require healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI. The OCR also requires healthcare providers to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. Overall, the U.S. has taken steps to protect individuals’ privacy and ethical issues related to AI in healthcare<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-09-05 |title=Civil Rights for Providers of Health Care and Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/index.html |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=hhs.gov |publisher=Office for Civil Rights |language=en}}</ref>

The U.S. is not the only country to develop or initiate regulations of data privacy with AI. Other countries have implemented data protection regulations, more specifically with company privacy invasions. In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on Data Ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity. The importance of human dignity is stressed, as it is said to outweigh profit and must be respected in all data processes<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cambridge Core - Journals & Books Online {{!}} Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/ |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=Cambridge Core |language=en}}</ref>

The European Union has implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect citizens' personal data, which applies to the use of AI in healthcare. In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency.<ref name="Forcier_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Forcier MB, Gallois H, Mullan S, Joly Y | title = Integrating artificial intelligence into health care through data access: can the GDPR act as a beacon for policymakers? | journal = Journal of Law and the Biosciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 317–335 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31666972 | pmc = 6813940 | doi = 10.1093/jlb/lsz013 }}</ref> With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy.<ref name="Forcier_2019" /> In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have also released guidelines for the development of AI-based medical applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sharing and Utilizing Health Data for AI Applications |website=hhs.gov |url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sharing-and-utilizing-health-data-for-ai-applications.pdf.}}</ref>

== Ethical concerns ==

=== Data collection ===
In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology.<ref name="Lacassie_2000" /> The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare.

Furthermore, the lack of current regulations surrounding AI in the United States has generated concerns about mismanagement of patient data, such as with corporations utilizing patient data for financial gain. For example, [[Roche]], a Swiss healthcare company, was found to have purchased healthcare data for approximately 2 million cancer patients at an estimated total cost of $1.9 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mudgal KS, Das N | title = The ethical adoption of artificial intelligence in radiology | journal = BJR Open | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 20190020 | date = 2020-11-01 | pmid = 33178959 | pmc = 7605209 | doi = 10.1259/bjro.20190020 }}</ref> Naturally, this generates questions of ethical concern; Is there a monetary price that can be set for data, and should it depend on its perceived value or contributions to science? Is it fair to patients to sell their data? These concerns were addressed in a survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2022 that asked Americans for their opinions about the increased presence of AI in their daily lives, and the survey estimated that 37% of Americans were more concerned than excited about such increased presence, with 8% of participants specifically associating their concern with "people misusing AI".<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Rainie L, Funk C, Anderson M, Tyson A |date=2022-03-17 |title=1. How Americans think about artificial intelligence |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/how-americans-think-about-artificial-intelligence/ |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=Pew Research Center |language=en-US}}</ref> Ultimately, the current potential of artificial intelligence in healthcare is additionally hindered by  concerns about mismanagement of data collected, especially in the United States.

=== Automation ===
A systematic review and thematic analysis in 2023 showed that most stakeholders including health professionals, patients, and the general public doubted that care involving AI could be empathetic.<ref name="Vo_2023">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vo V, Chen G, Aquino YS, Carter SM, Do QN, Woode ME | title = Multi-stakeholder preferences for the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare: A systematic review and thematic analysis | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 338 | issue = 1 | pages = 116357 | date = December 2023 | pmid = 37949020 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116357 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years.<ref name="Davenport_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport T, Kalakota R | title = The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare | journal = Future Healthcare Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–98 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31363513 | pmc = 6616181 | doi = 10.7861/futurehosp.6-2-94 }}</ref> However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction.<ref name="Davenport_2019" />

Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well. It is expected that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not.<ref>U.S News Staff (2018-09-20). "Artificial Intelligence Continues to Change Health Care". US News.
</ref> AI will likely not completely replace healthcare workers but rather give them more time to attend to their patients. AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload.

Recently, there have been many discussions between healthcare experts in terms of AI and elder care. In relation to elder care, AI bots have been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Savage N | title = Robots rise to meet the challenge of caring for old people | journal = Nature | volume = 601 | issue = 7893 | pages = S8–S10 | date = January 2022 | pmid = 35046591 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-022-00072-z | s2cid = 246064292 | bibcode = 2022Natur.601S...8S }}</ref>

=== Bias ===
Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baric-Parker J, Anderson EE | title = Patient Data-Sharing for AI: Ethical Challenges, Catholic Solutions | journal = The Linacre Quarterly | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–481 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 33100395 | pmc = 7551527 | doi = 10.1177/0024363920922690 }}</ref> A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] mapping.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mann S, Berdahl CT, Baker L, Girosi F | title = Artificial intelligence applications used in the clinical response to COVID-19: A scoping review | journal = PLOS Digital Health | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | pages = e0000132 | date = October 2022 | pmc = 11041459 | doi = 10.2196/42936 | s2cid = 256681439 | doi-access = free | pmid = 38875587 }}</ref>

There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020" />  Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. White males are overly represented in medical data sets.<ref name="Nordling_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordling L | title = A fairer way forward for AI in health care | journal = Nature | volume = 573 | issue = 7775 | pages = S103–S105 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31554993 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-02872-2 | s2cid = 202749329 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2019Natur.573S.103N }}</ref> Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations.<ref name="pmid31682262">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy S, Allan S, Coghlan S, Cooper P | title = A governance model for the application of AI in health care | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 491–497 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 31682262 | pmc = 7647243 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocz192 }}</ref> Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients.<ref name="Nordling_2019" /> In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult.<ref name="Pumplun_2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pumplun L, Fecho M, Wahl N, Peters F, Buxmann P | title = Adoption of Machine Learning Systems for Medical Diagnostics in Clinics: Qualitative Interview Study | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = e29301 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 34652275 | pmc = 8556641 | doi = 10.2196/29301 | s2cid = 238990562 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data.

A final source of bias, which has been called "label choice bias", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients.<ref>{{Cite news | vauthors = Evans M, Mathews AW |date=2019-10-24 |title=Researchers Find Racial Bias in Hospital Algorithm |language=en-US |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096 |access-date=2023-06-03 |issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Solutions to the "label choice bias" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program.
