'''Artificial intelligence in healthcare''' is an overarching term used to describe the utilization of machine-learning algorithms and software, or [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), to emulate human [[cognition]] in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of complicated medical and [[healthcare]] data. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data.

What distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gather data, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through [[machine learning]] [[algorithms]] and [[deep learning]]. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are [[black box]]es; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used.<ref name=":8">{{cite news |first1=Michael |last1=Luca |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |first3=Sendhil |last3=Mullainathan |name-list-style=vanc |date=January–February 2016 |url=https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too |title=Algorithms Need Managers, Too  |work=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>

=== Disease diagnosis ===

An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are several types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases, such as support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees. Each of these techniques is described as having a “training goal” so “classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible…”.

To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases include using “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian Networks (BN)”. It was found that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes and CVD.

Through the use of Medical Learning Classifiers (MLC’s), Artificial Intelligence has been able to substantially aid doctors in patient diagnosis through the manipulation of mass [[Electronic health record|Electronic Health Records]] (EHR’s).<ref name=":04">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang H, Tsui BY, Ni H, Valentim CC, Baxter SL, Liu G, Cai W, Kermany DS, Sun X, Chen J, He L, Zhu J, Tian P, Shao H, Zheng L, Hou R, Hewett S, Li G, Liang P, Zang X, Zhang Z, Pan L, Cai H, Ling R, Li S, Cui Y, Tang S, Ye H, Huang X, He W, Liang W, Zhang Q, Jiang J, Yu W, Gao J, Ou W, Deng Y, Hou Q, Wang B, Yao C, Liang Y, Zhang S, Duan Y, Zhang R, Gibson S, Zhang CL, Li O, Zhang ED, Karin G, Nguyen N, Wu X, Wen C, Xu J, Xu W, Wang B, Wang W, Li J, Pizzato B, Bao C, Xiang D, He W, He S, Zhou Y, Haw W, Goldbaum M, Tremoulet A, Hsu CN, Carter H, Zhu L, Zhang K, Xia H | display-authors = 6 | title = Evaluation and accurate diagnoses of pediatric diseases using artificial intelligence | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–438 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30742121 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-018-0335-9 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0335-9 | s2cid = 59945159 }}</ref> Medical conditions have grown more complex, and with a vast history of electronic medical records building, the likelihood of case duplication is high.<ref name=":04" /> Although someone today with a rare illness is less likely to be the only person to have suffered from any given disease, the inability to access cases from similarly symptomatic origins is a major roadblock for physicians.<ref name=":04" /> The implementation of AI to not only help find similar cases and treatments, but also factor in chief symptoms and help the physicians ask the most appropriate questions helps the patient receive the most accurate diagnosis and treatment possible.<ref name=":04" />

The information can be compared to other data that has already been collected using artificial intelligence algorithms that alert physicians if there are any issues to be aware of.<ref name=":1" />

Another application of artificial intelligence is in chat-bot therapy. Some researchers charge that the reliance on chat-bots for mental healthcare does not offer the reciprocity and accountability of care that should exist in the relationship between the consumer of mental healthcare and the care provider (be it a chat-bot or psychologist), though.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Yang M |date=2020-08-19|title=Painful conversations: Therapeutic chatbots and public capacities |journal=Communication and the Public|volume=5|issue=1–2|pages=35–44|language=en|doi=10.1177/2057047320950636|pmc=7441483}}</ref>

Since the average age has risen due to a longer life expectancy, artificial intelligence could be useful in helping take care of older populations.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pouke M, Häkkilä J | title = Elderly healthcare monitoring using an avatar-based 3D virtual environment | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 7283–98 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24351747 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph10127283 | pmc = 3881167 | s2cid = 18535954 }}</ref> Tools such as environment and personal sensors can identify a person’s regular activities and alert a caretaker if a behavior or a measured vital is abnormal.<ref name=":2" /> Although the technology is useful, there are also discussions about limitations of monitoring in order to respect a person’s privacy since there are technologies that are designed to map out home layouts and detect human interactions.<ref name=":2" />

=== Electronic health records ===
Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, the next step is to use artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrante FE | title = Evolving telemedicine/ehealth technology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-Health | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 370–83 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16035932 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2005.11.370 |doi-access=free}}</ref> One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms.<ref name=":3" /> For example, the term heart attack and [[myocardial infarction]] mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the over based on personal preferences.<ref name=":3" /> NLP algorithms  consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed.<ref name=":3" /> Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician’s notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read.<ref name=":3" />

Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient’s record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history.<ref name="Medrano_2018">{{cite journal| vauthors = Medrano IH, Guijarro JT, Belda C, Ureña A, Salcedo I, Anke LE, Saggion H |date=2018|title=Savana: Re-using Electronic Health Records with Artificial Intelligence|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6140780|journal=IJIMAI|volume=4|issue=7|pages=8–12|doi=10.9781/ijimai.2017.03.001|issn=1989-1660}}</ref> One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eren A, Subasi A, Coskun O | title = A decision support system for telemedicine through the mobile telecommunications platform | journal = Journal of Medical Systems | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–5 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18333403 | doi = 10.1007/s10916-007-9104-x | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-007-9104-x | s2cid = 11082133 }}</ref> This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses.<ref name=":7" /> Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient’s data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease.<ref name=":7" /> Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient’s information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician’s attention and save time.<ref name="Medrano_2018" /> One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70–72% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal| vauthors = Bennett CC, Doub TW, Selove R |date=April 2012|title=EHRs connect research and practice: Where predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, and clinical decision support intersect |journal=Health Policy and Technology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=105–114|doi=10.1016/j.hlpt.2012.03.001|arxiv=1204.4927|s2cid=25022446|issn=2211-8837}}</ref> These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years.<ref name="Medrano_2018" /> Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients.<ref name="Medrano_2018" />

=== Creation of new drugs ===
DSP-1181, a molecule of the drug for OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) treatment, was invented by artificial intelligence through joint efforts of Exscientia (British start-up) and [[Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma]] (Japanese pharmaceutical firm). The drug development took a single year, while pharmaceutical companies usually spend about five years on similar projects. DSP-1181 was accepted for a human trial.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Wakefield |name-list-style=vanc |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51315462 |title=Artificial intelligence-created medicine to be used on humans for first time |date=30 January 2020 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

In September 2019 [[Insilico Medicine]] reports the creation, via artificial intelligence, of six novel inhibitors of the [[DDR1]] gene, a kinase target implicated in [[fibrosis]] and other diseases. The system, known as Generative Tensorial Reinforcement Learning (GENTRL), designed the new compounds in 21 days, with a lead candidate tested and showing positive results in mice.<ref>{{cite web |title=Novel molecules designed by artificial intelligence in 21 days are validated in mice |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-09/im-nmd083019.php |date=2 September 2019 |work=EurekAlert! |access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Has AI Discovered a Drug Now?

== Industry ==
The trend of large health companies merging allows for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data lays the groundwork for implementation of AI algorithms.

A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the [[Clinical decision support system|clinical decision support systems]]. As more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions.<ref name=":03">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisarchik AN, Maksimenko VA, Hramov AE | title = From Novel Technology to Novel Applications: Comment on "An Integrated Brain-Machine Interface Platform With Thousands of Channels" by Elon Musk and Neuralink | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = e16356 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31674923 | doi = 10.2196/16356 | pmc = 6914250 | url = https://www.jmir.org/2019/10/e16356/ | s2cid = 207818415 }}</ref> Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of [[big data]] in the healthcare industry.

The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare:

* IBM's [[IBM Watson|Watson]] Oncology is in development at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Cleveland Clinic]]. IBM is also working with [[CVS Health]] on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with [[Johnson & Johnson]] on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS), to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare.
* [[Microsoft]]'s Hanover project, in partnership with [[Oregon Health & Science University]]'s Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective [[cancer]] drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells.
* [[Google]]'s [[DeepMind]] platform is being used by the UK [[National Health Service]] to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues.
* [[Tencent]] is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS), an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork
* Intel's venture capital arm [[Intel Capital]] recently invested in startup Lumiata which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options.

* Kheiron Medical developed deep learning software to detect [[Breast cancer|breast cancers]] in [[Mammogram|mammograms]].
* [[Fractal Analytics]] has incubated Qure.ai which focuses on using deep learning and AI to improve radiology and speed up the analysis of diagnostic x-rays.
* [[File:Elon Musk and the Neuralink Future.jpg|thumb|Elon Musk premiering the surgical robot that implants the Neuralink brain chip]][[Neuralink]] has come up with a next generation [[Neuroprosthetics|neuroprosthetic]] which intricately interfaces with thousands of neural pathways in the brain.<ref name=":03" /> Their process allows a chip, roughly the size of a quarter, to be inserted in place of a chunk of skull by a precision surgical robot to avoid accidental injury .<ref name=":03" />

Digital consultant apps like [[Babylon Health|Babylon Health's GP at Hand]], [[Ada Health]], [[AliHealth]] [[Doctor You]], KareXpert and [[Your.MD]] use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Use plain English#Buzzwords|buzzword]]] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders).

[[IFlytek]] launched a service robot “Xiao Man”, which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH ("Cruzr") and [[Softbank]] Robotics ("Pepper").

The Indian startup [[Haptik]] recently developed a [[WhatsApp]] chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly [[coronavirus]] in [[India]].

With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies.<ref name=":14" /> Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well.<ref name=":14" /> Companies such as [[BMW]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Toyota]], and [[Volvo]] all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances or in emotional distress.<ref name=":14" />

==Implications==

The use of AI is predicted to decrease medical costs as there will be more accuracy in diagnosis and better predictions in the treatment plan as well as more prevention of disease.

Other future uses for AI include Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI) which are predicted to help those with trouble moving, speaking or with a spinal cord injury. The BCIs will use AI to help these patients move and communicate by decoding neural activates.<ref name="Bresnick, Jennifer p 12">{{cite web |last=Bresnick |first=Jennifer |name-list-style=vanc |title=Top 12 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Healthcare |work=HealthITAnalytics |date=30 April 2018 |url=https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-healthcare}}</ref>

Artificial intelligence has led to significant improvements in areas of healthcare such as medical imaging, automated clinical decision-making, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. Although AI possesses the capability to revolutionize several fields of medicine, it still has limitations and cannot replace a bedside physician.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhattad PB, Jain V | title = Artificial Intelligence in Modern Medicine - The Evolving Necessity of the Present and Role in Transforming the Future of Medical Care | journal = Cureus | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = e8041 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32528777 | pmc = 7282357 | doi = 10.7759/cureus.8041 | url = https://www.cureus.com/articles/30942-artificial-intelligence-in-modern-medicine---the-evolving-necessity-of-the-present-and-role-in-transforming-the-future-of-medical-care }}</ref>

Healthcare is a complicated science that is bound by legal, ethical, regulatory, economical, and social constraints. In order to fully implement AI within healthcare, there must be "parallel changes in the global environment, with numerous stakeholders, including citizen and society."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lovis C | title = Unlocking the Power of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Medicine | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = e16607 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31702565 | pmc = 6874800 | doi = 10.2196/16607 | url = https://www.jmir.org/2019/11/e16607 }}</ref>

==Expanding care to developing nations==
Artificial intelligence continues to expand in its abilities to diagnose more people accurately in nations where fewer doctors are accessible to the public.  Many new technology companies such as [[SpaceX|Spacex]] and the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]] have enabled more developing countries to have access to computers and the internet than ever before.<ref name=":05">{{cite journal|last1=Abou-Zahra|first1=Shadi|last2=Brewer|first2=Judy|last3=Cooper|first3=Michael | name-list-style = vanc |date=2018-04-23|title=Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Web Accessibility: Is Conformance Evaluation a Way Forward?|url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3192714.3192834|journal=Proceedings of the Internet of Accessible Things|series=W4A '18|location=Lyon, France|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|pages=1–4|doi=10.1145/3192714.3192834|isbn=978-1-4503-5651-0|s2cid=49863409}}</ref> With the increasing capabilities of AI over the internet, advanced machine learning algorithms can allow patients to get accurately diagnosed when they would previously have no way of knowing if they had a life threatening disease or not.<ref name=":05" />

Using AI in developing nations who do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can improve patient care. AI can allow for not only diagnosis of patient is areas where healthcare is scarce, but also allow for a good patient experience by resourcing files to find the best treatment for a patient.<ref name=":15">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo J, Li B | title = The Application of Medical Artificial Intelligence Technology in Rural Areas of Developing Countries | journal = Health Equity | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–181 | date = 2018-08-01 | pmid = 30283865 | pmc = 6110188 | doi = 10.1089/heq.2018.0037 | url = https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/heq.2018.0037 }}</ref> The ability of AI to adjust course as it goes also allows the patient to have their treatment modified based on what works for them; a level of individualized care that is nearly non-existent in developing countries.<ref name=":15" />

==Regulation==

While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as [[algorithmic bias]], [[Do not resuscitate]] implications, and other [[machine morality]] issues. These challenges of the clinical use of AI has brought upon potential need for regulations.
[[File:Workshop GDPR compliance at the 2019 Global Entrepreneurship Summit.jpg|thumb|A man speaking at the GDPR compliance workshop at the 2019 Entrepreneurship Summit.]]
Currently, there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data. This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPPA]]) and the European General Data Protection Regulation ([[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]]).<ref name="Lacassie_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lacassie E, Marquet P, Martin-Dupont S, Gaulier JM, Lachâtre G | title = A non-fatal case of intoxication with foxglove, documented by means of liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 1154–8 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11005196 | doi = 10.1520/JFS14845J}}</ref> The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data. Similarly, HIPPA protects healthcare data from patient records in the United States.<ref name="Lacassie_2000" /> In May 2016, the [[White House]] announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the [[National Science and Technology Council]] (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of [[health information technology]] is in development stages.

The only agency that has expressed concern is the FDA. Bakul Patel, the Associate Center Director for Digital Health of the FDA, is quoted saying in May 2017:

“We're trying to get people who have hands-on development experience with a product's full life cycle. We already have some scientists who know artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we want complementary people who can look forward and see how this technology will evolve.”

The joint [[ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health]] (FG-AI4H) has built a platform for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions.

== Ethical concerns ==

=== Data collection ===
In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology.<ref name="Lacassie_2000" /> The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare.

=== Automation ===
According to a recent study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years.<ref name="Davenport_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport T, Kalakota R | title = The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare | journal = Future Healthcare Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–98 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31363513 | pmc = 6616181 | doi = 10.7861/futurehosp.6-2-94 }}</ref> However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor to patient interaction.<ref name="Davenport_2019" />

Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well. It is expected that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not.<ref>U.S News Staff (2018-09-20). "Artificial Intelligence Continues to Change Health Care". US News.

</ref> AI will likely not completely replace healthcare workers but rather give them more time to attend to their patients. AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload

AI will ultimately help contribute to progression of societal goals which include better communication, improved quality of healthcare, and autonomy.<ref>"AI for Health CareArtificial Intelligence for Health Care". GrayRipples.com | AI | iOS | Android | PowerApps. 2020-03-04. Retrieved 2020-11-04.</ref>

=== Bias ===
Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baric-Parker J, Anderson EE | title = Patient Data-Sharing for AI: Ethical Challenges, Catholic Solutions | journal = The Linacre Quarterly | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–481 | date = November 2020 | pmid = 33100395 | doi = 10.1177/0024363920922690 | pmc = 7551527 }}</ref>

There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities.<ref name="Baric-Parker_2020" />  Since AI’s decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. White males are overly represented in medical data sets.<ref name="Nordling_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordling L | title = A fairer way forward for AI in health care | journal = Nature | volume = 573 | issue = 7775 | pages = S103–S105 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31554993 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-02872-2 | bibcode = 2019Natur.573S.103N | s2cid = 202749329 }}</ref> Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations.<ref name="pmid31682262">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy S, Allan S, Coghlan S, Cooper P | title = A governance model for the application of AI in health care | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 491–497 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 31682262 | doi = 10.1093/jamia/ocz192 | pmc = 7647243 }}</ref> Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients.<ref name="Nordling_2019" />  However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data.
