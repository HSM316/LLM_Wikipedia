'''[[Artificial intelligence]]''' ('''AI''') '''in healthcare''' is the use of [[algorithms|complex algorithms and software]] to emulate human [[cognition]] in the analysis of complicated medical data. Specifically, AI is the ability for computer algorithms to approximate conclusions without direct human input.

What distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through [[machine learning]] [[algorithms]]. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create its own logic. In order to reduce the margin of error, AI algorithms need to be tested repeatedly. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: if you set a goal, the algorithm can't adjust itself and only understand what it has been told explicitly, (2) and algorithms are [[black box]]es; algorithms can predict extremely precise, but not the cause or the why.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too |title= Algorithms Need Managers, Too |date=2016-01-01 |work=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2018-10-08 }}</ref>

== Current research ==
Various specialties in medicine have shown an increase in research regarding AI.

=== Radiology ===
The ability to interpret imaging results with radiology may aid clinicians in detecting a minute change in an image that a clinician might accidentally miss. A study at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] created an algorithm that could detect pneumonia at that specific site, in those patients involved, with a better average F1 metric (a statistical metric based on accuracy and recall), than the radiologists involved in that trial.<ref>{{Cite arxiv| vauthors = Rajpurkar P, Irvin J, Zhu K, Yang B, Mehta H, Duan T, Ding D, Bagul A, Langlotz C, Shpanskaya K, Lungren MP |date=2017-11-14 |title=CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning |eprint=1711.05225 |class=cs.CV }}</ref> The radiology conference [[Radiological Society of North America]] has implemented presentations on AI in imaging during its annual meeting. The emergence of AI technology in radiology is perceived as a threat by some specialists, as the technology can achieve improvements in certain statistical metrics in isolated cases, as opposed to specialists.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chockley K, Emanuel E | title = The End of Radiology? Three Threats to the Future Practice of Radiology | journal = Journal of the American College of Radiology | volume = 13 | issue = 12 Pt A | pages = 1415–1420 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27652572 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacr.2016.07.010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jha S, Topol EJ | title = Adapting to Artificial Intelligence: Radiologists and Pathologists as Information Specialists | journal = JAMA | volume = 316 | issue = 22 | pages = 2353–2354 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27898975 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.17438 }}</ref>

=== Imaging ===
Recent advances have suggested the use of AI to describe and evaluate the outcome of [[Orthognathic surgery|maxillo-facial surgery]] or the assessment of [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patcas R, Bernini DA, Volokitin A, Agustsson E, Rothe R, Timofte R | title = Applying artificial intelligence to assess the impact of orthognathic treatment on facial attractiveness and estimated age | journal = International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–83 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30087062 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijom.2018.07.010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patcas R, Timofte R, Volokitin A, Agustsson E, Eliades T, Eichenberger M, Bornstein MM | title = Facial attractiveness of cleft patients: a direct comparison between artificial-intelligence-based scoring and conventional rater groups | journal = European Journal of Orthodontics | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 428–433 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30788496 | doi = 10.1093/ejo/cjz007 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/51d95858c2167133ab9a06d8047def31efc6abbe }}</ref>

In 2018, a paper published in the journal [[Annals of Oncology]] mentioned that skin cancer could be detected more accurately by an artificial intelligence system (which used a deep learning convolutional neural network) than by [[dermatologist]]s. On average, the human dermatologists accurately detected 86.6% of skin cancers from the images, compared to 95% for the CNN machine.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/29/skin-cancer-computer-learns-to-detect-skin-cancer-more-accurately-than-a-doctor | title = Computer learns to detect skin cancer more accurately than doctors | work = The Guardian | date = 29 May 2018 }}</ref>

=== Disease Diagnosis ===

There are many diseases out there but there also many ways that AI has been used to efficiently and accurately diagnose them. Some of the diseases that are the most notorious such as Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) which are both in the top ten for causes of death worldwide have been the basis behind  a lot of the research/testing to help get an accurate diagnosis. Due to such a high mortality rate being associated with these diseases there have been efforts to integrate various methods in helping get accurate diagnosis’.

An article by Jiang, et al (2017)<ref name="Jiang_2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang F, Jiang Y, Zhi H, Dong Y, Li H, Ma S, Wang Y, Dong Q, Shen H, Wang Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Artificial intelligence in healthcare: past, present and future | journal = Stroke and Vascular Neurology | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 230–243 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29507784 | pmc = 5829945 | doi = 10.1136/svn-2017-000101 }}</ref> demonstrated that there are multiple different types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases. Some of these techniques discussed by Jiang, et al include: Support vector machines, neural networks, Decision trees, and many more. Each of these techniques are described as having a “training goal” so “classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible…”.<ref name="Jiang_2017" />

To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases include using “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian Networks (BN)”<ref name="Alić_2017">{{cite journal| vauthors = Alić B, Gurbeta L, Badnjević A |date= June 2017 |title=Machine learning techniques for classification of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases|journal=2017 6th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)|pages=1–4|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/meco.2017.7977152|isbn=978-1-5090-6742-8}}</ref>. From a review of multiple different papers within the timeframe of 2008-2017<ref name="Alić_2017" /> observed within them which of the two techniques were better.  The conclusion that was drawn was that “the early classification of these  diseases can be achieved developing machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network and Bayesian Network.”  Another conclusion Alic, et al (2017)<ref name="Alić_2017" /> was able to draw was that between the two ANN and BN that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes/CVD with a mean accuracy in “both cases (87.29 for diabetes and 89.38 for CVD). 

=== Telehealth ===
The increase of [[Telehealth|Telemedicine]], has shown the rise of possible AI applications.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pacis|first=Danica | name-list-format = vanc |date=February 2018|title=Trends in telemedicine utilizing artificial intelligence|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=1933 |issue=1 |pages=040009 |doi=10.1063/1.5023979 |bibcode=2018AIPC.1933d0009P }}</ref> The ability to monitor patients using AI may allow for the communication of information to physicians if possible disease activity may have occurred.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.talkyblog.com/artificial-intelligence/ |title=Artificial Intelligence {{!}} Types of AI {{!}} 7 Practical Usage of Artificial Intelligence |date=2019-07-12 |website=Talky Blog |access-date=2019-07-27 }}</ref> A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and also allow for the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans.

=== Electronic health records ===
Electronic health records are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. However logging all of this data comes with its own problems like cognitive overload and burnout for users. EHR developers are now automating much of the process and even starting to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to improve this process. One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70–72% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response at baseline.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Meaning using an AI tool that scans EHR data it can pretty accurately predict the course of disease in a person.

=== Drug Interactions ===
Improvements in [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]] led to the development of algorithms to identify [[Drug interactions|drug-drug interactions]] in medical literature.<ref name=":0">B.

Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content, especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Organizations such as the [[FDA Adverse Event Reporting System]] (FAERS) and the World Health Organization’s [[VigiBase]] allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions.<ref>B.

[[Infermedica]]'s free mobile application Symptomate is the top-rated symptom checker in [[Google Play]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://appgrooves.com/app/symptomate-symptom-checker-by-infermedica-sp-z-o-o | title = Symptomate - Symptom Checker | work = AppGrooves | date = 15 November 2018 }}</ref> The company also released the first [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-based [[voice assistant]] symptom checker for three major voice platforms: [[Amazon Alexa]],<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Infermedica-Symptom-Checker/dp/B071JFJWZC | title = Symptom Checker | work = [[Amazon.com]] | access-date = 15 November 2018 }}</ref> [[Microsoft Cortana]],<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/skills/all/symptomate | title = Symptomate - Cortana Skills | work = [[Microsoft Cortana]] | access-date = 15 November 2018 }}</ref> and [[Google Assistant]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000a04396478b | title = Symptomate| work = [[Google Assistant]] | access-date = 15 November 2018 }}</ref>

A team associated with the [[University of Arizona]] and backed by BPU Holdings began collaborating on a practical tool to monitor [[anxiety]] and [[delirium]] in hospital patients, particularly those with [[Dementia]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.itij.com/IHHR/story/bringing-aei-technology-hospitals |title=Bringing AEI technology into hospitals |last=Haigh |first=Lauren | name-list-format = vanc |date=2019-03-18 |website=International Travel & Health Insurance Journal|language=en|access-date=2019-03-19 }}</ref> The AI utilized in the new technology – Senior's Virtual Assistant – goes a step beyond and is programmed to simulate and understand human emotions (artificial emotional intelligence).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sevatec-llc.com/about-us/|title=About Us|website=Sevatechnology LLC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref> Doctors working on the project have suggested that in addition to judging emotional states, the application can be used to provide companionship to patients in the form of small talk, soothing music, and even lighting adjustments to control anxiety.

Digital consultant apps like [[Babylon Health|Babylon Health's GP at Hand]], [[Ada Health]], and [[Your.MD]] use AI to give medical consultation<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600868/the-artificially-intelligent-doctor-will-hear-you-now/ |title=The Artificially Intelligent Doctor Will Hear You Now |last=Parkin |first=Simon | name-list-format = vanc |date=9 March 2016|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution{{solution-inline|date=October 2019}} to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders).<ref>{{cite journal |title= Artificial Intelligence as a Growth Engine for Health Care Startups: Emerging Business Models|journal = California Management Review |volume = 61 |issue = 2 |pages = 59–83 | last=Garbuio |first=Massimo |last2=Lin| first2=Nidthida | name-list-format = vanc |doi= 10.1177/0008125618811931b |year = 2019 |doi-broken-date = 2019-11-23}}</ref>

==Implications==

The use of AI is predicted to decrease medical costs as there will be more accuracy in diagnosis and better predictions in the treatment plan as well as more prevention of disease. Already, there is evidence that the use of chatbots leads to positive outcomes in the field of mental health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Using Chat Interfaces for Mental Health Interventions|url=https://thechatbot.net/chatbot-for-mental-health|date=11 December 2018}}</ref>

Other future uses for AI include Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI) which are predicted to help those with trouble moving, speaking or with a spinal cord injury. The BCIs will use AI to help these patients move and communicate by decoding neural activates.<ref name="Bresnick, Jennifer p 12">{{cite web | last = Bresnick | first = Jennifer | name-list-format = vanc | title = Top 12 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Healthcare | work = HealthITAnalytics | date = 30 April 2018 | url = https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-healthcare }}</ref>

Virtual nursing assistants are predicted to become more common and these will use AI to answer patient's questions and help reduce unnecessary hospital visits. They will be useful as they are available 24/7 and may eventually be able to give wellness checks with the use of AI and voice.<ref>{{cite web | title = 10 Common Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care | work = Novatio | date = 30 August 2017 | url = https://novatiosolutions.com/10-common-applications-artificial-intelligence-healthcare/ }}</ref>

As technology evolves and is implemented in more workplaces, many fear that their jobs will be replaced by robots or machines. The U.S. News Staff (2018) writes that in the near future, doctors who utilize AI will “win out” over the doctors who don't. AI will not replace healthcare workers but instead allow them more time for bed side cares. AI may avert healthcare worker burn out and cognitive overload. Overall, as Quan-Haase (2018) says, technology “extends to the accomplishment of societal goals, including higher levels of security, better means of communication over time and space, improved health care, and increased autonomy” (p.&nbsp;43). As we adapt and utilize AI into our practice we can enhance our care to our patients resulting in greater outcomes for all.

==Expanding care to developing nations==
With an increase in the use of AI, more care may become available to those in developing nations. AI continues to expand in its abilities and as it is able to interpret radiology, it may be able to diagnose more people with the need for less doctors as there is a shortage in many of these nations.<ref name="Bresnick, Jennifer p 12"/>
The goal of AI is to teach others in the world, which will then lead to improved treatment, and eventually greater global health. Using AI in developing nations who do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can use AI to improve patient care.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen AF, Zoga AC, Vaccaro AR | title = Point/Counterpoint: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. | journal = Healthcare Transformation | date = 1 November 2017 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–92 | doi = 10.1089/heat2017.29042.pcp | doi-broken-date = 2019-11-23 }}</ref> For example, Natural language processing, and machine learning are being used for guiding cancer treatments in places such as Thailand, China and India. Researchers trained an AI application to use NLP to mine through patient records, and provide treatment. The ultimate decision made by the AI application agreed with expert decisions 90% of the time.

==Regulation==

While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as [[algorithmic bias]], [[Do not resuscitate]] implications, and other [[machine morality]] issues. These challenges of the clinical use of AI has brought upon potential need for regulations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/resources/article/artificial-intelligence-in-health-care-applications-and-legal-issues |title= Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Applications and Legal Issues |work=Petrie-Flom Center |access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref>

Currently no regulations exist specifically for the use of AI in healthcare. In May 2016, the [[White House]] announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the [[National Science and Technology Council]] (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.<ref name="auto4">{{cite web | vauthors = Felten E | title = Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence. | work = Whitehouse.gov | date = 3 May 2016 | url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/03/preparing-future-artificial-intelligence }}</ref> In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D plan for the subfield of health information technology is in development stages.<ref>{{cite web | title = The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan | work = Office of Science and Technology Policy | date = 16 October 2016 | url =  https://www.nitrd.gov/PUBS/national_ai_rd_strategic_plan.pdf }}</ref>

The only agency that has expressed concern is the FDA. Bakul Patel, the Associate Center Director for Digital Health of the FDA, is quoted saying in May 2017.<blockquote>“We're trying to get people who have hands-on development experience with a product's full life cycle. We already have some scientists who know artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we want complementary people who can look forward and see how this technology will evolve.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/fda-assembles-team-to-oversee-ai-revolution-in-health|title=FDA Assembles Team to Oversee AI Revolution in Health|website=IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref></blockquote>The joint [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] - [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Focus Group on AI for Health has built a platform for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx|title=Focus Group on "Artificial Intelligence for Health"|website=www.itu.int|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/10/04/9t-global-healthcare-strengthened-by-itu-focus-group-ai-for-health/|title=$9T Global Healthcare Strengthened By ITU Focus Group AI For Health |last=Ibaraki |first=Stephen| name-list-format = vanc |website=Forbes |access-date=2018-12-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/news/2018/artificial-intelligence-for-health-itu-and-who-call-for-proposals.html|title=Artificial Intelligence for Health: ITU and WHO Call for Proposals – Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute|website=www.hhi.fraunhofer.de|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>
