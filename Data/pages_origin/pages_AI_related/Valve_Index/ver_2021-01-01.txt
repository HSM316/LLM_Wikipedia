The panels are full [[RGB]] and can operate at refresh rates of 80&nbsp;Hz, 90&nbsp;Hz, 120&nbsp;Hz, or a currently experimental 144&nbsp;Hz mode.<ref name="indexspecs-official" /> The specified field of view is 130° but users{{Who|date=October 2020}} report a practical field of view of 120°.<ref>{{cite web |title=Valve Index vs Vive Pro vs Reverb G2: Do We Have a VR King? |url=https://circuitstream.com/blog/valve-index-vs-vive-pro-vs-reverb-g2/ |website=Circuit Stream |publisher=Circuit Stream |accessdate=22 November 2020 |language=en-US |date=22 October 2020 |quote=Compared to other headsets on the market, Valve Index currently has the highest field of view (FOV) of 130 degrees (perceived as 120)}}{{unreliable source|date=December 2020}}</ref>

=== Tracking ===
The headset and controllers both support Valve's Lighthouse 2.0 tracking system,<ref name="ars-reveal" /> while retaining full compatibility with all previous [[HTC Vive]] base stations.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-04|title=Do HTC Vive lighthouse base stations work with the Valve Index headset?|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/can-you-use-htc-vive-base-stations-valve-index|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Windows Central}}</ref>

=== Controls ===
The headset is intended to be used with the Valve Index Controllers, known during development as the Knuckles Controllers,<ref name="roadtovr-leak" /> but is also backwards compatible with the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pro controllers.<ref name="index-storepage" /> The Valve Index Controllers have a joystick, touchpad, two face buttons, a menu button, a trigger, and an array of 87 sensors that allow the controllers to track hand position, finger position, motion, and pressure to create an accurate representation of the user's hand in virtual reality.<ref name="controllerspecs-official" /> Valve Index supports both the [[Windows]] and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name="index-storepage" /><ref name="tomshardware-linuxsupport" />

=== Audio ===
The Index features "a pair of ultra near-field, full range, off-ear (extra-aural) headphones", which use BMR drivers to create accurate and immersive low frequency sounds.

=== Connections ===
The Index uses a single connection which splits off into video/audio, USB and power.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The Valve Index is Valve's first virtual reality headset developed and manufactured in house, and is planned to be the launch console for Valve's upcoming virtual reality games. Development on a completely first party headset started some time around 2015 according to interviews with staff, before the release of their Vive headset with HTC.

=== Release ===
It sold an estimated 149,000 sets in 2019, 103,000 of which were in the 4th quarter due to the announcement of ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'', which buyers received for free.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/superdata-xr-update |title=SuperData XR Quarterly Update |website=SuperData, a Nielsen Company}}</ref> The sudden demand caused the unit to be sold out in all 31 countries except [[Japan]] in January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-01-15-valve-index-out-of-stock-around-the-globe-ahead-of-half-life-alyx-launch |title=Valve Index out of stock around the globe ahead of Half-Life: Alyx launch |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref> As of December 2019, 6.67% of the VR units connected to Steam are Valve Index sets.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.roadtovr.com/analysis-monthly-connected-vr-headsets-on-steam-record-high/ |title=Analysis: Monthly-connected VR Headsets on Steam Reach Record High of 1.3 Million |first=Ben |last=Lang |date=January 29, 2020}}</ref> While Valve had anticipated supply for many of those that had ordered the Index in time for the March 2020 release of ''Half-Life: Alyx'', the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] impacted production of the Index which left Valve with a reduced number of units available on the release date.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vg247.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-has-affected-the-production-schedule-for-valve-index-fewer-units-to-be-made-available/ | title=Coronavirus has affected the production schedule for Valve Index, fewer units to be made available | first=Stephany | last=Nunneley | date=February 21, 2020 | accessdate = February 21, 2020 | work=[[VG247]] }}</ref>
