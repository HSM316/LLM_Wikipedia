'''Affectiva''' is a software company that builds [[artificial intelligence]] that understands human emotions, cognitive states, activities and the objects people use, by analyzing facial and vocal expressions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Affectiva cloud API helps machines understand emotions in human speech|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/new-affectiva-cloud-api-helps-machines-understand-emotions-in-human-speech/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}</ref> The company spun out of [[MIT Media Lab]]<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Khatchadourian|first=Raffi|title=We Know How You Feel|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/19/know-feel|access-date=2020-11-20|magazine=The New Yorker|language=en-us}}</ref> and created the new technology category of Artificial Emotional Intelligence ([[Emotion AI]]).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Press|first=Gil|title=Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) Leaders: Rana el Kaliouby, Affectiva|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2017/06/12/emerging-artificial-intelligence-ai-leaders-rana-el-kaliouby-affectiva/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

==Technology==
The company has expanded its Emotion AI technology to detect more than facial expressions, reactions and emotions. Affectiva’s software detects complex and nuanced emotions, cognitive states, such as drowsiness and distraction, certain activities and the objects people use. It does that by analyzing the human face, vocal intonations and body posture.

Affectiva’s AI is built with deep learning, computer vision, [[speech analytics]] and large amounts of data that has been collected in real-world scenarios.<ref name="DigitalTrends">{{Cite web|title=How emotion-tracking A.I. will change computing as we know it|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/rise-of-emotion-tracking-tech/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.digitaltrends.com|date=18 April 2019}}</ref> The AI uses an optical sensor like a webcam or smartphone camera to identify a human face in real-time.<ref name="DigitalTrends" /> Then, computer vision algorithms identify key features on the face, which are analyzed by deep learning algorithms to classify facial expressions.
