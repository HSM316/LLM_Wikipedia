==Emotion measurement technology==
Affectiva's technology enables [[software application]]s to use a [[webcam]] to track a user's smirks, smiles, frowns and furrows, which measures the user's levels of surprise, amusement or confusion.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" />

The technology also allows a person's [[heart rate]] to be measured from a webcam without the person wearing a sensor. This is accomplished by tracking color changes in the person's face, which pulses each time the heart beats.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" />

===Applications===
Affectiva's Affdex technology<ref name="affdex-info" /> is based on affective science and machine learning algorithms published in the peer-reviewed literature on affect recognition.  When a user opts in, Affdex can be used via a low-cost webcam to observe the user's face while he or she watches content on the screen, tracking their smirks, smiles, frowns and furrows to measure their likely levels of surprise, amusement or confusion throughout a viewing experience, and comparing them to other viewers across different demographics.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" /><ref name="forbes-sb13" /><ref name="forbes-ces13" /><ref name="adage-ces13" /> The company developed the first online [[face tracking]] system for evaluation of advertising effectiveness as one of several applications of the technology.<ref name="forbes-sb13" /> Their clients for this technology include [[Coca-Cola]] <ref name="cnet-sb13" /> and other companies and content-creators who use the technology to better understand viewers' experience -- e.g., to see when a student watching an educational video finds it engaging or boring.  The technology is also being used to better understand the state of a driver or passenger in a car, with the aim of improving safety and experience for people inside vehicles.   

Political polling utilizes the technology to measure people's responses to a political debate.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" />

Games using this technology can adapt to a user's emotional experience, or the user's emotional state.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" /><ref name="forbes-ces13" /><ref name="vb-neurogames">{{cite news | url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/17/let-the-neurogames-begin/ | title=Let the NeuroGames Begin | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date=January 17, 2013 | accessdate=February 3, 2013 | author=Lynch, Zack}}</ref>

In its first three years of operation, Affectiva designed and sold the first comfortably wearable [[biosensor]] measuring [[electrodermal activity]], the "Q Sensor," that monitors changes in the user's emotional state via their skin.<ref name="huffpo-dec12" /><ref name="qsensor-info" /> 

In September 2017, Affectiva launched a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] [[Application programming interface|API]] to detect a range of emotion in human speech.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/new-affectiva-cloud-api-helps-machines-understand-emotions-in-human-speech/|title=New Affectiva cloud API helps machines understand emotions in human speech|last=Miller|first=Ron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Affectiva was co-founded by [[Rana el Kaliouby|Rana el Kaliouby, Ph.D.]], who became [[chief executive officer]] as of May 25, 2016,<ref name="prnews"/> and [[Rosalind Picard|Rosalind W. Picard, Sc.D.]], who worked as Chairman and Chief Scientist until 2013.  Motivated by growing demand for functions provided by the Q sensor (which Affectiva discontinued in 2013) and motivated by the medical needs of patients with epilepsy, Picard co-founded a new company, Empatica Inc., that created the first FDA-cleared smart watch for use in Neurology.  Both of Affectiva's early products grew out of collaborative research at the [[MIT Media Lab|MIT's Media Lab]]<ref name="huffpo-dec12" /><ref name="nsf-pr1" /><ref name="forbes-ces13" /> to help people on the [[autism spectrum]].<ref name="vb-neurogames" />

The company featured its technology and products at [[International CES#2013|Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2013]].<ref name="cnet-sb13" /><ref name="forbes-ces13" /><ref name="adage-ces13" /><ref name="bostinno-ces13">{{cite news | url=http://bostinno.com/2013/01/07/ces-2013-news/#ss__280891_280661_2__ss | title=Some Boston Companies to Watch at CES This Week | work=[[BostInno]] | date=January 7, 2013 | accessdate=February 3, 2013 | author=Frick, Walter}}</ref>
