'''Operational artificial intelligence''', or '''operational AI''', is a type of intelligent system designed for real-world applications, particularly at commercial scale. The term is used to distinguish accessible [[artificially intelligent]] (AI) systems from [[fundamental research|fundamental]] AI research and from [[industrial AI]] applications which are not integrated with the routine usage of a business. The definition of operational AI differs throughout the IT [[Industry (economics)|industry]], where vendors and individual organizations often create their own custom definitions of such processes and services for the purpose of marketing their own products. 

Applications include [[text analytics]], advanced analytics, [[facial recognition system|facial]] and [[image recognition]], machine learning, and [[natural language generation]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Gordon |title=The insurance industry is a prime target for AI technologies and solutions |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-insurance-industry-is-a-prime-target-for-ai-technologies-and-solutions/ |website=ZDNet |publisher=Forester Research |accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>

According to a white paper by software company Tupl Inc, continuous machine learning model training and results extraction in the telecom industry requires a large number of automation utilities in order to "facilitate the development and deployment of a multitude of use cases, the collection and correlation of the data, the creation and training of the models, and the operation at telecom-grade levels of security and availability".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tapia| last2=Palacios |last3=Noël| last4=Hautakangas |first1=Pablo| first2=Enrique| first3=Laurent| first4=Petri |title=Implementing Operational AI in Telecom Environments |url=https://www.tupl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tupl-white-paper-operational-ai.pdf |website=tupl.com |publisher=Tupl, inc. |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>
