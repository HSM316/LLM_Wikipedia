'''AlphaStar''' is a [[computer program]] by [[DeepMind]] that plays the video game ''[[StarCraft II]]''. It was unveiled to the public by name in January 2019. In a significant milestone for [[artificial intelligence]], AlphaStar attained Grandmaster status in August 2019.

== Background ==
Games created for humans are considered to have [[external validity]] as benchmarks of [[progress in artificial intelligence]]. IBM's chess-playing [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] (1997) and DeepMind's [[AlphaGo]] (2016) were considered major milestones; some argue that ''StarCraft'' would also be a major milestone, due to ''StarCraft's'' "real-time play, partial observability, no single dominant strategy, complex rules that make it hard to build a fast forward model, and a particularly large and varied action space."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arulkumaran |first1=Kai |last2=Antoine |first2=Cully |last3=Togelius |first3=Julian |title=Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion |chapter=AlphaStar: An evolutionary computation perspective |date=July 2019 |pages=314–5 |doi=10.1145/3319619.3321894 |language=EN|arxiv=1902.01724 |isbn=9781450367486 |s2cid=59604439 }}</ref> Though difficult, ''StarCraft'' may still be tractable with current technology because "its rules are known and the world is discrete with only a few types of objects".<ref name="human compatible chapter 2">{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |authorlink1=Stuart J.

== History ==
DeepMind Technologies was founded in the UK in 2010. As early as 2011, founder [[Demis Hassabis]] called ''StarCraft'' "the next step up" after games like [[Go (game)|Go]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cheng |first1=Jonathan |title=Computers That Crush Humans at Games Might Have Met Their Match: 'StarCraft' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/computers-that-crush-humans-at-games-might-have-met-their-match-starcraft-1461344309 |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=22 April 2016}}</ref> DeepMind became a [[Google]] subsidiary in 2014, after demonstrating self-learning bots with superhuman ability at a variety of [[Atari 2600]] games. In February 2015, computer scientist [[Zachary Mason]] predicted Deepmind's research "leads to StarCraft in five or ten years".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gibbs |first1=Samuel |title=Google buys UK artificial intelligence startup Deepmind for £400m |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=27 January 2014}}</ref> In March 2016, following [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|AlphaGo's victory over Lee Sedol]], a world champion [[Go (game)|Go]] player, Hassabis publicly mulled building an AI for ''StarCraft'', citing it as a strategic game with [[incomplete information]] where (unlike Go) much of the "board" is invisible.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Byford |first1=Sam |title=DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis on how AI will shape the future |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=The Verge |date=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Google's Artificial Intelligence Project May Start Playing Video Games |url=https://fortune.com/2016/03/11/go-deepmind-starcraft/ |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=Fortune |language=en}}</ref> A formal collaboration was announced at [[BlizzCon]] in November 2016, alongside a plan to release an open development environment for bots in Q1 of 2017.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Byford |first1=Sam |title=Google DeepMind's next gaming challenge: can AI beat StarCraft II? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13518210/deepmind-starcraft-ai-google-blizzard |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=The Verge |date=4 November 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

By 2017, DeepMind was experimenting with feeding ''StarCraft'' data into its software. In August 2017, DeepMind and Blizzard released development tools to assist in bot development, as well as data from 65,000 past games. At the time, computer scientist and ''StarCraft'' tournament manager [[David Churchill]] guessed it would take five years for a bot to beat a human, but made the caveat that AlphaGo had beaten expectations. In ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', tech journalist Tom Simonite stated, "No one expects the robot to win anytime soon. But when it does, it will be a far greater achievement than DeepMind's conquest of Go."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Google DeepMind AI Declares Galactic War on StarCraft |url=https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ai-declares-galactic-war-on-starcraft-/ |accessdate=26 February 2020 |magazine=Wired |date=9 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

On 19 December 2018, DeepMind's bot defeated "a top professional player", Grzegorz "MaNa" Komincz, 5-0. DeepMind announced the bot, named "AlphaStar", on 24 January 2019. A journalist at [[Ars Technica]] and others argued that AlphaStar still had unfair advantages: "AlphaStar has the ability to make its clicks with surgical precision using an API, whereas human players are constrained by the mechanical limits of computer mice". AlphaStar also had a global view rather than being limited by the in-game camera. Furthermore, while there was a cap on the number of actions over a five-second window, AlphaStar was free to allocate its action quota unevenly across the window in order to launch superhuman bursts of activity at critical moments. DeepMind quickly retrained AlphaStar under more realistic constraints, and then lost a rematch with Komincz.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Timothy B. |title=An AI crushed two human pros at StarCraft—but it wasn't a fair fight |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/ |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=Ars Technica |date=30 January 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref> Starting in July 2019, the new, constrained version of AlphaStar anonymously competed against players who "opted in" on the public 1v1 European multiplayer ladder.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amadeo |first1=Ron |title=DeepMind AI is secretly lurking on the public StarCraft II 1v1 ladder |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/deepmind-ai-takes-on-the-public-in-starcraft-ii-multiplayer/ |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=Ars Technica |date=11 July 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref> By the end of August 2019, AlphaStar had attained "grandmaster level", ranking among the top 0.2 percent of human players.<ref name="verge grandmaster">{{cite news |last1=Statt |first1=Nick |title=DeepMind's StarCraft 2 AI is now better than 99.8 percent of all human players |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939147/deepmind-google-alphastar-starcraft-2-research-grandmaster-level |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=The Verge |date=30 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

== Algorithms ==
Unlike AlphaZero, AlphaStar initially learns to imitate the moves of the best players in its database of human vs. human games; this step is necessary to solve what DeepMind's [[David Silver (computer scientist)|Dave Silver]] calls "the exploration problem": discovering new strategies would otherwise be like finding a "needle in a haystack". Agents then play each other and deploy reinforcement learning. These main agents also learn by playing against suboptimal "exploiter agents" whose purpose is to expose weaknesses in the main agents.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |last1=Kelion |first1=Leo |title=DeepMind claims landmark moment for AI in esports |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50212841 |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=BBC News |date=30 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vinyals |first1=Oriol |last2=Babuschkin |first2=Igor |last3=Czarnecki |first3=Wojciech M. |last4=Mathieu |first4=Michaël |last5=Dudzik |first5=Andrew |last6=Chung |first6=Junyoung |last7=Choi |first7=David H. |last8=Powell |first8=Richard |last9=Ewalds |first9=Timo |last10=Georgiev |first10=Petko |last11=Oh |first11=Junhyuk |last12=Horgan |first12=Dan |last13=Kroiss |first13=Manuel |last14=Danihelka |first14=Ivo |last15=Huang |first15=Aja |last16=Sifre |first16=Laurent |last17=Cai |first17=Trevor |last18=Agapiou |first18=John P. |last19=Jaderberg |first19=Max |last20=Vezhnevets |first20=Alexander S. |last21=Leblond |first21=Rémi |last22=Pohlen |first22=Tobias |last23=Dalibard |first23=Valentin |last24=Budden |first24=David |last25=Sulsky |first25=Yury |last26=Molloy |first26=James |last27=Paine |first27=Tom L. |last28=Gulcehre |first28=Caglar |last29=Wang |first29=Ziyu |last30=Pfaff |first30=Tobias |last31=Wu |first31=Yuhuai |last32=Ring |first32=Roman |last33=Yogatama |first33=Dani |last34=Wünsch |first34=Dario |last35=McKinney |first35=Katrina |last36=Smith |first36=Oliver |last37=Schaul |first37=Tom |last38=Lillicrap |first38=Timothy |last39=Kavukcuoglu |first39=Koray |last40=Hassabis |first40=Demis |last41=Apps |first41=Chris |last42=Silver |first42=David |display-authors=3 |title=Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning |journal=Nature |date=30 October 2019 |volume=575 |issue=7782 |pages=350–354 |doi=10.1038/s41586-019-1724-z|pmid=31666705 |bibcode=2019Natur.575..350V |s2cid=204972004 }}</ref>

== Reactions ==
After his 5-0 defeat in December 2018, Komincz stated "I wasn't expecting the AI to be that good".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heaven |first1=Douglas |title=Mind meld: Artificial intelligence is improving the way humans think |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24332440-700-mind-meld-artificial-intelligence-is-improving-the-way-humans-think/ |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=New Scientist |date=21 August 2019}}</ref>

[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] assessed that AlphaStar's 2018 victory required "a fair amount of problem-specific effort" and that general-purpose methods were "not quite ready for StarCraft".<ref name="human compatible chapter 2"/>

An article in ''[[Wired UK]]'' judged AlphaStar's new constraints, adopted for the July 2019 matches, to be "fair" this time around.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lee |first1=Alex |title=DeepMind has finally thrashed humans at StarCraft for real |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-starcraft-alphastar |accessdate=26 February 2020 |magazine=Wired UK |date=30 October 2019}}</ref> ''StarCraft'' pro Raza "RazerBlader" Sekha stated AlphaStar was "impressive" but had its quirks, succumbing in one game to an unorthodox army composition made up of only air units. The UK's top player, Joshua "RiSky" Hayward, expressed some disappointment, saying AlphaStar "often didn't make the most efficient, strategic decisions".<ref name=bbc/> Pro Diego "Kelazhur" Schwimer called AlphaStar's play "unimaginably unusual; it really makes you question how much of StarCraft's diverse possibilities pro players have really explored".<ref name="verge grandmaster"/> AlphaStar's opponents often did not realize they were playing a bot.<ref>{{cite news |title=DeepMind claims breakthrough as AI masters StarCraft II game |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d659b056-fb28-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6 |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=2019}}</ref>

Ian Sample of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called AlphaStar a "landmark achievement" for the field of artificial intelligence.<ref name="guardian grandmaster">{{cite news |last1=Sample |first1=Ian |title=AI becomes grandmaster in 'fiendishly complex' StarCraft II |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/ai-becomes-grandmaster-in-fiendishly-complex-starcraft-ii |accessdate=26 February 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=30 October 2019}}</ref> Churchill stated that he had previously seen bots that master one or two elements of ''StarCraft'', but that AlphaStar was the first that can handle the game in its entirety.<ref name=smithsonian/> [[Gary Marcus]] expressed his continuing skepticism about deep learning, stating: "So far the field has struggled to take techniques like this out of the laboratory and game environments and into the real world, and I don't immediately see this result as progress in that direction".<ref name=bbc/> AI researcher Jon Dodge was surprised by AlphaStar, stating he did not expect such a "superhuman" performance for "another couple of years"; in contrast, Churchill states "StarCraft is nowhere near being 'solved', and AlphaStar is not yet even close to playing at a world champion level".<ref name="nature news"/>

== Legacy ==
DeepMind argues that insights from AlphaStar might benefit robots, self-driving cars and virtual assistants, which need to operate with "imperfectly observed information". <!-- DeepMind's David Silver --> Silver has indicated his lab "may rest at this point", rather than try to substantially improve AlphaStar.<ref name=bbc/> Silver himself argues that "AlphaStar has become the first AI system to reach the top tier of human performance in any professionally played e-sport on the full unrestricted game under professionally approved conditions... Ever since computers cracked Go, chess and poker, the game of StarCraft has emerged, essentially by consensus from the community, as the next grand challenge for AI."<ref name="guardian grandmaster"/>

Computer scientist [[Noel Sharkey]] argues, disapprovingly, that "military analysts will certainly be eyeing the successful AlphaStar real-time strategies as a clear example of the advantages of AI for battlefield planning".<ref name="guardian grandmaster"/> In contrast, Silver argues: "To say that this has any kind of military use is saying no more than to say an AI for chess could be used to lead to military applications".<ref name=bbc/>
