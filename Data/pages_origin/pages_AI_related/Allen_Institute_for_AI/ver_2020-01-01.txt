The '''Allen Institute for AI''' (abbreviated '''AI2''') is a research institute founded by late [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]]. The institute seeks to achieve scientific breakthroughs by constructing AI systems with reasoning, learning, and reading capabilities.<ref name=website>{{cite web|url = http://allenai.org/|title = AI2: Home|publisher = Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence|accessdate = January 25, 2014}}</ref> [[Oren Etzioni]] was appointed by Paul Allen in September 2013 to direct the research at the institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allenai.org/content/docs/PRFinal_OrenEtzioni_090413.pdf|title = Paul G.

==Projects==
*'''Aristo''': A flagship project of AI2, inspired by a similar project called Project Halo carried out by Seattle-based investment company Vulcan.<ref name="aristo">{{cite web|url=http://allenai.org/aristo|title=Project Aristo|publisher=Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref> The goal is to design an artificially intelligent system that can successfully read, learn, and reason from texts and ultimately demonstrate its knowledge by providing explainable question answering. The focus of the project is explained by the guiding philosophy that artificial intelligence is about having a mental model for how things operate and refining that mental model based on new knowledge.<ref name=theverge>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/24/4863414/paul-allen-and-artificial-intelligence-etzioni|title = Paul Allen and the Machines: teaching the next generation of artificial intelligence|last = Brandom|first = Russell|date = October 24, 2013|accessdate = January 25, 2014|website = [[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=aristo-research>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pclark/papers/akbc07-clark.pdf|title = A Study of the Knowledge Base Requirements for Passing an Elementary Science Test|author = Clark|author2 = Harrison|author3 = Balasubramanian|year = 2013|accessdate = January 25, 2014}}</ref>
*'''PRIOR''': A ground-breaking research project on visual knowledge extraction that capitalizes on the wealth of information available in images. PRIOR aims to create knowledge bases composed entirely of information derived from images, both static and video. The PRIOR team released the game Iconary in February 2018 as a demonstration of an AI that can understand and produce situated scenes from a limited set of icons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prior.allenai.org|title=AI2 : PRIOR}}</ref>
*'''[[Semantic Scholar]]''': This project is a platform for scientific literature search and discovery, focusing on semantics and textual understanding. This search engine allows users to find key survey papers about a topic or to produce a list of important citations or results in a given paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allenai.org/semantic-scholar.html|title=AI2 : Semantic Scholar|work=allenai.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org|title=Semantic Scholar|work=semanticscholar.org}}</ref> Semantic Scholar officially launched on November 2, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allenai.org/content/articles/Semantic-Scholar.pdf|title=Semantic Scholar Utilizes Artificial Intelligence Methods to Transform Scientific Search for Computer Scientists|work=allenai.org|access-date=2015-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123100529/http://allenai.org/content/articles/Semantic-Scholar.pdf|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> In September 2017, Semantic Scholar added biomedical papers to its corpus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/allen-institute-for-ais-semantic-scholar-adds-biomedical-papers-to-its-ai-sorted-corpus/|title=Allen Institute for AI's Semantic Scholar adds biomedical papers to its AI-sorted corpus|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en}}</ref>
*'''AllenNLP''': AllenNLP is an open-source [[Natural language processing|NLP]] research library built on [[PyTorch]]. AllenNLP also includes reference implementations of high-quality models for both core NLP problems (e.g. [[semantic role labeling]]) and NLP applications (e.g. [[textual entailment]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allennlp.org/|title=AllenNLP|website=allennlp.org|access-date=2019-02-16}}</ref>
*'''MOSAIC''': The Mosaic project is focused on defining and building [[Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)|common sense knowledge]] and reasoning for AI systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mosaic.allenai.org/|title=Mosaic|website=mosaic.allenai.org|access-date=2019-02-16}}</ref>

===Partnerships===
In 2018, the institute partnered with the [[University of Washington]] to explore [[deep learning]] [[artificial intelligence]] designed to predict how dogs would respond to stimulus. Researchers used over 20,000 frames of video to train an AI to predict movements and learn other dog behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/ai-behaves-like-dogs/|publisher=Digital Trends|title=Forget Cloning Dogs, A.I. Is The Real Way to Let Your Pooch Live Forever|date=13 April 2018}}</ref>

AI2 also partnered with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Washington to develop an artificial intelligence named the "Composition, Retrieval and Fusion Network" (CRAFT). After the AI was trained with a database of over 25,000 videos from the U.S. television show ''[[The Flintstones]]'', it was able to create novel short video clips from natural language captions that resembled the cartoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/04/11/researchers-trained-an-ai-to-create-flintstones-cartoons/|publisher=The Next Web|title=Researchers Trained an AI to Create Flintstones Cartoons|date=12 April 2018}}</ref>

==Startup incubator==
The institute's startup incubator launched in 2015 with the intent to develop technologies in the artificial intelligence field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/paul-allens-artificial-intelligence-institute-launches-startup-incubator-with-top-minds-in-ai/|title=Paul Allen's Artificial Intelligence Institute launches startup incubator with top minds in AI - GeekWire|author=John Cook|work=GeekWire}}</ref>

==Media coverage==

AI2 was the subject of an in-depth article in ''[[The Verge]]''.<ref name=theverge/> Its launch was covered in [[Xconomy]],<ref name=xconomy/> and [[GeekWire]].<ref name=geekwire/> Allen and Etzioni co-authored an article for [[CNN]] about artificial intelligence and AI2 in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/11/business/star-trek-siri-machine-reading-revolution/index.html|title = From Star Trek to Siri: How the Machine-Reading Revolution will dictate the future|last = Allen|first = Paul|authorlink = Paul Allen|last2 = Etzioni|first2 = Oren|authorlink2 = Oren Etzioni|date = December 11, 2013|accessdate = January 25, 2014|publisher = [[CNN]]}}</ref> AI2 has also been mentioned in other articles discussing the current state of and trends in artificial intelligence research.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allenai.org/news-articles/news-articles-all.html|title=AI2: News Articles}}</ref>
