'''ACROSS''' is a Singular Strategic R&D Project led by Treelogic<ref>[http://www.treelogic.com Treelogic]</ref> funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade<ref>[http://www.mityc.es Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207090817/http://www7.mityc.es/ |date=2009-12-07 }} through the Plan Avanza I+D initiative. ACROSS carries out [[research and development]]</ref> activities in the field of [[Robotics]] and [[Cognitive informatics|Cognitive Computing]] over an execution time-frame from 2009 to 2011. ACROSS project involves a number higher than 100 researchers from 13 Spanish entities.

== ACROSS project objectives ==
ACROSS modifies the design of [[social robot]]ics, blocked in providing predefined services, going further by means of [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]]. These systems are able to self-reconfigure and modify their behavior autonomously through the capacity for understanding, learning and software [[Virtual private network|remote access]].

In order to provide an open framework for collaboration between universities, [[research center]]s and the Administration, ACROSS develops Open Source Services available to everybody.

== Three application domains ==
ACROSS works in three [[application domain]]s:

* Autonomous living: robots are used as technological tools to help handicapped person into daily tasks.
* Psycho-Affective Disorders ([[autism]]): robots are used to mitigate [[cognitive disorder]]s.
* Marketing: robots are used to interact with humans in a [[recreation]]al approach.
