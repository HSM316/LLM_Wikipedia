'''''Black Mirror''''' is a British<!-- the series was produced in the United Kingdom and was originally broadcast on Channel 4, a British TV station --> [[anthology series|anthology]] television series created by [[Charlie Brooker]]. Individual episodes explore a diversity of genres, but most are set in near-future [[dystopia]]s with [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] technology—a type of [[speculative fiction]]. The series is inspired by ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and uses the themes of technology and media to comment on contemporary social issues. Most episodes are written by Brooker with heavy involvement by the executive producer [[Annabel Jones]].

There are 27 episodes across six series and one special, in addition to the [[interactive film]] ''[[Black Mirror: Bandersnatch]]'' (2018). The first two series aired on the British network [[Channel 4]] in 2011 and 2013, as did the 2014 special "[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]". The programme then moved to [[Netflix]], where four further series aired in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2023. A seventh series is in development. Two related [[webisode]] series were produced by Netflix, and a companion book to the first four series, ''Inside Black Mirror'', was published in 2018. Soundtracks to many episodes have been released as albums.

The series has received critical acclaim and is considered by many reviewers to be one of the best television series of the 2010s. However, some critics have found the morality of the series obvious or cite declining quality over time. The programme won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie]] three times consecutively for "[[San Junipero]]", "[[USS Callister]]" and ''Bandersnatch''. ''Black Mirror'', along with ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[Inside No. 9]]'', has been credited with repopularising the anthology television format, and a number of episodes have been seen by reviewers as prescient.

''Black Mirror'' can be seen to demonstrate a negative view of unending pursuit of scientific and technological advancement.<ref name="QRFV"/> The majority of episodes end unhappily.<ref name="Via Panorâmica"/> However, characters who carefully consider the risks of technology with which they engage are met with happy endings, as in "San Junipero".<ref name="QRFV"/> Juliana Lopes of ''Via Panorâmica'' argued that the dystopian settings resemble the French Marxist [[Guy Debord]]'s concept of the [[spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]], wherein mass media create [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and an unattainable [[utopia]] for individuals to pursue. For instance, in "Nosedive", the protagonist Lacie strives for a utopian life through superficiality and performativity, in a society where social media success contributes to high socioeconomic status.<ref name="Via Panorâmica"/> Academics writing in ''[[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]]'' found that ''Black Mirror'' episodes fall into a genre of "mind-game films", wherein protagonists are disoriented and narratives are non-linear or fragmented.

The series was created by Brooker, who was previously known as a comedy writer.<ref name="Scriptnotes"/> He wrote video game reviews for ''[[PC Zone]]'' in the late 1990s and began writing television reviews for ''The Guardian'' and making television in the 2000s.<ref name="Wired profile">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-annabel-jones-season-five|title=Inside the prophetic, angry mind of Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|last=Reynolds|first=Matt|date=11 April 2019|access-date=14 June 2021|archive-date=26 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126123421/https://www.wired.co.uk/article/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-annabel-jones-season-five|url-status=live}}</ref> Brooker had completed production of ''[[Dead Set]]'' (2008), a zombie-based drama series, and while working on ''[[Newswipe with Charlie Brooker|Newswipe]]'' (2009–2010) and other programmes, decided to make an anthology drama series. It was modelled in the style of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959–1964), ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (1979–1988) and ''[[Hammer House of Horror]]'' (1980).<ref name="guardian_a">{{cite news |title=Charlie Brooker: the dark side of our gadget addiction |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/charlie-brooker-dark-side-gadget-addiction-black-mirror |access-date=17 December 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 December 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005141925/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/charlie-brooker-dark-side-gadget-addiction-black-mirror |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="denofgeek interview">{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/21083/charlie-brooker-interview-black-mirror-videogames-gameswipe-and-a-touch-of-cloth |title=Charlie Brooker interview: Black Mirror, videogames, Gameswipe and A Touch Of Cloth |first=Ryan |last=Lamble |date=12 February 2012 |access-date=7 December 2017 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208005054/http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/21083/charlie-brooker-interview-black-mirror-videogames-gameswipe-and-a-touch-of-cloth |archive-date=8 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Brooker recognised that [[Rod Serling]] had based ''The Twilight Zone'' on contemporary issues, often controversial ones such as racism, but placed them in fictional settings to get around television censors at the time. Brooker realised he could comment similarly on modern issues, specifically focusing on technology, a topic he explored in producing the series ''[[How TV Ruined Your Life]]'' (2011). He aimed to explore "the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time".<ref name="guardian_a" />

Brooker wanted to keep the anthology approach, using new stories, settings, characters, and actors for each episode, as he felt this was a key element of enjoying series like ''The Twilight Zone''. This approach would allow ''Black Mirror'' to contrast with current dramas and serials that had a standard recurring cast.<ref name="guardian_a" /> According to Brooker, the production team considered giving the series a linking theme or presenter, but ultimately decided not to.<ref name="SFX_Magazine">{{cite news |title=Charlie Brooker Talks The Twilight Zone And Technology |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/02/01/charlie-brooker-talks-the-twilight-zone-and-technology/ |access-date=4 February 2013 |magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |date=1 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205075847/http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/02/01/charlie-brooker-talks-the-twilight-zone-and-technology/ |archive-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Series 1 ===
[[File:Rory Kinnear 2012 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Rory Kinnear|[[Rory Kinnear]] starred as Prime Minister Michael Callow in the first episode, "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]".]]
The series's inception was in 2010. Brooker and Jones had begun to work together on ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', a television review programme which aired from 2006 to 2008. The first pitch for ''Black Mirror'', to the head of comedy at Channel 4, was for eight half-hour episodes by different authors. Technology was a lesser focus, and the worlds were larger and more detailed, which Jones said was not possible to execute properly in the short runtime. The series was then commissioned for three-hour-long episodes. The first script was "Fifteen Million Merits".<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|6–13}} The second was "Inbound", an episode that was never produced: it was a science fiction adaptation of what was revealed at the end to be a true story about a boy in the [[Iraq War]].<ref name="S&FS"/>{{rp|1:01:00}} Concepts from it were later repurposed for "Men Against Fire". The following script pitched became "The National Anthem", the first episode to air. The third episode is "The Entire History of You".<ref name="ibm">{{cite book | title= Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher = [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|6–13}}

The programme was produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for the Dutch media company [[Endemol]]. Joel Collins served as production designer, with his company Painting Practice working on visual effects. In the early stages of ''Black Mirror'', Jones was keen to avoid casting comedy actors, as Brooker was previously a comedy writer, and they wanted to distance the series from the genre.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|16, 18}} The production occurred concurrent to that of ''[[A Touch of Cloth]]'', a satirical police procedural series that Brooker wrote for.<ref name="S&FS"/>{{rp|0:23:00}} The series aired weekly from 4 December 2011. "The National Anthem" features [[Rory Kinnear]] as a British prime minister who must have sex with a pig for a kidnapped Princess to be released. In "Fifteen Million Merits", [[Daniel Kaluuya]] plays Bing and [[Jessica Brown Findlay]] plays Abi, two characters in a society where most people must cycle each day to earn currency. "The Entire History of You" follows the married couple Liam and Ffion, played by [[Toby Kebbell]] and [[Jodie Whittaker]], respectively, as Liam becomes suspicious of Ffion's relationship to a friend.<ref name="guardian_a"/>

=== Series 2 ===
[[File:Lenoracrichlow.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Lenora Crichlow|[[Lenora Crichlow]] starred as Victoria Skillane in "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]".]]
The first series was expensive for Channel 4, as the anthology format meant there were no [[economies of scale]], but ''Black Mirror'' was commissioned for a second series of three episodes. Brooker described it as "more epic in scale, but more intimate in scope": the episodes have more understated technologies. Brooker commented that the second series mirrors the first: the former has topics of (in order) "warped political satire", "dystopian [[hellscape]]", and "relationship torn apart by technology", while the latter presents episodes of these forms in reverse. Each episode in the first series had a male protagonist, so Brooker deliberately wrote female protagonists for the first two episodes, "[[Be Right Back]]" and "White Bear".<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|59–64}}

A trailer for the second series was made by [[Moving Picture Company]] and featured a dream sequence, a factory and a large dust cloud, but no extracts of series two episodes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/motion-graphics/mpc-creates-darkly-compelling-ads-for-charlie-brookers-black-mirror/ |title=MPC creates darkly compelling ads for Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |website=Digital Arts |date=29 January 2013 |access-date=16 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050737/https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/motion-graphics/mpc-creates-darkly-compelling-ads-for-charlie-brookers-black-mirror/ |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The series aired weekly from 11 February 2013. "Be Right Back" follows Martha ([[Hayley Atwell]]) turning to artificial intelligence for emotional support while grieving over the death of her partner Ash ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]). [[Lenora Crichlow]] stars as Victoria Skillane, a woman in an apocalypse who has lost her memory, in "White Bear". "[[The Waldo Moment]]" is a political satire starring [[Daniel Rigby]] as Jamie Salter, a man who contests a by-election as an animated bear. ''Black Mirror'' was first made available in the US from November 2013 via [[DirecTV]], where episodes aired on [[Audience (TV network)|Audience]] and were available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-1-the-national-anthem-pig-bang-theory/|title=Black Mirror Episode 1, 'The National Anthem': Pig Bang Theory|work=[[Grantland]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=14 November 2013|access-date=20 March 2020|archive-date=30 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630154648/http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-1-the-national-anthem-pig-bang-theory/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== "White Christmas" ===
[[File:Jon Hamm lightened and cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Jon Hamm|[[Jon Hamm]], who played Matt in "[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]"]]
According to Brooker, the series was still taking its budget from the comedy department of Channel 4, and there was discussion of whether it should fall under the drama department instead. Shane Allen, head of comedy for Channel 4 at the time, stated in 2018 that someone had been taken aback by the budget for ''Black Mirror'', which was well above the standard for a comedy. The new head of comedy did not have an existing relationship with Brooker and Jones.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}}

Brooker reported in 2018 that Channel 4 agreed on a third series of four episodes, but requested detailed synopses of the episodes in advance. Brooker came up with an episode "Angel of the Morning", which would later become a story in "White Christmas". He also conceived of an episode based on the earlier script "Inbound" which would have been similar to the later "Men Against Fire". Another episode was named "Crocodile", which overlapped in parts with the series four episode of the same name. After a lengthy wait, Brooker and Jones were told that the ideas "weren't very ''Black Mirror''". Though Channel 4 may have suggested making a one-off special, Jones said that she felt a lack of clarity from them.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}}

Jones and Brooker worked on other projects for the next year, such as ''A Touch of Cloth''.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–105}} They set up House of Tomorrow, a division of Endemol under which later ''Black Mirror'' content would be produced.<ref name="Variety Endemol"/> After bumping into a Channel 4 staff member, Brooker emailed the channel to ask how to continue with ''Black Mirror''. Channel 4 had the budget for an hour-long Christmas special, but Jones and Brooker pushed for a 90-minute episode. "White Christmas" was a portmanteau of three stories, inspired by works such as the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. It starred [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt and [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe throughout. Actors in the individual stories include: [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, [[Janet Montgomery]] as Beth, and Ken Drury as Beth's father. The episode aired on 16 December 2014.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–105}}

=== Move to Netflix ===
On the day of the press screening for "White Christmas", Brooker and Jones had a meeting with Channel 4 executives, who told them that they wanted to continue the series but due to budget constraints, it would need to be a co-production. The pair had travelled to Los Angeles a few months prior to try to secure co-production funding but were unsuccessful. The channel also suggested that Brooker could write an episode of ''[[Electric Dreams (2017 TV series)|Electric Dreams]]'' (2017–2018), an adaptation of short stories by [[Philip K. Dick]].<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|123–124}} They also considered a five-episode series with an overarching storyline, at the suggestion of a US network, nicknaming the plan ''Game of Drones''.<ref name="Wired profile"/>

On 1 December 2014, the first two series of the programme were released on Netflix in the United States after they bought exclusive streaming rights, leading to increased audience attention for the programme.<ref name="Wired profile"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|title=Netflix Run Brings U.K.'s 'Black Mirror' Into Light for U.S. Auds|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=18 December 2014|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040808/https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|archive-date=27 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In a bidding war between channels, which included the American companies [[AMC Networks|AMC]], [[Syfy]] and [[HBO]], Netflix led with a commitment of two series of ten episodes each.<ref name="Wired profile"/><ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|125–126}} Brooker and Jones reported in 2018 that although they and Netflix were both keen to have Channel 4 as equal partners, Channel 4 were evasive. They eventually got a meeting without discussion of a co-production with Netflix, where the channel suggested a renewal for three episodes. The channel later offered six episodes if full treatments could be given in advance, but Brooker and Jones were concerned due to past rejection of ideas. They had a limited time to reply to US offers and chose to make a deal with Netflix.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|125–126}}

In September 2015, Netflix commissioned 12 episodes of ''Black Mirror''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |title='Black Mirror' Lands at Netflix |first=Debra |last=Birnbaum |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=25 September 2015 |access-date=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162641/https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> By this point, the series was available in around 80 territories.<ref name="Wired profile"/> In March 2016, it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series in the UK, with a bid of {{US$|40&nbsp;million}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |title=Netflix deals Channel 4 knockout blow over Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |first=John |last=Plunkett |date=29 March 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=11 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230021155/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |archive-date=30 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Endemol released a statement saying that Channel 4 had "had the opportunity to recommission [''Black Mirror''] since 2013 and passed on this and subsequent co-production offers put to them.

In a press release, Channel 4 stated that they "offered to recommission ''Black Mirror''".

In developing the third series's stories, Brooker had looked at previous episodes and recognised that all of the stories were about characters becoming trapped in a situation from which they could not escape. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, adding more conventional stories like a romance and a police procedural.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/black-mirror-traps/ |title=What Happens When Black Mirror Moves Beyond Traps?

Brooker started writing the sixth series with the idea to "refresh" or "reset" what ''Black Mirror'' was about. He stated that many new dystopian sci-fi programmes had emerged since its 2011 debut, and he now wished to focus on horror and settings in the past.<ref name="RT Red Mirror"/> He said that ''Black Mirror'' should continually reinvent itself and display standalone stories; he began the series by "deliberately upending" his "core assumptions" about the programme.

The production and acting in series four were praised, as were some episodes.
