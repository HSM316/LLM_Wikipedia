'''''Black Mirror''''' is a British<!-- the series is produced in England and was originally broadcast on Channel 4, a British TV station --> [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction]] [[Anthology series|anthology]] television series created by [[Charlie Brooker]]. He and [[Annabel Jones]] are the programme's [[showrunner]]s. It examines modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of [[Post-industrial society|new technologies]]. Episodes are standalone, usually set in an [[alternative history|alternative present]] or the near future, often with a dark and satirical tone, although some are more experimental and lighter.

''Black Mirror'' was inspired by older anthology series, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', which Brooker felt were able to deal with controversial, contemporary topics with less fear of censorship than other more realistic programmes. Brooker developed ''Black Mirror'' to highlight topics related to humanity's relationship with technology, creating stories that feature "the way we live now&nbsp;– and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy."<ref name="guardian_a"/>

The series premiered for two series on [[Channel 4]] in December 2011 and February 2013. After its addition to the catalogue in December 2014, [[Netflix]] purchased the programme in September 2015. It commissioned a series of 12 episodes later divided into the third and fourth series, each comprising six episodes; the former was released on 21 October 2016 and the latter on 29 December 2017. A standalone [[interactive film]] titled ''[[Black Mirror: Bandersnatch]]'' was released on 28 December 2018. A fifth series, comprising three episodes, was released on 5 June 2019.<ref name="S5ReleaseDate" />

The series has garnered positive reception from critics, received many [[List of awards and nominations received by Black Mirror|awards and nominations]], and seen an increase in interest internationally after its addition to Netflix. The show has won eight [[Emmy Awards]] for "[[San Junipero]]", "[[USS Callister]]" and ''Bandersnatch'', including three consecutive wins in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Television Movie]] category.

== Production ==
=== Conception and style ===
Charlie Brooker had completed production of ''[[Dead Set]]'', a zombie-based drama series, and while working on ''[[Newswipe with Charlie Brooker|Newswipe]]'' and other programmes, had decided that he wanted to make another drama series, in an [[anthology series|anthology style]] like ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', and ''[[Hammer House of Horror]]''.<ref name="denofgeek interview">{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/21083/charlie-brooker-interview-black-mirror-videogames-gameswipe-and-a-touch-of-cloth |title=Charlie Brooker interview: Black Mirror, videogames, Gameswipe and A Touch Of Cloth |first=Ryan |last=Lamble |date=12 February 2012 |access-date=7 December 2017 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208005054/http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/21083/charlie-brooker-interview-black-mirror-videogames-gameswipe-and-a-touch-of-cloth |archive-date=8 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="guardian_a">{{cite news |title=Charlie Brooker: the dark side of our gadget addiction |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/charlie-brooker-dark-side-gadget-addiction-black-mirror |access-date=17 December 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 December 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005141925/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/charlie-brooker-dark-side-gadget-addiction-black-mirror |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Brooker recognised that [[Rod Serling]] had written episodes of ''The Twilight Zone'' using contemporary issues, often controversial ones such as racism, but placed them in fictional settings so as to get around television censors at the time.<ref name="guardian_a" /> Brooker realised he could do similar commentary on modern issues, specifically focusing on mankind's dependency on technology, something he encountered while producing the series ''[[How TV Ruined Your Life]]''.<ref name="guardian_a" /> Brooker pulled the series' title from this approach:
{{quote|If technology is a drug&nbsp;– and it does feel like a drug&nbsp;– then what, precisely, are the side effects? This area&nbsp;– between delight and discomfort&nbsp;– is where ''Black Mirror'', my new drama series, is set. The 'black mirror' of the title is the one you'll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a [[Television|TV]], a monitor, a [[smartphone]].<ref name="guardian_a" />}}

Brooker wanted to keep the anthology approach, using new stories, settings, characters, and actors for each episode, as he felt this approach was a key element of enjoying series like ''The Twilight Zone''; he said, "There was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating&nbsp;– but the filling was always a surprise."<ref name="guardian_a" /> This approach would allow ''Black Mirror'' to contrast with current dramas and serials that had a standard recurring cast.<ref name="guardian_a" /> According to Brooker, the production team considered giving the series a linking theme or presenter, but ultimately decided not to: "There were discussions. Do we set them all in the same street? Do we have some characters who appear in each episode, a bit ''[[Three Colours trilogy|Three Colours: Blue/White/Red]]'' style? We did think about having a character who introduces them, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' style, or like Rod Serling or [[Alfred Hitchcock]] or [[Roald Dahl]], because most anthology shows did have that... but the more we thought about it, we thought it was a bit weird."<ref name="SFX_Magazine">{{cite news |title=Charlie Brooker Talks The Twilight Zone And Technology |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/02/01/charlie-brooker-talks-the-twilight-zone-and-technology/ |access-date=4 February 2013 |magazine=SFX |date=1 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205075847/http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/02/01/charlie-brooker-talks-the-twilight-zone-and-technology/ |archive-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

While the production does not use linking elements, the series has included allusions and [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] from previous episodes into later ones. For example, "[[Hated in the Nation]]" in the third series calls back to the events of both the first series episode "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]" and the second series episode "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]",<ref name="hwr s4" /> while the final episode of the fourth series "[[Black Museum (Black Mirror)|Black Museum]]" includes references to each prior episode of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/black-mirror-season-4-black-museum-colm-mccarthy-directing-interview-1202640505/ |title='Black Mirror' Director on 'Black Museum': 'I Think There's Something Quite Spiritual About It' |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=29 December 2017 |access-date=31 December 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111102248/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/black-mirror-season-4-black-museum-colm-mccarthy-directing-interview-1202640505/ |archive-date=11 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some of these are for the ease of reusing a name developed in a prior episode; for example, they created the fictional "UKN" broadcast network for handling news reports that drive stories,<ref name="thrillest s3 easter eggs" /> while the pizza delivery company used in "[[USS Callister]]" was used again for a company running automated pizza trucks in "[[Crocodile (Black Mirror)|Crocodile]]".<ref name="ew s4 interview">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/02/black-mirror-season-4-interviews/ |title=Black Mirror season 4, your burning questions answered |first=James |last=Hibbard |date=2 January 2018 |access-date=2 January 2018 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102200542/http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/02/black-mirror-season-4-interviews/ |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other Easter eggs were added as they knew viewers would be intensely dissecting the episodes, and the team provided these as gags.

However, Brooker asserted that the Easter eggs in ''Black Mirror'' are only there "as an extra bit of texture for fans of the show", and not meant to fully construct an atlas of ''Black Mirror'' episodes that becomes essential for understanding any episode.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bandersnatch-tuckersoft-black-mirror-universe-1172028 | title = How 'Bandersnatch' Fits Into the 'Black Mirror' Universe | first = Jackie | last = Strause | date = 31 December 2018 | access-date = 2 January 2019 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190102053516/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bandersnatch-tuckersoft-black-mirror-universe-1172028 | archive-date = 2 January 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Giles Harvey comments in a profile of Brooker for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that each episode "establishes the background of normality against which a decisive tweak will stand out all the more starkly". Harvey notes that the series' diverse range of genres show that it is "manifestly the work of someone who has clocked up many hours of screen time". He further comments that Brooker is "scrupulous", as "the believability of each episode depends on maintaining the complex internal logic of its dystopic world". Brooker is involved during the filming and editing processes, pointing out any inconsistencies that arise, and is "determined to make the devices and screens and interfaces used in 'Black Mirror' seem authentic". As examples of Brooker's "meticulous attention to detail", Harvey reports that Brooker carefully considered whether a falling wine bottle would shatter in the nested virtual realities of "[[Playtest (Black Mirror)|Playtest]]", and whether it would rain in the eponymous location in "[[San Junipero]]". An instance of realistic technology is the email system in "[[Be Right Back]]", which contrasts with "histrionic computers" found in Hollywood; an email is sent to the main character with the heading "Martha, people in your position bought the following", containing various books on the topic of grief-counseling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |title=The Speculative Dread of "Black Mirror" |last=Harvey |first=Giles |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=28 November 2016 |access-date=16 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050640/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Knowing that fans of the series have dissected some of these details by watching the episodes frame-by-frame, Brooker and his team have included humorous jabs at these fans through printed messages on various props, such as a paragraph in a news article held up by a character directed to fans of the series on [[Reddit]] in "[[Crocodile (Black Mirror)|Crocodile]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |title='Black Mirror' Trolls Eagle-Eyed Reddit Users With Insane Season 4 Easter Egg |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=1 January 2018 |access-date=2 January 2018 |website=[[The Wrap]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102033759/https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Series 1 ===
The series' inception was in 2010. Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones served as executive producers; the two had begun to work together on ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', a television review programme which aired from 2006 to 2008. The first pitch, to the head of comedy at Channel 4, was for eight half-hour episodes written by different people. Technology was a lesser focus, and the worlds were larger and more detailed, which Jones said was not possible to execute properly in the short runtime. The series was then commissioned for three hour-long episodes. The first script was "[[Fifteen Million Merits]]", which was written by Brooker and his wife [[Konnie Huq]]. The second script was "Inbound", which episode was never produced; it was about war and contained concepts which were later repurposed for the series 3 episode "[[Men Against Fire]]". The following script pitched became "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]", the first episode to air. The third episode is "[[The Entire History of You]]".<ref name="ibm">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|6–13}}

The programme was produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for [[Endemol]]. Joel Collins served as production designer, with his company Painting Practice working on visual effects.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|18}} An Endemol press release described the series as "a hybrid of ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Tales of the Unexpected'' which taps into our contemporary unease about our modern world", with the stories having a "techno-paranoia" feel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endemoluk.com/news/black-mirror-a-new-drama-from-charlie-brooker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515185448/http://www.endemoluk.com/news/black-mirror-a-new-drama-from-charlie-brooker |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2011 |title=Black Mirror&nbsp;– A new drama from Charlie Brooker |website=Endemol UK |date=11 May 2011 |access-date=15 November 2011}}</ref> [[Channel 4]] described the first episode, "The National Anthem", as "a twisted parable for the [[Twitter]] age".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/programme-information/black-mirror/allpi |title=Black Mirror |website=Channel 4 |date=7 November 2011 |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127030814/http://www.channel4.com/info/press/programme-information/black-mirror/allpi |archive-date=27 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Black Mirror'' series 1 had a limited DVD release for PAL / Region 2 on 27 February 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tuppencemagazine.co.uk/black-mirror-dvd.html |title=Black Mirror DVD |magazine=Tuppence Magazine |date=7 November 2011 |access-date=18 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229014619/http://www.tuppencemagazine.co.uk/black-mirror-dvd.html |archive-date=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the early stages of ''Black Mirror'', Jones was keen to avoid casting comedy actors, as Brooker was previously a comedy writer, and they wanted the series to not feel like comedy.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|16}} "The National Anthem" stars [[Rory Kinnear]] as Prime Minister Michael Callow, with [[Lindsay Duncan]] playing Home Secretary Alex Cairns. "Fifteen Million Merits" features [[Daniel Kaluuya]] as Bing, [[Jessica Brown Findlay]] as Abi and [[Rupert Everett]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Bashy|Ashley Thomas]] as Judges Hope, Charity, and Wraith. In "The Entire History of You", [[Toby Kebbell]] and [[Jodie Whittaker]] star as married couple Liam and Ffion.

The first series was popular and critically well received, although viewing figures decreased throughout the series. The series was expensive for Channel 4, as the anthology format meant there were no [[economies of scale]], but it was commissioned for a second series.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|59}}

=== Series 2 ===
Series 2 consists of three episodes. Brooker described it as "more epic in scale, but more intimate in scope". The episodes are more "understated" in their technologies. Brooker commented that the second series mirrors the first: the first series has topics of (in order) "warped political satire", "dystopian hellscape", and "relationship torn apart by technology", while the second series presents episodes of these forms in reverse.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|60}} Each episode in the first series had a male protagonist, so Brooker deliberately wrote female protagonists for series 2 episodes "[[Be Right Back]]" and "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]".<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|64}}

A trailer for the second series was made by [[Moving Picture Company]] and featured three interspersed storylines: "a dream sequence, the repetitive factory setting and the huge dust cloud that sweeps through the street at the ad's climactic end." Aired from 22 January 2013, the advertisement was shown on Channel 4 and in cinemas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/motion-graphics/mpc-creates-darkly-compelling-ads-for-charlie-brookers-black-mirror/ |title=MPC creates darkly compelling ads for Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |website=Digital Arts |date=29 January 2013 |access-date=16 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050737/https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/motion-graphics/mpc-creates-darkly-compelling-ads-for-charlie-brookers-black-mirror/ |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

"Be Right Back" stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as Martha and [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Ash, both in human and robot form. In "White Bear", [[Lenora Crichlow]] plays Victoria Skillane and [[Michael Smiley]] and [[Tuppence Middleton]] play Baxter and Jem. "[[The Waldo Moment]]" features [[Daniel Rigby]] as Jamie Salter, [[Chloe Pirrie]] as Gwendolyn Harris and [[Jason Flemyng]] as Jack Napier.

=== "White Christmas" ===
According to Brooker, the series was still taking its budget from the comedy department of Channel 4, and there was discussion of whether it should fall under the drama department instead. Shane Allen, head of comedy for Channel 4 at the time, stated in 2018 that someone had been taken aback by the budget for ''Black Mirror'', which was well above the standard for a comedy, and became involved in the editorial process. A new head of comedy had been hired, who did not have a relationship with Brooker and Jones.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}}

Brooker reported in 2018 that Channel 4 agreed on a third series of four episodes, but requested detailed synopses of the episodes in advance. Brooker came up with an episode "Angel of the Morning", which would later become a story in "[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]". He also conceived of an episode based on the earlier script "Inbound" which would have been similar to a later series 3 episode, "Men Against Fire". Another episode was named "Crocodile", which overlapped in parts with the series 4 episode of the same name. After a lengthy wait, Brooker and Jones were told that the ideas "weren't very ''Black Mirror''". Though Channel 4 may have suggested doing a one-off special, Jones said that "we felt there wasn't any clarity from the channel".<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}}

Jones and Brooker worked on other projects for the next year, such as the comedy procedural ''[[A Touch of Cloth]]''. After bumping into a Channel 4 staff member, Brooker emailed the channel to ask about how to continue with ''Black Mirror''. Channel 4 had the budget for an hour-long Christmas special, but Jones and Brooker pushed for a 90-minute episode.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}}

"White Christmas" was a portmanteau of three stories, inspired by works such as the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|101–103}} It starred [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt and [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe throughout. Actors in the individual stories include: [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, [[Janet Montgomery]] as Beth, and Ken Drury as Beth's father. The episode aired on 16 December 2014.

=== Move to Netflix ===
On the day of the press screening for "White Christmas", Brooker and Jones had a meeting with Channel 4 executives, who told them that they wanted to continue the series but due to budget constraints, it would need to be a co-production. The pair had travelled to Los Angeles a few months prior to try to get co-production money but were unsuccessful. The channel also suggested that Brooker could write an episode of ''[[Electric Dreams (2017 TV series)|Electric Dreams]]'', a 2017 adaptation of short stories by [[Philip K. Dick]].<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|123–124}}

In December 2014, the first two series of the programme were released on [[Netflix]] in the United States after they bought exclusive streaming rights, leading to increased attention for the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|title=Netflix Run Brings U.K.'s 'Black Mirror' Into Light for U.S. Auds|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=18 December 2014|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040808/https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|archive-date=27 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In a bidding war between channels, which included several American networks, Netflix led with a commitment of two series of ten episodes each. Brooker and Jones reported in 2018 that although they and Netflix were both keen to have Channel 4 as equal partners, they could not get a meeting with Channel 4. They eventually got a meeting without discussion of a co-production with Netflix, where the channel suggested a renewal for three episodes. The channel later offered six episodes if full treatments could be given in advance, but Brooker and Jones were concerned due to past rejection of ideas. They had a limited time to reply to US offers and chose to make a deal with Netflix.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|125–126}}

In September 2015, Netflix officially commissioned 12 episodes of ''Black Mirror''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |title='Black Mirror' Lands at Netflix |first=Debra |last=Birnbaum |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=25 September 2015 |access-date=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162641/https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In March 2016, it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series in the UK, with a bid of {{US$|40&nbsp;million}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |title=Netflix deals Channel 4 knockout blow over Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |first=John |last=Plunkett |date=29 March 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=11 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230021155/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |archive-date=30 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Endemol released a statement saying that Channel 4 had "had the opportunity to recommission [''Black Mirror''] since 2013 and passed on this and subsequent co-production offers put to them.

=== Series 3 ===
In developing the third series' stories, Brooker had looked back to the first two series and the Christmas special and recognised that all the stories were about characters becoming trapped in a situation from which they could not escape. Coupled with the anthology format that asked for viewers to get immersed within the stories to understand the nature of each, this created a sense of darkness and horror, which could make it difficult to watch successive episodes without becoming uncomfortable. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, still having a few "trap" episodes but adding more conventional stories like a romance and police procedural, making the new series more digestible for the viewer.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/black-mirror-traps/ |title=What Happens When Black Mirror Moves Beyond Traps?

The first episode that Brooker wrote for the series was "[[San Junipero]]", and it was an intentional departure from previous episodes as well as a "deliberate raspberry-blow" at fans who were concerned at the series' Americanisation.<ref name="ibm"/>{{rp|126–127}}

She ended the piece with: "It's another work of dark and twisted genius from Mr Brooker."  The second series is popular in China.

A series of webisodes ''Czarne Lusterko'' (Polish for ''Little Black Mirror'') was produced for Netflix Polska by Jacek Ambrosiewicz, in collaboration with Polish YouTubers. Released on 19 January 2018, the four shorts vary between eight and 21 minutes in length. "69.90" explores "loneliness and gaming" according to creators Huyen Pham and Marcin Nguyen, who discussed twenty different ideas for the episode before deciding upon an episode featuring a computer simulation which is indistinguishable from real life. "The Breakup" features Krzysztof Gonciarz and Kasia Mecinski; it used realism and ordinary technology, being filmed in part on a [[Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5]] to emulate [[vlog]] aesthetics. "The Sum of Happiness" was posted on Martin Stankiewicz's YouTube channel and focuses on a neurological implant and a relationship app, which have been featured before in ''Black Mirror''. "1%" is about a "fallible" and "ruthless" piece of [[obstetrics]] technology.<ref name="Lusterko">{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/43b3ep/the-polish-version-of-black-mirror-might-be-the-best-thing-on-the-internet|title=The Polish version of Black Mirror might be the best thing on the internet|work=[[Vice Media]]|last=Greenhill|first=Richard|date=2 April 2018|access-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526093523/https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/43b3ep/the-polish-version-of-black-mirror-might-be-the-best-thing-on-the-internet|archive-date=26 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
