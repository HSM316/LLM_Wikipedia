'''Smarter Planet'''<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/now</ref> is a corporate initiative of the [[information technology]] company [[IBM]]. The initiative seeks to highlight how forward-thinking leaders in business, government, and civil society around the world are capturing the potential of smarter systems to achieve [[economic growth]], near-term efficiency, [[sustainable development]] and societal progress.,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/big-blues-smarter-marketing-playbook/ | work=The New York Times | title=Big Blue's Smarter Marketing Playbook | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2010-01-12 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-20012306-52.html | work=CNET News | title=At IBM Research, a constant quest for the bleeding edge | first=Daniel | last=Terdiman | date=2010-08-02 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>

Examples of smarter systems include [[smart grid]]s,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/grid</ref> [[water management]] systems,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/water</ref> solutions to [[traffic congestion]] problems,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/traffic</ref> greener buildings,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/buildings</ref> and many others. These systems have historically been difficult to manage because of their size and complexity. But with new ways of monitoring, connecting, and analyzing the systems, business, civic and nongovernmental leaders are developing new ways to manage these systems. IBM's strategy is to provide or enable many of these technology and process management capabilities and, outside the realm of technology, to advocate for policy decisions that, according to the views expressed by IBM's management in interviews,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.vector1media.com/dialogue/interviews/8971-interview-ibm-takes-aim-at-creating-a-smarter-planet | work=V1 Magazine | title=IBM Takes Aim at Creating a Smarter Planet: Interview with Richard Lechner, IBM Vice President, Energy &amp; Environment | first=Matt | last=Ball | date=2009-09-13 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref> speeches,<ref>Palmisano, Samuel J.

==Origins==
In November 2008, IBM’s Chairman, CEO and President [[Sam Palmisano]], during a speech<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/smartplanet/20081106/sjp_speech.shtml|title=IBM About IBM - United States|author=|date=4 April 2018|website=www.ibm.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], outlined a new agenda for building a "Smarter Planet". The speech emphasized how the world's systems and industries are becoming more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent, and that [[leader]]s and citizens can take advantage of this state of affairs to improve these systems and industries.

In January 2010 Sam Palmisano gave a follow-up speech<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/decadeofsmart</ref> to the [[Chatham House]] called the "Decade of Smart". He highlighted dozens of initiatives in which leaders created smarter systems to solve the planet's most pressing problems. The speech aimed to inspire others to follow the leads of these innovators by helping to create a smarter planet.

On March 1, 2011, IBM announced the [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/data/flash/smartercomputing/ Smarter Computing] framework to support Smarter Planet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Launch of IBM Smarter Computing|url=https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/IBMSmarterSystems/date/201102?lang=en_us|accessdate=1 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420162543/https://www-304.ibm.com/connections/blogs/IBMSmarterSystems/date/201102?lang=en_us|archivedate=20 April 2013}}</ref>

==Advertising campaign==
IBM has created an advertising campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/ibm|title=IBM|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> to support its Smarter Planet agenda.

In 2008 and 2009, IBM ran a series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/global/files/us__en_us__overview__COM03003USEN.PDF|title="22 opportunities for a smarter planet"|author=|date=|website=ibm.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> of full-page advertisements in newspapers such as the [[New York Times]] and the [[Wall Street Journal]]. Each of these "op-ads" featured an essay about a system or industry that IBM claims can be made "smarter" through the application of technology.<ref>[Behind IBM's Quest for a 'Smarter Planet' http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/2009/01/behind-ibms-quest-for-a-smarter-planet.html]</ref>

A display at [[Epcot]]'s [[Innoventions (Epcot)|Innoventions]] was installed, and opened on January 29, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/29289.wss|title=IBM Works with Walt Disney Imagineering to Create a New Smarter Planet Exhibit|author=|date=29 January 2010|website=www-03.ibm.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24_AckuhDlY|title=Smarter Planet presented by IBM at INNOVENTIONS at Epcot®|first=|last=Connor|date=29 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> A video that plays on a 12-foot globe in the exhibit was created by Christian Matts <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmatts.com/work/ibm-epcot-smarter-planet-installation|title=IBM Epcot  –  Christian Matts // Motion Graphics 2017|author=|date=|website=www.cmatts.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> and edited by Ben Suenaga.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/11356415|title=IBM Epcot|first=michael|last=paterson|date=30 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=Vimeo}}</ref> A game called "RUNTIME" has been installed since 2009, where you could record your own images in the park, and play the game online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkingofyoupostcards.com/runtime/play/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630220059/http://www.thinkingofyoupostcards.com/runtime/play/ |archivedate=2012-06-30 }}</ref>
