'''Smarter Planet''' is a corporate initiative of the [[information technology]] company [[IBM]]. The initiative was formed to encourage the ideas of business, government, and civil society leaders worldwide towards their path of achieving [[economic growth]], near-term efficiency, [[sustainable development]], and societal progress.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/big-blues-smarter-marketing-playbook/ | work=The New York Times | title=Big Blue's Smarter Marketing Playbook | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2010-01-12 | access-date=2010-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-20012306-52.html | work=CNET News | title=At IBM Research, a constant quest for the bleeding edge | first=Daniel | last=Terdiman | date=2010-08-02 | access-date=2010-08-08}}</ref> Examples of smarter systems include [[smart grid]]s,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/grid</ref> [[water management]] systems,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/water</ref> solutions to [[traffic congestion]] problems,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/traffic</ref> greener buildings,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/buildings</ref> IBM's goal and strategy is to use the capacity of these technology and process management capabilities and, outside the realm of technology, to advocate for policy decisions that, according to the IBM's management in, could "make the planet smarter.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.vector1media.com/dialogue/interviews/8971-interview-ibm-takes-aim-at-creating-a-smarter-planet | work=V1 Magazine | title=IBM Takes Aim at Creating a Smarter Planet: Interview with Richard Lechner, IBM Vice President, Energy & Environment | first=Matt | last=Ball | date=2009-09-13 | access-date=2010-08-08}}</ref>

== History ==

Smarter Planet was officially formed in November 2008, when IBM's Chairman, CEO, and President [[Sam Palmisano]] at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] presented a new agenda for building a "smarter planet".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eweek.com/networking/25-things-you-might-not-know-about-ibms-smarter-planet-strategy|title=25 Things You Might Not Know About IBMs Smarter Planet Strategy|work=[[eWeek]]|author=Darryl K. Taft|date=2009-10-19|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> In his speech, he emphasized how the world's systems and industries are becoming more interconnected and intelligent, and that [[leader]]s and citizens can take advantage of this state of affairs to improve these systems and industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/smarterplanet/|title=IBM100 - Smarter Planet|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> In January 2010, Sam Palmisano gave a follow-up speech to the [[Chatham House]] called the "Decade of Smart". He highlighted dozens of initiatives in which leaders created smarter systems to solve the planet's most pressing problems. The speech aimed to inspire others to follow the leads of these innovators by helping to create a smarter planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/big-blues-smarter-marketing-playbook|title=Big Blue's Smarter Marketing Playbook|publisher=Bits. [[The New York Times]]|author=Steve Lohr|date=2010-01-12|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

Smarter Planet's goal is to use the technology and intelligent systems in order to create smarter power grids, food systems, water, healthcare, and traffic systems.<ref name="smarterplanetintro">{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/|title=IBM Builds a smarter planet|publisher=[[IBM]]|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>

==Advertising campaign==

In 2008 and 2009, IBM ran a series of marketing campaigns<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@mikeschoultz/6-lessons-learned-from-ibms-smart-planet-marketing-campaign-2e29eac4aaba|title=6 Lessons Learned from IBM's Smart Planet Marketing Campaign|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|author=Mike Schoultz|date=2019-08-19|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> in newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Each of these "op-ads" featured an essay about a system or industry that IBM claims can be made "smarter" through the application of technology.<ref>[Behind IBM's Quest for a 'Smarter Planet' http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/2009/01/behind-ibms-quest-for-a-smarter-planet.html]</ref>

In January 2010, a display at [[Epcot]]'s [[Innoventions (Epcot)|Innoventions]] was installed. Its goal is to showcase how using technology can solve world problems "from reducing road traffic and city crime to improving food safety and local water supplies."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/29289.wss|title=IBM Works with Walt Disney Imagineering to Create a New Smarter Planet Exhibit|publisher=IBM|date=2010-01-29|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> A video that plays on a 12-foot globe in the exhibit was created by Christian Matts <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmatts.com/work/ibm-epcot-smarter-planet-installation|title=IBM Epcot â€“ Christian Matts // Motion Graphics 2017|website=www.cmatts.com|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> and edited by Ben Suenaga.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/11356415|title=IBM Epcot|first=michael|last=paterson|date=30 April 2010|access-date=19 April 2018|via=Vimeo}}</ref> Smarter Planet's advertising campaign is also supporting [[TED (conference)|TED]] (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Talks.<ref>http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/339</ref>

==Smarter cities==
{{see |smart city}}

In 2009, IBM launched the Smarter Cities Challenge. Its goal is to aid major cities worldwide to run more efficiently, save money and resources, and improve the quality of life for their citizens.<ref name="smarterplanetintro"/> 

To date, Smarter Cities Challenge serves thousands of cities around the world in all areas of management<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/management/index.html</ref> including public safety, health and human services, education,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/human_services/index.html</ref> infrastructure,<ref>http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/infrastructure/index.html</ref> energy, water, and environmental. IBM Smarter cities also include citizen participation through People4SmarterCities.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people4smartercities.com|title=IBM Government Industry Blog - Insights on Business|date=3 February 2018|website=IBM Government Industry Blog|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> so they can be part of the technological advances transforming their cities.
