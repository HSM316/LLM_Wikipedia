'''NetOwl''' is a suite of multilingual text and identity analytics products that analyze [[big data]] in the form of text data – reports, web, [[social media]], etc. – as well as structured entity data about people, organizations, places, and things.

NetOwl utilizes artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches, including [[natural language processing]] (NLP), [[machine learning]] (ML), and [[computational linguistics]], to extract entities, relationships, and events; to perform [[sentiment analysis]]; to assign latitude/longitude to geographical references in text; to translate names written in foreign languages; and to perform name matching and [[identity resolution]].<ref name="washingtonpost">[https://apps.washingtonpost.com/local/top-dc-companies/2011/company/sra-international/596/ "SRA International."] Washington Post.

== Products ==

The NetOwl suite includes, among others, the following text and entity analytics products:

=== Text Analytics ===

NetOwl Extractor performs [[entity extraction]] from unstructured texts using [[natural language processing]] (NLP), [[machine learning]] (ML), and [[computational linguistics]].  Extractor also performs [[semantic relationship]] and [[event extraction]] as well as [[geotagging]] of text.<ref name="maybury"/><ref name="geoint"/> It is used for a variety of data sources including both traditional sources (e.g., news, reports, web pages, email) and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, chats, blogs).<ref name="assentor"/> It runs on a variety of Big Data analytics platforms, including [[Apache Hadoop]] and LexisNexis’s High-Performance Computer Cluster ([[HPCC]]) technology.<ref name="lexisnexis"/> It has been integrated with a number of 3rd party analytical tools such as Esri ArcGIS and Google Earth/Maps.<ref name="geoint"/>

=== Identity Analytics ===

NetOwl NameMatcher and EntityMatcher perform name matching and identity resolution for large multicultural and multilingual entity databases using [[machine learning]] (ML) and [[computational linguistics]] approaches.<ref name="washingtonpost"/><ref name="transliteration"/>  They are used for applications such as [[anti-money laundering]] (AML), watch lists, [[regulatory compliance]], fraud detection, etc.

== History ==

The first NetOwl product was NetOwl Extractor, which was initially released in 1996.<ref>Hudgins-Bonafield, Christine. [http://www.networkcomputing.com/709/709hreportb.html “Filtering Knowledge On The Net Just Got Simpler.”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030330031828/http://www.networkcomputing.com/709/709hreportb.html# |date=2003-03-30 }}  NetWork Computing (1996-05-31). Retrieved 2013-09-03.</ref>  Since then, Extractor has added many new capabilities, including relationship and event extraction, categorization, name translation, geotagging, and sentiment analysis, as well as entity extraction in other languages.  Other products were added later to the NetOwl suite, namely TextMiner, NameMatcher, and EntityMatcher.

NetOwl has participated in several 3rd party-sponsored text and entity analytics software benchmarking events. NetOwl Extractor was the top-scoring named entity extraction system at the [[DARPA]]-sponsored [[Message Understanding Conference]] MUC-6 and the top-scoring link and event extraction system in MUC-7.<ref>Sundheim, Beth M.
