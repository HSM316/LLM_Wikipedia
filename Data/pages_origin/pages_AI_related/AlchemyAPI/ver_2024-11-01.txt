'''AlchemyAPI''' was a software company in the field of [[machine learning]]. Its technology employed [[deep learning]] for various applications in [[natural language processing]], such as semantic text analysis and sentiment analysis, as well as [[computer vision]]. AlchemyAPI offered both traditionally-licensed software products as well API access under a [[Software as a service]] model.<ref name=official>{{cite web|url = http://www.alchemyapi.com/|title = AlchemyAPI|accessdate = February 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090921044923/http://www.alchemyapi.com/|archive-date = September 21, 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name="techcrunch">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/alchemy-api-raises-2-million-for-neural-net-analysis-tech-on-par-with-ibm-watson-google/|title=AlchemyAPI Raises $2 Million For Neural Net Analysis Tech, On Par With IBM Watson, Google|last=Williams|first=Alex|date=February 7, 2013|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref> After acquisition by [[IBM]] in 2015, the products were integrated into the [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] line of products and the brand name eventually disappeared.

==Technology and business model==

As the name suggests, the business model of charging for access to an API was central to the company's identity and uncommon for its time: A ''[[TechCrunch]]'' article highlighted that even though the technology was similar to IBM's Watson, the pay-per-use model made it more accessible, especially to non-enterprise customers.<ref name="techcrunch" /> At one point, AlchemyAPI served over 3 billion API calls per month.

==History==

AlchemyAPI was founded by Elliot Turner<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datainnovation.org/2014/01/5-qs-for-alchemyapi-ceo-elliot-turner/|title=5 Qâ€™s for AlchemyAPI CEO Elliot Turner|first=Travis|last=Korte|website=Center for Data Innovation}}</ref> in 2005,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Golliher|first=Sean|date=2012-07-20|title=SemanticWeb.com "Innovation Spotlight" Interview with Elliot Turner, CEO of AlchemyAPI.|url=https://www.dataversity.net/semanticweb-com-innovation-spotlight-interview-with-elliot-turner-ceo-of-alchemyapi/|access-date=2021-08-21|website=DATAVERSITY|language=en-US}}</ref> and launched their API in 2009.<ref name=techcrunch/>

In September 2011, ProgrammableWeb added AlchemyAPI to its API Billionaires Club, alongside giants such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]].<ref name=techcrunch/><ref name="programmable-web">{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/news/new-api-billionaire-text-extractor-alchemy/2011/09/16/|title=New API Billionaire: Text Extractor Alchemy|last=DuVander|first=Adam|date=September 16, 2011|publisher=[[ProgrammableWeb]]|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2013, it was announced that AlchemyAPI had raised US$2 million to improve the capabilities of its deep learning technology.<ref name=techcrunch/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alchemyapi.com/blog/2m-new-financing-hiring-several-c-engineers/|title = $2m In New Financing, Hiring Several C++ Engineers|publisher = AlchemyAPI|date = February 27, 2013|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=venturebeat>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/07/funding-daily-decisions-decisions/|title = Funding Daily: Decisions, decisions|publisher = [[VentureBeat]]|date = February 7, 2013|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://semanticweb.com/alchemy-api-raises-2m_b35276|title = Alchemy API raises $2 M|last = Guess|first = Angela|date = February 12, 2013|accessdate = February 11, 2014|publisher = semanticweb.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140225094307/http://semanticweb.com/alchemy-api-raises-2m_b35276|archive-date = February 25, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> In September 2013, it was reported that AlchemyAPI had created a [[Google Glass]] app that could identify what a person was looking at, and that AlchemyAPI would soon be rolling out deep learning-based image recognition as a service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/09/19/alchemyapi-says-its-delivering-google-level-deep-learning-as-a-service/|title = AlchemyAPI says it's delivering Google-level deep learning as a service|last = Harris|first = Derrick|date = September 19, 2013|accessdate = February 11, 2014|publisher = [[GigaOm]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/519726/a-google-glass-app-knows-what-youre-looking-at/|title = A Google Glass App Knows What You're Looking At: An app for Google's wearable computer Glass can recognize objects in front of a person wearing the device.|last = Simonite|first = Tom|date = September 30, 2013|accessdate = February 11, 2014|publisher = [[Technology Review]]}}</ref> 

As of February 2014 (prior to the IBM acquisition), it claimed to have clients in 36 countries and process over 3 billion documents a month. In May 2014, it was reported that AlchemyAPI had released a computer vision API known as AlchemyVision, capable of recognizing objects in photographs and providing image similarity search capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2014/05/12/alchemyapi-rolls-out-deep-learning-based-computer-vision-as-a-service/|title = AlchemyAPI rolls out deep-learning-based computer vision as a service|last = Harris|first = Derrick|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = July 18, 2014|publisher = [[GigaOm]]}}</ref> 

In March 2015, it was announced that AlchemyAPI had been acquired by IBM and the company's breakthroughs in deep learning would accelerate IBM's development of next generation cognitive computing applications. IBM reported plans to integrate AlchemyAPI's deep learning technology into the core Watson platform <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46205.wss#contact |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304163647/http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/46205.wss#contact |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2015 |title= IBM Acquires AlchemyAPI, Enhancing Watson's Deep Learning Capabilities |first= Jay|last = Stankiewicz|date = March 4, 2015|accessdate = April 14, 2015|publisher = [[IBM]]}}</ref>
