'''AlchemyAPI''' is an IBM-owned company that uses [[machine learning]] (specifically, [[deep learning]]) to do [[natural language processing]] (specifically, semantic text analysis, including sentiment analysis) and [[computer vision]] (specifically, face detection and recognition) for its clients both over the cloud and on-premises.<ref name=official>{{cite web|url=http://www.alchemyapi.com/|title = AlchemyAPI|accessdate = February 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="techcrunch">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/alchemy-api-raises-2-million-for-neural-net-analysis-tech-on-par-with-ibm-watson-google/|title=AlchemyAPI Raises $2 Million For Neural Net Analysis Tech, On Par With IBM Watson, Google|last=Williams|first=Alex|date=February 7, 2013|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref>

==Technology and business model==

AlchemyAPI uses technology similar to [[Watson (computer)|IBM's Watson computer]].<ref name=techcrunch/> It gets paid per API call, and does over 3 billion API calls per month.

A ''[[TechCrunch]]'' article highlights that even though the technology is similar, AlchemyAPI offers its technology in the form of [[software as a service]] (by allowing people to make API calls), making its technological capabilities more accessible to people.<ref name="techcrunch" />

==History==

AlchemyAPI launched in 2009.<ref name=techcrunch/>

In September 2011, ProgrammableWeb added AlchemyAPI to its API Billionaires Club, alongside giants such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]].<ref name=techcrunch/><ref name="programmable-web">{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/news/new-api-billionaire-text-extractor-alchemy/2011/09/16/|title=New API Billionaire: Text Extractor Alchemy|last=DuVander|first=Adam|date=September 16, 2011|publisher=[[ProgrammableWeb]]|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref>
