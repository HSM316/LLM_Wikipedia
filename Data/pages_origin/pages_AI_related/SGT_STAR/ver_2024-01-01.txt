== Background ==
After the [[September 11 attacks]], traffic increased significantly to chatrooms on the U.S. Army's website, goarmy.com, increasing costs of staffing the live chatrooms. As a cost-cutting measure, the SGT STAR project was initiated as a partnership between the [[United States Army Accessions Command]] and [[Spectre AI Incorporated|Spectre AI]], a wholly owned subsidiary of Next IT. Next IT, a [[Spokane, Washington]]-based company deploys "intelligent [[virtual assistant]]s," using its software dubbed "ActiveAgent" which is a framework for  [[functional presence engine|functional presence engines]]. 

Testing began in 2003, and SGT STAR launched to the public in 2006.<ref name="eff201404">{{cite web |last1=Maass |first1=Dave |title=Answers and Questions About Military, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence Agency Chatbots |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/answers-questions-about-military-law-enforcement-and-intelligence-agency-chatbots |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation |accessdate=1 August 2018 |language=en |date=18 April 2014}}</ref> "STAR" is an [[acronym]] for "strong, trained and ready."<ref name="armysite" /> SGT STAR was launched as a chat interface on goarmy.com, but has since been developed as a mobile application,<ref name="armysite"/> as well as a life-size animated projection that has appeared live at public events.<ref name="usc">{{cite web |title=Sergeant Star |url=http://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/sgt-star/ |website=ict.usc.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> SGT STAR can also interact with users on [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An intelligent interface that is ready when you are |url=http://www.nextit.com/case-studies/army |website=Next IT}}</ref>
