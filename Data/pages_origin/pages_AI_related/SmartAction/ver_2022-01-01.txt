== History ==
Developing artificial intelligence has challenged researchers since at least the 1940s (see [[History of artificial intelligence]]). Part of the problem has been the difficulty of defining an adequate theory of intelligence that can serve as a framework to guide hardware implementations. Starting in the early 1990s Voss developed a new theory of intelligence, outlined in the book ''Artificial General Intelligence''.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Goertzel|editor-first=Ben|title=Artificial General Intelligence|edition=1st|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-23733-4}}</ref> In 2001, Voss founded an R&D startup, Adaptive AI, Inc., to research and develop a prototype [[artificial general intelligence]] system based on his theory of intelligence.<ref name=kurzweil/> In 2009 Voss founded Smart Action Company, LLC to commercialize this technology. Born out of Voss' research and development, SmartAction created its first practical application of this new technology focused on the management of inbound and outbound calls for contact centers.<ref name="speechtechmag090112">"[http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/Industry-News/Start-Up-SmartAction-Starts-with-IVR-Release-52266.aspx Start-Up SmartAction Starts with IVR Release]", SpeechTechMag.com 2009-01-12. Retrieved on 2009-08-11.</ref> Since its inception, SmartAction has continued to develop the technology into a highly specialized and purpose driven AI, identified by the company as Intelligent Voice Automation.<ref name="smartaction about">"[http://www.smartaction.com/our-difference/artificial-intelligence Intelligent Voice Automation]", SmartAction.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-06.</ref>

== Technology ==
There are two layers of technology that SmartAction uses in its systems. The first is speech recognition, which enables the system to understand [[natural language processing|natural language]] spoken words and phrases. Second is a proprietary artificial intelligence engine used to determine the meaning and intent behind the spoken words, drive the conversation with the caller, and improve over time.<ref name = about>[http://smartaction.com/about.html About], SmartAction, (Retrieved Jan 5, 2015).</ref><ref name="io9 090208">"[http://io9.com/5148075/im-sorry-i-cant-connect-your-call-dave I'm Sorry, I Can't Connect Your Call, Dave]", io9.com 2009-02-08. Retrieved on 2009-09-01.</ref> A [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] engine enables the system to speak.  The AI engine's built-in knowledge and skills also makes development and updates to the system much faster and easier than with older technology.
