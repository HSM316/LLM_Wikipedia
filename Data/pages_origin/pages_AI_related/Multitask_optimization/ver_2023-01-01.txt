'''Multi-task optimization''' is a [[paradigm]] in the optimization literature that focuses on solving multiple  self-contained tasks simultaneously.<ref name=TO>Gupta, A., Ong, Y. S., & Feng, L.

The key motivation behind multi-task optimization is that if optimization tasks are related to each other in terms of their optimal solutions or the general characteristics of their function landscapes,<ref>Cheng, M. Y., Gupta, A., Ong, Y. S., & Ni, Z. W. (2017).

Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 64, 13-24.}</ref> the search progress can be transferred to substantially accelerate the search on the other.

The success of the paradigm is not necessarily limited to one-way knowledge transfers from simpler to more complex tasks. In practice an attempt is to intentionally solve a more difficult task that may unintentionally solve several smaller problems.<ref name="DeFreitas">Cabi, S., Colmenarejo, S. G., Hoffman, M.

==Methods==

There are several common approaches for multi-task optimization: [[Bayesian optimization]],  [[evolutionary computation]], and approaches based on [[Game theory]].<ref name=TO/>

=== Multi-task Bayesian optimization ===
'''Multi-task Bayesian optimization''' is a modern model-based approach that leverages the concept of knowledge transfer to speed up the automatic [[hyperparameter optimization]] process of machine learning algorithms.<ref name=mtbo>Swersky, K., Snoek, J., & Adams, R. P. (2013). [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5086-multi-task-bayesian-optimization.pdf Multi-task bayesian optimization]. Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 2004-2012).</ref> The method builds a multi-task [[Gaussian process]] model on the data originating from different searches progressing in tandem.<ref>Bonilla, E. V., Chai, K. M., & Williams, C. (2008). [http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3189-multi-task-gaussian-process-prediction.pdf Multi-task Gaussian process prediction]. Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 153-160).</ref> The captured inter-task dependencies are thereafter utilized to better inform the subsequent sampling of candidate solutions in respective search spaces.

=== Evolutionary multi-tasking ===
'''Evolutionary multi-tasking''' has been explored as a means of exploiting the [[implicit parallelism]] of population-based search algorithms to simultaneously progress multiple distinct optimization tasks. By mapping all tasks to a unified search space, the evolving population of candidate solutions can harness the hidden relationships between them through continuous genetic transfer. This is induced when solutions associated with different tasks crossover.<ref name=mfo/><ref name=cognitive>Ong, Y. S., & Gupta, A. (2016). [http://www.cil.ntu.edu.sg/mfo/downloads/MultitaskOptimization_manuscript.pdf Evolutionary multitasking: a computer science view of cognitive multitasking]. Cognitive Computation, 8(2), 125-142.</ref> Recently, modes of knowledge transfer that are different from direct solution [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] have been explored.<ref>Feng, L., Zhou, L., Zhong, J., Gupta, A., Ong, Y. S., Tan, K. C., & Qin, A. K. (2018). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8401802/ Evolutionary Multitasking via Explicit Autoencoding]. IEEE transactions on cybernetics, (99).</ref>

=== Game-theoretic optimization ===
Game-theoretic approaches to multi-task optimization propose to view the optimization problem as a game, where each task is a player. All players compete through the reward matrix of the game, and try to reach a solution that satisfies all players (all tasks). This view provide insight about how to build efficient algorithms based on [[gradient descent]] optimization (GD), which is particularly important for training [[deep neural networks]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodfellow |first=Ian |title=Deep Learning |last2=Bengio |first2=Yoshua |last3=Courville |first3=Aaron |publisher=MIT Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-0262035613}}</ref>  In GD for MTL, the problem is that each task provides its own loss, and it is not clear how to combine all losses and create a single unified gradient, leading to several different aggregation strategies.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Liu |first=L. |last2=Li |first2=Y. |last3=Kuang |first3=Z. |last4=Xue |first4=J. |last5=Chen |first5=Y. |last6=Yang |first6=W. |last7=Liao |first7=Q. |last8=Zhang |first8=W. |date=2021-05-04 |title=Towards Impartial Multi-task Learning |url=https://iclr.cc/ |access-date=2022-11-20 |website=In:  Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2021).

== Applications ==

Algorithms for multi-task optimization span a wide array of real-world applications. Recent studies highlight the potential for speed-ups in the optimization of engineering design parameters by conducting related designs jointly in a multi-task manner.<ref name=cognitive/> In [[machine learning]], the transfer of optimized features across related data sets can enhance the efficiency of the training process as well as improve the generalization capability of learned models.<ref>Chandra, R., Gupta, A., Ong, Y.
