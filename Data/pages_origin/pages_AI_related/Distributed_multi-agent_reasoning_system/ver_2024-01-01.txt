In [[artificial intelligence]], the '''distributed multi-agent reasoning system (dMARS)''' was a platform for [[Intelligent agent|intelligent software agents]] developed at the [[Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute|AAII]] that makes uses of the [[belief–desire–intention software model]] (BDI). The design for dMARS was an extension of the intelligent agent cognitive architecture developed at [[SRI International]] called [[procedural reasoning system]] (PRS). The most recent incarnation of this framework is the [[JACK Intelligent Agents]] platform.

==Overview==
dMARS was an agent-oriented development and implementation environment written in [[C++]] for building complex, distributed, time-critical systems.
