==History==
Before the creation of the Hive brand, [[British Gas]] had been trialling a remote control heating service, starting in September 2011, using technology from [[AlertMe]].<ref name="Guardian2011">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/30/smart-home-remote-control|title=Smart homes: take remote control|author=Miles Bignall|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>  This led to the launch of the Remote Heating Control service in 2012<ref name="Guardian2012">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/11/british-gas-remote-control-central-heating|title=British Gas launches remote control central heating service|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|author=Mark King}}</ref> paving the way for the later Hive-branded smart heating system.

Hive was established when parent company [[Centrica]], owner of British Gas, formed its Connected Homes sector in 2012.<ref name="Wareable"/> The year after it was founded, the company launched Hive Active Heating on October 14, 2013,<ref name="Campaignlive">{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1213627/british-gas-creates-hive-brand-house-internet-enabled-tech-products#|title=British Gas creates Hive brand to house internet-enabled tech products |author=Matthew Chapman |publisher=Campaign Live |date=September 26, 2013}}</ref> a [[smart thermostat]] that allows customers to control heating and hot water in their homes via the company's website or app.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10334379/British-Gas-Hive-adds-app-controls-to-domestic-boilers.html|title=British Gas Hive adds app controls to domestic boilers |author=Matt Warman |publisher=The Telegraph |date=25 Sep 2013}}</ref> The system can be installed in customers' homes by a British Gas engineer.<ref name="MobileIndustryReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2016/02/hive-releases-new-connected-home-products.html|title=Hive Releases New Connected Home Products |author=Roland Banks  |publisher=Mobile Industry Review |date=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2015, British Gas purchased the connected home firm AlertMe in a deal worth £65 million.<ref name="Techcrunch">{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/13/british-gas-buys-uk-smart-home-pioneer-alertme-for-100m/|title=British Gas Buys UK Smart Home Pioneer AlertMe In $100M Deal |author=Ingrid Lunden  |publisher=TechCrunch |date=Feb 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name="CityAM">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityam.com/209405/british-gas-buys-smart-home-company-alertme-44m-centrica-bets-internet-things|title=British Gas buys smart home company AlertMe for £44m as Centrica bets on Internet of Things |author=Lynsey Barber |publisher=City A.M. |date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> This allowed Hive to build its devices using the Honeycomb platform developed by AlertMe, which facilitates the capability for users to control all their smart home devices through an app.<ref name="Techcrunch"/><ref name="The Inquirer">{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2443443/hive-launches-first-products-built-on-its-honeycomb-iot-platform|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128092342/http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2443443/hive-launches-first-products-built-on-its-honeycomb-iot-platform|url-status=unfit|archive-date=January 28, 2016|title=Hive launches first products built on its Honeycomb IoT platform |author=Chris Merriman |publisher=The Inquirer |date=27 January 2016}}</ref> This meant Hive could more closely compete with similar platforms used by rivals such as [[HomeKit]], [[Project Brillo]] and [[Nest Labs]].<ref name="Wareable"/><ref name="Thenextweb">{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2015/07/15/hive-unveils-sleek-new-smart-thermostat-and-connected-home-gadgets-you-might-actually-want/|title=Hive unveils sleek new smart thermostat and connected home gadgets you might actually want |author=Ben Woods |publisher=The Next Web}}</ref>

Hive Active Heating 2, the second edition of the company's smart heating system, was released in July 2015.<ref name="Techweekeurope">{{cite web |url=http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/e-innovation/hive-smart-home-plugs-sensors-184700#Tv0TrXqfTaIusvCS.99 |title=Hive Releases Window, Door Sensors And Smart Plug |author=Michael Moore |publisher=TechWeek europe |date= January 27, 2016}}</ref> The new model was upgraded to include two additional features.<ref name="Techcrunch"/> The holiday mode setting allows customers to set a given temperature while away from home.<ref name="PocketlintHiveActiveHeating2.0">{{cite web |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/126983-hive-active-heating-2-0-review-style-meets-connected-practicality|title=Hive Active Heating 2.0 review: Style meets connected practicality |author=Chris Hall |publisher=Pocket-lint |date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> The boost function allows customers to immediately turn heating and hot water on for a period of up to six hours.<ref name="TechDigest">{{cite web |url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2015/11/review-hive-2-from-british-gas.html|title=Review: Hive 2 heating/hot water control system from British Gas |author=Chris Price |publisher=TechDigest |date=November 12, 2015}}</ref>

The smart thermostat was designed by [[Silicon Valley]]-based,<ref name="Wareable"/> Swiss designer [[Yves Béhar]],<ref name="BBCNews"/> who won [[Design Miami]] Design Visionary Award in 2015.<ref name="ArchitechturalDigest">{{cite web |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/yves-behar-design-visionary-award-2015-design-miami|title=Yves Behar Is Honored with Design Miamiís 2015 Design Visionary Award |author=Will Speros |publisher=Architectural Digest |date=December 4, 2015}}</ref> It was praised for its sleek look,<ref name="Thenextweb"/> with critics saying it was an improvement on the company's first active heating model, which was criticised for having a dull aesthetic.<ref name="Thenextweb"/> However, in the same year, complaints about the lack of data security led to changes in the software. The company improved data [[encryption]] as a result of an investigation by ''[[Which?]]'' magazine.<ref name="BurglarsDream">{{cite web |url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2015/08/which-probe-uncovers-hive-heating-app-data-risk-407275/ |title=Which? probe uncovers Hive heating app data risk Thermostat app sending information unencrypted |first=Alice |last=Rickman |date=19 August 2015 |work=Which? |publisher=The Consumer Association}}</ref>

The company also paired up with [[Dulux]]<ref name="Thenextweb"/> to provide accessory frames for the thermostat in a range of different colours.<ref name="PocketlintHiveActiveHeating2.0"/>

In 2015 the company announced future plans to use the Honeycomb platform to support and allow integration with third-party products including a [[Samsung]] camera.<ref name="Pocketlint2ThirdParySupport">{{cite web |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/134601-hive-will-add-connected-cameras-honeycomb-platform-offers-third-party-support |title=Hive will add connected cameras, Honeycomb platform offers third-party support |author=Chris Hall |publisher=Pocket-lint |date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

On September 27, 2016, the company launched two new smart [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] bulbs that can be controlled to alter the colour and tone of the bulbs.<ref name="Engadget2ColourChangingBulbs">{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/27/hive-colour-changing-warm-white-bulbs/|title=Hive takes on Hue with colour-changing light bulbs |author=Matt Brian |publisher=engadget |date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

Effective December 31st, 2019 [https://www.centrica.com/what-we-do/centrica-consumer/home-solutions/ Centrica Hive Limited] discontinued the direct sale of products and related services for Hive in the United States and Canada. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Hive {{!}} A British Gas Innovation {{!}} Start Your Connected Home|url=https://www.hivehome.com/|website=www.hivehome.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

==Operations==
The company is the only UK-based, connected homes organisation that provides an end-to-end service, including the creation and installation of devices while also providing customer support on an ongoing basis.<ref name="TechWorldSmartGadgets">{{cite web |url=http://www.techworld.com/news/personal-tech/hive-reveals-new-products-says-it-will-open-api-developers-work-with-its-iot-platform-3619613/|title=British Gas Connected Homes reveals smart household gadgets for its Honeycomb IoT platform |author=Margi Murphy |publisher=TechWorld |date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

Beginning with 15 staff members,<ref name="Wareable"/> by 2015 this had grown to 200.<ref name="Wareable"/> The company offers services in the UK, the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[North America]].<ref name="MobileToday">{{cite web |url=http://www.mobiletoday.co.uk/news/industry/36625/british-gas-owners-invest-500m-in-the-connected-home--.aspx |title=British Gas owners invest £500m in the connected home |author=Kezia Joseph |publisher=Mobile |date=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

===Devices===
The main devices offered include a smart thermostat, lightbulbs, motion sensors for doors and windows, and what the company refers to as a smart plug<ref name="MobileIndustryReview"/> - all of which operate on an interconnected system that links to a central hub connected to the internet.<ref name="PocketlintHiveActiveHeating2.0"/>

Devices can be controlled via the hub, either by using the company website or smartphone app (available on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]).<ref name="PocketlintHiveActiveHeating2.0"/> Users can turn devices on and off both remotely<ref name="MirrorAppliancesViaSmartphone">{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/british-gas-wants-you-control-6067117 |title=British Gas wants you to control all of your home appliances via your smartphone |author=Olivia Solon |publisher=Mirror |date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> and manually.<ref name="Thenextweb"/>

==Criticism and controversy==
In August 2015, a [[Which?]] investigation claimed that the Hive app was a "burglars dream"<ref name="StopSmartMeters">{{cite web |url=http://stopsmartmeters.org.uk/british-gas-forced-to-change-burglars-dream-hive-smart-heating-app/ |title=British Gas Forced to Change Burglars Dream Hive Smart Heating App |publisher=Stop Smart Meters |date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> because it was sending data that was unencrypted, including heating schedules and away settings, posing a security risk to customers should their Wi-Fi be tapped into.<ref name="WhichNews">{{cite web |url=http://www.which.co.uk/news/2015/08/which-probe-uncovers-hive-heating-app-data-risk-407275/ |title=Which? probe uncovers Hive heating app data risk |publisher=Which? |date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> The company was informed about the Which? investigation in May 2015 and immediately began encrypting previously vulnerable data.<ref name="BurglarsDream"/>

There was criticism of Hive because users could only operate devices designed for the company's system, instead of integrating multiple platforms like companies such as nCube do.<ref name="TheNextWeb2NewHiveProducts"/> However, in August 2016 it was announced the partnership with IFTTT will allow for cross-platform collaboration.<ref name="EngadgetHiveIFTTT"/>
