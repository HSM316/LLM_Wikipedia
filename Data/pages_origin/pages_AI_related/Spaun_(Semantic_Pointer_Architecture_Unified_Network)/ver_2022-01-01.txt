'''Spaun''' ("'''Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network'''") is a [[cognitive architecture]] pioneered by '''Chris Eliasmith'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> of the [[University of Waterloo]] Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/spaun-chris-eliasmith-how-build-brain | title=Spaun: Chris Eliasmith on how to build a brain | work=University of Waterloo | date=6 March 2013 | accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> It consists of 2.5 million simulated neurons organized into subsystems that resemble specific brain regions, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[thalamus]]. It can recognize numbers, remember them, figure out numeric sequences, and even write them down with a robotic arm.<ref name="MyUser_Popsci.com_May_17_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-11/meet-spaun-first-computer-model-complex-brain-behavior |title=Meet Spaun, The Most Complex Simulated Brain Ever |newspaper=Popsci.com |date= |author= |accessdate= May 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Spaun">{{cite journal |last=Eliasmith |first=C. |last2=Stewart |first2=T.C. |last3=Choo |first3=X. |last4=Bekolay |first4=T. |last5=DeWolf |first5=T. |last6=Tang |first6=Y. |last7=Rasmussen |first7=D. |title=A large-scale model of the functioning brain |journal=Science |volume=338 |issue=6111 |pages=1202â€“5 |date=2012 |doi=10.1126/science.1225266 |url=}}</ref> It is implemented using [[NENGO|Nengo]].
