A '''semantic triple''', or '''RDF triple''' or simply '''triple''', is the atomic data entity in the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) data model.<ref>http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/ "Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification"</ref> As its name indicates, a triple is a [[tuple|set of three entities]] that codifies a [[statement (programming)|statement]] about [[Semantic data model|semantic data]] in the form of subject–predicate–object expressions (e.g., "Bob is 35", or "Bob knows John").

==Subject, predicate and object==
This format enables [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge to be represented]] in a machine-readable way. Particularly, every part of an RDF triple is individually addressable via unique [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]] — for example, the statement "Bob knows John" might be represented in RDF as: 

<code><nowiki>http://example.name#BobSmith12 http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows http://example.name#JohnDoe34</nowiki></code>.

Given this precise representation, semantic data can be unambiguously [[Semantic query|queried]] and [[Semantic reasoner|reasoned]] about.

[[File:Basic RDF Graph.svg|alt=Image depicting the subject predicate object relation.|thumb|The basic semantic triple model.]]The components of a triple, such as the statement "The sky has the color blue", consist of a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] ("the sky"), a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] ("has the color"), and an [[Object (grammar)|object]] ("blue"). This is similar to the classical notation of an [[entity–attribute–value model]] within [[object-oriented design]], where this example would be expressed as an entity (sky), an attribute (color) and a value (blue). 

From this basic structure, triples can be composed into [[Semantic network|more complex models]], by using triples as objects or subjects of other triples — for example, <code>Mike → said → (triples → can be → objects)</code>.

Given their particular, consistent structure, a collection of triples is often stored in purpose-built databases called [[Triplestore]]s.

==Difference to relational databases==
A [[relational database]] is the classical form for information storage. It's working with different tables which consist of rows. The well known [[SQL]]-language is able to retrieve information from a database. In contrast, the RDF triple storage is working with logical predicates. No tables nor rows are needed but the information is stored in a text file. A RDF-triple storage can be converted into a SQL database and the other way around.<ref>{{cite arxiv |title=SemTK: An Ontology-first, Open Source Semantic Toolkit for Managing and Querying Knowledge Graphs |author=Cuddihy, Paul and McHugh, Justin and Williams, Jenny Weisenberg and Mulwad, Varish and Aggour, Kareem S |eprint=1710.11531 |year=2017 |class=cs.AI }}</ref> If the knowledge is highly [[Unstructured data|unstructured]] and dedicated tables aren't flexible enough, semantic triples are used over classical SQL storage.

In contrast to a traditional SQL database, the RDF triple storage isn't created with table editors but the preferred tool is a [[knowledge editor]], for example Protege.<ref>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |title=Semantic modeling of educational curriculum and syllabus |author=Katis, Evangelos |year=2018 |publisher=Technological Educational Institute of Crete }}</ref> [[Protégé (software)|Protégé]] looks similar to an object-oriented modeling application used for [[software engineering]], but it's focused on natural language information. The RDF triples are aggregated into a [[knowledge base]] which allows external parser to run requests. Possible applications are located within video games for the creation of non player characters.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Talking NPCs in a virtual game world |author=Kluwer, Tina and Adolphs, Peter and Xu, Feiyu and Uszkoreit, Hans and Cheng, Xiwen |conference=Proceedings of the ACL 2010 System Demonstrations |pages=36–41 |year=2010 }}</ref>

==Limitations==
An easy to solve concern about triple storage is the missing [[Database scalability]] towards larger datasets.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24369-6_5 |year=2015 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |pages=58–69 |author=Jaroslav Pokorny |title=Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management |chapter=Graph Databases: Their Power and Limitations |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=9339 |isbn=978-3-319-24368-9 |url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01444505/file/978-3-319-24369-6_5_Chapter.pdf |conference=Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management }}</ref> The problem has become visible if not only a few information but millions of triples are stored and retrieved in a database. The seek time is larger than for classical SQL based databases.

A bit harder to fix is the missing ability to predict future situation with a given knowledge model. Even if all the information are available as [[Predicate (mathematical logic) |logical predicates]], the model fails in answering [[What-if analysis|what-if questions]]. For example, suppose in the RDF-format the world of a robot is described very well. The robot knows what the location of the table is, is aware of the distance to the table in centimeter and knows also that a table is a furniture. Before the robot can plan the next action he needs [[Commonsense reasoning|temporal reasoning]] capabilities.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/tkde.2007.34 |year=2007 |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=207–218 |author=Claudio Gutierrez and Carlos Hurtado and Alejandro Vaisman |title=Introducing Time into RDF |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering }}</ref> That means, the knowledge model should answer hypothetical questions in advance before an action was taken.
