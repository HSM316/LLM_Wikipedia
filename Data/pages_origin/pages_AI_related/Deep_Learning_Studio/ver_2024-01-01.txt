'''Deep Learning Studio''' is a software tool that aims to simplify the creation of [[deep learning]] models used in [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/deep-learning-made-easy-deep-cognition.html|title=Deep Learning Made Easy with Deep Cognition|website=www.kdnuggets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref> It is compatible with a number of [[Open source programming|open-source programming]] frameworks popularly used in [[artificial neural network]]s, including [[MXNet]] and Google's [[TensorFlow]].<ref name=":0" />

Prior to the release of Deep Learning Studio in January 2017, proficiency in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], among other programming languages, was essential in developing effective deep learning models.<ref name=":0" /> Deep Learning Studio sought to simplify the model creation process through a visual, drag-and-drop interface and the application of pre-trained learning models on available data.<ref name=":0" />

Irving, TX-based Deep Cognition Inc. is the developer behind Deep Learning Studio. In 2017, the software allowed Deep Cognition to become a finalist for Best Innovation in Deep Learning in the Alconics Awards, which are given annually to the best artificial intelligence software.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dallasinnovates.com/deep-cognition-among-finalists-alconics-award/|title=Deep Cognition Among Finalists for Alconics Award » Dallas Innovates|last=Innovates|first=Dallas|date=2017-09-25|work=Dallas Innovates|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

Deep Learning Studio is available in two versions: Desktop and Cloud, both of which are [[free software]]. The Desktop version is available on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. The Cloud version is available in single-user and multi-user configurations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=69746f7d-1813-4e31-ba16-cc79f42fd257|title=AWS Marketplace: Deep Cognition|website=aws.amazon.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}</ref> A Deep Cognition account is needed to access the Cloud version. Account registration is free.

Deep Learning Studio can import existing [[Keras]] models; it also takes a data set as an input.

Deep Learning Studio's [[AutoML]] feature allows automatic generation of deep learning models. More advanced users may choose to generate their own models using various types of layers and neural networks.

Deep Learning Studio also has a library of loss functions and optimizers for use in [[Hyperparameter (machine learning)|hyperparameter]] tuning, a traditionally complicated area in neural network programming.

Generated models can be trained using either [[CPUs]] or [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]]. Trained models can then be used for [[predictive analytics]].

Deep Learning Studio has been cited for being a user-friendly deep learning tool.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/making-deep-learning-user-friendly-possible-8fe3c1220f9|title=Making Deep Learning User-Friendly, Possible? – Towards Data Science|date=2018-04-04|work=Towards Data Science|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref>
