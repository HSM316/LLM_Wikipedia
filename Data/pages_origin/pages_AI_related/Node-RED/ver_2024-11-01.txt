'''Node-RED''' is a [[flow-based programming|flow-based]], [[Low-code development platform|low-code]] development tool for [[visual programming language|visual programming]], originally developed by [[IBM]] for wiring together hardware devices, [[Application programming interface|API]]s and [[online services]] as part of the [[Internet of things]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/node-red/ |title=How IBM's Node-RED is hacking together the Internet of things |last=Heath |first=Nick |date=March 13, 2014|work=[[TechRepublic|techrepublic.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref>

Node-RED provides a [[web browser]]-based flow editor, which can be used to create [[JavaScript]] functions. Elements of applications can be saved or shared for re-use. The runtime is built on [[Node.js]]. The flows created in Node-RED are stored using [[JSON]]. Since version 0.14, [[MQTT]] nodes can make properly configured [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] connections.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nodered.org/blog/2016/06/14/version-0-14-released |title=Version 0.14 released |author=Community staff writer |date=June 14, 2016 |website=nodered.org/blog |publisher=Node-RED |pages=1 |format= |access-date=July 6, 2016 |quote=MQTT with TLS support }}</ref>

In 2016, IBM contributed Node-RED as an [[open-source software|open source]] [[OpenJS Foundation]] project.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/10/ibm-partners-js-foundation/|title=IBM and partners launch JS Foundation - Cloud computing news |last=Diaz |first=Angel Luis |date=October 17, 2016 |website=[[IBM]] |access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |<!--last=developerWorks TV-->last1=Powers |first1=Calvin |last2=Watson |first2=Todd |last3=Lewis |first3=Ashley |title=Node-RED Joins the JS Foundation |date=October 17, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lis4Z5XIkg0 |website=IBM developerWorks TV/video channel |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/open-source-iot/ |title=Node-RED visual programming for the Internet of Things (IoT) is now a JS Foundation Project |last=Lewis |first=Karen|date=October 17, 2016 |work=IBM Internet of Things blog |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>
== Node-RED projects ==
The Node-RED project has a number of components:

* Node-RED, the visual designer tool.

* Node-RED Dashboard, a dashboard [[user interface]] for Node-RED.
* Node generator, a [[command-line tool]] to generate Node-RED node modules from several sources, including [[OpenAPI Specification|OpenAPI documents]] and a function node's source.
* Node-RED Command Line Tool, a command-line tool that allows for remotely administering a Node-RED instance.

== Flows ==
A Node-RED flow describes the connection and sequencing of various input, output, and processing nodes within the Node-RED platform. Each node within a flow performs a unique and specific task. When data is transmitted to a node, the node processes it according to its designated function, before passing it on to the subsequent node in the flow. This system allows for the controlled execution and regulation of a wide range of operations. Node-RED flows represent the primary visual programming mechanism of the tool.

== Adoption ==
Node-RED has gained traction in the [[industrial internet of things]] (IIoT) and [[edge computing]] sectors.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-13 |title=Node-RED in Industrial IoT: a growing standard |url=https://learn.umh.app/blog/node-red-in-industrial-iot-a-growing-standard/ |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=UMH Learning Center |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=GmbH |first=TeDo Verlag |date=2022-03-30 |title=Node-Red im Industrial IoT - IT&Production |url=https://www.it-production.com/industrie-4-0-iot/node-red-im-industrial-iot/ |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=www.it-production.com |language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=#38 Visuelle Programmierung mit Node-RED {{!}} Die Open-Source Low-Code-Plattform {{!}} Teil 1 von 2 by Einfach Komplex - Der Podcast für Software- und IT-Laien |url=https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/einfach-komplex/episodes/38-Visuelle-Programmierung-mit-Node-RED--Die-Open-Source-Low-Code-Plattform--Teil-1-von-2-e29mrh6/a-aad2u60 |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=Spotify for Podcasters |language=en}}</ref> Node-RED's open-source nature and large community have led to the creation of over 4000 connectors<ref>{{Cite web |title=Library - Node-RED |url=https://flows.nodered.org/ |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=flows.nodered.org}}</ref> supporting a wide range of data sources and protocols such as [[Modbus]], [[OPC Unified Architecture|OPC-UA]], [[Simatic|Siemens S7]], and [[MQTT]].

== Community survey ==
The 2023 Node-RED Community Survey<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Node-RED Community Survey : Node-RED |url=https://nodered.org/about/community/survey/2023/ |access-date=2023-07-02 |website=nodered.org}}</ref> provided insights into the usage patterns, preferences, and feedback from 780 individuals who are part of the Node-RED community. The survey, conducted in March 2023, revealed that Node-RED's usage extends beyond DIY home automation, with a  trend towards professional use in a variety of industries. Over half of the respondents had been using Node-RED for over two years, indicating a well-established community. The most common messaging technologies used in conjunction with Node-RED are MQTT and HTTP, while [[InfluxDB]] emerged as the most popular database within the community. The survey also shed light on perceived barriers to adoption, pointing towards the perception of Node-RED as a proof of concept tool and the lack of certain key features. Despite these challenges, the survey highlighted a high level of satisfaction within the community, with over two-thirds of respondents rating Node-RED a 5 out of 5.
