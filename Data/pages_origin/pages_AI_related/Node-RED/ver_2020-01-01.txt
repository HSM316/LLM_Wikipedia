'''Node-RED''' is a [[flow-based programming|flow-based]] development tool for [[visual programming language|visual programming]] developed originally by [[IBM]] for wiring together hardware devices, [[Application programming interface|API]]s and [[online services]] as part of the [[Internet of Things]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/node-red/ |title=How IBM's Node-RED is hacking together the Internet of things |last=Heath |first=Nick |date=March 13, 2014|work=[[TechRepublic|techrepublic.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref>

Node-RED provides a [[web browser]]-based flow editor, which can be used to create [[JavaScript]] functions. Elements of applications can be saved or shared for re-use. The runtime is built on [[Node.js]]. The flows created in Node-RED are stored using [[JSON]]. Since version 0.14 [[MQTT]] nodes can make properly configured [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] connections.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nodered.org/blog/2016/06/14/version-0-14-released |title=Version 0.14 released |author=Community staff writer |date=June 14, 2016 |website=nodered.org/blog |publisher=Node-RED |pages=1 |format= |access-date=July 6, 2016 |quote=MQTT with TLS support }}</ref>

In 2016, IBM contributed Node-RED as an [[open-source software|open source]] [[JS Foundation]] project.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2016/10/ibm-partners-js-foundation/|title=IBM and partners launch JS Foundation - Cloud computing news |last=Diaz |first=Angel Luis |date=October 17, 2016 |website=[[IBM]] |access-date=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |<!--last=developerWorks TV-->last1=Powers |first1=Calvin |last2=Watson |first2=Todd |last3=Lewis |first3=Ashley |title=Node-RED Joins the JS Foundation |date=October 17, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lis4Z5XIkg0 |website=IBM developerWorks TV/video channel |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/open-source-iot/ |title=Node-RED visual programming for the Internet of Things (IoT) is now a JS Foundation Project |last=Lewis |first=Karen|date=October 17, 2016 |work=IBM Internet of Things blog |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>
