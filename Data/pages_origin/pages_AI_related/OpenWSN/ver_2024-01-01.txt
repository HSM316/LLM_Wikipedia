The root of OpenWSN is a deterministic [[MAC layer]] implementing the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH based on the concept of [[Time Slotted Channel Hopping]] (TSCH). Above the MAC layer, the Low Power Lossy Network stack is based on IETF standards including the IETF 6TiSCH management and adaptation layer (a minimal configuration profile, 6top protocol and different scheduling functions). The stack is complemented by an implementation of 6LoWPAN, RPL in non-storing mode, UDP and CoAP, enabling access to devices running the stack from the native [[IPv6]] through open standards.

OpenWSN is related to other projects including the following:
* [[RIOT (operating system)|RIOT]]
* OpenMote
OpenWSN is available for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[OS X]] platforms. Current release of OpenWSN is 1.14.0.
