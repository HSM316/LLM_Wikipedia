== Concept ==
In 2011, the need to extend cloud computing with fog computing emerged, in order to cope with huge number of IoT devices and big data volumes for real-time low-latency applications.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last1=Bonomi |first1=Flavio |last2=Milito |first2=Rodolfo |last3=Zhu |first3=Jiang |last4=Addepalli |first4=Sateesh |title=Proceedings of the first edition of the MCC workshop on Mobile cloud computing |chapter=Fog computing and its role in the internet of things |date=2012-08-17 |publisher=ACM |isbn=9781450315197 |pages=13–16 |doi=10.1145/2342509.2342513 |s2cid=207196503}}</ref> Fog computing, also called edge computing, is intended for distributed computing where numerous "peripheral" devices connect to a [[cloud computing|cloud]]. The word "fog" refers to its cloud-like properties, but closer to the "ground", i.e. IoT devices.<ref name=":0" /> Many of these devices will generate voluminous raw data (e.g., from sensors), and rather than forward all this data to cloud-based servers to be processed, the idea behind fog computing is to do as much processing as possible using computing units co-located with the data-generating devices, so that processed rather than raw data is forwarded, and bandwidth requirements are reduced. An additional benefit is that the processed data is most likely to be needed by the same devices that generated the data, so that by processing locally rather than remotely, the latency between input and response is minimized. This idea is not entirely new: in non-cloud-computing scenarios, special-purpose hardware (e.g., signal-processing chips performing [[Fast Fourier Transforms]]) has long been used to reduce latency and reduce the burden on a CPU.

Fog networking consists of a [[control plane]] and a [[data plane]]. For example, on the data plane, fog computing enables computing services to reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data-center. Compared to [[cloud computing]], fog computing emphasizes proximity to end-users and client objectives (e.g. operational costs, security policies,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Forti |first1=Stefano |last2=Ferrari |first2=Gian-Luigi |last3=Brogi |first3=Antonio |title=Secure Cloud-Edge Deployments, with Trust |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2020 |volume=102 |pages=775–788 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2019.08.020|doi-access=free |arxiv=1901.05347 }}</ref> resource exploitation), dense geographical distribution and context-awareness (for what concerns computational and IoT resources), latency reduction and backbone bandwidth savings to achieve better [[quality of service]] (QoS)<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brogi|first1=Antonio|last2=Forti|first2=Stefano|date=2017|title=QoS-aware Deployment of IoT Applications Through the Fog|journal=IEEE Internet of Things Journal|volume=PP|issue=99|pages=1185–1192|doi=10.1109/JIOT.2017.2701408|s2cid=2880664|issn=2327-4662|url=http://eprints.adm.unipi.it/2362/1/paper.pdf}}</ref> and edge analytics/stream mining, resulting in superior user-experience<ref name="CiscoFog">Cisco RFP-2013-078.

[[ISO/IEC 20248]] provides a method whereby the data of objects identified by [[edge computing]] using Automated Identification Data Carriers (AIDC), a [[barcode]] and/or [[RFID]] tag, can be read, interpreted, verified and made available into the "Fog" and on the "Edge," even when the AIDC tag has moved on.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dupGDgAAQBAJ&dq=ISO/IEC+20248+provides+a+method+whereby+the+data+of+objects+identified+by+edge+computing+using+Automated+Identification+Data+Carriers+%5BAIDC%5D,+a+barcode+and/or+RFID+tag,+can+be+read,+interpreted,+verified+and+made+available+into+the+%22Fog%22+and+on+the+%22Edge%22+even+when+the+AIDC+tag+has+moved+on.&pg=PA157|title=Mobile Cloud Computing: Foundations and Service Models|last1=Huang|first1=Dijiang|last2=Wu|first2=Huijun|date=2017-09-08|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=9780128096444|language=en}}</ref>
<!--Eassy like material hidden:
== Motivation ==
There are many factors that make this an interesting paradigm to study.
Each client/edge device in the past several years as become powerful in its capabilities. For instance, the original iPhone had a single core 412&nbsp;MHz ARM processor with 128&nbsp;MB RAM and 8&nbsp;GB storage space. The current iPhone 5S on the other hand carries a dual-core 1.3&nbsp;GHz Apple A7 processor with 1GB RAM, 64 GB storage space and enhanced GPU capabilities. Intel's mobile chip Atom and Nvidia's Tegra too promise near similar specifications. The increase in strength and capabilities implies complex functionality such as CPU/GPU intensive gaming, powerful location/context tracking sensors and enhanced storage.

Fog computing can be much more cognitive of end user application experience since it is much "closer" to the data then traditional cloud computing. Due to the rise of encrypted traffic and multipath-TCP in the  core network, the network provider and the cloud service provider are often unable to extract and understand features specific to the users. Fog applications are not as limited since they may often reside on or near the end user, granting it access to raw user data.

The need for fog applications has been brought further into focus by the clear trend towards cell densification in the 5G framework with multiple small base-stations covering shorter areas. Can they act as miniature LTE-cores coordinating with a centralized LTE core serving only those functionalities that cannot be carried out by the edge?

== Architecture ==
The functionality of Fog networking can be studied according to the traditional functional planes

EDD (Edge-driven Data Center): On the data-plane, distributed data centers, mobile CDN, and edge caching are various manifestations of the Fog. And a goal of Fog networking research is to investigate the optimization of resources that are virtualized, pooled, and shared in unpredictable way.
EDC (Edge-driven Control Plane): On the (much less appreciated) control plane and its many functionalities, Fog Networking revisits the role of the edge devices in network architectures as an integral part of the control plane that monitors, measures, and manages the  network.

== Applications ==
While there has been many applications in the past in the world of P2P networks, sensor networks and mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) there are many applications that can be conceived such as:

* Edge caching/BW management at home gateway/small cell (industrial automation)
* Edge analytics and real-time stream-mining
* IoT session management and signaling load optimization
* Client-driven distributed beam-forming/content sharing
* Clients' idle computing/storage resource pooling
* Cloudlets/Mobile CDN
* FlashLinQ/LTE Direct/WiFi Direct/AirDrop
* Over The Top (OTT) content management

==Definition==
Both [[cloud computing]] and fog computing provide storage, applications, and data to end-users. However, fog computing is closer to end-users and has wider geographical distribution.<ref>F. Bonomi, R. Milito, J. Zhu, and S. Addepalli, "Fog computing and its role in the internet of things," in Proceedings of the First Edition of the MCC Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing, ser. MCC'12. ACM, 2012, pp. 13–16.</ref>

'Cloud computing' is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cloud_computing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927033704/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cloud_computing|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2016|title=cloud computing {{!}} Definition of cloud computing in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>

Also known as edge computing or fogging, fog computing facilitates the operation of compute, storage, and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers. 

[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in March 2018 released a definition of fog computing adopting much of Cisco's commercial terminology as NIST Special Publication 500-325, ''Fog Computing Conceptual Model'', that defines fog computing as a horizontal, physical or virtual resource paradigm that resides between smart end-devices and traditional [[cloud computing]] or [[data center]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1894659|title=Fog brings the cloud closer to the ground: Cisco innovates in fog computing|website=newsroom.cisco.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> This paradigm supports vertically-isolated, latency-sensitive applications by providing ubiquitous, scalable, layered, federated, distributed computing, storage, and network connectivity. Thus, fog computing is most distinguished by distance from the edge. In the theoretical model of fog computing, fog computing nodes are physically and functionally operative between edge nodes and centralized cloud.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sarkar|first1=S.|last2=Misra|first2=S.|date=2016|title=Theoretical modelling of fog computing: a green computing paradigm to support IoT applications|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7437623|journal=IET Networks|volume=5|issue=2|pages=23–29|doi=10.1049/iet-net.2015.0034|issn=2047-4954}}</ref> Much of the terminology is undefined, including key architectural terms like "smart", and the distinction between fog computing from edge computing is not generally agreed.  

=== Differences with edge computing and cloud computing ===
While edge computing is typically referred to the location where services are instantiated, fog computing implies distribution of the communication, computation, storage resources, and services on or close to devices and systems in the control of end-users.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zhang |first=Chiang |title=2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC) |chapter=Reliable capacity provisioning for distributed cloud/Edge/Fog computing applications |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:289-oparu-4539-1 |date=2016 |journal=IEEE Internet of Things Journal |isbn=978-1-5386-3873-6 |volume=3 |pages=854–864 |doi=10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980667 |hdl=11572/272828 |issue=6 |s2cid=19836815}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ostberg |display-authors=etal |date=2017 |title=Reliable Capacity Provisioning for Distributed Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing Applications |journal=Networks and Communications (EuCNC), 2017 European Conference on |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=854–864 |doi=10.1109/JIOT.2016.2584538 |s2cid=207018722}}</ref> Fog computing is a medium weight and intermediate level of computing power.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Perera |first1=Charith |last2=Qin |first2=Yongrui |last3=Estrella |first3=Julio C. |last4=Reiff-Marganiec |first4=Stephan |last5=Vasilakos |first5=Athanasios V. |date=2017-10-09 |title=Fog Computing for Sustainable Smart Cities: A Survey |url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/31927/8/__nas01_librhome_librsh3_Desktop_acmsmall-sample.pdf |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=32 |arxiv=1703.07079 |bibcode=2017arXiv170307079P |doi=10.1145/3057266 |issn=0360-0300 |s2cid=12675271}}</ref> Rather than a substitute, fog computing often serves as a complement to cloud computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Matt |first=Christian |date=2018-04-19 |title=Fog Computing |url=https://boris.unibe.ch/121416/3/Matt%20%282018%29_Fog%20Computing_postprint.pdf |journal=Business & Information Systems Engineering |language=en |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=351–355 |doi=10.1007/s12599-018-0540-6 |issn=2363-7005 |s2cid=51874973}}</ref> Fog computing is more energy-efficient than cloud computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sarkar |first1=S. |last2=Chatterjee |first2=S. |last3=Misra |first3=S. |date=2018 |title=Assessment of the Suitability of Fog Computing in the Context of Internet of Things |journal=IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=46–59 |doi=10.1109/TCC.2015.2485206 |issn=2168-7161 |s2cid=3823420}}</ref>
