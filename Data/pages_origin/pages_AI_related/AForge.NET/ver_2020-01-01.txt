'''AForge.NET''' is a [[computer vision]] and [[artificial intelligence]] library originally developed by Andrew Kirillov for the [[.NET Framework]].<ref name="GDuncan">Greg Duncan. Portable Image and Video processing with help from AForge.NET and Accord.NET. [https://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/Portable-Image-and-Video-processing-with-help-from-AForgeNET-and-AccordNET] Channel 9, November 2014.

The source code and binaries of the project are available under the terms of the [[LGPL|Lesser GPL]] and the [[GPL|GPL (GNU General Public License)]].

Another (unaffiliated) project called [[Accord.NET]] was created to extend the features of the original '''AForge.NET''' library.<ref name="AforgeExtensionAccordSousa">{{cite web |url=http://crsouza.com/2010/05/20/accord-net-framework-an-extension-to-aforge-net/ |title=Accord.NET Framework – An extension to AForge.NET | last=Souza| first=César | website= | date=20 May 2010 | archive-url=http://crsouza.com/2010/05/20/accord-net-framework-an-extension-to-aforge-net/ |archive-date=2018-11-26 |access-date=2018-11-26 }}</ref>

== Discontinuation of free public support and future development ==

On April 1, 2012, Andrew Kirillov announced the end of the public support for the library, temporarily closing the discussion forums. The last release of the AForge.NET Framework was made available on July 17, 2013. However, since its release 3.0 in 2015, the [[Accord.NET]] project started to incorporate most of the original AForge.NET source code in its codebase, continuing its support and development under the [[Accord.NET]] name.<ref name="AforgeExtensionAccordSousa" />

==Features==

The framework's API includes support for:
* [[Computer vision]], [[image processing]] and video processing<ref name="AforgeComputerVision">{{cite web |url=https://www.codeguru.com/columns/dotnet/computer-vision-using-aforge.net.html |title=Computer Vision Using AForge.NET  | authors=Peter Shaw  | work=.NET Nuts & Bolts | publisher=Code Guru |date=3 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126151806/https://www.codeguru.com/columns/dotnet/computer-vision-using-aforge.net.html |archive-date=2018-11-26 |access-date=2018-11-26 }}</ref>
** Including a comprehensive image filter library
* [[Neural Network|Artificial Neural networks]] library implements some common network architectures (multi-layer feed forward and distance networks) and learning algorithms (back propagation, delta rule, simple [[perceptron]], evolutionary learning).
* [[Genetic algorithm]]s, [[genetic programming]] and [[gene expression programming]]
* [[Fuzzy logic]]
* [[Machine learning]]
* and libraries for a select set of [[robotics]] kits
** [[Lego Mindstorms]] NXT and RCX kits

The framework is provided not only with different libraries and their sources, but with many sample applications, which demonstrate the use of this framework, and with documentation help files, which are provided in HTML Help format.
