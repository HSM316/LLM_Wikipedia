{{distinguish|Hyperparameter (Bayesian)}}

In [[machine learning]], a '''hyperparameter''' is a [[parameter]] whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are derived via training.

Hyperparameters can be classified as model hyperparameters, that cannot be inferred while [[Model fitting|fitting the machine to the training set]] because they refer to the [[model selection]] task, or algorithm hyperparameters, that in principle have no influence on the performance of the model but affect the speed and quality of the learning process. An example of a model hyperparameter is the topology and size of a neural network. Examples of algorithm hyperparameters are [[learning rate]] and batch size as well as mini-batch size. Batch size can refer to the full data sample where mini-batch size would be a smaller sample set.

Different model training algorithms require different hyperparameters, some simple algorithms (such as [[ordinary least squares]] regression) require none. Given these hyperparameters, the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data. For instance, [[LASSO]] is an algorithm that adds a [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] hyperparameter to [[ordinary least squares]] regression, which has to be set before estimating the parameters through the training algorithm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Li |last2=Shami |first2=Abdallah |date=2020-11-20 |title=On hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms: Theory and practice |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220311693 |journal=Neurocomputing |language=en |volume=415 |pages=295–316 |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2020.07.061 |arxiv=2007.15745 |s2cid=220919678 |issn=0925-2312}}</ref>

== Considerations ==
The time required to train and test a model can depend upon the choice of its hyperparameters.<ref name=abs1502.02127>{{cite news |arxiv=1502.02127 |title=Claesen, Marc, and Bart De Moor. "Hyperparameter Search in Machine Learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.02127 (2015).|bibcode=2015arXiv150202127C}}</ref> A hyperparameter is usually of continuous or integer type, leading to mixed-type optimization problems.<ref name=abs1502.02127/> The existence of some hyperparameters is conditional upon the value of others, e.g. the size of each hidden layer in a neural network can be conditional upon the number of layers.<ref name=abs1502.02127/>

=== Difficulty learnable parameters ===

Usually, but not always, hyperparameters cannot be learned using well known gradient based methods (such as gradient descent, LBFGS) - which are commonly employed to learn parameters. These hyperparameters are those parameters describing a model representation that cannot be learned by common optimization methods but nonetheless affect the loss function. An example would be the tolerance hyperparameter for errors in support vector machines.

=== Untrainable parameters ===

Sometimes, hyperparameters cannot be learned from the training data because they aggressively increase the capacity of a model and can push the loss function to an undesired minimum (overfitting to, and picking up noise in the data), as opposed to correctly mapping the richness of the structure in the data. For example, if we treat the degree of a polynomial equation fitting a regression model as a [[trainable parameter]], the degree would increase until the model perfectly fit the data, yielding low training error, but poor generalization performance.

=== Tunability ===
Most performance variation can be attributed to just a few hyperparameters.<ref name=hutter14>{{Cite journal|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/hutter14.html|title=An Efficient Approach for Assessing Hyperparameter Importance|first1=Kevin|last1=Leyton-Brown|first2=Holger|last2=Hoos|first3=Frank|last3=Hutter|date=January 27, 2014|pages=754–762|via=proceedings.mlr.press}}</ref><ref name=abs1502.02127/><ref name=abs1710.04725>{{cite news |arxiv=1710.04725 |title=van Rijn, Jan N., and Frank Hutter.

Although some research has advocated the use of mini-batch sizes in the thousands, other work has found the best performance with mini-batch sizes between 2 and 32.<ref name=arXiv:1804.07612>{{cite news |arxiv=1804.07612 |title=Revisiting Small Batch Training for Deep Neural Networks (2018).|bibcode=2018arXiv180407612M}}</ref>

=== Robustness ===
An inherent stochasticity in learning directly implies that the empirical hyperparameter performance is not necessarily its true performance.<ref name=abs1502.02127/> Methods that are not [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] to simple changes in hyperparameters, [[random seed]]s, or even different implementations of the same algorithm cannot be integrated into mission critical control systems without significant simplification and robustification.<ref name=arXiv:1803.07055>{{cite news |arxiv=1803.07055 |title=Mania, Horia, Aurelia Guy, and Benjamin Recht. "Simple random search provides a competitive approach to reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.07055 (2018).|bibcode=2018arXiv180307055M}}</ref>

[[Reinforcement learning]] algorithms, in particular, require measuring their performance over a large number of random seeds, and also measuring their sensitivity to choices of hyperparameters.<ref name=arXiv:1803.07055/> Their evaluation with a small number of random seeds does not capture performance adequately due to high variance.<ref name=arXiv:1803.07055/> Some reinforcement learning methods, e.g. DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), are more sensitive to hyperparameter choices than others.<ref name=arXiv:1803.07055/>

== Optimization ==
{{main|Hyperparameter optimization}}

Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined [[loss function]] on given test data.<ref name=abs1502.02127/>  The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss.<ref name=abs1502.02127/>

== Reproducibility ==
Apart from tuning hyperparameters, machine learning involves storing and organizing the parameters and results, and making sure they are reproducible.<ref name=sacred2015>{{cite news |url=https://indico.lal.in2p3.fr/event/2914/contributions/6476/subcontributions/169/attachments/6034/7159/Sacred_3.pdf |title=Greff, Klaus, and Jürgen Schmidhuber.
