A '''smart speaker''' is a type of [[wireless speaker]] and [[voice command device]] with an integrated [[virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] that offers interactive actions and [[Hands-free computing|hands-free activation]] with the help of one "hot word" (or several "hot words"). Some smart speakers can also act as a [[smart device]] that utilizes [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] and other wireless protocol standards to extend usage beyond audio playback, such as to control [[home automation]] devices. This can include, but is not limited to, features such as compatibility across a number of services and platforms, [[peer-to-peer]] connection through [[mesh networking]], virtual assistants, and others. Each can have its own designated [[Interface (computing)|interface]] and [[Software feature|features]] in-house, usually launched or controlled via [[Application software|application]] or [[home automation]] software.<ref>[http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/smart-speaker smart speaker], techtarget.com, May 2017</ref> Some smart speakers also include a screen to show the user a visual response.

A smart speaker with a touchscreen is known as a '''smart display'''.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Rich|last1=Brown|accessdate=2019-06-19|title=Echo Show, Nest Hub, Facebook Portal and more: How to pick the best smart display in 2019|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/echo-show-nest-hub-facebook-portal-and-more-how-to-pick-the-best-smart-display-in-2019/|website=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Cameron|last1=Faulkner|accessdate=2019-06-19|title=How Google's new Home Hub compares to the Echo Show and Facebook Portal|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956898/google-home-hub-vs-amazon-echo-show-facebook-portal-price-smart-speaker-display|date=9 October 2018|website=The Verge}}</ref> While similar in [[Form factor (design)|form factor]] to [[tablet computer]]s, smart displays differ in their emphasis on a hands-free user interface and virtual assistant features.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/what-is-a-smart-display/ |first=Tyler |last=Lacoma |date=October 26, 2018 |title=What is a smart display? |work=[[Digital Trends]]}}</ref>

As of winter 2017, it is estimated by [[NPR]] and Edison Research that 39 million Americans (16% of the population over 18) own a smart speaker.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://nationalpublicmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Smart-Audio-Report-from-NPR-and-Edison-Research-Fall-Winter-2017.pdf|title=The Smart Audio Report from NPR and Edison Research, Fall-Winter 2017}}</ref>

==Privacy concerns==
The built-in microphone in smart speakers is continuously listening for "hot words" followed by a command. However, these continuously listening microphones also raise privacy concerns among users.<ref name="lau">{{cite journal|title=Alexa, Are You Listening?: Privacy Perceptions, Concerns and Privacy-seeking Behaviors with Smart Speakers|first1=Josephine|last1=Lau|first2=Benjamin|last2=Zimmerman|first3=Florian|last3=Schaub|date=1 November 2018|journal=Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact.|volume=2|issue=CSCW|pages=102:1–102:31|doi=10.1145/3274371}}</ref> These  include what is being recorded, how the data will be used, how it will be protected, and whether it will be used for invasive advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39191056|title=Amazon hands over Echo 'murder' data|author=|date=7 March 2017|publisher=|access-date=2 March 2019|via=www.BBC.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43725708|title=Amazon patents 'voice-sniffing' algorithms|author=|date=11 April 2018|publisher=|access-date=2 March 2019|via=www.BBC.com}}</ref> Further, an analysis of Amazon Alexa Echo Dots showed that 30–38% of "spurious audio recordings were human conversations", suggesting that these devices capture audio outside of strictly after hot word detection.<ref>Ford, Marcia, and William Palmer. "Alexa, are you listening to me? An analysis of Alexa voice service network traffic." Personal and Ubiquitous Computing (2018): 1-13.</ref>

===As a wiretap===
There are strong concerns that the ever-listening microphone of smart speakers presents a perfect candidate for a wiretap. In 2017, British security researcher Mark Barnes showed that pre-2017 Echos have exposed pins that allow for a compromised OS to be booted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-wiretap-hack/|title=A Hacker Turned an Amazon Echo Into a 'Wiretap'|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|date=1 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2019|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>

===Voice assistance vs privacy===
While voice assistants provide a valuable service, there can be some hesitation towards using them in various social contexts, such as in public or around other users.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31205-2_10 Sarah Mennicken and Elaine M. Huang. 2012. Hacking the Natural Habitat: An In-the-Wild Study of Smart Homes,Their Development, and the People Who Live in Them. In ''Pervasive Computing''. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 143–160.]</ref> However, only more recently have users begun interacting with voice assistants through an interaction with smart speakers rather than an interaction with the phone. On the phone, most voice assistants have the option to be engaged by a physical button (e.g., Siri with a long press of the home button) rather than solely by hot word-based engagement in a smart speaker. While this distinction increases the privacy by limiting when the microphone is on, users felt that having to press a button first removed the convenience of voice interaction. <ref>Christoffer Lambertsson. 2017. Expectations of Privacy in Voice Interaction–A Look at Voice Controlled Bank Transactions. Ph.D. Dissertation. KTH Royal Institute of Technology</ref> This trade-off is not unique to voice assistants; as more and more devices come online, there is an increasing trade-off between convenience and privacy.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-todays-homes-consumers-are-willing-to-sacrifice-privacy-for-convenience/2018/09/11/5f951b4a-a241-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html Rao, Sonia (12 September 2018) "In today's homes, consumers are willing to sacrifice privacy for convenience". Retrieved 25 February 2019]</ref>

===Factors influencing adoption===
While there are many factors influencing smart speaker adoption, specifically with regards to privacy, Lau et. al. define five distinct categories as pros and cons: convenience, identity as an early adopter, contributing factors,{{examples needed|date=November 2019}} perceived lack of utility, and privacy and security concerns.<ref name="lau" />

==Security concerns==
When configured without [[authentication]], smart speakers can be activated by people other than the intended user. For example, visitors to a home or office, or people in a publicly accessible area outside an open window, partial wall, or security fence, may be able to be heard by a speaker. One team demonstrated the ability to stimulate the microphones of smart speakers and smartphones through a closed window, from another building across the street, using a laser.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/lasers-voice-commands-smart-speaker/ Lasers can silently issue 'voice commands' to your smart speakers]</ref>
