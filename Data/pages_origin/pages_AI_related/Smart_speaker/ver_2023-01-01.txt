A '''smart speaker''' is a type of [[loudspeaker]] and [[voice command device]] with an integrated [[virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] that offers interactive actions and [[Hands-free computing|hands-free activation]] with the help of one "hot word" (or several "hot words"). Some smart speakers can also act as a [[smart device]] that utilizes [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] and other protocol standards to extend usage beyond audio playback, such as to control [[home automation]] devices. This can include, but is not limited to, features such as compatibility across a number of services and platforms, [[peer-to-peer]] connection through [[mesh networking]], virtual assistants, and others. Each can have its own designated [[Interface (computing)|interface]] and [[Software feature|features]] in-house, usually launched or controlled via [[Application software|application]] or [[home automation]] software.<ref>[http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/smart-speaker smart speaker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410155936/http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/smart-speaker |date=2019-04-10 }}, techtarget.com, May 2017</ref> Some smart speakers also include a screen to show the user a visual response.

As of winter 2017, it is estimated by [[NPR]] and Edison Research that 39 million Americans (16% of the population over 18) own a smart speaker.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Smart Audio Report from NPR and Edison Research, Fall-Winter 2017|url=http://nationalpublicmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Smart-Audio-Report-from-NPR-and-Edison-Research-Fall-Winter-2017.pdf|access-date=2018-01-13|archive-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101004239/http://nationalpublicmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Smart-Audio-Report-from-NPR-and-Edison-Research-Fall-Winter-2017.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first smart displays were introduced in 2017 by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] ([[Amazon Echo Show]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 Jan 2020|title=Smart Speakers History & Future - The Rise Of Voice Assistants! {{!}} IGW|url=https://www.igadgetsworld.com/smart-speakers-history-future/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-01-11|website=igadgetsworld|language=en-US|archive-date=2020-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926010548/https://www.igadgetsworld.com/smart-speakers-history-future/}}</ref> Amazon Echo Spot).

==Accuracy==
According to a study by ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' released In March 2020, the six biggest tech development companies, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Google]], [[Yandex]], [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]], have misidentified more words spoken by "[[black people]]" than "[[white people]]". The systems tested errors and unreadability, with a 19 and 35 percent discrepancy for the former and 2 and 20 percent discrepancy for the latter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/speech-recognition-bias-apple-amazon-google.html |title=There Is a Racial Divide in Speech-Recognition Systems, Researchers Say |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=2020-03-23 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US |access-date=2020-04-22 |archive-date=2022-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013220941/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/speech-recognition-bias-apple-amazon-google.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics]] (NAACL) also identified a discrepancy between male and female voices. According to their research, Google's speech recognition software is 13 percent more accurate for men than women. It performs better than the systems used by [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[AT&T]] and IBM.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2019/05/voice-recognition-still-has-significant-race-and-gender-biases |title=Voice Recognition Still Has Significant Race and Gender Biases |last=Bajorek |first=Joan Palmiter |date=2019-05-10 |website=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2020-04-24 |archive-date=2020-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425050619/https://hbr.org/2019/05/voice-recognition-still-has-significant-race-and-gender-biases |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Privacy concerns==
The built-in microphone in smart speakers is continuously listening for "hot words" followed by a command. However, these continuously listening microphones also raise privacy concerns among users.<ref name="lau">{{cite journal|title=Alexa, Are You Listening?: Privacy Perceptions, Concerns and Privacy-seeking Behaviors with Smart Speakers|first1=Josephine|last1=Lau|first2=Benjamin|last2=Zimmerman|first3=Florian|last3=Schaub|date=1 November 2018|journal=Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction|volume=2|issue=CSCW|pages=102:1–102:31|doi=10.1145/3274371|s2cid=53223356}}</ref> These include what is being recorded, how the data will be used, how it will be protected, and whether it will be used for invasive advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39191056|title=Amazon hands over Echo 'murder' data|date=7 March 2017|access-date=2 March 2019|via=www.BBC.com|archive-date=6 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106035858/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39191056|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43725708|title=Amazon patents 'voice-sniffing' algorithms|date=11 April 2018|access-date=2 March 2019|via=www.BBC.com|archive-date=14 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214030848/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43725708|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, an analysis of Amazon [[Amazon Echo|Echo Dots]] showed that 30–38% of "spurious audio recordings were human conversations", suggesting that these devices capture audio other than strictly detection of the hot word.<ref>Ford, Marcia, and William Palmer. "Alexa, are you listening to me? An analysis of Alexa voice service network traffic." Personal and Ubiquitous Computing (2018): 1-13.</ref>

===As a wiretap===
There are strong concerns that the ever-listening microphone of smart speakers presents a perfect candidate for [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]]. In 2017, British security researcher Mark Barnes showed that pre-2017 Echos have exposed pins which allow for a compromised OS to be booted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-wiretap-hack/|title=A Hacker Turned an Amazon Echo Into a 'Wiretap'|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|date=1 August 2017|access-date=2 March 2019|via=www.wired.com|archive-date=3 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603152834/https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-wiretap-hack/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Voice assistance vs privacy===
While [[Virtual assistant|voice assistants]] provide a valuable service, there can be some hesitation towards using them in various social contexts, such as in public or around other users.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31205-2_10 |title=Sarah Mennicken and Elaine M. Huang. 2012. Hacking the Natural Habitat: An In-the-Wild Study of Smart Homes,Their Development, and the People Who Live in Them. In ''Pervasive Computing''. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 143–160. |access-date=2019-02-26 |archive-date=2022-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013220942/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31205-2_10 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, only more recently have users begun interacting with voice assistants through an interaction with smart speakers rather than an interaction with the phone. On the phone, most voice assistants have the option to be engaged by a physical button (e.g., Siri with a long press of the home button) rather than solely by hot word-based engagement in a smart speaker. While this distinction increases the privacy by limiting when the microphone is on, users felt that having to press a button first removed the convenience of voice interaction.<ref>Christoffer Lambertsson. 2017. Expectations of Privacy in Voice Interaction–A Look at Voice Controlled Bank Transactions. Ph.D. Dissertation. KTH Royal Institute of Technology</ref> This trade-off is not unique to voice assistants; as more and more devices come online, there is an increasing trade-off between convenience and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-todays-homes-consumers-are-willing-to-sacrifice-privacy-for-convenience/2018/09/11/5f951b4a-a241-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html |title=Rao, Sonia (12 September 2018) "In today's homes, consumers are willing to sacrifice privacy for convenience".

===Factors influencing adoption===
While there are many factors influencing smart speaker adoption, specifically with regards to privacy, Lau et al. define five distinct categories as pros and cons: convenience, identity as an early adopter, contributing factors, perceived lack of utility, privacy and security concerns.<ref name="lau" />

==Security concerns==
When configured without [[authentication]], smart speakers can be activated by people other than the intended user or owner. For example, visitors to a home or office, or people in a publicly accessible area outside an open window, partial wall, or security fence, may be able to be heard by a speaker. One team demonstrated the ability to stimulate the microphones of smart speakers and smartphones through a closed window, from another building across the street, using a laser.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/lasers-voice-commands-smart-speaker/ |title=Lasers can silently issue 'voice commands' to your smart speakers |access-date=2019-11-06 |archive-date=2019-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105100324/https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/lasers-voice-commands-smart-speaker/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
