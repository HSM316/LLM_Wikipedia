'''UMBEL''' ('''U'''pper '''M'''apping and '''B'''inding '''E'''xchange '''L'''ayer) is a logically organized knowledge [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of 34,000 concepts and entity types that can be used in [[information science]] for relating information from disparate sources to one another. It was retired at the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bergman |first1=Michael K. |title=UMBEL to Be Retired by End of 2019 |url=https://www.mkbergman.com/2229/umbel-to-be-retired-by-end-of-2019/ |website=AI3:::Adaptive Information |language=English |date=7 May 2019}}</ref> UMBEL was first released in July 2008. Version 1.00 was released in February 2011.<ref>See the [http://umbel.org/resources/news/finally-umbel-v-100] release announcement.</ref> Its current release is version 1.50.<ref>See http://umbel.org/resources/news/new-major-upgrade-of-umbel-released-version-1.50/</ref>

The [[symbol grounding problem|grounding]] of this information occurs by common reference to the permanent [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]] for the UMBEL concepts; the connections within the UMBEL [[upper ontology]] enable concepts from sources at different levels of abstraction or specificity to be logically related. Since UMBEL is an [[open-source software|open-source]] extract of the [[Cyc#OpenCyc|OpenCyc]] [[knowledge base]], it can also take advantage of the [[inference engine|reasoning capabilities]] within [[Cyc]].

UMBEL has two means to promote the [[semantic interoperability]] of information:.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> It is:

* An [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of about 35,000 reference concepts, designed to provide common [[Data mapping|mapping]] points for relating different ontologies or [[Conceptual schema|schema]] to one another, and
* A [[controlled vocabulary|vocabulary]] for aiding that ontology mapping, including expressions of likelihood relationships distinct from exact identity or equivalence. This vocabulary is also designed for interoperable [[Ontology (information science)#Domain ontologies and upper ontologies|domain ontologies]].

[[File:LOD Cloud 2014-08.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram showing [[Linking Open Data]] datasets.  UMBEL is near the hub, below and to the right of the central DBpedia.]]

UMBEL is written in the [[Semantic Web]] languages of [[SKOS]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL 2]]. It is a [[Class (set theory)|class]] structure used in [[Linked data|Linked Data]], along with OpenCyc, [[Yago (database)|YAGO]], and the [[DBpedia]] ontology. Besides data integration, UMBEL has been used to aid [[concept search]],<ref>{{cite book

Including OpenCyc, UMBEL has about 65,000 formal mappings to [[DBpedia]], PROTON, [[GeoNames]], and [[schema.org]], and provides linkages to more than 2 million [[Wikipedia]] pages (English version). All of its reference concepts and mappings are organized under a hierarchy of 31 different "super types",<ref>See [http://techwiki.umbel.org/index.php/UMBEL_-_Annex_G Annex G] in the UMBEL specifications.</ref> which are mostly disjoint from one another. Each of these "super types" has its own typology of entity classes to provide flexible tie-ins for external content. 90% of UMBEL is contained in these entity classes.
