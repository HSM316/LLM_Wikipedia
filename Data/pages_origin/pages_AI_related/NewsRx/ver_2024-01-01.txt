==History==

The idea for the first newsletter originated at an international conference on [[AIDS]] sponsored by the [[Centers for Disease Control & Prevention]] (CDC). A staff member commented to CW Henderson on the need for a publication to condense the rapid rise in information about the disease.<ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/> In 1984, Henderson created CW Henderson Publisher,<ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/> which became NewsRx in 2004.<ref name= "Who.is.">{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.is/domain_archive-com/newsrx.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930033810/http://www.who.is/domain_archive-com/newsrx.com/ |archive-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

That same year, the company distributed its first journal, ''CDC AIDS Weekly'', (which split into ''AIDS Weekly'' and ''Medical Letter on the CDC & FDA'') to an international audience.<ref name="6 Men">Zimmerman, David, Lou Ziegler, and Patrick O'Driscoll. "6 Who Made a Difference." ''USA Today'' December 11, 1985</ref><ref name="CW Quietly Built">Goss, Fred. "Charles Henderson Quietly Built one of the Largest and Most Successful Operations in Newsletter History, Title by Title, Week by Week." ''Newsletter on Newsletters'' May 23, 2005</ref> The first subscriber was the Soviet Union.<ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/> Other subscribers include physicians, educators, government agencies, and pharmaceutical companies.<ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/><ref name="Health-Care Newsletters">Allison, David. "Atlanta's a Center for Health-care Newsletters." ''Atlanta Business Chronicle''. April 21, 1995</ref>

The articles in ''AIDS Weekly'' discussed social issues of the disease to medical research.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/> The newsweekly included “shorts” to explain as much as was known about unfolding information and events.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/>

Before the World Wide Web, NewsRx coordinated with the National AIDS Information Clearinghouse to provide information on the disease.<ref name="AIDS Bulletin">Moore, Lisa. "AIDS Bulletin." ''U.S. News & World Report''. June 6, 1988: 83</ref> The ''CDC AIDS Weekly Infoline'' provided a list of upcoming AIDS seminars as well as names and addresses of over 65 AIDS periodicals published worldwide.<ref name="AIDS Bulletin"/>

The information published in ''AIDS Weekly'' came primarily from the government organization [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC).<ref name="Anniversary Book"/> Though the newsweekly had no direct ties to the CDC other than as a source for information, a CDC official described the publication as “highly informative.” <ref name="CW Quietly Built"/> Other sources of information for this and other titles were the nearby [[Emory University]] medical library and international agencies.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/> Articles included summaries of peer-reviewed research, conference reports, news releases, and compilations from other health and medical organizations.<ref>"NewsRx Weekly Reports." Dialog, November 10, 2003. Web. 24 Aug 2011. http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0135.html</ref>

However, in the beginning, some critics were offended by the fact that NewsRx was a non-governmental agency distributing statistics that were available for free in official versions from the government.<ref name="Source of News">Laermer, Richard. "A Source of News on AIDS." ''Editor and Publisher'' September 5, 1987</ref> (see Controversy)

In 1988, the firm added ''Cancer Weekly''<ref name="86 Titles"/><ref name="AIDS Therapies">Ricklefs, Roger. "Medical Newsletters on AIDS Therapies Crop Up Across U.S." ''The Wall Street Journal''. October 4, 1988</ref> and it added ''Blood Weekly'' in 1993.<ref name="86 Titles"/> The company added ''Vaccine Weekly'' in 1995, followed by over 100 more medical-related titles.<ref name="Let the Reader Beware"/><ref name="Anniversary Book"/>

In 1999, the firm also adopted ''[[Artificial Intelligence]] Journalist'' (AIJ) which uses robotics, [[machine learning]], [[algorithms]], logic, and [[automated reasoning]] to provide [[computer-assisted reporting]] and [[data driven journalism]].<ref name="CW Quietly Built"/> The software shortens the time from news event to news distribution.<ref name="CW Quietly Built"/>

In 2007, the firm introduced VerticalNews.<ref name="86 Titles"/> 

The firm also adopted site licenses, including  the ability for users to download reports showing the types of information used in a given organization—information previously restricted to the NewsRx staff.<ref name="CW Quietly Built"/> The system recognizes IP addresses to facilitate research activities.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/><ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/><ref name="CW Quietly Built"/><ref name="Health-Care Newsletters"/>

In 2010, the firm's VerticalNews China was the subject of a [[denial of service attack]] that originated from China as a result of controversial news reported.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-01-15 |title=More Victims Of Chinese Hacking Attacks Come Forward |url=https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/more-victims-of-chinese-hacking-attacks-come-forward |access-date=2023-02-17 |website=Dark Reading |language=en}}</ref> The attack was halted when the company's IP service identified the source and blocked it.<ref>"NewsRx; China News from U.S. Hit by Denial of Service Cyber Attack Originating from China." ''Wall Street Journal Professional Edition with Factiva''. January 25, 2010</ref>

On April 22, 2015, NewsRx announced hiring new VP and Publisher Kalani Rosell.<ref name= "PRnewswire">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsrx-expands-team-for-butter-launch---kalani-rosell-new-vp-business-development-300069451.html|title=NewsRx™ Expands Team for BUTTER™ Launch - Kalani Rosell New V.P. Business Development|website=www.prnewswire.com}}</ref> The business development office opened in 2016 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], headed by Rosell.<ref name= "siaa"/>

== BUTTER ==
In 2015, NewsRx started BUTTER, which stands for Better Understanding Through Technology & Emerging Research, a business intelligence and data analytics platform with emerging research and new discoveries.<ref name="PRnewswire"/> It has content for researchers, academics, and investors, using a New Discovery Index (NDI) that analyzes discoveries worldwide by quarter and new discoveries within specific topic areas.<ref name= "Butter.business">{{cite web|url=http://www.butterbusiness.com/BUTTERbusiness/#!about|title=NewsRx|website=www.butterbusiness.com}}</ref>

BUTTER uses a search engine and publishes 10,000 new articles a day (11.4 million articles as of March, 2016).<ref name="PRnewswire"/>

BUTTER's platform creates content 30 minutes after stock markets close, monitoring all market movements, new SEC and patent filings, trademarks, and financial and investment decisions.<ref name= "siaa"/>

==Controversies==

NewsRx is staffed by journalists rather than medical professionals.<ref name="AIDS Marketplace"/><ref name="Reading All About It">Fernandes, Manuela. "Reading All About It: Newsletters growing in number, but not all information is reliable." ''Atlanta Journal''. August 16, 1995</ref> At the company's beginnings, ''Newsweek'' magazine commented that ''AIDS Weekly'', as a non-government entity, should not be reporting on topics that included policy, research, and statistics that some{{who|date=October 2015}} considered exclusive to the government.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/> The head of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) AIDS task force at the time was misquoted as stating that he disagreed with having the CDC name associated with the newsweekly.<ref name="Source of News"/> On the contrary, every issue of the ''CDC AIDS Weekly'' included an advisory caption, “…not sponsored by, endorsed by, affiliated with, or officially connected with the CDC.”<ref name="Source of News"/> Other staffers within the CDC supported NewsRx's view to bring AIDS awareness to the public eye.<ref name="Source of News"/> The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that ''AIDS Weekly'' was a necessary “watchdog” publication providing needed information to the public.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/> Other articles appeared supporting NewsRx in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]'', for what they said to be its impact in AIDS awareness and investigative journalism.<ref name="Anniversary Book"/>{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

CW Henderson's role as executive editor at the firm was discussed in an article in ''Editor and Publisher'', focusing on the influence of pharmaceutical companies on news publications.<ref name="Mice and Men">Nicholson, Joe. "Of Mice & Men: Is there too much hype in media's medical stories?." ''Editor and Publisher''. October 3, 1998</ref> Henderson opposed pharmaceutical company influence on reporters as well as premature reporting of experiments.<ref name="Mice and Men"/>

The firm was also involved with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in controversial breaking news about AIDS studies that had purposely been tampered with at the CDC.<ref name="Tampering">{{Cite news |last=Schneider |first=Keith |date=1986-09-17 |title=TAMPERING UNCOVERED AT AIDS RESEARCH LAB |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/us/tampering-uncovered-at-aids-research-lab.html |access-date=2023-02-17 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> On at least 5 occasions, research on the causes of AIDS and other viral diseases might have been tampered with.<ref name="Tampering"/> ''CDC AIDS Weekly'' published an internal CDC memorandum on the incident.<ref name="Tampering"/>

==Partnerships==
In 2011, the firm partnered with [[ScholarlyMedia]]'s [[ScholarlyEditions]] imprint, publishing 4,000 reference books, which replaced the EncyK line.<ref name="ScholarlyEditions Brochure"/> The president of NewsRx is also president of ScholarlyMedia.<ref name="ScholarlyMedia">"ScholarlyEditions."
