'''Algorithmic entities''' are [[autonomous]] [[algorithms]] that operate without [[human]] control. Recently, attention is being given to ''legal algorithmic entities'' that may obtain [[personhood]] or identity for purposes of conducting legal proceedings. Legal analysis demonstrates that this is possible and likely.<ref> https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol95/iss4/7 </ref><ref>Lynn M. LoPucki, ''Algorithmic Entities'', 95 Wash. U. L. Rev. 887 (2018).</ref> The [[European Union]] is considering a case to grant a specific legal status for robots.<ref>

Theoretical work is equating [[intelligent agents]] and robots with algorithmic entities,<ref>Svozil, K. (2000). Quantum interfaces. arXiv preprint quant-ph/0001064</ref> and connecting them with global catastrophic risks associated with [[artificial intelligence]]<ref>Turchin, A., & Denkenberger, D. (2018). ''Classification of global catastrophic risks connected with artificial intelligence''. AI & SOCIETY, 1-17</ref> [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE200/PE237/RAND_PE237.pdf <ref>Osoba, O. A., & Welser IV, W. (2017).

Algorithmic entities can satisfy the requirements of [[juridical person]]hood. [[Shawn Bayern]] demonstrated several ways of how algorithmic/autonomous systems could possess [[private law|private-law]] rights of [[legal person]]s by means of [[limited liability]] companies (LLCs).<ref>Bayern, Shawn, ''The Implications of Modern Business-Entity Law for the Regulation of Autonomous Systems''. 19 Stanford Technology Law Review 93 (2015); FSU College of Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 797; FSU College of Law, Law, Business & Economics Paper No. 797. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2758222</ref><ref>Bayern, Shawn, ''Of Bitcoins, Independently Wealthy Software, and the Zero-Member LLC''. 108 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1485 (2014); 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. Online 257 (2014); FSU College of Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 675. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2366197</ref>

Prof. LoPucki's paper on Algorithmic Entities (reference 1 here) has jumped to the number one spot on [[SSRN]]<ref>https://www.law.ucla.edu/news-and-events/in-the-news/2018/02/fear-of-bot-controlled-corporations-causes-professors-paper-to-jump-to-number-one/ Fear of Bot-Controlled Corporations Causes Professorâ€™s Paper to Jump to #1</ref><ref>http://ssrnblog.com/2018/02/26/weekly-top-5-papers-february-23-2018/</ref> in February 2018.

== Legal Algorithmic Entities ==
Professor Shawn Bayern displayed that any person can bestow legal personhood on an autonomous computer algorithm simply by allowing it to be the sole controller of an LLC.<ref>[https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6319&context=law_lawreview]</ref> By doing this, the algorithm can perform the rights of the LLC, which simultaneously makes them the rights of the algorithm. This then leads to the algorithmic entity having multiple more rights, such as "rights to privacy, to own property, to enter into contracts, to be represented by counsel, to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, to equal protection of the laws, to speak freely, and to spend money on political campaigns."<ref>[https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6319&context=law_lawreview]</ref> Bayern then went on to suggest that once an algorithm has these rights, the entity then also has the rights to bestow similar rights onto other algorithmic entities.
