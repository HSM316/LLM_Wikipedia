'''Huawei LiteOS''' is a lightweight [[real-time operating system]]. It is an open source operating system licensed under a [[BSD licenses|BSD 3-Clause license]] for IoT smart terminals. Microcontrollers of different architectures such as ARM (M0/3/4/7, A7/17/53, ARM9/11), x86, and RISC-V are supported by the project. Huawei LiteOS is part of Huawei's "1+2+1" Internet of Things solution and has been featured in a number of open source development kits and industry offerings.

Huawei LiteOS features lightweight, low-power, fast-response, multi-sensor collaboration, multi-protocol interconnect connectivity, enabling IoT terminals to quickly access the network. Huawei LiteOS will make intelligent hardware development easier, thereby accelerating the realization of the interconnection of all things.

The latest version is V2.1, which was released in May 2018.
