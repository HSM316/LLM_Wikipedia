A '''percept''' is the input that an [[intelligent agent]] is [[Perception|perceiving]] at any given moment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=|isbn=978-0-13-604259-4|edition=3rd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|page=34|pages=}}</ref> It is essentially the same concept as a [[percept]] in [[psychology]], except that it is being perceived not by the [[brain]] but by the agent. A percept is detected by a [[sensor]], often a [[camera]], processed accordingly, and acted upon by an [[actuator]]. Each percept is added to a "percept sequence", which is a complete history of each percept ever detected. The agent's action at any instant point may depend on the entire percept sequence upto that particular instant point. An [[intelligent agent]] chooses how to act not only based on the current percept, but the percept sequence. The next action is chosen by the [[agent function]], which maps every percept to an action.

For example, if a camera were to record a [[gesture]], the agent would process the percepts, calculate the corresponding [[spatial vector]]s, examine its percept history, and use the [[agent program]] (the application of the agent function) to act accordingly.

==Examples==
Examples of percepts include inputs from touch sensors, cameras, infrared sensors, sonar, microphones, mice, and keyboards. A percept can also be a higher-level feature of the data, such as lines, depth, objects, faces, or gestures.<ref> {{cite book
