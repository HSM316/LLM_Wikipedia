'''Mocolo''' is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] video analysis server for [[Microsoft Windows]], mostly used in interactive environments. 
It monitors video streams, finds interactions (presences or movements) and sends analysis results to a list of client applications in form of [[Open Sound Control]] (OSC) packets.
Key features: lightweight performance, capability to analyze several video sources at the same time, connectivity toward any [[Open Sound Control|OSC]] capable application.
Mocolo makes use of small amounts of [[CPU]] time and no use of the [[GPU]], leaving enough resources for other client applications running on the same machine.
