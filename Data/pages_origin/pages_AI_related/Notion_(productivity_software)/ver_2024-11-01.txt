By default, each row will have two pre-populated properties: 'Name' and 'Tags'. Users can add more properties, such as date, checkbox, multi-select, URL, and more. When creating databases, users can choose to either create it 'inline', within an already existing page, or as its own page.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Los |first=Sija |date=2022-12-09 |title=The Only Tutorial You'll Need to Get Your Notion Up and Running |url=https://medium.com/@Ramblingsofa20something/the-only-tutorial-youll-need-to-get-your-notion-up-and-running-1837657bbc5d |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Medium |language=en}}</ref>

Notion users can make and use templates. Notion hosts its own template gallery, where users can browse through templates made by other Notion creators.
