=== Blocks ===
Everything in Notion is made up of blocks. Including text, images, tables, and pages themselves. This allows users to easily customize a page by adding and moving blocks in various ways. In June 2021, Notion released a 'synced block', which is a type of block that, when copied and pasted across different pages in a user's workspace, shows edits between them.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frank |first=Thomas |date=2021-05-10 |title=Notion Blocks: Everything You Need to Know |url=https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-blocks-guide/ |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Thomas Frank |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Databases ===
One of Notion's features is its database. Databases are used for storing information and can hold any number of rows and columns. By default, each row will have two pre-populated properties: 'Name' and 'Tags'. Users can add more properties, such as date, checkbox, multi-select, URL, and more. When creating databases, users can choose to either create it 'inline', within an already existing page, or as its own page.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Los |first=Sija |date=2022-12-09 |title=The Only Tutorial You'll Need to Get Your Notion Up and Running |url=https://medium.com/@Ramblingsofa20something/the-only-tutorial-youll-need-to-get-your-notion-up-and-running-1837657bbc5d |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=Medium |language=en}}</ref>

=== Templates ===
Notion users can make and use templates. Notion hosts its own template gallery, where users can browse through templates made by other Notion creators.

Jason Ruiyi Chen, from Singapore, made $239,000 by selling his Notion templates to his Twitter audience. Thomas Frank, a YouTuber with 2.8 million subscribers as of February 2023, made $1 million in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The YouTuber Making $1 Million Selling Notion 'Templates' |url=https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-youtuber-making-1-million-selling-notion-templates |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=The Information}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Courter |first=Emily |title=I made $239,000 this year selling budgeting and productivity templates online.

=== Notion AI ===
Notion AI uses [[artificial intelligence]], which enables prediction of some results, text generation and solving arithmetic.
