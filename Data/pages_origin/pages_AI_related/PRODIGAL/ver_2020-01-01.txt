'''PRODIGAL''' ('''proactive discovery of insider threats using graph analysis and learning)''' is a computer system for predicting anomalous behavior among humans, by [[data mining]] network traffic such as emails, text messages and [[server log]] entries.<ref name=insidehpc1>{{cite news|url=http://insidehpc.com/2011/11/29/video-interview-darpas-adams-project-taps-big-data-to-find-the-breaking-bad/|title=Video Interview: DARPA's ADAMS Project Taps Big Data to Find the Breaking Bad|publisher=Inside HPC|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> It is part of [[DARPA]]'s [[Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales]] (ADAMS) project.<ref name=brandon>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/03/could-us-government-start-reading-your-emails/|title=Could the U.S. Government Start Reading Your Emails?|first=John|last=Brandon|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref> The initial schedule is for two years and the budget $9&nbsp;million.<ref name=gatech1>{{cite news|url=http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=72599|title=Georgia Tech Helps to Develop System That Will Detect Insider Threats from Massive Data Sets|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

It uses [[graph theory]], [[machine learning]], statistical [[anomaly detection]], and [[high-performance computing]] to scan larger sets of data more quickly than in past systems. The amount of data analyzed is in the range of [[terabyte]]s per day.<ref name=gatech1 /> The targets of the analysis are employees within the government or defense contracting organizations; specific examples of behavior the system is intended to detect include the actions of [[Nidal Malik Hasan]] and [[WikiLeaks]] source [[Chelsea Manning]].<ref name=insidehpc1 /> Commercial applications may include finance.<ref name=insidehpc1 /> The results of the analysis, the five most serious threats per day, go to agents, analysts, and operators working in [[counterintelligence]].<ref name=insidehpc1 /><ref name=gatech1 /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/19382/sifting_through_petabytes_prodigal_monitoring_for_lone_wolf_insider_threats|title=Sifting through petabytes: PRODIGAL monitoring for lone wolf insider threats|first=Darlene|last=Storm|work=[[Computer World]]|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>
