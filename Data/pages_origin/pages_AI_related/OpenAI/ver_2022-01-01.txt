'''OpenAI''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) research laboratory consisting of the for-profit corporation '''OpenAI LP''' and its [[parent company]], the non-profit '''OpenAI Inc.''' The company, considered a competitor to [[DeepMind]], conducts research in the field of AI with the stated goal of promoting and developing [[friendly AI]] in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. The organization was founded in [[San Francisco]] in late 2015 by [[Elon Musk]], [[Sam Altman]], and others, who collectively pledged US$1 billion. Musk resigned from the board in February 2018 but remained a donor. In 2019, OpenAI LP received a {{USD}}1 billion investment from [[Microsoft]].

[[File:Pioneer Building, San Francisco (2019) -1.jpg|thumb|380x380px|The Pioneer Building in San Francisco, housing the offices of OpenAI and Neuralink]]
In December 2015, [[Elon Musk]], [[Sam Altman]], and other investors announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged over {{USD}}1 billion to the venture. The organization stated they would "freely collaborate" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing OpenAI |url=https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/ |website=OpenAI Blog |date=12 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="bbc-giants" />

On April 27, 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym", its platform for [[reinforcement learning]] research.<ref name=":0" />

On December 5, 2016, OpenAI released Universe, a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications<!--AI training ground that spans any software running on any machine, from games to web browsers to protein folders-->.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/openais-universe-computers-learn-use-apps-like-humans/|title=Elon Musk's Lab Wants to Teach Computers to Use Apps Just Like Humans Do|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|publisher=WIRED|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/openais-universe-is-the-fun-parent-every-artificial-intelligence-deserves/|title=OpenAI's Universe is the fun parent every artificial intelligence deserves|last1=Mannes|first1=John|work=TechCrunch|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://universe.openai.com/|title=OpenAI - Universe|language=en-us|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/05/openai_universe_reinforcement_learning/|title=Elon Musk-backed OpenAI reveals Universe – a universal training ground for computers|last1=Claburn|first1=Thomas|website=The Register|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref>

In June 2020, OpenAI announced [[GPT-3]], a language model trained on trillions of words from the Internet. It also announced that an associated [[Application programming interface|API]], named simply "the API", would form the heart of its first commercial product. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering of questions, but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text.<ref name="2020-06-11_Bloomberg">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/trillions-of-words-analyzed-openai-sets-loose-ai-language-colossus |title=Trillions of Words Analyzed, OpenAI Sets Loose AI Language Colossus |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |date=2020-06-11 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref>

The group started in early January 2016 with nine researchers. According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Brockman met with [[Yoshua Bengio]], one of the "founding fathers" of the [[deep learning]] movement, and drew up a list of the "best researchers in the field". Microsoft's [[Peter Lee (computer scientist)|Peter Lee]] stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback prospect. While OpenAI pays corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, it doesn't currently pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google. Nevertheless, Sutskever stated that he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI "partly of because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission." Brockman stated that "the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way." OpenAI researcher [[Wojciech Zaremba]] stated that he turned down "borderline crazy" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.<ref name=wired_inside />

==Motives==
Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], have articulated concerns that if advanced AI someday gains the ability to re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable "[[intelligence explosion]]" could lead to [[human extinction]]. Musk characterizes AI as humanity's "biggest existential threat."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Piper |first1=Kelsey |title=Why Elon Musk fears artificial intelligence |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18053418/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-openai |access-date=10 March 2021 |work=Vox |date=2 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref> OpenAI's founders structured it as a non-profit so that they could focus its research on creating a positive long-term human impact.<ref name=bbc-giants>{{cite news|title=Tech giants pledge $1bn for 'altruistic AI' venture, OpenAI|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344|access-date=19 December 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 December 2015}}</ref>

Musk and Altman have stated they are motivated in part by concerns about the [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].<ref name=csmonitor>{{cite news|last1=Lewontin|first1=Max|title=Open AI: Effort to democratize artificial intelligence research?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2015/1214/Open-AI-Effort-to-democratize-artificial-intelligence-research|access-date=19 December 2015|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=14 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=wired_inside /> OpenAI states that "it's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society," and that it is equally difficult to comprehend "how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly".<ref name=bbc-giants/> Research on safety cannot safely be postponed: "because of AI's surprising history, it's hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jessica|title=Tech leaders launch nonprofit to save the world from killer robots|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1214/Tech-leaders-launch-nonprofit-to-save-the-world-from-killer-robots|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref> OpenAI states that AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible...",<ref name=bbc-giants/> and which sentiment has been expressed elsewhere in reference to a potentially enormous class of AI-enabled products: "Are we really willing to let our society be infiltrated by autonomous software and hardware agents whose details of operation are known only to a select few?

[[Vishal Sikka]], former CEO of [[Infosys]], stated that an "openness" where the endeavor would "produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity" was a fundamental requirement for his support, and that OpenAI "aligns very nicely with our long-held values" and their "endeavor to do purposeful work".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vishal Sikka|title=OpenAI: AI for All|url=http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|website=InfyTalk|publisher=[[Infosys]]|access-date=22 December 2015|date=14 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094518/http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|archive-date=22 December 2015|author1-link=Vishal Sikka}}</ref> Cade Metz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' suggests that corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] may be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] that own enormous supplies of proprietary data.

In 2019, OpenAI became a for profit company called OpenAI LP to secure additional funding while staying controlled by a non-profit called OpenAI Inc in a structure that OpenAI calls "capped-profit",<ref name=capped-profit>{{Cite web |url= http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/ |title=OpenAI shifts from nonprofit to 'capped-profit' to attract capital |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> having previously been a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]].<ref name="medium">{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a |title=How Elon Musk and Y Combinator Plan to Stop Computers From Taking Over |first1=Steven |last1=Levy |date=December 11, 2015 |publisher=[[Medium (publishing platform)|Medium]]/[[Backchannel (blog)|Backchannel]] |access-date=December 11, 2015 |quote="Elon Musk: ...we came to the conclusion that having a 501(c)(3)... would probably be a good thing to do"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= https://twitter.com/gdb/status/848938670878900224 |title=Yes, we're a 501(c)(3).

==Strategy==
Musk posed the question: "what is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity." Musk acknowledged that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; nonetheless, the best defense is "to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."<ref name="seattle-investors">{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley investors to bankroll artificial-intelligence center|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|access-date=19 December 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=13 December 2015}}</ref>

Musk and Altman's counter-intuitive strategy of trying to reduce the risk that AI will cause overall harm, by giving AI to everyone, is controversial among those who are concerned with [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk from artificial intelligence]]. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] is skeptical of Musk's approach: "If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone."<ref name=wired_inside>{{cite news|author1=Cade Metz|title=Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk's Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|access-date=28 April 2016|work=[[Wired magazine]]|date=27 April 2016|language=en-US}}</ref> During a 2016 conversation about the technological singularity, Altman said that "we don't plan to release all of our source code" and mentioned a plan to "allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board". Greg Brockman stated that "Our goal right now... is to do the best thing there is to do. It's a little vague."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sam Altman's Manifest Destiny|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|access-date=4 October 2016|work=The New Yorker|issue=10 October 2016}}</ref>

Conversely, OpenAI's initial decision to withhold [[GPT-2]] due to a wish to "err on the side of caution" in the presence of potential misuse, has been criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated "I don't think {{bracket|OpenAI}} spent enough time proving {{bracket|GPT-2}} was actually dangerous." Other critics argued that open publication is necessary to replicate the research and to be able to come up with countermeasures.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=AI researchers debate the ethics of sharing potentially harmful programs |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234500/ai-ethics-debate-researchers-harmful-programs-openai |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=The Verge |date=21 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

In the 2017 tax year, OpenAI spent US$7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.<ref>{{cite news |title=Microsoft to invest $1 billion in OpenAI |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-openai/microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-openai-idUSKCN1UH1H9 |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=Reuters |date=22 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In comparison, DeepMind's total expenses in 2017 were much larger, measuring US$442 million. In Summer 2018, simply training OpenAI's ''Dota 2'' bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks. According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model adopted in March 2019 allows OpenAI LP to legally attract investment from venture funds, and in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company, the goal being that they can say "I'm going to Open AI, but in the long term it's not going to be disadvantageous to us as a family."<ref name="wired investors">{{cite news |title=To Compete With Google, OpenAI Seeks Investors–and Profits |url=https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/ |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=Wired |date=3 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Many top researchers work for [[Google Brain]], DeepMind, or [[Facebook, Inc.]], which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.<ref name="bloomberg arm">{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Jeremy |title=AI Research Group Co-Founded by Elon Musk Starts For-Profit Arm |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/ai-research-group-co-founded-by-musk-starts-for-profit-arm |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=11 March 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, OpenAI LP raised a billion dollars from [[Microsoft]], a sum which OpenAI plans to have spent "within five years, and possibly much faster".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murgia |first1=Madhumita |title=DeepMind runs up higher losses and debts in race for AI |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d4280856-b92d-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need "more capital than any non-profit has ever raised" to achieve AGI.<ref>{{cite news |title=OpenAI Will Need More Capital Than Any Non-Profit Has Ever Raised |url=https://fortune.com/2019/10/03/openai-will-need-more-capital-than-any-non-profit-has-ever-raised/ |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=Fortune |language=en}}</ref>

The transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by [[Oren Etzioni]] of the nonprofit [[Allen Institute for AI]], who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult, but stated "I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can't compete" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. "If bigger and better funded was always better, then [[IBM]] would still be number one." Following the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI LP is no longer legally required. The nonprofit, OpenAI Inc., is the sole [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]] of OpenAI LP. OpenAI LP, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary responsibility]] to OpenAI's Inc.'s nonprofit charter. A majority of OpenAI Inc.'s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI LP.<ref name="wired investors"/> In addition, minority members with a stake in OpenAI LP are barred from certain votes due to [[conflict of interest]].<ref name="bloomberg arm"/> Some researchers have argued that OpenAI LP's switch to for-profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI's claims to be "democratizing" AI.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=Microsoft invests $1 billion in OpenAI to pursue holy grail of artificial intelligence |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=[[The Verge]] |date=22 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref> A journalist in [[Vice News]] wrote that "generally, we've never been able to rely on venture capitalists to better humanity".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Haskins |first1=Caroline |title=OpenAI's Mission to Benefit Humanity Now Includes Seeking Profit |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzdyme/openais-mission-to-benefit-humanity-now-includes-seeking-profit |access-date=6 March 2020 |work=[[Vice News]] |date=12 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

Through this adversarial learning process, the agents learn how to adapt to changing conditions; when an agent is then removed from this virtual environment and placed in a new virtual environment with high winds, the agent braces to remain upright, suggesting it had learned how to balance in a generalized way.<ref>{{cite news|title=AI Sumo Wrestlers Could Make Future Robots More Nimble|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-sumo-wrestlers-could-make-future-robots-more-nimble/|access-date=2 November 2017|work=Wired|date=11 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=OpenAI's Goofy Sumo-Wrestling Bots Are Smarter Than They Look|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609117/openais-goofy-sumo-wrestling-bots-are-smarter-than-they-look/|access-date=2 November 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref> OpenAI's Igor Mordatch argues that competition between agents can create an intelligence "arms race" that can increase an agent's ability to function, even outside the context of the competition.

GPT-2's authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and [[perplexity]] on 7 of 8 [[One-shot learning|zero-shot]] tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples). The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text from URLs shared in [[Reddit]] submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using [[byte pair encoding]]. This allows to represent any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens.<ref name="gpt2">{{cite journal |title=Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners |url=https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

First, commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts. Second, many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run. This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology. We’re hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Third, the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology. Since it is hard to predict the downstream use cases of our models, it feels inherently safer to release them via an API and broaden access over time, rather than release an [[open source]] model where access cannot be adjusted if it turns out to have harmful applications."

DALL-E is a Transformer model that creates images from textual descriptions, revealed by OpenAI in January 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/|title=DALL·E: Creating Images from Text}}</ref> 

CLIP does the opposite: it creates a description for a given image.<ref>{{cite web |title=CLIP: Connecting Text and Images |url=https://openai.com/blog/clip/}}</ref> DALL-E uses a 12-billion-parameter version of GPT-3 to interpret natural language inputs (such as "a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon" or "an isometric view of a sad capybara") and generate corresponding images. It is able to create images of realistic objects ("a stained glass window with an image of a blue strawberry") as well as objects that do not exist in reality ("a cube with the texture of a porcupine"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available.

In March 2021 OpenAI released a paper, titled ''Multimodal Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Multimodal Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks |url=https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/}}</ref> where they showed detailed analysis of CLIP (and  GPT) models and their vulnerabilities. The new type of attacks on such models was described in this work.

{{Quote
