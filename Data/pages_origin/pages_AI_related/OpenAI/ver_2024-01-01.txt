"If bigger and better funded was always better, then [[IBM]] would still be number one."

The nonprofit, OpenAI, Inc., is the sole [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]] of OpenAI Global LLC, which, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary responsibility]] to OpenAI, Inc.'s nonprofit charter.

[[Vishal Sikka]], the former CEO of Infosys, stated that an "openness" where the endeavor would "produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity" was a fundamental requirement for his support, and that OpenAI "aligns very nicely with our long-held values" and their "endeavor to do purposeful work".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vishal Sikka|title=OpenAI: AI for All|url=http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|website=InfyTalk|publisher=[[Infosys]]|access-date=December 22, 2015|date=December 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094518/http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|archive-date=December 22, 2015|author1-link=Vishal Sikka}}</ref> Cade Metz of ''Wired'' suggests that corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] may be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook which own enormous supplies of proprietary data.

== Strategy ==
In the early years before his 2018 departure, Musk posed the question: "What is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity." Musk acknowledged that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; nonetheless, the best defense is "to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."<ref name="seattle-investors">{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley investors to bankroll artificial-intelligence center|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|access-date=December 19, 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 13, 2015|archive-date=January 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105181552/http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Musk and Altman's counter-intuitive strategy of trying to reduce the risk that AI will cause overall harm, by giving AI to everyone, is controversial among those who are concerned with existential risk from artificial intelligence. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] is skeptical of Musk's approach: "If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone."<ref name=wired_inside>{{cite magazine|author1=Cade Metz|title=Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk's Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|access-date=April 28, 2016|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=April 27, 2016|language=en-US|archive-date=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427162700/http://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|url-status=live}}</ref> During a 2016 conversation about [[technological singularity]], Altman said "we don't plan to release all of our source code" and mentioned a plan to "allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board".

Conversely, OpenAI's initial decision to withhold GPT-2 around 2019, due to a wish to "err on the side of caution" in the presence of potential misuse was criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated "I don't think {{bracket|OpenAI}} spent enough time proving {{bracket|GPT-2}} was actually dangerous." Other critics argued that open publication is necessary to replicate the research and to be able to come up with countermeasures.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=AI researchers debate the ethics of sharing potentially harmful programs |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234500/ai-ethics-debate-researchers-harmful-programs-openai |access-date=March 6, 2020 |work=The Verge |date=February 21, 2019 |language=en |archive-date=February 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209123243/https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234500/ai-ethics-debate-researchers-harmful-programs-openai |url-status=live }}</ref>

More recently, in 2022, OpenAI published its approach to the [[AI alignment|alignment problem]]. They expect that aligning [[Artificial general intelligence|AGI]] to human values is likely harder than aligning current AI systems: "Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together". They explore how to better use human feedback to train AI systems.

=== Debate Game ===
In 2018, OpenAI launched the Debate Game, which teaches machines to debate [[toy problem]]s in front of a human judge. The purpose is to research whether such an approach may assist in auditing AI decisions and in developing [[Explainable artificial intelligence|explainable AI]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/05/04/openais-debate-game-teaches-you-and-your-friends-how-to-lie-like-robots/|title=OpenAI's Debate Game teaches you and your friends how to lie like robots|last=Greene|first=Tristan|date=May 4, 2018|work=The Next Web|access-date=May 31, 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505005129/https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/05/04/openais-debate-game-teaches-you-and-your-friends-how-to-lie-like-robots/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Why Scientists Think AI Systems Should Debate Each Other |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40569116/why-scientists-think-ai-systems-should-debate-each-other |access-date=June 2, 2018 |work=Fast Company |date=May 8, 2018 |archive-date=May 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519140829/https://www.fastcompany.com/40569116/why-scientists-think-ai-systems-should-debate-each-other |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Dactyl ===
Developed in 2018, Dactyl uses machine learning to train a [[Shadow Hand]], a human-like robot hand, to manipulate physical objects.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vincent |first=James |date=July 30, 2018 |title=OpenAI sets new benchmark for robot dexterity |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17621112/openai-robot-dexterity-dactyl-artificial-intelligence |access-date=February 12, 2023 |website=The Verge |language=en-US |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212152342/https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17621112/openai-robot-dexterity-dactyl-artificial-intelligence |url-status=live }}</ref> It learns entirely in simulation using the same RL algorithms and training code as [[#OpenAI Five|OpenAI Five]]. OpenAI tackled the object orientation problem by using [[domain randomization]], a simulation approach which exposes the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality. The set-up for Dactyl, aside from having motion tracking cameras, also has [[RGB color model|RGB]] cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it. In 2018, OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author=OpenAI |last2=Andrychowicz |first2=Marcin |last3=Baker |first3=Bowen |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Józefowicz |first5=Rafał |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Pachocki |first7=Jakub |last8=Petron |first8=Arthur |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ray |first11=Alex |last12=Schneider |first12=Jonas |last13=Sidor |first13=Szymon |last14=Tobin |first14=Josh |last15=Welinder |first15=Peter |last16=Weng |first16=Lilian |last17=Zaremba |first17=Wojciech |year=2019 |title=Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation |eprint=1808.00177v5 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>

In 2019, OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a [[Rubik's Cube]]. The robot was able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time. Objects like the Rubik's Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model. OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments. ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author1=OpenAI |last2=Akkaya |first2=Ilge |last3=Andrychowicz |first3=Marcin |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Litwin |first5=Mateusz |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Petron |first7=Arthur |last8=Paino |first8=Alex |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ribas |first11=Raphael |year=2019 |title=Solving Rubik's Cube with a Robot Hand |eprint=1910.07113v1 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>

[[File:GPT2-talks-about-GPT2.png|right|thumb|An instance of GPT-2 writing a paragraph based on a prompt from its own Wikipedia article in February 2021]]
Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ("GPT-2") is an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]] [[language model]] and the successor to OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1"). GPT-2 was announced in February 2019, with only limited demonstrative versions initially released to the public.

GPT-2's authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and [[perplexity]] on 7 of 8 [[Zero-shot learning|zero-shot]] tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples).

The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 gigabytes of text from [[URL]]s shared in [[Reddit]] submissions with at least 3 [[upvotes]]. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using [[byte pair encoding]]. This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens.<ref name="gpt2">{{citation |title=Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners |url=https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |access-date=December 4, 2019 |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212223916/https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

First, commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts. Second, many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run. This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology. We're hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Third, the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology.

It can create images of realistic objects ("a stained-glass window with an image of a blue strawberry") as well as objects that do not exist in reality ("a cube with the texture of a porcupine"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available.

==Controversies==
In January 2023, OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the annotation of [[data set]]s including toxic{{Definition needed|date=November 2023}} content to [[Sama (company)|Sama]], a company based in San Francisco but employing workers in [[Kenya]]. These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to filter out toxic content, notably from ChatGPT's training data and outputs. But these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The four Sama employees interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators. Sama's spokesperson said that the $12.50 was also covering other implicit costs, among which were infrastructure expenses, quality assurance and management.<ref name="Time1">{{cite magazine |last1=Perrigo |first1=Billy |title=Exclusive: The $2 Per Hour Workers Who Made ChatGPT Safer |url=https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/ |access-date=5 August 2023 |magazine=Time |date=18 January 2023 |language=en |archive-date=January 19, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119152814/https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2023, the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, which goes against its initial commitment to openness and makes it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and to develop safeguards. OpenAI justified this strategic turn by competitiveness and safety reasons. OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models is increasingly risky, expecting that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models will be "obvious" in a few years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=OpenAI co-founder on company's past approach to openly sharing research: "We were wrong" |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview |access-date=20 August 2023 |work=[[The Verge]] |date=15 March 2023 |archive-date=March 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317210900/https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview |url-status=live }}</ref>
