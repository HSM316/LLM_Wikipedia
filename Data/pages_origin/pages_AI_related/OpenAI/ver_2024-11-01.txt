The transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by [[Oren Etzioni]] of the nonprofit [[Allen Institute for AI]], who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult, but stated "I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can't compete" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. "If bigger and better funded was always better, then [[IBM]] would still be number one."

The nonprofit, OpenAI, Inc., is the sole [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]] of OpenAI Global, LLC, which, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary responsibility]] to OpenAI, Inc.'s nonprofit charter.

In October 2024, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion from investors, potentially valuing the company at $157 billion and solidifying its status as one of the most valuable private firms globally.

== Motives ==
Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], have articulated concerns that if advanced AI gains the ability to redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable "[[intelligence explosion]]" could lead to [[human extinction]]. Co-founder [[Elon Musk|Musk]] characterizes AI as humanity's "biggest existential threat".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Piper |first1=Kelsey |title=Why Elon Musk fears artificial intelligence |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18053418/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-openai |access-date=March 10, 2021 |work=Vox |date=November 2, 2018 |language=en |archive-date=April 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423095445/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18053418/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-openai |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Vishal Sikka]], former CEO of Infosys, stated that an "openness", where the endeavor would "produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity", was a fundamental requirement for his support; and that OpenAI "aligns very nicely with our long-held values" and their "endeavor to do purposeful work".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vishal Sikka|title=OpenAI: AI for All|url=http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|website=InfyTalk|publisher=[[Infosys]]|access-date=December 22, 2015|date=December 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094518/http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|archive-date=December 22, 2015|author1-link=Vishal Sikka}}</ref> Cade Metz of ''Wired'' suggested that corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] might be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as Google and Facebook, which own enormous supplies of proprietary data. Altman stated that Y Combinator companies would share their data with OpenAI.<ref name=wired_far_more/>

== Strategy ==
In the early years before his 2018 departure, Musk posed the question: "What is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity." He acknowledged that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; but nonetheless, that the best defense was "to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."<ref name="seattle-investors">{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley investors to bankroll artificial-intelligence center|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|access-date=December 19, 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 13, 2015|archive-date=January 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105181552/http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Musk and Altman's counterintuitive strategy—that of trying to reduce of harm from AI by giving everyone access to it—is controversial among those concerned with existential risk from AI. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] said, "If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone."<ref name=wired_inside>{{cite magazine|author1=Cade Metz|title=Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk's Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|access-date=April 28, 2016|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=April 27, 2016|language=en-US|archive-date=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427162700/http://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|url-status=live}}</ref> During a 2016 conversation about [[technological singularity]], Altman said, "We don't plan to release all of our source code" and mentioned a plan to "allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board". Greg Brockman stated, "Our goal right now... is to do the best thing there is to do. It's a little vague."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Sam Altman's Manifest Destiny|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|access-date=October 4, 2016|magazine=The New Yorker|issue=October 10, 2016|archive-date=October 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004091200/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|url-status=live}}</ref>

Conversely, OpenAI's initial decision to withhold GPT-2 around 2019, due to a wish to "err on the side of caution" in the presence of potential misuse, was criticized by advocates of openness. Delip Rao, an expert in text generation, stated, "I don't think {{bracket|OpenAI}} spent enough time proving {{bracket|GPT-2}} was actually dangerous." Other critics argued that open publication was necessary to replicate the research and to create countermeasures.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=AI researchers debate the ethics of sharing potentially harmful programs |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234500/ai-ethics-debate-researchers-harmful-programs-openai |access-date=March 6, 2020 |work=The Verge |date=February 21, 2019 |language=en |archive-date=February 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209123243/https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234500/ai-ethics-debate-researchers-harmful-programs-openai |url-status=live }}</ref>

More recently, in 2022, OpenAI published its approach to the [[AI alignment|alignment problem]], anticipating that aligning [[Artificial general intelligence|AGI]] to human values would likely be harder than aligning current AI systems: "Unaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity[,] and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together". They stated that they intended to explore how to better use human feedback to train AI systems, and how to safely use AI to incrementally automate alignment research.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our approach to alignment research |url=https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research |access-date=April 26, 2023 |website=openai.com |language=en-US |archive-date=April 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426111006/https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research |url-status=live }}</ref> Some observers believe the company's November 2023 reorganization—including Altman's return as CEO, and the changes to its board of directors—indicated a probable shift towards a business focus and reduced influence of "cautious people" at OpenAI.<ref name="NYT_2023_11_22">{{Cite news |last1=Sorkin |first1=Andrew Ross |author-link=Andrew Ross Sorkin |last2=Mattu |first2=Ravi |last3=Warner |first3=Bernhard |last4=Kessler |first4=Sarah |last5=Merced |first5=Michael J. de la |last6=Hirsch |first6=Lauren |last7=Livni |first7=Ephrat |date=November 22, 2023 |title=The Fallout From Sam Altman's Return to OpenAI |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/business/dealbook/openai-altman-microsoft-board.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217010304/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/business/dealbook/openai-altman-microsoft-board.html |archive-date=December 17, 2023 |access-date=February 17, 2024 |work=[[The New York Times]] |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==== Dactyl ====
Developed in 2018, Dactyl uses machine learning to train a [[Shadow Hand]], a human-like robot hand, to manipulate physical objects.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vincent |first=James |date=July 30, 2018 |title=OpenAI sets new benchmark for robot dexterity |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17621112/openai-robot-dexterity-dactyl-artificial-intelligence |access-date=February 12, 2023 |website=The Verge |language=en-US |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212152342/https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17621112/openai-robot-dexterity-dactyl-artificial-intelligence |url-status=live }}</ref> It learns entirely in simulation using the same RL algorithms and training code as [[#OpenAI Five|OpenAI Five]]. OpenAI tackled the object orientation problem by using [[domain randomization]], a simulation approach which exposes the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality. The set-up for Dactyl, aside from having motion tracking cameras, also has [[RGB color model|RGB]] cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it. In 2018, OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author=OpenAI |last2=Andrychowicz |first2=Marcin |last3=Baker |first3=Bowen |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Józefowicz |first5=Rafał |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Pachocki |first7=Jakub |last8=Petron |first8=Arthur |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ray |first11=Alex |last12=Schneider |first12=Jonas |last13=Sidor |first13=Szymon |last14=Tobin |first14=Josh |last15=Welinder |first15=Peter |last16=Weng |first16=Lilian |last17=Zaremba |first17=Wojciech |year=2019 |title=Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation |eprint=1808.00177v5 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>

In 2019, OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a [[Rubik's Cube]]. The robot was able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time. Objects like the Rubik's Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model. OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments. ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges.<ref>{{cite arXiv |author1=OpenAI |last2=Akkaya |first2=Ilge |last3=Andrychowicz |first3=Marcin |last4=Chociej |first4=Maciek |last5=Litwin |first5=Mateusz |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Petron |first7=Arthur |last8=Paino |first8=Alex |last9=Plappert |first9=Matthias |last10=Powell |first10=Glenn |last11=Ribas |first11=Raphael |year=2019 |title=Solving Rubik's Cube with a Robot Hand |eprint=1910.07113v1 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>

[[File:GPT2-talks-about-GPT2.png|right|thumb|An instance of GPT-2 writing a paragraph based on a prompt from its own Wikipedia article in February 2021]]
Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ("GPT-2") is an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]] [[language model]] and the successor to OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1").

GPT-2's authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and [[perplexity]] on 7 of 8 [[Zero-shot learning|zero-shot]] tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples).

The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly 40 gigabytes of text from [[URL]]s shared in [[Reddit]] submissions with at least 3 [[upvotes]]. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using [[byte pair encoding]]. This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens.<ref name="gpt2">{{citation |title=Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners |url=https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |access-date=December 4, 2019 |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212223916/https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

First, commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts. Second, many of the models underlying the API are very large, taking a lot of expertise to develop and deploy and making them very expensive to run. This makes it hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology. We're hopeful that the API will make powerful AI systems more accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Third, the API model allows us to more easily respond to misuse of the technology.

=== Content moderation contract with Sama ===
{{Broader|Content moderation and working conditions}}
In January 2023, OpenAI has been criticized for outsourcing the [[Labeled data|annotation of data sets]] to [[Sama (company)|Sama]], a company based in San Francisco that employed workers in [[Kenya]]. These annotations were used to train an AI model to detect toxicity, which could then be used to [[Content moderation|moderate toxic content]], notably from ChatGPT's training data and outputs. However, these pieces of text usually contained detailed descriptions of various types of violence, including sexual violence. The investigation uncovered that OpenAI began sending snippets of data to Sama as early as November 2021. The four Sama employees interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described themselves as mentally scarred. OpenAI paid Sama $12.50 per hour of work, and Sama was redistributing the equivalent of between $1.32 and $2.00 per hour post-tax to its annotators. Sama's spokesperson said that the $12.50 was also covering other implicit costs, among which were infrastructure expenses, quality assurance and management.<ref name="Time1">{{cite magazine |last1=Perrigo |first1=Billy |title=Exclusive: The $2 Per Hour Workers Who Made ChatGPT Safer |url=https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/ |access-date=August 5, 2023 |magazine=Time |date=January 18, 2023 |language=en |archive-date=January 19, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119152814/https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Lack of technological transparency ===
In March 2023, the company was also criticized for disclosing particularly few technical details about products like GPT-4, contradicting its initial commitment to openness and making it harder for independent researchers to replicate its work and develop safeguards. OpenAI cited competitiveness and safety concerns to justify this strategic turn. OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever argued in 2023 that open-sourcing increasingly capable models was increasingly risky, and that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models would become "obvious" in a few years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=OpenAI co-founder on company's past approach to openly sharing research: "We were wrong" |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview |access-date=August 20, 2023 |work=[[The Verge]] |date=March 15, 2023 |archive-date=March 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317210900/https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2021, OpenAI developed a [[speech recognition]] tool called Whisper. OpenAI used it to transcribe more than one million hours of YouTube videos into text for training GPT-4. The automated transcription of YouTube videos raised concerns within OpenAI employees regarding potential violations of YouTube's terms of service, which prohibit the use of videos for applications independent of the platform, as well as any type of automated access to its videos. Despite these concerns, the project proceeded with notable involvement from OpenAI's president, [[Greg Brockman]].

In April 2023, the EU's [[European Data Protection Board]] (EDPB) formed a dedicated task force on ChatGPT "to foster cooperation and to exchange information on possible enforcement actions conducted by data protection authorities" based on the "enforcement action undertaken by the Italian data protection authority against Open AI about the Chat GPT service".<ref>{{cite web |title=EDPB resolves dispute on transfers by Meta and creates task force on Chat GPT |url=https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-resolves-dispute-transfers-meta-and-creates-task-force-chat-gpt_en |website=EDPB resolves dispute on transfers by Meta and creates task force on Chat GPT |access-date=November 22, 2023 |archive-date=November 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231122215754/https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/edpb-resolves-dispute-transfers-meta-and-creates-task-force-chat-gpt_en |url-status=live }}</ref>

In late April 2024 [[NOYB]] filed a complaint with the [[Austria]]n Datenschutzbehörde against OpenAI for violating the European [[General Data Protection Regulation]]. A text created with ChatGPT gave a false [[date of birth]] for a living person without giving the individual the option to see the personal data used in the process. A request to correct the mistake was denied. Additionally, neither the recipients of ChatGPT's work nor the sources used, could be made available, OpenAI claimed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ChatGPT verbreitet falsche Infos über Personen – und OpenAI kann nichts tun |url=https://noyb.eu/de/chatgpt-provides-false-information-about-people-and-openai-cant-correct-it |access-date=April 29, 2024 |website=noyb.eu |archive-date=April 29, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240429054826/https://noyb.eu/de/chatgpt-provides-false-information-about-people-and-openai-cant-correct-it |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Removal of military and warfare clause ===
OpenAI quietly deleted its ban on using ChatGPT for "military and warfare". Up until January 10, 2024, its "usage policies" included a ban on "activity that has high risk of physical harm, including," specifically, "weapons development" and "military and warfare." Its new policies prohibit "[using] our service to harm yourself or others" and to "develop or use weapons".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/open-ai-military-ban-chatgpt/ | title=OpenAI Quietly Deletes Ban on Using ChatGPT for "Military and Warfare" | date=January 12, 2024 | access-date=January 13, 2024 | archive-date=January 25, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240125091034/https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/open-ai-military-ban-chatgpt/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=January 16, 2024 |title=OpenAI Is Working With US Military on Cybersecurity Tools |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/openai-working-with-us-military-on-cybersecurity-tools-for-veterans |access-date=January 23, 2024 |work=Bloomberg.com |language=en |archive-date=January 26, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240126131713/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/openai-working-with-us-military-on-cybersecurity-tools-for-veterans |url-status=live }}</ref> As one of the industry collaborators, OpenAI provides LLM to the Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) sponsored by [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and [[Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health]] to protect software critical to Americans.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OpenAI {{!}} AIxCC |url=https://aicyberchallenge.com/openai/ |website=Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge |access-date=March 30, 2024 |archive-date=March 30, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240330202438/https://aicyberchallenge.com/openai/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 2024, The Intercept revealed that OpenAI's tools are considered "essential" for [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]]'s mission and included in an "Exception to Fair Opportunity" contractural agreement between the Department of Defence and Microsoft.<ref name="intercept-africom" />

In May 2024, OpenAI removed accounts used by state-backed [[influence operations]] such as China's [[Spamouflage]] and Russia's [[Doppelganger (disinformation campaign)|Doppelganger]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bond |first=Shannon |date=May 30, 2024 |title=In a first, OpenAI removes influence operations tied to Russia, China and Israel |url=https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1670/openai-influence-operations-china-russia-israel |access-date=May 30, 2024 |work=[[NPR]] |archive-date=May 30, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240530183810/https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1670/openai-influence-operations-china-russia-israel |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Bergengruen |first=Vera |date=May 30, 2024 |title=OpenAI Says Russia, China, and Israel Are Using Its Tools for Foreign Influence Campaigns |url=https://time.com/6983903/openai-foreign-influence-campaigns-artificial-intelligence/ |access-date=July 11, 2024 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |language=en |archive-date=July 11, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711014517/https://time.com/6983903/openai-foreign-influence-campaigns-artificial-intelligence/ |url-status=live }}</ref> OpenAI banned access to its services from China in July 2024.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last= |first= |date=June 26, 2024 |title=How OpenAI Leaving China Will Reshape the Country's AI Scene |url=https://time.com/6992026/openai-china-ai/ |access-date=July 11, 2024 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |language=en |archive-date=July 11, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711014517/https://time.com/6992026/openai-china-ai/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Data scraping ===
In June 2023, a lawsuit claimed that OpenAI scraped 300 billion words online without consent and without registering as a data broker. It was filed in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], by sixteen anonymous plaintiffs. They also claimed that OpenAI and its partner as well as customer [[Microsoft]] continued to unlawfully collect and use personal data from millions of consumers worldwide to train artificial intelligence models.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Xiang |first1=Chloe |title=OpenAI and Microsoft Sued for $3 Billion Over Alleged ChatGPT 'Privacy Violations' |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjxgx/openai-and-microsoft-sued-for-dollar3-billion-over-alleged-chatgpt-privacy-violations |work=Vice |date=June 29, 2023 |language=en |access-date=July 13, 2024 |archive-date=July 13, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240713042222/https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjxgx/openai-and-microsoft-sued-for-dollar3-billion-over-alleged-chatgpt-privacy-violations |url-status=live }}</ref>
