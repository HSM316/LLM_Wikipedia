== History ==
In October 2015, Musk, Altman and other investors announced the formation of the organization, pledging over {{USD}}1 billion to the venture.<ref name="bbc-giants" />

On April 27, 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym", its platform for [[reinforcement learning]] research.<ref name=":0" />

On December 5, 2016, OpenAI released Universe, a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications<!--AI training ground that spans any software running on any machine, from games to web browsers to protein folders-->.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/openais-universe-computers-learn-use-apps-like-humans/|title=Elon Musk's Lab Wants to Teach Computers to Use Apps Just Like Humans Do|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/openais-universe-is-the-fun-parent-every-artificial-intelligence-deserves/|title=OpenAI's Universe is the fun parent every artificial intelligence deserves|last1=Mannes|first1=John|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://universe.openai.com/|title=OpenAI - Universe|language=en-us|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/05/openai_universe_reinforcement_learning/|title=Elon Musk-backed OpenAI reveals Universe – a universal training ground for computers|last1=Claburn|first1=Thomas|website=The Register|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref> 

On February 21, 2018, Musk resigned his board seat, citing “a potential future conflict (of interest)” with [[Tesla Autopilot|Tesla AI development for self driving cars]], but remained a donor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17036214/elon-musk-openai-ai-safety-leaves-board|title=Elon Musk leaves board of AI safety group to avoid conflict of interest with Tesla|first=James|last=Vincent|date=February 21, 2018|website=The Verge}}</ref>

As of 2018, OpenAI is headquartered in [[Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Mission District]], sharing an office building with [[Neuralink]], another company co-founded by Musk.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-neuralink-sought-to-open-an-animal-testing-f-1823167674|title=Elon Musk's Neuralink Sought to Open an Animal Testing Facility in San Francisco|last=Conger|first=Kate|date=|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

The group started in early January 2016 with nine researchers. According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Brockman met with [[Yoshua Bengio]], one of the “founding fathers” of the [[deep learning]] movement, and drew up a list of the “best researchers in the field”. Microsoft's [[Peter Lee (computer scientist)|Peter Lee]] stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback prospect. While OpenAI pays corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, it doesn't currently pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google. Nevertheless, Sutskever stated that he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI “partly of because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.” Brockman stated that “the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.” OpenAI researcher [[Wojciech Zaremba]] stated that he turned down “borderline crazy” offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.<ref name=wired_inside />

==Motives==
Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], believed that if advanced AI someday gains the ability to re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate, an unstoppable "[[intelligence explosion]]" could lead to [[human extinction]].  Musk characterizes AI as humanity's "biggest existential threat."<ref>{{Citation|last=Anthony Patch|title=Elon Musk Artificial Intelligence could be our biggest existential threat 720p|date=2018-03-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjcifdMg6s4|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> OpenAI's founders structured it as a non-profit so that they could focus its research on creating a positive long-term human impact.<ref name=bbc-giants>{{cite news|title=Tech giants pledge $1bn for 'altruistic AI' venture, OpenAI|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344|accessdate=19 December 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 December 2015}}</ref>

OpenAI states that "it's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society," and that it is equally difficult to comprehend "how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly".<ref name=bbc-giants/> Research on safety cannot safely be postponed: "because of AI's surprising history, it's hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jessica|title=Tech leaders launch nonprofit to save the world from killer robots|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1214/Tech-leaders-launch-nonprofit-to-save-the-world-from-killer-robots|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref> OpenAI states that AI “should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible...”,<ref name=bbc-giants/> and which sentiment has been expressed elsewhere in reference to a potentially enormous class of AI-enabled products: "Are we really willing to let our society be infiltrated by autonomous software and hardware agents whose details of operation are known only to a select few? Of course not."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Glenn W.

[[Vishal Sikka]], former CEO of [[Infosys]], stated that an “openness” where the endeavor would “produce results generally in the greater interest of humanity” was a fundamental requirement for his support, and that OpenAI “aligns very nicely with our long-held values” and their “endeavor to do purposeful work”.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vishal Sikka|title=OpenAI: AI for All|url=http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|website=InfyTalk|publisher=[[Infosys]]|accessdate=22 December 2015|date=14 December 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094518/http://www.infosysblogs.com/infytalk/2015/12/openai_ai_for_all.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|author1-link=Vishal Sikka}}</ref> Cade Metz of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' suggests that corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] may be motivated by a desire to use open-source software and data to level the playing field against corporations such as [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] that own enormous supplies of proprietary data.

In 2019 OpenAI became a for profit company called OpenAI LP while staying controlled by a non-profit called OpenAI Inc, a structure that OpenAI call "capped-profit",<ref name=capped-profit>{{Cite web |url= http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/ |title=OpenAI shifts from nonprofit to 'capped-profit' to attract capital |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US |access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> having previously been a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]].<ref name="medium">{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a |title=How Elon Musk and Y Combinator Plan to Stop Computers From Taking Over |first1=Steven |last1=Levy |date=December 11, 2015 |publisher=[[Medium (publishing platform)|Medium]]/[[Backchannel (blog)|Backchannel]] |access-date=December 11, 2015 |quote=“Elon Musk: ...we came to the conclusion that having a 501(c)(3)... would probably be a good thing to do”}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= https://twitter.com/gdb/status/848938670878900224 |title=Yes, we're a 501(c)(3).

==Strategy==
Musk posed the question: “what is the best thing we can do to ensure the future is good? We could sit on the sidelines or we can encourage regulatory oversight, or we could participate with the right structure with people who care deeply about developing AI in a way that is safe and is beneficial to humanity.” Musk acknowledged that “there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about”; nonetheless, the best defense is “to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower.”<ref name="seattle-investors">{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley investors to bankroll artificial-intelligence center|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-investors-to-bankroll-artificial-intelligence-center/|accessdate=19 December 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=13 December 2015}}</ref>

Musk and Altman's counter-intuitive strategy of trying to reduce the risk that AI will cause overall harm, by giving AI to everyone, is controversial among those who are concerned with [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk from artificial intelligence]]. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] is skeptical of Musk's approach: “If you have a button that could do bad things to the world, you don't want to give it to everyone.”<ref name=wired_inside>{{cite news|author1=Cade Metz|title=Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk's Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/04/openai-elon-musk-sam-altman-plan-to-set-artificial-intelligence-free/|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=[[Wired magazine]]|date=27 April 2016|language=en-US}}</ref> During a 2016 conversation about the technological singularity, Altman said that “we don’t plan to release all of our source code” and mentioned a plan to “allow wide swaths of the world to elect representatives to a new governance board”. Greg Brockman stated that “Our goal right now... is to do the best thing there is to do. It’s a little vague.”<ref>{{cite news|title=Sam Altman's Manifest Destiny|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=The New Yorker|issue=10 October 2016}}</ref>

In “RoboSumo”, virtual humanoid “[[Meta learning (computer science)|metalearning]]” robots initially lack knowledge of how to even walk, and given the goals of learning to move around, and pushing the opposing agent out of the ring.

However, it is important to note that OpenAI only learned a heavily simplified version of Dota, including only 17 out of over 100 heroes and excluding certain items as well as game mechanics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wiggers |first1=Kyle |title=OpenAI's Dota 2 bot defeated 99.4% of players in public matches.|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/22/openais-dota-2-bot-defeated-99-4-of-players-in-public-matches/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Dactyl ===
Dactyl uses machine learning to train a robot [[Shadow Hand]] from scratch, using the same reinforcement learning algorithm code that OpenAI Five uses. The robot hand is trained entirely in physically inaccurate simulation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Learning Dexterity |url=https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/ |website=Openai.com |publisher=OpenAI |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Ryan |first1=Mae |title=How Robot Hands Are Evolving to Do What Ours Can |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/30/technology/robot-hands.html |accessdate=1 September 2018 |date=2018 |language=en}}</ref>

=== GPT-2 ===
GPT-2 is an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] [[Transformer (machine learning model)|Transformer]] [[Language model|language model]], a [[Generative model|generative model]] of language. Its authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and [[Perplexity|perplexity]] on 7 of 8 [[One-shot learning|zero-shot]] tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples). The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text from URLs shared in [[Reddit]] submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using [[Byte pair encoding|byte pair encoding]]. This allows to represent any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners |url=https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf |access-date=December 4, 2019 }}</ref>
GPT-2 generates extremely fluent English, and has learned some information about other languages.

Several websites host interactive demonstrations of different instances of GPT-2 and Transformer models<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transformer.huggingface.co/|title=Write With Transformer|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://talktotransformer.com/|title=Talk to Transformer|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>.

When fed the first sentence of George Orwell's novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' it produces plausible futuristic fiction set in China. Unlike previous OpenAI models, GPT-2 was not initially released to the public out of concern over potential misuse, including applications for writing [[fake news]].<ref>{{Cite paper|last = Hern|first = Alex| title = New AI fake text generator may be too dangerous to release, say creators| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 14 February 2019|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/14/elon-musk-backed-ai-writes-convincing-news-fiction| access-date = 14 February 2019}}</ref> Much of the academic community is skeptical that GPT-2 poses a significant threat. The [[Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence]] followed up with a tool to detect "neural fake news".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Oscar |title=Could 'fake text' be the next global political threat? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/04/ai-fake-text-gpt-2-concerns-false-information |accessdate=16 July 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=4 July 2019}}</ref> Other researchers, like Jeremy Howard, warn of "the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable-sounding, context-appropriate prose, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=OpenAI's new multitalented AI writes, translates, and slanders |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2 |accessdate=16 July 2019 |work=The Verge |date=14 February 2019}}</ref> Eventually, OpenAI released the complete version of the GPT-2 language model<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/|title=GPT-2: 1.5B Release|date=2019-11-05|website=OpenAI|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>.

=== GYM Retro===
Gym Retro is a platform for reinforcement learning research on games. Gym Retro is used to conduct research on RL algorithms and study generalization. Prior research in RL has mostly focused on optimizing agents to solve single tasks. Gym Retro gives the ability to generalize between games with similar concepts but different appearances.
