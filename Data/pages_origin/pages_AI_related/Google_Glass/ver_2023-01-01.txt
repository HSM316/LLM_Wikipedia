In early 2013, interested potential Glass users were invited to use a Twitter message, with hashtag #IfIHadGlass, to qualify as an early user of the product. The qualifiers, dubbed "Glass Explorers" and numbering 8,000 individuals, were notified in March 2013, and were later invited to pay $1,500 and visit a Google office in Los Angeles, New York or San Francisco, to pick up their unit following "fitting" and training from Google Glass guides. On May 13, 2014, Google announced a move to a "more open beta", via its Google Plus page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?passive=1209600&osid=1&continue=https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts/QLD88fE7qmE&followup=https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts/QLD88fE7qmE|title=Sign in - Google Accounts|website=accounts.google.com}}</ref>

The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam splitter to a [[collimator|collimating reflector]] at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and into the wearer's eye.<ref name="US20130070338">{{US patent application|20130070338}}</ref><ref name="US20130207887">{{US patent application|20130207887}}</ref>

=== MyGlass ===
Google offered a companion Android and iOS app called MyGlass, which allowed the user to configure and manage the device. It was removed on February 22, 2020 from the Play Store.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.glass.companion |title= MyGlass | work = Android Apps | publisher = Google Play}}</ref>

=== Voice activation ===

In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Glass and posted in the Glass Explorers community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|title=Украинцы не смогут легально купить очки Google Glass из-за запрета на "шпионские" гаджеты|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Korrespondent.net|language=ru|access-date=March 13, 2013}}</ref>

Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the committee, Google stated that a locking system for the device is in development. Google also reminded users that Glass can be remotely reset.<ref name="Slash" /> Police in various states have also warned Glass wearers to watch out for muggers and street robbers.<ref name="bp">{{cite web|title=US Police issues warnings for Google Glass Users over Muggery|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/04/us-police-issues-warnings-for-google-glass-users-over-muggery/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|access-date=April 21, 2014}}</ref>

Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist who was born deaf, tested the product on behalf of people with disabilities and published a review on August 6, 2013. In her review, Goldstein states that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Glass: Not for the Hearing Impaired|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/05/google-glass-hearing-impaired/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|access-date=August 6, 2013|author=Lisa A.

Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations that ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.<ref name=Caesars>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Matt|title=Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|publisher=IGN|access-date=June 1, 2013|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> On October 29, 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) announced a ban on wearable technology including Google Glass, placing it under the same rules as mobile phones and video cameras.<ref name=MPAA>{{cite web|last=MPPA|title=MPAA and NATO Announce Updated Theatrical Anti-Theft Policy|url=http://www.mpaa.org/mpaa-and-nato-announce-updated-theatrical-anti-theft-policy/|publisher=MPAA|access-date=November 7, 2014|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref>

There have also been concerns over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass.<ref name="betabeat">[http://betabeat.com/2014/05/googles-eye-doctor-admits-glass-can-cause-pain/ Google’s Eye Doctor Admits Glass Can Cause Pain] Betabeat.com Jack Smith May 2014</ref> These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of [[Harvard]], though he later partly backtracked due to the controversy that ensued from his remarks.<ref name=betabeat /><ref name=betabeat2014-05/><ref name=businessinsider2014-05/>

Concerns have been raised by cyber forensics experts at the [[University of Massachusetts]] who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the passcodes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fink|first=Erica|title=Google Glass wearers can steal your password|url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/07/07/technology/security/google-glass-password-hack/index.html?iid=HP_River|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|access-date=July 8, 2014|date=July 7, 2014}}</ref>

Another concern regarding the camera application raises controversy to privacy. Some people are concerned about how the product has the capability of recording during events such as conversations. The device sets off a light to indicate that it is recording but many speculate that there will be an app to disable this.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-google-glass-is-creepy/|title = Why Google Glass Is Creepy|last = Pogue|first = David|date = May 14, 2013|journal = Scientific American|access-date = October 28, 2014}}</ref>

=== Safety considerations ===
Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On July 31, 2013 it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass was likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by the [[Department for Transport]].<ref name="telegraph glass ban 1">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10214822/Drivers-to-be-banned-from-wearing-Google-Glass.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10214822/Drivers-to-be-banned-from-wearing-Google-Glass.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Drivers to be banned from wearing Google Glass|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=David|last=Millward|date=July 31, 2013|location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In the US, West Virginia state representative [[Gary Howell (West Virginia politician)|Gary G. Howell]] introduced an amendment in March 2013 to the state's law against texting while driving that would include bans against "using a wearable computer with head mounted display". In an interview, Howell stated, "The primary thing is a safety concern, it [the glass headset] could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there's a lot of potential for distraction."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/25/tech/innovation/google-glass-driving/index.html?hpt=hp_c3|title=Lawmaker: Google Glass and driving don't mix|newspaper=CNN|first=Brandon|last=Griggs|date=March 25, 2013|access-date=March 25, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2013, a driver in California was ticketed for "driving with monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)" after being pulled over for speeding by a [[San Diego Police Department]] officer. The driver was reportedly the first to be fined for driving while wearing a Google Glass.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3020899/fast-feed/california-driver-gets-a-ticket-for-wearing-google-glass-behind-the-wheel|title=California Driver Gets a Ticket for Wearing Google Glass Behind the Wheel|publisher=Fast Company & Inc|first=Christina|last=Chaey|date=October 30, 2013|access-date=November 4, 2013}}</ref> While the judge noted that "Google Glass fell under 'the purview and intent' of the ban on driving with a monitor", the case was thrown out of court due to lack of proof the device was on at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25764674|title=Google Glass driver Abadie has case dropped|work=BBC News|date=January 17, 2014|access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

In November 2014, Sawyer et al., from the [[University of Central Florida]] and the US [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], published the results of comparative study in a [[driving simulator]]. Subjects were asked to use either Google Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface and were then interrupted with an emergency event. The Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting [[Cognitive load|cognitive demands]]. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing the Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multi-tasking.<ref>Sawyer, B.D., Finomore, V.S., Calvo, A.A. and Hancock, P.A., “Google Glass: A Driver Distraction Cause or Cure?” in ‘’[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]]’’, November 2014, 56: pp. 1307–1321, {{doi|10.1177/0018720814555723}}</ref>

In February 2014, a woman wearing Google Glass claimed she was verbally and physically assaulted at a bar in San Francisco after a patron confronted her while she was showing off the device, allegedly leading a man accompanying her to physically retaliate. Witnesses suggested that patrons were upset over the possibility of being recorded.<ref name=CBSSF>{{cite web|last=Vazquez|first=Joe|title=Woman Wearing Google Glass Says She Was Attacked In San Francisco Bar|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/02/25/woman-wearing-google-glass-says-she-was-attacked-in-san-francisco-bar/|publisher=CBSSF|access-date=November 7, 2014|date=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

=== Terms of service ===
Under the Google Glass terms of service for the Glass Explorer pre-public release program, it specifically states, "You may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."
''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' commented on this policy of a company claiming ownership of its product after it had been sold, saying: "Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them."<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Google Is Forbidding Users From Reselling, Loaning Glass Eyewear |date = April 17, 2013 |url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/ |access-date = April 17, 2013 |magazine=Wired |first=David |last=Kravets}}</ref> Others pointed out that Glass was not for public sale at all, but rather in private testing for selected developers, and that not allowing developers in a closed beta to sell to the public is not the same as banning consumers from reselling a publicly released device.<ref>{{cite web|last=Suleman|first=Khidr|title= Google bans developers from selling Glass headset |url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/19645/google-bans-developers-selling-glass-headset|work= IT Pro |access-date= July 2, 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}</ref>
