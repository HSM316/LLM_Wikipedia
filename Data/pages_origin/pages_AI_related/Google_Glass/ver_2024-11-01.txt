In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Glass and posted in the Glass Explorers community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|title=Украинцы не смогут легально купить очки Google Glass из-за запрета на "шпионские" гаджеты|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Korrespondent.net|language=ru|access-date=March 13, 2013|archive-date=March 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330170835/https://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|url-status=live}}</ref>

Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the committee, Google stated that a locking system for the device is in development. Google also reminded users that Glass can be remotely reset.<ref name="Slash" /> Police in various states have also warned Glass wearers to watch out for muggers and street robbers.<ref name="bp">{{cite web|title=US Police issues warnings for Google Glass Users over Muggery|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/04/us-police-issues-warnings-for-google-glass-users-over-muggery/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|access-date=April 21, 2014|archive-date=April 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421143116/http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/04/us-police-issues-warnings-for-google-glass-users-over-muggery/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist who was born deaf, tested the product on behalf of people with disabilities and published a review on August 6, 2013. In her review, Goldstein states that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Glass: Not for the Hearing Impaired|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/05/google-glass-hearing-impaired/|work=Mashable|access-date=August 6, 2013|author=Lisa A.

Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations that ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.<ref name=Caesars>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Matt|title=Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|publisher=IGN|access-date=June 1, 2013|date=May 8, 2013|archive-date=March 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330170855/https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|url-status=live}}</ref> On October 29, 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America and the National Association of Theatre Owners announced a ban on wearable technology including Google Glass, placing it under the same rules as mobile phones and video cameras.<ref name=MPAA>{{cite web|last=MPPA|title=MPAA and NATO Announce Updated Theatrical Anti-Theft Policy|url=http://www.mpaa.org/mpaa-and-nato-announce-updated-theatrical-anti-theft-policy/|publisher=MPAA|access-date=November 7, 2014|date=October 29, 2014|archive-date=November 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107231203/http://www.mpaa.org/mpaa-and-nato-announce-updated-theatrical-anti-theft-policy/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Concerns have been raised by cyber forensics experts at the [[University of Massachusetts]] who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the passcodes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fink|first=Erica|title=Google Glass wearers can steal your password|url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/07/07/technology/security/google-glass-password-hack/index.html?iid=HP_River|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|access-date=July 8, 2014|date=July 7, 2014|archive-date=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220700/http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/07/technology/security/google-glass-password-hack/index.html?iid=HP_River|url-status=live}}</ref>

Another concern regarding the camera application raises controversy to privacy. Some people are concerned about how the product has the capability of recording during events such as conversations. The device sets off a light to indicate that it is recording but many speculate that there will be an app to disable this.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-google-glass-is-creepy/|title = Why Google Glass Is Creepy|last = Pogue|first = David|date = May 14, 2013|journal = Scientific American|access-date = October 28, 2014|archive-date = October 28, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028060342/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-google-glass-is-creepy/|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Safety considerations ===
Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On July 31, 2013, it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass was likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by the [[Department for Transport]].<ref name="telegraph glass ban 1">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10214822/Drivers-to-be-banned-from-wearing-Google-Glass.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10214822/Drivers-to-be-banned-from-wearing-Google-Glass.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Drivers to be banned from wearing Google Glass|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=David|last=Millward|date=July 31, 2013|location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In the US, West Virginia state representative [[Gary Howell (West Virginia politician)|Gary G.

In February 2014, a woman wearing Google Glass claimed she was verbally and physically assaulted at a bar in San Francisco after a patron confronted her while she was showing off the device, allegedly leading a man accompanying her to physically retaliate. Witnesses suggested that patrons were upset over the possibility of being recorded.<ref name=CBSSF>{{cite web|last=Vazquez|first=Joe|title=Woman Wearing Google Glass Says She Was Attacked In San Francisco Bar|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/02/25/woman-wearing-google-glass-says-she-was-attacked-in-san-francisco-bar/|publisher=CBSSF|access-date=November 7, 2014|date=February 25, 2014|archive-date=November 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000836/http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/02/25/woman-wearing-google-glass-says-she-was-attacked-in-san-francisco-bar/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2014 the results of comparative study in a [[driving simulator]] were published by Sawyer et al. of the [[University of Central Florida]] and the US [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], were published in the journal ''[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]]''. Subjects were asked to use either a smartphone or Google Glass to receive a message and were then presented with a situation where emergency braking was required. The messages delivered by Google Glass were less distracting than those delivered via text, but the problem was not eliminated. Both devices impaired driving abilities while receiving messages, and the Google Glass users also experienced some impairment even when not actively using the device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=B.D. |last2=Finomore |first2=V.S. |last3=Calvo |first3=A.A. |last4=Hancock |first4=P.A. |title=Google Glass: A Driver Distraction Cause or Cure? |journal=[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]] |date=November 2014 |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=307–1321 |doi=10.1177/0018720814555723|pmid=25490810 |s2cid=17392554 }}</ref>

=== Terms of service ===
Under the Google Glass terms of service for the Glass Explorer pre-public release program, it specifically states, "You may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."
''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' commented on this policy of a company claiming ownership of its product after it had been sold, saying: "Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them."<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Google Is Forbidding Users From Reselling, Loaning Glass Eyewear |date = April 17, 2013 |url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/ |access-date = April 17, 2013 |magazine = Wired |first = David |last = Kravets |archive-date = April 18, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130418233949/http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/ |url-status = live }}</ref> Others pointed out that Glass was not for public sale at all, but rather in private testing for selected developers, and that not allowing developers in a closed beta to sell to the public is not the same as banning consumers from reselling a publicly released device.<ref>{{cite web|last=Suleman|first=Khidr|title=Google bans developers from selling Glass headset|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/19645/google-bans-developers-selling-glass-headset|work=IT Pro|access-date=July 2, 2013|date=April 18, 2013|archive-date=June 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619163201/http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/19645/google-bans-developers-selling-glass-headset|url-status=live}}</ref>
