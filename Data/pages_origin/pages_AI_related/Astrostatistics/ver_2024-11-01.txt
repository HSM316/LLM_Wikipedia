'''Astrostatistics''' is a discipline which spans [[astrophysics]], [[statistical analysis]] and [[data mining]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal |url=https://asaip.psu.edu |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=asaip.psu.edu}}</ref> It is used to process the vast amount of data produced by [[automated scanning]] of the cosmos, to characterize complex datasets, and to link [[astronomical data]] to [[theoretical astrophysics|astrophysical theory]]. Many branches of statistics are involved in astronomical analysis including [[nonparametrics]], [[multivariate regression]] and [[multivariate classification]], [[Time series|time series analysis]], and especially [[Bayesian inference]]. The field is closely related to [[astroinformatics]].
