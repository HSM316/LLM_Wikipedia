{{Short description|Branch of statistics combining astrophysics, statistical analysis and data mining}}
'''Astrostatistics''' is a discipline which spans [[astrophysics]], [[statistical analysis]] and [[data mining]].<ref>[https://asaip.psu.edu  Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal]</ref> It is used to process the vast amount of data produced by [[automated scanning]] of the cosmos, to characterize complex datasets, and to link [[astronomical data]] to [[theoretical astrophysics|astrophysical theory]].  Many branches of statistics are involved in astronomical analysis including [[nonparametrics]], [[multivariate regression]] and [[multivariate classification]], [[time series analysis]], and especially [[Bayesian inference]]. The field is closely related to [[astroinformatics]].

==Professional association==
Practitioners are represented by the [[International Astrostatistics Association]] affiliated with the [[International Statistical Institute]], the [[International Astronomical Union]] Working Group in Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics, the [[American Astronomical Society]] Working Group in Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics, the [[American Statistical Association]] Interest Group in Astrostatistics, and the [https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/ Cosmostatistics Initiative].  All of these organizations participate in the [http://asaip.psu.edu Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal] Web site.
