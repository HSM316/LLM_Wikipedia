'''Eloquens'''™ is a text-to-speech software, whose first version was released in 1993 by [[CSELT]]. It was the first commercial [[speech synthesis]] software able to speak Italian.

== Description ==
It was the first commercial product of the research center CSELT in the field of voice technology. It was built with diphone-technology aimed to reach a high computational efficiency.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Balestri |first1=Marcello |last2=Lazzaretto |first2=Stefano |last3=Salza |first3=Pier Luigi |last4=Sandri |first4=Stefano |title=3rd European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (Eurospeech 1993) |chapter=The CSELT system for Italian text-to-speech synthesis |date=22 September 1993 |pages=2091–2094 |doi=10.21437/Eurospeech.1993-468|s2cid=42744136 }}</ref> As a result, the produced voice is still "robotic", but more natural than the previous generation voice implemented in [[MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton)|MUSA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2006/Talks/0607-loquendo-speech/Baggia_Trento_2006_sml.pdf|first= Paolo|last= Baggia|title= ''Speech Technologies and Standards'', DIT Seminars, Povo, Trento|date= 7 June 2006}}</ref> by CSELT itself. In the past, ELOQUENS was applied to automatically read timetables in the Italian train stations<ref>1997 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing: April 21-24, 1997, Munich, Germany. (1997). United States: IEEE Computer Society Press: p. 1147</ref> and some telephone services provided by [[Telecom Italia]], e.g. the automated address book service.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nebbia |first1=L. |last2=Quazza |first2=S. |last3=Luigi Salza |first3=P. |title=Proceedings 1998 IEEE 4th Workshop Interactive Voice Technology for Telecommunications Applications.

In 1997 Eloquens was also used as a building block (synthezer module) in dialogue systems.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gemello |first1=R. |last2=Albesano |first2=D. |last3=Mana |first3=F. |title=Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'97) |chapter=Continuous speech recognition with neural networks and stationary-transitional acoustic units |date=1997 |volume=4 |pages=2107–2111 |doi=10.1109/ICNN.1997.614230|isbn=0-7803-4122-8 |s2cid=56858298 }}</ref>

Nowadays, it is released as [[freeware]]: it is nowadays typically used in spoken comments in many [[YouTube]] videos.
