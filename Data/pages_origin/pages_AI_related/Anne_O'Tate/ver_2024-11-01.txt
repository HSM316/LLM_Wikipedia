While PubMed has its own wide range of search options to identify sets of records relevant to a researchers query it lacks the ability to analyse these sets of records further, a process for which the terms [[text mining]] and  [[drill down]] have been used. Anne O'Tate is able to perform such analysis and can process sets of up to 25,000 PubMed records.<ref name="cite pmid| 18279519"/>

==Description==

Once a set of articles has been identified using Anne O’Tate with its PubMed-like interface and search syntax, the set can be analysed and words and concepts mentioned in specific 'fields' (sections) of PubMed records can be displayed in order of frequency.<ref name="cite pmid| 20333611 ">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> ‘Fields’ which Anne O’Tate can display in this manner are:

===Topics (MeSH)===
This option may help to identify possible [[Medical Subject Headings]]  (known as MeSH terms, but called ‘Topics’ by Anne O’Tate) for a subject for which no corresponding subject heading or ‘entry term’ (cross-references to preferred MeSH term) exists or where PubMed’s automatic mapping process (identifying a MeSH term and including it in a search formulation) fails.

Searching for instance for articles on ‘“Knowledge Transfer”’ (for which no corresponding MeSH or entry term exists) will retrieve a set of some 530 studies in PubMed (as of August 2011); Anne O’Tate’s analysis suggests that MeSH terms like "Diffusion of Innovation" or "Information Dissemination" may be suitable additional concepts to retrieve a more ‘sensitive’ (comprehensive) set of references. This method of identifying possible MeSH terms is not available on PubMed.

===Authors===
This option may help with identifying authors who have written frequently about a given subject, or may help with identifying possible experts or peer reviewers

===Journals===
Identifying journals which publish papers on the subject under investigation may assist with selecting suitable journals to consider for manuscripts or for detailed scanning for relevant articles ('hand searching'<ref name="cite pmid| 10381991">{{Cite journal

== History ==

Anne O'Tate (a pun on the word ‘annotate’) was developed by Neil R Smalheiser and a team of researchers from the [[University of Chicago]]. It is part of the Arrowsmith Project, which developed tools such as “Arrowsmith” proper, a text-comparison application,<ref name="cite pmid| 19185946">{{Cite journal

==Other PubMed text-mining applications==

A wide range of text-mining applications for PubMed have been developed,<ref name="cite pmid| 21245076"/> using their own interface, such as [[GoPubMed]], ClusterMed, or PubReMiner. Only Anne O’Tate uses PubMed’s standard interface, search syntax, and some of its functionality.
