'''Non-human''' (also spelled '''nonhuman''') is any entity displaying some,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/nonhuman|title=the definition of nonhuman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref> but not enough, [[human]] characteristics to be considered a human. The term has been used in a variety of contexts and may refer to objects that have been developed with [[human intelligence]], such as robots or vehicles.

==Animal rights and personhood==
{{Further information|Personhood#Non-human animals}}
In the [[animal rights]] movement, it is common to distinguish between "[[Personhood#Humans|human animal]]s" and "[[non-human animal]]s". Participants in the animal rights movement generally recognize that non-human animals have some similar characteristics to those of human [[personhood|person]]s. For example, various non-human animals have been shown to register pain, compassion, memory, and some [[Animal cognition|cognitive]] function.  Some animal rights activists argue that the similarities between human and non-human animals justify giving non-human animals rights that human society has afforded to humans, such as the right to self-preservation, and some even wish for all non-human animals or at least those that bear a fully thinking and conscious mind, such as [[vertebrate]]s and some [[invertebrate]]s such as [[cephalopod]]s, to be given a full right of personhood.

==The non-human in philosophy==
Contemporary philosophers have drawn on the work of [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (among others) to suggest that the non-human poses [[epistemological]] and [[ontological]] problems for humanist and post-humanist ethics,<ref>{{Citation | title= Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans: Deleuze and Guattari in Madagascar | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human | year=2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.</ref> and have linked the study of non-humans to materialist and [[ethological]] approaches to the study of society and culture.<ref>Whatmore, Sarah (2006), 'Materialist Returns: Practising Cultural Geography In and For a More-Than-Human World', ''Cultural Geographies'', 13, pp. 600-09.</ref>

==Sandra the Orangutan==
Sandra (born February 14, 1986, in Rostock Zoo in East Germany) is an orangutan, currently living in the Center for Great Apes in Florida after being moved from the Buenos Aires Zoo in 2019. Sandra is a zoo-born, hybrid orangutan of the two separate species of Borneo and Sumatra orangutans. In Germany, Sandra, then called Marisa, was transferred to a second zoo in [[Germany]], then transferred to [[Argentina]] on September 17, 1994. In the Buenos Aires Zoo the name of the orangutan was changed to Sandra.

Sandra had a baby girl called Shembira or Gembira, who was born on March 2, 1999, and was transferred to Xixiakou Wild Animal Park, Rongcheng, Sandong, [[China]] in 2008. During the [[amparo court case]] in Buenos Aires in 2015, it was revealed that an attempt by the Buenos Aires zoo to mate Sandra with an orangutan named Max failed because Sandra preferred instead to sit outside in the rain and snow.

On December 18, 2014, Sandra was termed by the court in Argentina as a [["subject of rights"]] in an unsuccessful [[habeas corpus]] case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The decision turning down the habeas corpus application also led to the court's direction to prosecute alleged cruelty by the zoo through the prosecutor's office in Buenos Aires in 2015. The brief "subject of rights" statement left the status of the orangutan Sandra as a [["non-human being"]] uncertain legally, until on October 21, 2015, Justice Elena Amanda Liberatori ruled in an amparo case with Sandra that the orangutan is "una persona no humana" or "a non-human person" and ordered the city of Buenos Aires to provide what is "necessary to preserve her cognitive abilities". A few days after the decision, both sides said they would appeal.[1][2]

==Artificial intelligence==
The term non-human has been used to describe computer programs and robot-like devices that display some human-like characteristics. In both [[science fiction]] and in the real world, [[artificial intelligence|computer programs]] and [[robots]] have been built to perform tasks that require human-computer interactions in a manner that suggests [[sentience]] and compassion. There is increasing interest in the use of robots in nursing homes and to provide elder care.<ref>{{citation |author=Nick Bilton| newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 19, 2013 |title=Disruptions: Helper Robots Are Steered, Tentatively, to Care for the Aging |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/disruptions-helper-robots-are-steered-tentatively-to-elder-care/?ref=technology |access-date=2013-05-24}}</ref> Computer programs have been used for years in schools to provide one-on-one education with children. The [[Tamagotchi]] toy required children to provide care, attention, and nourishment to keep it "alive".
