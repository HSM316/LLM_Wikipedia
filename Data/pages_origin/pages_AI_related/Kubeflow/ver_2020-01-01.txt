'''Kubeflow''' is a [[Free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] machine learning platform co-founded by [http://davidaronchick.com David Aronchick], Jeremy Lewi and Vishnu Kannan, built by developers at [[Google]], [[Cisco]], [[Red Hat|RedHat]], [[CoreOS]] and [https://intl.caicloud.io/ CaiCloud],  and first released at Kubecon North America in 2017<ref>{{Citation|title=''Hot Dogs or Not" - At Scale with Kubernetes [I] - Vish Kannan & David Aronchick, Google|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3dVF5wWz-g|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>. Kubeflow is designed to enable using machine learning pipelines to orchestrate complicated workflows running on Kubernetes (e.g. doing data processing then using [[TensorFlow]] or [[PyTorch]] to train a model, and deploying to [[TensorFlow Serving]]). Kubeflow was based on Google's internal method to deploy TensorFlow models to Kubernetes called TensorFlow Extended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/kubeflow/|title=Kubeflow|website=Kubeflow|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>
