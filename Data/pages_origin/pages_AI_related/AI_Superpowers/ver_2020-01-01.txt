In his September 2018 ''[[The New York Times]]'' Opinion piece, [[Thomas L. Friedman]] cited ''AI Superpowers'' in his summary of the emerging global dominance of China in AI. According to Kai-Fu Lee, "If data is the new oil, then China is the new [[Saudi Arabia]]."<ref>{{cite book| title= AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order| author= Kai-Fu Lee| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]| date= September 25, 2018| isbn= 9781328546395| oclc= 1035622189| location= [[Boston]], Mass| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/aisuperpowerschi0000leek| author-link= Kai-Fu Lee}}</ref> Lee advances several arguments for why he thinks the [[artificial intelligence industry in China]] will excel in the [[artificial intelligence arms race]]:

# Training [[deep learning]] models requires more of a [[brute force method]] than innovation; well suited to China's supposedly higher quantity but lower quality of [[software engineer]] compared to the US<ref name="Atkinson">{{cite web|url=https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/ai-superpowers|title=AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order|first=Robert|last=Atkinson|publisher=New York Journal of Books|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>
# China has fewer data protection regulations (e.g., the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] in Europe) than other countries, so Chinese software collect more data on users.<ref name="Atkinson"/>
# Chinese tech startup culture is more "aggressive" than that of other countries', with [[Intellectual property in China|fewer intellectual property restrictions]]<ref name="Atkinson"/> and fewer barriers to [[vertical integration]]<ref name="FA">{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-11-16/beyond-ai-arms-race|title=Beyond the AI Arms Race|first=Remco|last=Zwetsloot|first2=Helen|last2=Toner|first3=Jeffrey|last3=Ding|publisher=Foreign Affairs|date=2018-11-16}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Senator [[Mark Warner]] named ''AI Superpowers'' as his recommended book for The 2018 [[POLITICO]] 50 Reading List.<ref name="The POLITICO 50 Reading List">{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/politico-50-book-picks/ |title=The POLITICO 50 Reading List |author=Politico Magazine Staff  |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=September 4, 2018 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' criticized the book for promoting [[zero-sum thinking]] and hyping Chinese state investment in tech ventures that often underperform relative to expectations; for focusing on deep learning to the exclusion of other forms of artificial intelligence; and for overgeneralizing the usefulness of Chinese data sets.<ref name="FA"/>
