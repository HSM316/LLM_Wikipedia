'''Google Nest''' is a line of [[home automation|smart home]] products including [[smart speaker]]s, [[smart displays]], streaming devices, [[Smart thermostat|thermostats]], [[smoke detector]]s, [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[security alarms|security systems]] including [[smart doorbell]]s, [[Smart camera|cameras]] and [[smart lock]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Google Nest: Why Google finally embraced Nest as its smart home brand|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530609/google-nest-smart-home-brand-merging-hub-max-rebrand-io-2019|last1=Statt|first1=Nick|last2=Bohn|first2=Dieter|date=2019-05-09|website=The Verge|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>

The Nest brand name was originally owned by '''Nest Labs''', co-founded by former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] engineers [[Tony Fadell]] and Matt Rogers in 2010.<ref name="Wired: Lowly Smoke Detector">{{cite magazine|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=Nest Gives the Lowly Smoke Detector a Brain — And a Voice|url=https://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/nest-smoke-detector/all/|magazine=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|access-date=October 9, 2013|date=October 8, 2013}}</ref> Its flagship product, which was the company's first offering, is the Nest Learning Thermostat, introduced in 2011.

The company quickly expanded to more than 130 employees by the end of 2012.<ref name="Wired: Lowly Smoke Detector" /> Google acquired Nest Labs for [[United States dollar|US$]]3.2 billion in January 2014, when the company employed 280. As of late 2015, Nest employs more than 1,100 and added a primary engineering center in [[Seattle]].<ref name="nestseattle">{{cite web|title=Google's Nest Labs plans top secret project at new Seattle engineering center|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/nest-labs-teases-top-secret-project-for-seattle-as-it-opens-new-engineering-center-with-big-growth-plans/|last=Demmitt|first=Jacob|date=November 18, 2015|website=Geekwire}}</ref><ref name="Tony Fadell next Steve Jobs">{{cite web|title=Is Tony Fadell the next Steve Jobs.. or Larry Page?|url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/12/tony-fadell-nest/|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|date=2014-06-15|website=Fortune|access-date=2014-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html | title=Google to Acquire Nest| date=2014-01-13 | access-date=2014-01-13}}</ref>

After Google reorganized itself under the holding company [[Alphabet Inc.]], Nest operated independently of Google from 2015 to 2018. However, in 2018, Nest was merged into Google's home-devices unit led by Rishi Chandra, effectively ceasing to exist as a separate business.<ref name=":0" /> In July 2018, it was announced that all [[Google Home]] electronics products will henceforth be marketed under the brand Google Nest.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Statt|first1=Nick|last2=Bohn|first2=Dieter|date=2019-05-07|title=Google Nest: Why Google finally embraced Nest as its smart home brand|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530609/google-nest-smart-home-brand-merging-hub-max-rebrand-io-2019|access-date=2021-07-12|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Nest logo.png|thumb|Nest Labs logo before becoming the hardware division for Google]]

=== Nest Labs before acquisition by Google ===
Nest Labs was founded in 2010 by former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] engineers Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news|last=Winkler|first=Rolfe|author2=Wakabayashi, Daisuke|date=January 14, 2014|title=Google to Buy Nest Labs for $3.2 Billion|page=|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303595404579318952802236612}}</ref> The idea came when Fadell was building a vacation home and found all of the available thermostats on the market to be inadequate, motivated to bring something better on the market.<ref name="Tony Fadell next Steve Jobs" /> Early investors in Nest Labs included [[Shasta Ventures]] and [[Kleiner Perkins]].

===Acquisition by Google of Nest Labs, Dropcam, and Revolv===
On January 13, 2014, Google announced plans to acquire Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in cash. Google completed the acquisition the next day, on January 14, 2014.<ref name="nest-tc">{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/nest-investors-strike-it-rich/|title = Who Gets Rich From Google Buying Nest?

In June 2014, it was announced that Nest would buy camera startup [[Dropcam]] for $555 million.<ref name="nestdropcam">{{cite news|last=Ajmera|first=Ankit|date=23 June 2014|title=Google's Nest to buy Dropcam for $555 million|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-nest-dropcam-idUSKBN0EW02820140622}}</ref> With the purchase, Dropcam became integrated with other Nest products; if the Protect alarm is triggered, the Dropcam can automatically start recording, and the Thermostat can use Dropcam to sense for motion.<ref name="dropcamcowork">{{cite web| title=Here's How Nest Will Work Together With Your Dropcam Now | website=Gizmodo | url=https://gizmodo.com/heres-how-nest-will-work-together-with-your-dropcam-now-1632364518 | date=9 September 2014}}</ref>

On October 24, 2014, Nest both acquired the hub service Revolv, and discontinued its product line, gaining the expertise of Revolv's staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2014/10/24/11632238/nest-acquires-home-automation-hub-revolv-but-will-stop-selling-it|title=Nest acquires home automation hub Revolv but will stop selling it|first=Liz|last=Gannes|work=Recode|date=2014-10-24|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref><ref name="hackaday_brick"/>

=== Nest as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. ===
In August 2015, Google announced that it would restructure its operations under a new parent company, [[Alphabet Inc.]], with Nest being separated from Google as a subsidiary of the new holding company.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Google to be publicly traded under Alphabet Inc. in planned restructuring|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/google-to-be-publicly-traded-under-alphabet-inc-in-planned-restructuring-1.3186244|access-date = 2015-08-10}}</ref>

In January 2016, some Nest thermostats stopped working, a fault attributed to a software update a fortnight earlier. There were no lawsuits, individual or [[class-action lawsuit|class-action]], due to an [[arbitration clause]] in the contract.<ref name="NYT_thermostat">{{cite news |last1=Bilton |first1=Nick |title=Nest Thermostat Glitch Leaves Users in the Cold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/fashion/nest-thermostat-glitch-battery-dies-software-freeze.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bode |first1=Karl |title=Nest Thermostat Goes From 'Internet Of Things' Darling To Cautionary Tale |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160121/05125933392/nest-thermostat-goes-internet-things-darling-to-cautionary-tale.shtml |work=Techdirt. |date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

According to Frank Gillet of [[Forrester Research]], only 6% of American households possessed internet-connected devices such as appliances, home-monitoring systems, speakers, or lighting. He also predicted this percentage would grow to only 15% by 2021. Furthermore, 72% of respondents in a 2016 British survey conducted by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Pricewaterhouse Coopers]] did not foresee adopting smart-home technology over the next two to five years.<ref name=economist_market>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21700380-connected-homes-will-take-longer-materialise-expected-where-smart|title=Where the smart is|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-15|quote=Nest’s problems are symptomatic.

Breakneck growth is not expected; by 2021 the number will be just over 15% (see chart). Too few consumers are convinced that the internet has a role to play in every corner of their lives. A survey conducted in Britain by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting firm, found that 72% of people have no plans to adopt smart-home technology in the next two to five years and that they are unwilling to pay for it.}}</ref>

=== Nest as a part of Google hardware division ===
On February 7, 2018, it was announced by hardware head Rick Osterloh that Nest had been merged into Google's hardware division, directly alongside units such as [[Google Home]] and [[Chromecast]]. It would retain its separate Palo Alto headquarters, but Nest CEO Marwan Fawaz would now report to Osterloh, and there were plans for tighter integration with Google platforms and software such as [[Google Assistant]] in future products.<ref name="tc-nestmerge">{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/nest-is-being-rolled-into-googles-hardware-team/|title=Nest is being rolled into Google's hardware team|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-and-nest-reunite-in-push-to-add-ai-to-every-gadget/|title=Google and Nest reunite in push to add AI to every gadget|date=2018-02-07|work=CNET|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en}}</ref> Shortly after the announcement, co-founder and chief product officer Matt Rogers announced his plans to leave the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16993058/nest-matt-rogers-co-founder-leaving-google-smart-home-chief-product-officer|title=Nest co-founder Matt Rogers is leaving the company just after it rejoins Google|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>

The [[Google Home Hub]] was retroactively renamed Google Nest Hub, while a new and larger version of the product is now available called the Nest Hub Max with both a larger screen and an amplified speaker, for a greater low-end audio experience. Also, product lines such as Chromecast, Google Home, and [[Google Nest Wifi|Google Wifi]] will now be marketed under the Google Nest brand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18531532/google-nest-rename-smart-home-rebrand-io-2019|title=Google just renamed its smart home brand to Google Nest|last=Gartenberg|first=Chaim|date=2019-05-07|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> In addition, Nest began to deprecate its own internal platforms, announcing the discontinuation of the existing "Works with Nest" program in favor of Google Assistant going forward, and pushing users to migrate themselves from Nest's account system to [[Google account]]s. Google published Nest-specific privacy information outlining a commitment to transparency, not selling personal information, and giving users control of their data.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/nest-the-company-died-at-google-io-2019/|title=Nest, the company, died at Google I/O 2019|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2019-05-10|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>

In August 2020 Google announced intent to invest $450 million in [[ADT Inc.]] for a 6.6% stake in the company.

===Nest Learning Thermostat===
{{Main|Nest Learning Thermostat}}

The Nest Learning Thermostat is an electronic, programmable, and self-learning Wi-Fi-enabled thermostat that optimizes heating and cooling of homes and businesses to conserve energy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pogue|first=David|title=A Thermostat That's Clever, Not Clunky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/technology/personaltech/nest-learning-thermostat-sets-a-standard-david-pogue.html|date=November 30, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=October 9, 2013}}</ref> It is based on a machine-learning algorithm: for the first weeks users have to regulate the thermostat in order to provide the reference data set. Nest can then learn people's schedules, at which temperature they are used to and when. Using built-in sensors and phones' locations it can shift into energy-saving mode when it realizes nobody is at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/|title=Meet the Nest Learning Thermostat|website=Nest|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref>

The Nest Thermostat is built around an operating system that allows interaction with the thermostat via spinning and clicking of its control wheel (or swiping and tapping on the 2020 Nest Thermostat), which brings up option menus for switching from heating to cooling, access to device settings, energy history, and scheduling. Users can control Nest without a [[touch screen]] or other input devices. As the thermostat is connected to the Internet, the company can push updates to fix bugs, improve performance and add additional features.

In September 2017, Nest released the Thermostat E, a lower-priced version of the original Nest Thermostat. It is similar in functionality to the standard model, except with a plastic, ceramic-like bezel ring (instead of metal) and a "frosted" overlay for its display. Unlike the original, the screen only activates when the device is being used; these design changes are intended to make the device appear more natural within a home. The Thermostat E also does not feature as many wiring connectors as the higher-end model; Nest stated that this would make it support at least 85% of homes (as opposed to 95% for the standard model).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/nest-thermostat-e-vs-original-nest-thermostat/?ncid=rss|title=This is the new, less expensive Nest Thermostat|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|date=30 August 2017|work=TechCrunch|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/alphabet-nest-new-thermostat-e/|title=Nest Doesn't Want You to Notice Its New Smart Thermostat|last=Reisinger|first=Don|date=30 August 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=4 September 2017}}</ref>

In October 2020 Google released the "Nest Thermostat" for the North American market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511951/google-nest-smart-thermostat-new-design-lower-price-specs-features|title=Google's Nest announces new smart thermostat with simpler design, lower price|first=Dan|last=Seifert|date=October 12, 2020|website=The Verge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/google-nest/new-nest-thermostat-energy-savings/|title=The new Nest Thermostat: more energy savings for more people|date=October 12, 2020|website=Google}}</ref>  Pricing was made more accessible and features a mirror-like face, among other significant physical changes. The rotating ring found on other Nest models was replaced with a touch-sensitive strip on the right side of the thermostat body, with swiping and tapping of the touch-sensitive strip being the input method for this model. Learning features have been removed along with support for remote sensors. HVAC compatibility is the same as the Nest Thermostat E, although the bases of the 2020 Nest Thermostat and Nest Thermostat E are not interchangeable.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nest Thermostat|url=https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_thermostat|access-date=2020-12-11|website=Google Store|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Nest Protect===
[[File:NestProtect.JPG|thumb|Nest Protect]]
In October 2013, Nest announced its second product, the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. The Nest Protect is available in both black and white (the black is exclusively sold through Nest directly<ref>{{cite web|title=Where can I buy the black Nest Protect?|url=https://nest.com/support/article/Where-can-I-buy-the-black-Nest-Protect|access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref>) and also comes in battery or AC-powered models. The Nest Protect features a multicolored light ring which is color-coded to indicate different operations, such as yellow to indicate an early warning or red if an alarm is sounding. The ring also has a motion detector which turns it white briefly when someone passes under to provide illumination. The Nest Protect warns of an alarm sounding briefly before it does. It is also able to communicate with the Nest Thermostat to provide the Auto-Away feature information that someone is present in the house, as well as to shut off the furnace in the event of a fire or carbon monoxide. It is available for sale in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

On April 3, 2014, sales of the Nest Protect were suspended, due to the potential for the alarm feature to be accidentally disabled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slashdot.org/story/14/04/04/204254/nest-halts-sales-of-smart-fire-alarm-after-discovering-dangerous-flaw?sdsrc=next|title=Nest Halts Sales of Smart Fire Alarm After Discovering Dangerous Flaw - Slashdot|website=slashdot.org}}</ref>

On June 17, 2015, Nest launched a new version of the Nest Protect (officially termed the "second generation"). The differences from the first generation Nest Protect includes an improved sensor, which uses two wavelengths of light, allowing it to detect both smoldering and flaming fires. The carbon monoxide sensor lasts longer, resulting in the new Nest Protect lasting 10 years, whereas the original Nest Protect lasts seven years. The new Nest Protect can be silenced using a [[smart device]], if not in the US or Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.google.com/us/|title=Google Store|website=Google Store}}</ref> When not home, the new Nest Protect will test itself using a built-in microphone.

===Nest Cam Indoor===
In June 2014, Nest acquired Dropcam, maker of the Dropcam security camera. In June 2015, Nest announced the Nest Cam, an upgraded and rebranded security camera based on the Dropcam. Features are a 1080p video resolution, a rotating, magnetic stand, night vision, two-way talk, sound and motion alerts, and optional Nest Aware cloud services for an additional fee. It was renamed Nest Cam Indoor following the announcement of the Nest Cam Outdoor in July 2016. In 2021, Google announced the second-generation Nest Cam Indoor, which is either battery-powered or wired.<ref name="NestSummer2021" />

Several security flaws with Nest Cam products were reported in March 2017, allowing a burglar to hack the camera's always-on [[Bluetooth]] signal and stop recording.<ref name="Security Flaw">{{cite web|url=https://www.bitdefender.com/box/blog/iot-news/triple-flaw-nests-dropcam-opens-door-burglars/|title=riple Flaw in Nest's Dropcam Opens the Door to Burglars|last=Arsene|first=Liviu|date=March 21, 2017|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Security Flaw Fix" /> Nest released a security update later that month that fixed the vulnerabilities.<ref name="Security Flaw Fix">{{cite web|url=https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-cams-have-brutal-bug-will-be-fixed-coming-days|title=That potentially dangerous Nest Cam bug has been fixed|last=Bader|first=Daniel|date=March 31, 2017|work=androidcentral.com|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref>

===Nest Cam Outdoor===
Nest Cam Outdoor was announced in July 2016 and is a version of the Nest Cam adapted for outdoor monitoring. The main differences from the Nest Cam Indoor is in its design which is built to withstand outdoor conditions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/nest-cam-iq-outdoor-premium-hardware-and-clever-software-make-for-a-smart-security-package/|title=Nest Cam IQ Outdoor: Premium hardware and clever software make for a smart security package {{!}} ZDNet|last=Ranger|first=Steve|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> In 2021, Google announced the second-generation, battery-powered Nest Cam Outdoor.<ref name="NestSummer2021" />

===Nest Cam IQ===
Nest Cam IQ was announced in June 2017 and is a more premium model of their Nest Cam Indoor. It features a 4K camera sensor with HDR. It also comes with the ability to recognize and distinguish between different faces when using the Nest Aware service. It also has several minor upgrades, such as better wi-fi connectivity, brighter infrared LEDs, a more powerful speaker in addition to added microphones, and a close-up tracking view, which zooms in on action occurring within view of the camera.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.google.com/us/category/nest_cams|title=Nest Indoor & Outdoor Security Cameras|website=Google Store}}</ref>

In February 2019, the Nest Guard received an update to add Google Assistant, allowing it to effectively double as a [[smart speaker]] similar to [[Google Home]] for general voice commands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/02/06/your-nest-secure-becomes-an-assistant-integrated-smart-speaker-starting-today/|title=[Update: Setup video, opt-in confirmed] Your Nest Secure becomes an Assistant-integrated smart speaker starting today|date=2019-02-06|website=Android Police|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> This addition has faced criticism, as the presence of a microphone inside the device was not adequately disclosed in product specifications. Google stated that its inclusion of a microphone was accidentally not included in the listed specifications, and was originally intended to enable future sensor functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/20/18232960/google-nest-secure-microphone-google-assistant-built-in-security-privacy|title=Google claims built-in Nest mic was 'never intended to be a secret'|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-02-20|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

===Nest Cam with Floodlight===
In 2021, Google announced the Nest Cam with Floodlight, a version of the [[#Nest Cam Outdoor|Nest Cam Outdoor]] equipped with two [[floodlights]] on each side.<ref name="NestSummer2021" />

== Works with Nest ==
Works with Nest was a program that allowed third party devices to communicate with Nest products, such as virtual assistants, along with many third-party home automation platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/05/nest-camera-integration-google-assistant-already-live/|title=Nest camera integration with Google Assistant is already live|last=Whitwam|first=Ryan|date=5 October 2017|work=Android Police|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-alexa-voice-control-for-nests-thermostat-is-live-25433548/|title=Amazon Alexa voice control for Nest's Thermostat is live|last=Davies|first=Chris|date=25 March 2016|work=[[SlashGear]]|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> Additionally, many smart device manufacturers have direct integration with the Nest platform, including [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] and [[GE Appliances]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.techhive.com/article/2864412/whirlpool-s-new-washers-talk-to-nest-while-you-re-away.html|title=Whirlpool's new washers talk to Nest while you're away|last=McGarry|first=Caitlin|date=4 January 2015|work=[[TechHive]]|access-date=2 September 2018|publisher=[[International Data Group]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Thompson|first=Ashlee Clark|date=3 January 2017|title=Is something burning?

On May 7, 2019, it was announced that Works with Nest would be discontinued effective August 31, 2019. Users are being directed to migrate to [[Google account]]s and [[Google Assistant]] integration instead; doing so will remove the ability to use Works with Nest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nest.com/whats-happening/|title=What's happening at Nest?|last=Nest|website=Nest|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-works-with-nest-discontinued-1203207335/|title=Google Discontinues 'Works With Nest' Program, Tightens Smart Home Privacy Rules|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=2019-05-07|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref> Google stated that this change was for security and privacy reasons; as third-party devices may only integrate with the Nest ecosystem via Google Assistant, they will be heavily restricted in the amount of personal data and access to devices they will have access to. Google stated that it would give "a small number of thoroughly vetted partners" access to additional data.<ref name="verge-noworkswithnest"/>

The change faced criticism for potentially resulting in a loss of functionality: vendors such as Lutron and [[SimpliSafe]] announced that their products' integration with the Nest platform (which allow them to be tied to the thermostat's home and away modes) would be affected by this change, while Google explicitly named [[IFTTT]] as a service that could not be integrated due to the amount of access it would need to operate.<ref name="verge-noworkswithnest"/> ''[[The Verge]]'' estimated that affected devices would also include [[Philips Hue]], [[Logitech Harmony]], Lutron lights, [[August Home]], and [[Belkin Wemo]] switches. Furthermore, ''The Verge'' argued that this change created a [[closed platform]], and would lead to [[Market fragmentation|fragmentation]] of the smart home market by potentially blocking integration with products that directly compete with those of Google.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="verge-noworkswithnest">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537331/google-nest-cancellation-assistant-smart-home-integration-report|title=Google's Nest changes risk making the smart home a little dumber|last=Seifert|first=Dan|date=2019-05-09|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>

On May 16, 2019, Google clarified its deprecation plans for Works with Nest: existing integrations will not be disabled after August 31, but users will no longer be able to add new ones, and the service will only receive maintenance updates going forward. Google also stated that it was working on replicating Nest platform functions as part of Assistant, such as integrating Nest's Home/Away triggers into the "Routines" system, and maintaining integration between Nest and Amazon Alexa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reverses-course-on-cutting-off-works-with-nest-connections/|title=Google reverses course on cutting off Works with Nest connections|last=Gebhart|first=Andrew|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627719/google-works-with-nest-shutdown-clarification-statement-update|title=Google clarifies Works with Nest shutdown, provides extension on existing connections|last=Seifert|first=Dan|date=2019-05-16|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>

==Litigation==
In February 2012, [[Honeywell]] filed a lawsuit claiming that some of its patents had been infringed by Nest.

In April 2012, Nest stated they believe that none of the allegedly infringed patents were actually violated. Honeywell claimed that Nest infringed on patents pertaining to remotely controlling a thermostat, power-stealing thermostats, and thermostats designed around a circular, interactive design, similar to the [[Honeywell T87]]. However, Honeywell held patents that were almost identical to those that expired in 2004.

===Parody after Google acquisition===

On May 7, 2014, German activist group [[Peng Collective]] released a parody website named ''Google Nest'', satirizing Google's privacy policies and practices with fake products imitating Google art style, supposedly created as a result of "an intensive period of studying user behavior" in response to the "[[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|public debate around privacy]] and [[Global surveillance|government surveillance]]".<ref name="googlenest">{{cite web | url=http://google-nest.org/ | title=Google Nest | access-date=22 May 2014 | archive-date=May 7, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507171628/http://google-nest.org/}}</ref><ref name="fastcocreate">{{cite web|title=How activists fooled the internet with these convincing new Google Nest products|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3030418/how-activists-fooled-the-internet-with-these-convincing-new-google-nest-products|last=Hullinger|first=Jessica|date=2014-05-09|website=Fast Co.Create|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|access-date=2014-05-22}}</ref><ref name="Forbes">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/05/07/google-nest-spoof-by-german-activists-promises-eerie-data-driven-future/ | title=Google Nest Spoof By German Activists Promises Eerie, Data-Driven Future | magazine=Forbes | access-date=22 May 2014 | author=Ellen Huet}}</ref> The site described four purported new services lampooning Google's data gathering tendencies made possible with Nest's technology: ''Google Trust, Google Hug, Google Bee'' and ''Google Bye'', respectively a "data insurance" paid with personal data, a [[Location-based service|location service]] encouraging in-person emotional interactions, a "personal [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]", and a memorial website created from automatically collected information.<ref name="techcrunch">{{cite web|title=Google Nest Parody Protest Site Holds A Funhouse Mirror Up To The Search Giant|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/07/google-nest-parody-protest-site-holds-a-funhouse-mirror-up-to-the-search-giant/|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=7 May 2014|website=[[Tech Crunch]]|access-date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

The next day, Google trademark lawyers issued a [[cease-and-desist]] letter to Peng, asking them to change the site and to transfer the [[domain name]] to Google.<ref name="arstechnica">{{cite web|title=Google scolded for "polite trademark bullying" of parody site|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/google-scolded-for-polite-trademark-bullying-of-parody-site/|last=Mullin|first=Joe|date=21 May 2014|website=Ars Technica|access-date=22 May 2014}}</ref> The site replaced its content with a note explaining the situation, and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] responded on behalf of Peng with a public letter saying that noncommercial political commentary is not prohibited under [[trademark law]],<ref name=arstechnica/> and that the site would not likely be confused after the ample press coverage received.<ref name="EFF">{{cite web|title=Re: google-nest.org|url=https://www.eff.org/files/2014/05/20/google-nest.org_correspondence_from_c._mcsherry_copy.pdf|last=McSherry|first=Corynne|date=2014-05-20|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==
Per the terms of service, Google will provide law enforcement with Nest data “[i]f we reasonably believe that we can prevent someone from dying or from suffering serious physical harm…for example, in the case of bomb threats, school shootings, kidnappings, suicide prevention, and missing person cases.” In certain situations, this may be done without a warrant.<ref>[https://petapixel.com/2022/07/27/googles-nest-will-provide-data-to-police-without-a-warrant/ Google’s Nest Will Provide Data to Police Without a Warrant]</ref>
