==Plot summary==

After the events of ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'', [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Jean le Flambeur|Jean le Flambeur]] and [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Mieli|Mieli]] are on their way to Earth. Jean is trying to open the Schrödinger's Box he retrieved from the memory palace on the Oubliette. After making little progress, he is prodded by the ship ''[[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Perhonen|Perhonen]]'' to talk to Mieli, who turns out to be possessed by the pellegrini again. This time, Jean identifies Mieli's employer as a Sobornost Founder, [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Joséphine Pellegrini|Joséphine Pellegrini]], and gets her to reveal how he got captured, thereby picking up the clues to make plans for his next heist. No sooner is that done than an attack comes from [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Engineer-of-Souls|the Hunter]]. The ship and crew barely survived that, and Jean realizes that he has to find a better way to open the Box - fast.

Mieli has been very quiet after they left Mars. She has given up almost everything to the pellegrini, even her identity, as she has promised to let the pellegrini make [[Glossary of terms in the Jean le Flambeur series#Gogols|gogols]] of her in exchange for rescuing the thief. Yet, having to work with the thief is testing her, especially when the thief eventually does something even more unforgivable than stealing [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Sydän|Sydän's]] jewel from her.

In the city of Sirr, on an Earth ravaged by [[Glossary of terms in the Jean le Flambeur series#Wildcode|wildcode]], [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Tawaddud Gomelez|Tawaddud]] and [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Dunyazad Gomelez|Dunyazad]] are sisters and members of the powerful Gomelez family. Tawaddud is the black sheep of the family, having run away from her husband and consorted with a notorious jinn, a disembodied intelligence from the wildcode desert. Now [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Cassar Gomelez|Cassar Gomelez]], her father, hopes to get her to curry favor with a gogol merchant, [[List of characters in the Jean le Flambeur series#Abu Nuwas|Abu Nuwas]], so that he has enough votes in the Council for the upcoming decision to renegotiate the [[Glossary of terms in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Cry of Wrath Accords|Cry of Wrath Accords]] with the [[Glossary of terms in the Jean le Flambeur series#The Sobornost|Sobornost]]. Soon, Tawaddud is embroiled in an investigation with a Sobornost envoy into the murder that triggered the need for her father to forge a new alliance in the first place, and forced to confront old secrets that will change Sirr forever.

Somewhere else, in a bookshop and on a beach, a young boy is at play. His mother has told him not to talk to strangers, but there has never been anyone here before. Until now. Should he talk to them?

==Influences==

In the acknowledgments, Rajaniemi cites the influence of "[[Andy Clark#The Extended Mind|Andy Clark]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Maurice Leblanc]], [[Jan Potocki]] and [...] ''[[The Arabian Nights]]''."

===Self-loops===

In the novel, the idea that the mind is a self-loop may have been influenced by the theories of the Professor of Philosophy, Andy Clark, and the book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' by Douglas Hofstadter.

===Frame stories===

The novel uses [[Frame story|frame stories]] rather extensively, a feature also of ''The Arabian Nights'' and Jan Potocki's [[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]. Several characters in Sirr are the namesakes of characters in these two earlier works as well. The events in ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' are also retold at least once by Jean le Flambeur in the course of the events in this novel.

==Reception==

The novel has received generally positive reviews.<ref name="PDF">{{Cite web| url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/The-Speculator/The-Fractal-Prince/ba-p/9815| title=The Fractal Prince | author=Paul Di Filippo | author-link=Paul Di Filippo | publisher=Barnes and Noble Review | accessdate=2013-02-04}}</ref><ref name="geekchock">{{Cite web| url=http://geekchocolate.co.uk/the-fractal-prince-hannu-rajaniemi/| title=The Fractal Prince - Hannu Rajaniemi | author=Michael Flett | publisher=Geek Chocolate | accessdate=2013-02-04}}</ref><ref name="Adam Roberts">{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/26/fractal-prince-hannu-rajaniemi-review| title=The Fractal Prince by Hannu Rajaniemi – review| author=Adam Roberts| author-link=Adam Roberts (British writer)| publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2013-02-04| location=London| date=2012-09-26}}</ref>

However, criticisms of the novel still revolve around Rajaniemi's uncompromising "[[show, don't tell]]" style. For example, Amy Goldschlager, writing for the [[Los Angeles Review of Books]], suggested that "[a] bit more explication of the physics involved (“surfing the [[Glossary of terms in the Jean le Flambeur series#Deficit angle|deficit angle]]”?) would really be helpful, more helpful than the description of the [[Schrödinger’s cat|Schrödinger’s Cat]] problem given earlier in the book".<ref name="Goldschlager">{{Cite web| url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=1206| title=A Puzzle Box of a Quest Fantasy | author=Amy Goldschlager | publisher=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]] | accessdate=2013-02-04}}</ref>
