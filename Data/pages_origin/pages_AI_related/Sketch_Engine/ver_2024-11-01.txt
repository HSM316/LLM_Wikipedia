'''Sketch Engine''' is a [[corpus manager]] and [[text analysis]] [[software]] developed by Lexical Computing since 2003. Its purpose is to enable people studying [[language]] behaviour ([[lexicographers]], researchers in [[corpus linguistics]], [[Translation|translators]] or [[Language acquisition|language learners]]) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. Sketch Engine gained its name after one of the key features, [[word sketch]]es: one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Baisa|first2=Vít|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Jakubíček|first4=Miloš|last5=Kovář|first5=Vojtěch|last6=Michelfeit|first6=Jan|last7=Rychlý|first7=Pavel|last8=Suchomel|first8=Vít|title=The Sketch Engine: ten years on|journal=Lexicography|date=10 July 2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–36|doi=10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|issn=2197-4292|doi-access=free}}</ref> Currently, it supports and provides corpora in over 90 languages.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=7 June 2016 |title=Languages in Sketch Engine |url=https://www.sketchengine.eu/user-guide/user-manual/corpora/by-language/ |access-date=22 January 2018 |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing CZ s.r.o.}}</ref>

== History of development ==
Sketch Engine is a product of Lexical Computing, a company founded in 2003 by the lexicographer and research scientist [[Adam Kilgarriff]].<ref>[http://kilgarriff.co.uk Adam Kilgarriff's home page]</ref> He started a collaboration with Pavel Rychlý, a computer scientist working at the Natural Language Processing Centre, [[Masaryk University]],<ref>[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz Natural Language Processing Centre, Masaryk University]</ref> and the developer of Manatee and Bonito (two major parts of the software suite). Kilgarriff also introduced the concept of [[word sketch]]es.

Since then, Sketch Engine has been commercial software, however, all the core features of Manatee and Bonito that were developed by 2003 (and extended since then) are freely available under the [[GPL]] license within the NoSketch Engine suite.<ref>[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske NoSketch Engine]</ref>

== Features ==
A list of tools available in Sketch Engine:
* [[Word sketch]]es – a one-page automatic derived summary of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour
* Word sketch difference – compares and contrasts two words by analysing their collocations
* Distributional [[thesaurus]] – automated thesaurus for finding words with similar meaning or appearing in the same/similar context
* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] search – finds occurrences of a [[word]] form, [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], phrase, [[Part-of-speech tagging|tag]] or complex structure
* [[Collocation]] search – word co-occurrence analysis displaying the most frequent words (for a search word) which can be regarded as collocation candidates
* [[Word list|Word lists]] – generates frequency lists which can be filtered with complex criteria
* [[n-gram]]s – generates frequency lists of multi-word expressions
* [[Terminology extraction|Terminology]] / [[Keyword (linguistics)|Keyword]] extraction (both monolingual and bilingual) – automatic extraction of key words and multi-word terms from texts (based on frequency count and linguistic criteria)
* Diachronic analysis ([[Trend analysis|Trends]])<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Herman|first2=Ondřej|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Jakubíček|first5=Miloš|title=DIACRAN: a framework for diachronic analysis|journal=Corpus Linguistics 2015|date=2015|pages=65–70|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Diacran_CL2015.pdf}}</ref> – detecting words which undergo changes in the frequency of use in time (show trending words)
* Corpus building and management – create corpora from [[World Wide Web|the Web]] or uploaded texts including [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[lemmatization]] which can be used as [[data mining]] software
* [[Parallel corpus]] (bilingual) facilities – looking up translation examples ([[EUR-Lex]] corpus, [[Europarl corpus]], OPUS corpus, etc.) or building a parallel corpus from own [[Word alignment (linguistics)|aligned texts]]
* Text type analysis – statistics of metadata in the corpus

=== Keywords and terminology extraction ===
Sketch Engine can perform automatic [[Terminology extraction|term extraction]] by identifying words typical of a particular corpus, document, or text. Single words and multi-word units can be extracted from monolingual or bilingual texts. The terminology extraction feature provides a list of relevant terms based on comparison with a large corpus of general language. This functionality is also available as a separate service called [https://terms.sketchengine.eu/ OneClick Terms] with a dedicated interface.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baisa|first1=Vít|title=Simplifying terminology extraction: OneClick Terms|journal=Proceedings of the 9th International Corpus Linguistics Conference|date=2017|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2017/general/paper385.pdf}}</ref>

=== SKELL ===
A free web service based on Sketch Engine and aimed at [[Language acquisition|language learners]] and [[Language education|teachers]] is SKELL (formerly ''SkELL''). It exploits Sketch Engine's proprietary GDEX (Good Dictionary Examples) scoring function to provide authentic example sentences for specific target words. Results are drawn from a special corpus of high-quality texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language and displayed as a [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]]. SKELL also includes simplified versions of Sketch Engine's [[word sketch]] and [[thesaurus]] functions.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Baisa |first1=Vít |last2=Suchomel |first2=Vít |date=2014 |title=SkELL:Web Interface for English Language Learning |url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/raslan14.pdf#page=71 |journal=Eighth Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing |publisher=NLP Consulting |pages=63–70}}</ref>

It has been suggested that SKELL can be used, for instance, to help students understand the meaning and/or usage of a word or phrase; to help teachers wanting to use example sentences in a class; to discover and explore [[Collocation|collocates]]; to create [[Cloze test|gap-fill exercises]]; to teach various kinds of [[Homonym|homonyms]] and [[Polysemy|polysemous words]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Michael H. |date=2016-04-07 |title=SkELL: Easy to use for teachers and students |url=https://corpling4efl.wordpress.com/2016/04/07/skell-easy-to-use-for-teachers-and-students/ |access-date=2018-12-03 |work=Corpus Linguistics 4 EFL |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Michael H. |date=2016-04-19 |title=SkELL: Homonymy and Polysemy |url=https://corpling4efl.wordpress.com/2016/04/19/skell-homonymy-and-polysemy/ |access-date=2018-12-03 |work=Corpus Linguistics 4 EFL |language=en-US}}</ref> SKELL was first presented in 2014, when only [[English language|English]] was supported.<ref name=":0" /> Later, support was added for [[Russian language|Russian]],<ref>Valentina, A., Vitalevna, B.

== List of text corpora ==
Sketch Engine provides access to more than 700 text corpora. There are monolingual as well as multilingual corpora of different sizes (from thousand of words up to 60 billions of words) and various sources (e.g. web, books, subtitles, legal documents). The list of corpora includes [[British National Corpus]], [[Brown Corpus]], [[Cambridge English Corpus|Cambridge Academic English Corpus]] and Cambridge Learner Corpus, [[CHILDES]] corpora of child language, OpenSubtitles (a set of 60 parallel corpora), 24 multilingual corpora of [[EUR-Lex]] documents, the [[TenTen Corpus Family]] (multi-billion web corpora), and Trends corpora (monitor corpora with daily updates).

== Architecture ==
[[File:Thesaurus in Sketch Engine.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Sketch Engine thesaurus page|Thesaurus cloud of the lemma ''work'' in Sketch Engine]]

Sketch Engine consists of three main components: an underlying [[database management system]] called Manatee, a web interface search front-end called Bonito, and a web interface for corpus building and management called Corpus Architect.
<ref name="bonito">{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|title=Manatee/bonito–a modular corpus manager|journal=1st Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2007|pages=65–70|url=http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2007/raslan07.pdf#page=73}}</ref>

=== Manatee ===

Manatee is a [[database management system]] specifically devised for effective indexing of large text corpora. It is based on the idea of [[inverted index]]ing (keeping an index of all positions of a given word in the text). It has been used to index text corpora comprising tens of billions of words.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pomikálek|first1=Jan|last2=Jakubíček|first2=Miloš|last3=Rychlý|first3=Pavel|title=Building a 70 billion word corpus of English from ClueWeb|journal=Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'12)|date=2012|url=http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/1047_Paper.pdf}}</ref>

Searching corpora indexed by Manatee is performed by formulating queries in the Corpus Query Language (CQL).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ |title=CQL – Corpus Query Language |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 15 May 2015|website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing CZ s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>

Manatee is written in [[C++]] and offers an [[API]] for a number of other programming languages including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Recently, it was rewritten into [[Go (programming language)|Go]] for faster processing of corpus queries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|last2=Rábara|first2=Radoslav|title=Concurrent Processing of Text Corpus Queries|journal=Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2015|pages=49–58|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Concurrent_Processing_2015.pdf}}</ref>

=== Bonito ===

Bonito is a web interface for Manatee providing access to corpus search. In the [[client–server model]], Manatee is the server and Bonito plays the client part. It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref name="bonito" />

=== Corpus Architect ===

Corpus Architect is a web interface providing corpus building and management features. It is also written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Applications ==
Sketch Engine has been used by major [[United Kingdom|British]] and other publishing houses for producing dictionaries such as [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]], [[Dictionnaires Le&nbsp;Robert]], [[Oxford University Press]] or [[Shogakukan]]. Four of United Kingdom's five biggest dictionary publishers use Sketch Engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=39760 |title=Using Computational Lexicography for Dictionary Production with the Sketch Engine
