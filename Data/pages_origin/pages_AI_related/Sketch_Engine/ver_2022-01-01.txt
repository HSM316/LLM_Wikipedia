'''Sketch Engine''' is a corpus manager and [[text analysis]] software developed by Lexical Computing Limited since 2003. Its purpose is to enable people studying language behaviour ([[lexicographers]], researchers in  [[corpus linguistics]], translators or language learners) to search large text collections according to complex and linguistically motivated queries. Sketch Engine gained its name after one of the key features, [[word sketch]]es: one-page, automatic, corpus-derived summaries of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Baisa|first2=Vít|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Jakubíček|first4=Miloš|last5=Kovář|first5=Vojtěch|last6=Michelfeit|first6=Jan|last7=Rychlý|first7=Pavel|last8=Suchomel|first8=Vít|title=The Sketch Engine: ten years on|journal=Lexicography|date=10 July 2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–36|doi=10.1007/s40607-014-0009-9|issn=2197-4292|doi-access=free}}</ref> Currently, it supports and provides corpora in 90+ languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/user-guide/user-manual/corpora/by-language/ |title= Languages in Sketch Engine |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>

== History of development ==
Sketch Engine is a product of Lexical Computing Limited, a company founded in 2003 by the lexicographer and research scientist [[Adam Kilgarriff]].<ref>[http://kilgarriff.co.uk Adam Kilgarriff's home page]</ref> He started collaboration with Pavel Rychlý, a computer scientist working at the Natural Language Processing Centre at [[Masaryk University]]<ref>[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz Natural Language Processing Centre, Masaryk University]</ref> and the developer of Manatee and Bonito (two major parts of the software suite), and introduced the concept of [[word sketch]]es.

Since then, Sketch Engine has been commercial software, however all the core features of Manatee and Bonito that were developed by 2003 (and extended since then) are freely available under the [[GPL]] license within the NoSketch Engine suite.<ref>[http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske NoSketch Engine]</ref>

== Features ==
* [[Word sketch]]es – a one-page automatic derived summary of a word's grammatical and collocational behaviour
* Word sketch difference – compares and contrasts two words by analysing their collocation
* Distributional [[Thesaurus]] – automated thesaurus finding words with similar meaning or appearing in the same/similar context
* [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] search – finds examples of a word form, lemma, phrase, tag or complex structure
* [[Collocation]] search – word co-occurrence analysis displaying the most frequent words (to a search word) which can be regarded as collocation candidates
* Word lists – generates frequency lists which can be filtered with complex criteria
* [[n-gram]]s – generates frequency lists of multi-word expressions
* [[Terminology extraction|Terminology]] / [[Keyword (linguistics)|Keyword]] extraction (both monolingual and bilingual) – automatic extraction key words and multi-word terms from texts (based on frequency count and linguistic criteria)
* Diachronic analysis ([[Trend analysis|Trends]])<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=Adam|last2=Herman|first2=Ondřej|last3=Bušta|first3=Jan|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Jakubíček|first5=Miloš|title=DIACRAN: a framework for diachronic analysis|journal=Corpus Linguistics 2015|date=2015|pages=65–70|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Diacran_CL2015.pdf}}</ref> – detecting words which undergo changes in the frequency of use in time (show trending words)
* Corpus building and management – create corpora from the Web or uploaded texts including [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[lemmatization]] which can be used as [[data mining]] software
* [[Parallel corpus]] (bilingual) facilities – looking up translation examples (EUR-Lex corpus, [[Europarl corpus]], OPUS corpus, etc.) or building parallel corpus from own aligned texts

== Architecture ==

Sketch Engine consists of three main components: an underlying [[database management system]] called Manatee, a web interface search front-end called Bonito and a web interface for corpus building and management called Corpus Architect.
<ref name="bonito">{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|title=Manatee/bonito–a modular corpus manager|journal=1st Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2007|pages=65–70|url=http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/2007/raslan07.pdf#page=73}}</ref>

=== Manatee ===

Manatee is a [[database management system]] specifically devised for effective indexing of large text corpora. It is based on the idea of [[inverted index]]ing (keeping an index of all positions of a given word in the text). It has been used to index text corpora comprising tens of billions of words.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pomikálek|first1=Jan|last2=Jakubíček|first2=Miloš|last3=Rychlý|first3=Pavel|title=Building a 70 billion word corpus of English from ClueWeb|journal=Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'12)|date=2012|url=http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/1047_Paper.pdf}}</ref>

Searching corpora indexed by Manatee is performed by formulating queries in the Corpus Query Language (CQL).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/corpus-querying/ |title=CQL – Corpus Query Language |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Sketch Engine |publisher=Lexical Computing s.r.o. |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>

Manatee is written in [[C++]] and offers an [[API]] for a number of other programming languages including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Recently, it was rewritten into [[Go (programming language)|Go]] for faster processing of corpus queries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rychlý|first1=Pavel|last2=Rábara|first2=Radoslav|title=Concurrent Processing of Text Corpus Queries|journal=Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2015|pages=49–58|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Concurrent_Processing_2015.pdf}}</ref>

=== Bonito ===

Bonito is a web interface for Manatee providing access to corpus search. In the [[client–server model]], Manatee is the server and Bonito plays the client part. It is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref name="bonito" />

=== Corpus Architect ===

Corpus Architect is a web interface providing corpus building and management features. It is also written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

== Applications ==
Sketch Engine has been used by major British or other publishing houses for producing dictionaries such as [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]], [[Dictionnaires Le&nbsp;Robert]], [[Oxford University Press]] or [[Shogakukan]] and four of the UK's five biggest dictionary publishers use Sketch Engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=39760 |title=Using Computational Lexicography for Dictionary Production with the Sketch Engine
