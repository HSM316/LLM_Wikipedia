The original focus was on standardizing technical data definitions for capital intensive projects at the handover from the [[EPC (contract)|EPC]] contractor to the owner/operators of onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities. The program was sponsored by [[The Research Council of Norway]], two [[EPC (contract)|EPC]] contractors ([[Aker Maritime]] and [[Kværner]]), three owners/operators ([[Norsk Hydro]], [[Saga Petroleum]] and [[Statoil]]) and [[DNV]] as service provider and project owner.

=== POSC Caesar project ===
During the period 1994-96, Caesar Offshore Program was defined as a project of [[POSC|Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC)]] (now [[Energistics]]), and changed its name to the '''POSC Caesar Project'''.<ref name="PCAHis"/><ref name=POSCStatus98/><ref name="Pein"/><ref name="Stanley"/>

In 1995 the project was joined by [[BP]], [[Brown and Root]] and [[Elf Aquitaine]] and in 1997 by [[Intergraph]], [[IBM]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Lloyd's]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[ABB Group|ABB]] and [http://www.umoe.no/ UMOE Technologies].<ref name=POSCStatus98/>

During that time, POSC Caesar also became a member of European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE) where it collaborates with PISTEP (UK), and USPI-NL (The Netherlands) on the development of [[ISO 10303]], also known as "Standard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP)."

=== POSC Caesar Association ===
In 1997, POSC Caesar Association was founded as an independent, global, non-profit, member organization. POSC Caesar Association serves an international membership and collaborates with other international organizations. It has its main office in Norway.

Albeit the name of POSC Caesar Association still hints to its past as a project within the [[POSC|Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC)]] (now [[Energistics]]<ref name="POSCEnergistics">

== Activities and services ==

=== Initiator and custodian of ISO 15926 ===

In consultation with the other EPISTLE members and the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]], it was decided in 2003 (some say already in 1997{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) that for modeling-technical reasons it was better to discontinue the development of [[ISO 10303]]<ref name="SC4Legacy">

|accessdate=2009-08-05
}}</ref> and to initiate the development of [[ISO 15926]] "Integration of life-cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities."

Over the years, the scope of the standard has increased from the initial capital-intensive projects in the [[Upstream (oil industry)|upstream oil and gas industry]], to include also relevant terminology for [[Downstream (oil industry)|downstream oil and gas industry]] applications and to deal with real-time data related to the actual oil and gas production.

[[ISO 15926]] has also over the years evolved from a dictionary (a list of terms with definitions), over a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] (added hierarchy) to an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] (a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts). [[ISO 15926]] is therefore sometimes nicknamed the "Oil and Gas Ontology.",<ref name="OLFIOOntology">

to get to better interoperability, an optimal use of all available data across boundaries and an increase in efficiency. This is what some call the next generation of [[Integrated Operations]].<ref name="OLFIOOntology"/>

=== Reference data services ===
Placeholders:
* Flow scheme of WIP - RDS - ISO and role of SIGs
* RDS
* Standards in database pilot (ISO)

=== Special interest groups ===
Placeholders:
* Overview of SIGs
* Drilling and Completion
* Reservoir and Production
* Operations and Maintenance

== Projects ==
There are a number of projects (co-)organized by POSC Caesar Association working on the extension of the [[ISO 15926]] standard in different application areas.

=== Capital intensive projects application domain ===
The following projects are running at the moment (August 2009):

* The ADI Project of FIATECH, to build the tools (which will then be made available in the public domain)
* The IDS Project of POSC Caesar Association, to define product models required for data sheets
* A joint collaboration project between FIATECH POSC Caesar Association is the ADI-IDS project is the [[ISO 15926 WIP]]

=== Upstream oil and gas industry application domain ===
The following projects are currently running (August 2009):

* The [[Integrated Operations in the High North|Integrated Operations in the High North (IOHN)]] project is working on extending ISO 15926 to handle real-time data transmission and (pre-)processing to enable the next generation of [[Integrated operations|Integrated Operations]].<ref>

* The Environment Web project to include environmental reporting terms and definitions as used in EPIM's EnvironmentWeb in ISO 15926.

Finalised projects include:

* The Integrated Information Platform (IIP) project working on establishing a real-time information pipeline based on open standards. It worked among others on:
** Daily Drilling Report (DDR) to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard became mandatory on February 1, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |title=Drilling Reporting to the authorities |author=Norwegian Petroleum Directorate |accessdate=2009-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726004215/http://www.npd.no/English/Produkter+og+tjenester/Skjemaer/CDRS_reporting_oct_2007.htm |archive-date=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> for reporting on the [[Norwegian Continental Shelf]] by the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate|Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD)]] and Safety Authority Norway (PSA). NPD says that the quality of the reports has improved considerably since.
** Daily Production Report (DPR) to including all terms and definitions in ISO 15926. This standard was tested successfully on the [[Valhall oil field|Valhall]] ([[BP]]-operated) and Åsgard ([[StatoilHydro]]-operated) fields offshore Norway. The terminology and XML schemata developed have also been included in [http://www.Energistics.org Energistics]’ [[PRODML]] standard.
