'''''Kasparov's Gambit''''', or simply '''''Gambit''''', is a [[chess]] playing [[computer program]] created by Heuristic Software and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1993 based on [[Socrates II]], the only winner of the [[North American Computer Chess Championship]] running on a common [[microcomputer]].<ref>Wall, Bill.

==History==
[[Julio Kaplan]], chessplayer, computer programmer, and owner of the company 'Heuristic Software', first developed [[Human-computer chess matches#Harvard Cup (1989–1995)|Heuristic Alpha]] in 1990–91.<ref>[http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Heuristic+Alpha Heuristic Alpha]. CPW Chess Programming Wiki. Consulted on September 19, 2012.</ref> The original version evolved into ''[[Human-computer chess matches#Harvard Cup (1989–1995)|Socrates]]'' with the help of other chess players and programmers including [[Larry Kaufman]] and [[Don Dailey]], who, later, were also developers of ''Kasparov's Gambit''.<ref>Julio Kaplan [http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Julio+Kaplan Chess Programming Wiki] Retrieved on September 6, 2012</ref>

Improvements to ''Socrates'' were reflected in a version called ''Titan'', renamed for competition as ''[[Socrates II]]'',<ref>Socrates. [http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Socrates Chess Programming Wiki] Retrieved on September 6, 2012</ref> the most successful of the series winning the 1993 ACM International Chess Championship.<ref>ACM 1993 [http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/ACM+1993 Chess Programming Wiki]. Retrieved on September 6, 2012</ref> During the course of the championship ''Socrates II'', which was running on a stock [[80486|486]] PC, defeated opponents with purpose-built hardware and software for playing chess, including [[HiTech]]<ref>HiTech [http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Hitech Chess Programming Wiki].

Electronic Arts purchased ''Socrates II'' and hired its creators to build a new product, ''Kasparov's Gambit'', including Kasparov as consultant and brand. It was the company's effort to enter the chess programs market, dominated at the time by ''[[Chessmaster 3000]]'' and ''[[Cray Blitz|Blitz]]''. In 1993 it went on sale, but contained a number of [[software bug|bugs]], so was [[patch (computing)|patched]] at the end of that year. The patched version ran at about 75% of the speed of ''Socrates II'' which was quite an achievement considering the whole functionality of the software was sharing the same [[computational resource|computer resources]].<ref>Kasparov's Gambit.

In 1993 it competed in the [[Harvard Cup#Harvard Cup (1989–1995)|Harvard Cup]] (six humans versus six programs) facing grandmasters who had ratings ranging from 2515 to 2625 ELO,.<ref>[http://www.365chess.com/players/Comp_Kasparov's_Gambit Comp Kasparov's Gambit]. 365Chess.com.

===Rating===
The human strength rating is calculated using [[Elo rating system|Elo formula]] with the included personalities and the player's own performance, going from 800 to 2800 points. New players get a customizable 800 Elo, which changes according to the total number of games played, opponents' relative strength, and game results.<ref>Schiller, E. "How to get the most out of Gambit". Kasparov's Gambit User's Manual (1993). Electronic Arts. p. 10.</ref>

Creation of personalities enables five adjustable characteristics in percentage (0-100%)—strength, orthodoxy, creativity, focus and aggressiveness—which define, besides its style, its Elo rating.<ref>Kasparov's Gambit Online Help.

===Development===
First intention was using ''Heuristic Alpha'' as ''Gambit'''s base, but unexpected good performance of ''Socrates II'' in tournaments made of it the final choice. According to developer and tester Larry Kauffman<ref name="cite">Kauffman, Larry. (1993). Read in [http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Kasparov's+Gambit#History Kasparov's Gambit History]. Retrieved on September 19, 2012.</ref> "first released included important bugs, that Knowledge of bishop mobility appears to be missing, as does some other chess knowledge, and Gambit appears to run only about 50-60% of the speed of the ACM program in positions (without bishops) where the two do play and evaluate identically. There are also bugs in the features and the time controls, and the program is rather difficult to use (perhaps because it has so many features). One good thing I can say is that the 3d graphics are superb... I have tested the patched version, and have confirmed that most or all of the bugs have been corrected. The new version does play identically to the ACM program and runs at 70-75% of the speed, so it should rate just 30 points below the ACM program."

''Socrates II'' engine was fully programmed in [[assembly language]], but rewritten just in [[C (programming language)|C language]] for ''Kasparov's Gambit'' engine. Instead, assembly language was used for sound and video capabilities, as for other functionalities.
