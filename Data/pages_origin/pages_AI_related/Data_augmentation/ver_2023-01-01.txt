'''Data augmentation''' in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a [[Regularization (mathematics) |regularizer]] and helps reduce [[overfitting]] when training a machine learning model.<ref name="Big Data 2019 6:60">{{cite journal | last1=Shorten | first1=Connor | last2=Khoshgoftaar | first2=Taghi M. | title=A survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning | journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | publisher=springer | volume=6 | year=2019 | doi=10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0 | pages=60 | doi-access=free }}</ref> It is closely related to [[Oversampling and undersampling in data analysis|oversampling]] in data analysis.

=== Introducing new synthetic images ===
If a dataset is very small, then a version augmented with rotation and mirroring etc. may still not be enough for a given problem. Another solution is the sourcing of entirely new, synthetic images through various techniques, for example the use of [[generative adversarial network]]s to create new synthetic images for data augmentation.<ref name="Big Data 2019 6:60"/> Additionally, image recognition algorithms show improvement when transferring from images rendered in virtual environments to real-world data.<ref name="bird2020simulation">{{cite conference |last1=Bird |first1=Jordan J |last2=Faria |first2=Diego R |last3=Ekart |first3=Aniko |last4=Ayrosa |first4=Pedro PS |title=From simulation to reality: CNN transfer learning for scene classification |conference=2020 IEEE 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS) |publisher=IEEE |place=Varna, Bulgaria |date=2020-08-30 |year=2020 |pages=619–625 }}</ref>

== Data augmentation for signal processing ==
[[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Residual or block bootstrap]] can be used for time series augmentation.

=== Biological signals ===
Synthetic data augmentation is of paramount importance for machine learning classification, particularly for biological data, which tend to be high dimensional and scarce. The applications of robotic control and augmentation in disabled and able-bodied subjects still rely mainly on subject-specific analyses. Data scarcity is notable in signal processing problems such as for Parkinson's Disease [[Electromyography]] signals, which are difficult to source - Zanini, et al. noted that it is possible to use a [[Generative adversarial network]] (in particular, a DCGAN) to perform style transfer in order to generate synthetic electromyographic signals that corresponded to those exhibited by sufferers of Parkinson's Disease.<ref name="Anicet ZaniniLuna Colombini2020">{{cite journal|last1=Anicet Zanini|first1=Rafael|last2=Luna Colombini|first2=Esther|title=Parkinson's Disease EMG Data Augmentation and Simulation with DCGANs and Style Transfer|journal=Sensors|volume=20|issue=9|year=2020|pages=2605|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s20092605|pmid=32375217|pmc=7248755|bibcode=2020Senso..20.2605A |doi-access=free}}</ref>

The approaches are also important in [[electroencephalography]] (brainwaves). Wang, et al. explored the idea of using Deep [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition, results show that emotion recognition was improved when data augmentation was used.<ref name="WangZhong2018">{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Fang|last2=Zhong|first2=Sheng-hua|last3=Peng|first3=Jianfeng|last4=Jiang|first4=Jianmin|last5=Liu|first5=Yan|title=Multi ''Media'' Modeling|chapter=Data Augmentation for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=10705|year=2018|pages=82–93|issn=0302-9743|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73600-6_8|isbn=978-3-319-73599-3}}</ref>

It has also been noted that OpenAI's [[GPT-2]] model is capable of learning from, and generating synthetic biological signals such as EEG and EMG.<ref name="BirdPritchard2021">{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=Jordan J.|last2=Pritchard|first2=Michael George|last3=Fratini|first3=Antonio|last4=Ekart|first4=Aniko|last5=Faria|first5=Diego|title=Synthetic Biological Signals Machine-generated by GPT-2 improve the Classification of EEG and EMG through Data Augmentation|journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters|year=2021|volume=6|issue=2|pages=3498–3504|issn=2377-3766|doi=10.1109/LRA.2021.3056355|s2cid=232373183|url=https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/42292/1/09345373.pdf}}</ref> In this study, it was noted that recognition was improved via data augmentation. It was also noted that statistical [[machine learning]] models trained on the synthetic domain could classify the human data, and vice versa. In the image, a comparison is given by some examples of EEG produced by the GPT-2 model and a human brain. 

A common approach is to generate synthetic signals by re-arranging components of real data.

This approach was shown to improve performance of a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier on three different datasets.

Current research shows great impact can be derived from relatively simple techniques. For example, Freer<ref name="FreerYang2020">{{cite journal|last1=Freer|first1=Daniel|last2=Yang|first2=Guang-Zhong|title=Data augmentation for self-paced motor imagery classification with C-LSTM|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=17|issue=1|year=2020|pages=016041|issn=1741-2552|doi=10.1088/1741-2552/ab57c0|pmid=31726440|bibcode=2020JNEng..17a6041F|hdl=10044/1/75376|s2cid=208034533 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> observed that introducing noise into gathered data to form additional data points improved the learning ability of several models which otherwise performed relatively poorly. Tsinganos et al.<ref name="TsinganosCornelis2020">{{cite journal|last1=Tsinganos|first1=Panagiotis|last2=Cornelis|first2=Bruno|last3=Cornelis|first3=Jan|last4=Jansen|first4=Bart|last5=Skodras|first5=Athanassios|title=Data Augmentation of Surface Electromyography for Hand Gesture Recognition|journal=Sensors|volume=20|issue=17|year=2020|pages=4892|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s20174892|pmid=32872508|pmc=7506981|bibcode=2020Senso..20.4892T |doi-access=free}}</ref> studied the approaches of magnitude warping, wavelet decomposition, and synthetic surface EMG models (generative approaches) for hand gesture recognition, finding classification performance increases of up to +16% when augmented data was introduced during training. More recently, data augmentation studies have begun to focus on the field of deep learning, more specifically on the ability of generative models to create artificial data which is then introduced during the classification model training process. In 2018, Luo et al.<ref name="LuoLu2018">{{cite book|last1=Luo|first1=Yun|last2=Lu|first2=Bao-Liang|title=2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)|chapter=EEG Data Augmentation for Emotion Recognition Using a Conditional Wasserstein GAN|journal=Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

The authors found classification performance was improved when such techniques were introduced.
