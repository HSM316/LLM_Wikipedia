'''Data augmentation''' in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a [[Regularization (mathematics) |regularizer]] and helps reduce [[overfitting]] when training a machine learning model.<ref name="Big Data 2019 6:60">{{cite journal | last1=Shorten | first1=Connor | last2=Khoshgoftaar | first2=Taghi M. | title=A survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning | journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | publisher=springer | volume=6 | year=2019 | doi=10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0 | pages=60 | doi-access=free }}</ref> It is closely related to [[Oversampling and undersampling in data analysis|oversampling]] in data analysis.

=== Transformations of images ===
Geometric transformations, flipping, color modification, cropping, rotation, noise injection and random erasing are used to augment image in deep learning.<ref name="Big Data 2019 6:60"/>

=== Adding new synthetic images ===
Because image data usually have too high dimensions for traditional synthetic oversampling methods, new methods are required for creating new synthetic images for deep learning.

[[Generative adversarial network]]s enable to create new synthetic images for data augmentation.<ref name="Big Data 2019 6:60"/>
