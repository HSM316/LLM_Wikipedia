== History ==
The [[Startup company|start-up]] was founded by [[Demis Hassabis]], [[Shane Legg]] and [[Mustafa Suleyman]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-27/google-buys-u-k-artificial-intelligence-company-deepmind.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Google Buys U.K. Artificial Intelligence Company DeepMind | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dfedc62e-874e-11e3-9c5c-00144feab7de.html | title=Google makes £400m move in quest for artificial intelligence | newspaper=Financial Times | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> Hassabis and Legg first met at [[University College London]]'s [[UCL Faculty of Life Sciences|Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Demis Hassabis: 15 facts about the DeepMind Technologies founder|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/jan/28/demis-hassabis-15-facts-deepmind-technologies-founder-google|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>

During one of the interviews, Demis Hassabis said that the start-up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties, which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today. Some of those games included ''Breakout'', ''Pong'' and ''Space Invaders''.  AI was introduced to one game at a time, without any prior knowledge of its rules. After spending some time on learning the game, AI would eventually become an expert in it. “The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/02/02/how-googles-amazing-ai-start-up-deepmind-is-making-our-world-a-smarter-place/#3f5f079ddfff|title=How Google's Amazing AI Start-Up 'DeepMind' Is Making Our World A Smarter Place|last=Marr|first=Bernard|work=Forbes|access-date=30 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The goal of the founders is to create a general-purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything.

=== Deep reinforcement learning ===
As opposed to other AIs, such as [[IBM]]'s [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] or [[Watson (computer)|Watson]], which were developed for a pre-defined purpose and only function within its scope, DeepMind claims that its system is not pre-programmed: it learns from experience, using only raw pixels as data input. Technically it uses [[deep learning]] on a [[convolutional neural network]], with a novel form of [[Q-learning]], a form of model-free [[reinforcement learning]].<ref name="nature2015" /><ref name="Atari Paper">{{cite arXiv|title=Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning |date=12 December 2013 |first1=Volodymyr |last1=Mnih |first2=Koray |last2=Kavukcuoglu |first3=David |last3=Silver |first4=Alex |last4=Graves |first5=Ioannis |last5=Antonoglou |first6=Daan |last6=Wierstra |first7=Martin |last7=Riedmiller |eprint=1312.5602|class=cs.LG }}</ref>  They test the system on video games, notably early [[Arcade Games#Golden Age|arcade games]], such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' or ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''.<ref name="Atari Paper" /><ref name="hassabis talk" /> Without altering the code, the AI begins to understand how to play the game, and after some time plays, for a few games (most notably ''Breakout''), a more efficient game than any human ever could.<ref name="hassabis talk">{{cite AV media|title=Deepmind artificial intelligence @ FDOT14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfGD2qveGdQ|date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

=== AlphaGo and successors ===
{{Main|AlphaGo|Master (software)|AlphaGo Zero|AlphaZero}}
In October 2015, a [[computer Go]] program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the European [[Go (game)|Go]] champion [[Fan Hui]], a [[Go ranks and ratings|2 dan]] (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero.<ref name="bbcgo">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35420579|title=Google achieves AI 'breakthrough' by beating Go champion|date=27 January 2016|author=|newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> This is the first time an artificial intelligence (AI) defeated a professional Go player.<ref name="lemondego">{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/01/27/premiere-defaite-d-un-professionnel-du-go-contre-une-intelligence-artificielle_4854886_4408996.html|title=Première défaite d'un professionnel du go contre une intelligence artificielle|language=French|date=27 January 2016|work=Le Monde}}</ref> Previously, computers were only known to have played Go at "amateur" level.<ref name="bbcgo" /><ref name="googlego">{{cite web|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html|title=Research Blog: AlphaGo: Mastering the ancient game of Go with Machine Learning|date=27 January 2016|author=|work=Google Research Blog}}</ref> Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like [[chess]], due to the much larger number of possibilities, making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as [[Brute-force search|brute-force]].<ref name="bbcgo" /><ref name="googlego" />

In March 2016 it beat [[Lee Sedol]]—a 9th dan Go player and one of the highest ranked players in the world—with a score of 4-1 in a [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol|five-game match]].

In 2017, an improved version, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo 100 games to 0. AlphaGo Zero's strategies were self-taught. AlphaGo Zero was able to beat its predecessor after just three days with less processing power than AlphaGo; in comparison, the original AlphaGo needed months to learn how to play.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41668701|title=Google DeepMind: AI becomes more alien|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=18 October 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Later that year, AlphaZero, a modified version of AlphaGo Zero but for handling any two-player game of perfect information, gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi. Like AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero learned solely through self-play.

==== Technology ====
AlphaGo technology was developed based on the deep [[reinforcement learning]] approach. This makes AlphaGo different from the rest of AI technologies on the market. With that said, AlphaGo's ‘brain’ was introduced to various moves based on the historical tournament data. The number of moves was increased gradually until it eventually processed over 30 million of them. The aim was to have the system mimic the human player and eventually become better. It played against itself and learned not only from its own defeats but wins as well; thus, it learned to improve itself over the time and increased its winning rate as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=3339590|title=Penn State WebAccess Secure Login|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>

AlphaGo used two deep neural networks: a policy network to evaluate move probabilities and a value network to assess positions. The policy network trained via supervised learning, and was subsequently refined by policy-gradient [[reinforcement learning]]. The value network learned to predict winners of games played by the policy network against itself. After training these networks employed a lookahead [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS), using the policy network to identify candidate high-probability moves, while the value network (in conjunction with Monte Carlo rollouts using a fast rollout policy) evaluated tree positions.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Silver|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first2= Julian|last2= Schrittwieser|first3= Karen|last3= Simonyan|first4= Ioannis|last4= Antonoglou|first5= Aja|last5= Huang|author-link5=Aja Huang|first6=Arthur|last6= Guez|first7= Thomas|last7= Hubert|first8= Lucas|last8= Baker|first9= Matthew|last9= Lai|first10= Adrian|last10= Bolton|first11= Yutian|last11= Chen|author-link11=Chen Yutian|first12= Timothy|last12= Lillicrap|first13=Hui|last13= Fan|author-link13=Fan Hui|first14= Laurent|last14= Sifre|first15= George van den|last15= Driessche|first16= Thore|last16= Graepel|first17= Demis|last17= Hassabis |author-link17=Demis Hassabis|title=Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issn= 0028-0836|pages=354–359|volume =550|issue =7676|doi =10.1038/nature24270|pmid=29052630|date=19 October 2017|bibcode=2017Natur.550..354S|url= http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf}}{{closed access}}</ref>

Zero trained using reinforcement learning in which the system played millions of games against itself. Its only guide was to increase its win rate. It did so without learning from games played by humans. Its only input features are the black and white stones from the board. It uses a single neural network, rather than separate policy and value networks. Its simplified tree search relies upon this neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves, without Monte Carlo rollouts. A new reinforcement learning algorithm incorporates lookahead search inside the training loop.<ref name=":0" /> AlphaGo Zero employed around 15 people and millions in computing resources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609141/alphago-zero-shows-machines-can-become-superhuman-without-any-help/|title=The world’s smartest game-playing AI—DeepMind’s AlphaGo—just got way smarter|last=Knight|first=Will|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> Ultimately, it needed much less computing power than AlphaGo, running on four specialized AI processors (Google [[Tensor processing unit|TPUs]]), instead of AlphaGo's 48.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught|title=DeepMind’s Go-playing AI doesn’t need human help to beat us anymore|last=Vincent|first=James|date=18 October 2017|work=The Verge|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref>

=== AlphaFold ===
In 2016 DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to [[protein structure prediction|protein folding]], one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's AlphaFold won the 13th [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins. “This is a lighthouse project, our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental, very important, real-world scientific problem,” Hassabis said to ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/02/google-deepminds-ai-program-alphafold-predicts-3d-shapes-of-proteins|title=Google's DeepMind predicts 3D shapes of proteins|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2018-12-02|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref>

=== WaveNet ===
{{Main|WaveNet}}
Also in 2016, DeepMind introduced WaveNet, a [[text-to-speech]] system. It was originally too computationally intensive for use in consumer products, but in late 2017 it became ready for use in consumer applications such as [[Google Assistant]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Here's Why Google's Assistant Sounds More Realistic Than Ever Before|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/05/google-assistant-deepmind-wavenet-speech-ai/|accessdate=20 January 2018|work=Fortune|date=5 October 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gershgorn|first1=Dave|title=Google’s voice-generating AI is now indistinguishable from humans|url=https://qz.com/1165775/googles-voice-generating-ai-is-now-indistinguishable-from-humans/|accessdate=20 January 2018|work=Quartz}}</ref> In 2018 Google launched a commercial text-to-speech product, Cloud Text-to-Speech, based on WaveNet.<ref name="cnbc money">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/31/how-google-makes-money-from-alphabets-deepmind-ai-research-group.html|title=Google is finding ways to make money from Alphabet's DeepMind A.I. technology|last=Novet|first=Jordan|date=31 March 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing Cloud Text-to-Speech powered by DeepMind WaveNet technology|url=https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/introducing-Cloud-Text-to-Speech-powered-by-Deepmind-WaveNet-technology.html|website=Google Cloud Platform Blog|accessdate=5 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

=== AlphaStar ===
In January 2019, DeepMind introduced AlphaStar, a program playing the real-time strategy game ''[[StarCraft II]]''. AlphaStar used reinforcement learning based on replays from human players, and then played against itself to enhance its skills. At the time of the presentation, AlphaStar had knowledge equivalent to 200 years of playing time.  It won 10 consecutive matches against two professional players, though it had unfair advantage of being able to see the entire field, unlike a human player who has to move a camera around. A preliminary version in which that advantage was fixed, lost a subsequent match.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/284441-deepmind-ai-challenges-pro-starcraft-ii-players-wins-almost-every-match|title=DeepMind AI Challenges Pro StarCraft II Players, Wins Almost Every Match|date=24 January 2019|work=Extreme Tech|access-date=24 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In July 2019, AlphaStar began playing against random humans on the public 1v1 European multiplayer ladder.  Unlike the first iteration of AlphaStar, which played only [[Protoss]] v. Protoss, this one played as all of the game's races, and had earlier unfair advantages fixed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/deepmind-ai-takes-on-the-public-in-starcraft-ii-multiplayer/|title=DeepMind AI is secretly lurking on the public StarCraft II 1v1 ladder|last1=Amadeo|first1=Ron|date=11 July 2019|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/cgvu6r/i_played_against_alphastardeepmind/|title=I played against AlphaStar/Deepmind|access-date=2019-07-27|language=en|website=[[reddit]]}}</ref> In October 2019, AlphaStar reached Grandmaster level on the StarCraft II ladder on all three StarCraft races, becoming the first AI to reach the top league of a widely popular [[Esports|esport]] without any game restrictions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning|title=AlphaStar: Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning|date=31 October 2019|website=DeepMind Blog|access-date=31 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Miscellaneous contributions to Google ===
Google has stated that DeepMind algorithms have greatly increased the efficiency of cooling its data centers.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeepMind AI Reduces Google Data Centre Cooling Bill by 40% |url=https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/ |website=DeepMind Blog}} 20 July 2016.</ref> In addition, DeepMind (alongside other Alphabet AI researchers) assists [[Google Play|Google Play's]] personalized app recommendations.<ref name="cnbc money"/> DeepMind has also collaborated with the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] team at [[Google]] for the creation of two new features which will be available to people with devices running [[Android (operating system)|Android]] Pie, the ninth installment of Google's mobile operating system. These features, Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Brightness, use machine learning to conserve energy and make devices running the operating system easier to use. It is the first time DeepMind has used these techniques on such a small scale, with typical machine learning applications requiring orders of magnitude more computing power.<ref>{{cite web |title=DeepMind, meet Android {{!}} DeepMind |url=https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-meet-android/ |website=DeepMind Blog}} 8 May 2018.</ref>

== DeepMind Health ==
In July 2016, a collaboration between DeepMind and [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] was announced to develop [[Artificial intelligence in healthcare|AI applications for healthcare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36713308|title=Google's DeepMind to peek at NHS eye scans for disease analysis|date=6 July 2016|publisher=BBC|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> DeepMind would be applied to the analysis of [[Data anonymization|anonymised]] eye scans, searching for early signs of diseases leading to [[blindness]].

In August 2016, a research programme with [[University College Hospital|University College London Hospital]] was announced with the aim of developing an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues in head and neck areas.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37230806|title=Google DeepMind targets NHS head and neck cancer treatment|date=31 August 2016|publisher=BBC|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>

There are also projects with the [[Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust]] and [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to [[electronic patient record]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=DeepMind announces second NHS partnership|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/public-sector/27833/deepmind-announces-second-nhs-partnership|accessdate=23 December 2016|publisher=IT Pro|date=23 December 2016}}</ref>  Staff at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] were reported as saying in December 2017 that access to patient data through the app had saved a ‘huge amount of time’ and made a ‘phenomenal’ difference to the management of patients with acute kidney injury.  Test result data is sent to staff's mobile phones and alerts them to change in the patient's condition.  It also enables staff to see if someone else has responded, and to show patients their results in visual form.<ref>{{cite news|title=Google DeepMind’s Streams technology branded ‘phenomenal’|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2017/12/google-deepmind-streams-royal-free/|accessdate=23 December 2017|publisher=Digital Health|date=4 December 2017}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=Personally never heard of digitalhealth.net, quick search didn't produce evidence that it passes WP:RS or WP:DUE.

In November 2017, DeepMind announced a research partnership with the [[Cancer Research UK]] Centre at Imperial College London with the goal of improving breast cancer detection by applying machine learning to mammography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/11/24/google-deepmind-announces-new-research-partnership-fight-breast-cancer-ai/|title=Google DeepMind announces new research partnership to fight breast cancer with AI|date=24 November 2017|website=Silicon Angle}}</ref> Additionally, in February 2018, DeepMind announced it was working with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] in an attempt to use machine learning to predict the onset of acute kidney injury in patients, and also more broadly the general deterioration of patients during a hospital stay so that doctors and nurses can more quickly treat patients in need.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/22/googles-deepmind-wants-ai-to-spot-kidney-injuries/|title=Google's DeepMind wants AI to spot kidney injuries|date=22 February 2018|website=Venture Beat}}</ref>

DeepMind developed an app called Streams, which sends alerts to doctors about patients at risk of acute risk injury.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evenstad |first=Lis |url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252443164/DeepMind-Health-must-be-transparent-to-gain-public-trust-review-finds |title=DeepMind Health must be transparent to gain public trust, review finds |website=ComputerWeekly.com |date=15 June 2018 |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> On 13 November 2018, DeepMind announced that its health division and the Streams app would be absorbed into [[Google Health]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Vincent |first=James |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18091774/google-deepmind-health-absorbing-streams-team-ai-assistant-nurse-doctor|title=Google is absorbing DeepMind's health care unit to create an 'AI assistant for nurses and doctors' |work=The Verge |date=13 November 2018 |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> Privacy advocates said the announcement betrayed patient trust and appeared to contradict previous statements by DeepMind that patient data would not be connected to Google accounts or services.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hern |first=Alex |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/14/google-betrays-patient-trust-deepmind-healthcare-move |title=Google 'betrays patient trust' with DeepMind Health move |date=14 November 2018 |newspaper=the Guardian |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Stokel-Walker |first=Chris |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-deepmind-nhs-health-data |title=Why Google consuming DeepMind Health is scaring privacy experts |work=Wired |date=14 November 2018 |accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref> A spokesman for DeepMind said that patient data would still be kept separate from Google services or projects.<ref>{{cite news |last= Murphy |first=Margi |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/14/deepmind-boss-defends-controversial-google-health-deal/ |title=DeepMind boss defends controversial Google health deal |date=14 November 2018 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>

=== NHS data-sharing controversy ===
In April 2016, ''[[New Scientist]]'' obtained a copy of a [[data sharing]] agreement between DeepMind and the [[Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust]].  The latter operates three London hospitals where an estimated 1.6 million patients are treated annually. The agreement shows DeepMind Health had access to admissions, discharge and transfer data, accident and emergency, pathology and radiology, and critical care at these hospitals. This included personal details such as whether patients had been diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], suffered from [[major depressive disorder|depression]] or had ever undergone an [[abortion]] in order to conduct research to seek better outcomes in various health conditions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data |title=Revealed: Google AI has access to huge haul of NHS patient data |first=Hal |last=Hodson |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030722-900-big-data-if-theres-nothing-to-hide-why-be-secretive/ |title=Leader: If Google has nothing to hide about NHS data, why so secretive? |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=4 May 2016 |accessdate= }}</ref>

A complaint was filed to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), arguing that the data should be pseudonymised and encrypted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450296175/ICO-probes-Google-DeepMind-patient-data-sharing-deal-with-NHS-Hospital-Trust |title=ICO probes Google DeepMind patient data-sharing deal with NHS Hospital Trust |first=Caroline |last=Donnelly |work=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate= }}</ref> In May 2016, ''New Scientist'' published a further article claiming that the project had failed to secure approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2088056-exclusive-googles-nhs-deal/ |title=Did Google's NHS patient data deal need ethical approval? |first=Hal |last=Hodson |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=25 May 2016 |accessdate=28 May 2016 }}</ref>

In May 2017, ''Sky News'' published a leaked letter from the National Data Guardian, Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]], revealing that in her "considered opinion" the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free took place on an "inappropriate legal basis".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/google-received-16-million-nhs-patients-data-on-an-inappropriate-legal-basis-10879142/ |title=Google received 1.6 million NHS patients' data on an 'inappropriate legal basis' |first=Alexander J |last=Martin |work=[[Sky News]] |date=15 May 2017 |accessdate=16 May 2017 }}</ref> The Information Commissioner's Office ruled in July 2017 that the Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Hern |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/03/google-deepmind-16m-patient-royal-free-deal-data-protection-act |title=Royal Free breached UK data law in 1.6m patient deal with Google's DeepMind |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 July 2017}}</ref>

== DeepMind Ethics and Society ==
In October 2017, DeepMind  announced a new research unit, DeepMind Ethics & Society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/why-we-launched-deepmind-ethics-society/|title=Why we launched DeepMind Ethics & Society|work=DeepMind Blog|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> Their goal is to fund external research of the following themes: privacy, transparency, and fairness; economic impacts; governance and accountability; managing AI risk; AI morality and values; and how AI can address the world's challenges. As a result, the team hopes to further understand the ethical implications of AI and aid society to seeing AI can be beneficial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-ethics-and-society-artificial-intelligence|title=DeepMind's new AI ethics unit is the company's next big move|last=Temperton|first=James|work=Wired (UK)|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

This new subdivision of DeepMind is a completely separate unit from the partnership of leading companies using AI, academia, civil society organizations and nonprofits of the name [[Partnership on AI|Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society]] of which DeepMind is also a part.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=DeepMind announces ethics group to focus on problems of AI|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/google-deepmind-ai-artificial-intelligence-ethics-group-problems|accessdate=8 December 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 October 2017}}</ref>
