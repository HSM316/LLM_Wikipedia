== History ==

The [[Startup company|start-up]] was founded by [[Demis Hassabis]], [[Shane Legg]] and [[Mustafa Suleyman]] in November 2010.<ref name="economist"></ref> Hassabis and Legg first met at the [[Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit]] at [[University College London]] (UCL).<ref>{{cite news|title=Demis Hassabis: 15 facts about the DeepMind Technologies founder|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/jan/28/demis-hassabis-15-facts-deepmind-technologies-founder-google|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref>

Demis Hassabis has said that the start-up began working on artificial intelligence technology by teaching it how to play old games from the seventies and eighties, which are relatively primitive compared to the ones that are available today. Some of those games included ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Pong]]'', and ''[[Space Invaders]]''. AI was introduced to one game at a time, without any prior knowledge of its rules. After spending some time on learning the game, AI would eventually become an expert in it. "The cognitive processes which the AI goes through are said to be very like those of a human who had never seen the game would use to understand and attempt to master it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/02/02/how-googles-amazing-ai-start-up-deepmind-is-making-our-world-a-smarter-place/#3f5f079ddfff|title=How Google's Amazing AI Start-Up 'DeepMind' Is Making Our World A Smarter Place|last=Marr|first=Bernard|work=Forbes|access-date=30 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> The goal of the founders is to create a general-purpose AI that can be useful and effective for almost anything.

AlphaGo technology was developed based on [[deep reinforcement learning]], making it different from the AI technologies then on the market. The data fed into the AlphaGo algorithm consisted of various moves based on historical tournament data. The number of moves was increased gradually until over 30 million of them were processed. The aim was to have the system mimic the human player, as represented by the input data, and eventually become better. It played against itself and learned from the outcomes; thus, it learned to improve itself over the time and increased its winning rate as a result.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730391-learning-play-go-only-start-latest-ai-can-work-things-out-without|title=The latest AI can work things out without being taught|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>

AlphaGo used two deep neural networks: a policy network to evaluate move probabilities and a value network to assess positions. The policy network trained via supervised learning, and was subsequently refined by policy-gradient [[reinforcement learning]]. The value network learned to predict winners of games played by the policy network against itself. After training, these networks employed a lookahead [[Monte Carlo tree search]], using the policy network to identify candidate high-probability moves, while the value network (in conjunction with Monte Carlo rollouts using a fast rollout policy) evaluated tree positions.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Silver|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first2= Julian|last2= Schrittwieser|first3= Karen|last3= Simonyan|first4= Ioannis|last4= Antonoglou|first5= Aja|last5= Huang|author-link5=Aja Huang|first6=Arthur|last6= Guez|first7= Thomas|last7= Hubert|first8= Lucas|last8= Baker|first9= Matthew|last9= Lai|first10= Adrian|last10= Bolton|first11= Yutian|last11= Chen|author-link11=Chen Yutian|first12= Timothy|last12= Lillicrap|first13=Hui|last13= Fan|author-link13=Fan Hui|first14= Laurent|last14= Sifre|first15= George van den|last15= Driessche|first16= Thore|last16= Graepel|first17= Demis|last17= Hassabis |author-link17=Demis Hassabis|title=Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issn= 0028-0836|pages=354–359|volume =550|issue =7676|doi =10.1038/nature24270|pmid=29052630|date=19 October 2017|bibcode=2017Natur.550..354S|s2cid=205261034|url= http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf}}{{closed access}}</ref>

In contrast, AlphaGo Zero was trained without being fed data of human-played games. Instead it generated its own data, playing millions of games against itself. It used a single neural network, rather than separate policy and value networks. Its simplified tree search relied upon this neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves. A new reinforcement learning algorithm incorporated lookahead search inside the training loop.<ref name=":0" /> AlphaGo Zero employed around 15 people and millions in computing resources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609141/alphago-zero-shows-machines-can-become-superhuman-without-any-help/|title=The world's smartest game-playing AI—DeepMind's AlphaGo—just got way smarter|last=Knight|first=Will|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref> Ultimately, it needed much less computing power than AlphaGo, running on four specialized AI processors (Google [[Tensor processing unit|TPUs]]), instead of AlphaGo's 48.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught|title=DeepMind's Go-playing AI doesn't need human help to beat us anymore|last=Vincent|first=James|date=18 October 2017|work=The Verge|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> It also required less training time, being able to beat its predecessor after just three days, compared with months required for the original AlphaGo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41668701|title=Google DeepMind: AI becomes more alien|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=18 October 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> Similarly, AlphaZero also learned via [[Self-play (reinforcement learning technique)|self-play]].

Researchers applied MuZero to solve the real world challenge of video compression with a set number of bits with respect to Internet traffic on sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and [[Google Meet]].

==== AlphaStar ====
{{Main|AlphaStar (software)}}
In 2016, Hassabis discussed the game ''[[StarCraft]]'' as a future challenge, since it requires strategic thinking and handling imperfect information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai|title=DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis on how AI will shape the future|date=10 March 2016|website=The Verge}}</ref>

In January 2019, DeepMind introduced AlphaStar, a program playing the real-time strategy game ''[[StarCraft II]]''. AlphaStar used reinforcement learning based on replays from human players, and then played against itself to enhance its skills. At the time of the presentation, AlphaStar had knowledge equivalent to 200 years of playing time. It won 10 consecutive matches against two professional players, although it had the unfair advantage of being able to see the entire field, unlike a human player who has to move the camera manually. A preliminary version in which that advantage was fixed lost a subsequent match.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/284441-deepmind-ai-challenges-pro-starcraft-ii-players-wins-almost-every-match|title=DeepMind AI Challenges Pro StarCraft II Players, Wins Almost Every Match|date=24 January 2019|work=Extreme Tech|access-date=24 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In July 2019, AlphaStar began playing against random humans on the public 1v1 European multiplayer ladder. Unlike the first iteration of AlphaStar, which played only [[Protoss]] v. Protoss, this one played as all of the game's races, and had earlier unfair advantages fixed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/deepmind-ai-takes-on-the-public-in-starcraft-ii-multiplayer/|title=DeepMind AI is secretly lurking on the public StarCraft II 1v1 ladder|last1=Amadeo|first1=Ron|date=11 July 2019|work=Ars Technica|access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/cgvu6r/i_played_against_alphastardeepmind/|title=I played against AlphaStar/Deepmind|access-date=27 July 2019|language=en|website=[[reddit]]|date=23 July 2019}}</ref> By October 2019, AlphaStar had reached Grandmaster level on the ''StarCraft II'' ladder on all three ''StarCraft'' races, becoming the first AI to reach the top league of a widely popular [[Esports|esport]] without any game restrictions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning|title=AlphaStar: Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning|date=31 October 2019|website=DeepMind Blog|access-date=31 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Protein folding ===
{{Main|AlphaFold}}

In 2016, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to [[protein structure prediction|protein folding]], a long-standing problem in [[molecular biology]]. In December 2018, DeepMind's AlphaFold won the 13th [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins. "This is a lighthouse project, our first major investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental, very important, real-world scientific problem," Hassabis said to ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/02/google-deepminds-ai-program-alphafold-predicts-3d-shapes-of-proteins|title=Google's DeepMind predicts 3D shapes of proteins|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=2 December 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=3 December 2018}}</ref> In 2020, in the 14th CASP, AlphaFold's predictions achieved an accuracy score regarded as comparable with lab techniques.

The most recent update, AlphaFold3, was released in May 2024, predicting the interactions of proteins with DNA, RNA, and various other molecules. In a particular [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark test]] on the problem of DNA interactions, AlphaFold3's attained an accuracy of 65%, significantly improving the previous state of the art of 28%.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeepMind's new AlphaFold 3 expands to DNA, RNA modeling|date=May 8, 2024|last1=Sullivan|first1=Mark|website=[[Fast Company]]|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/91120456/deepmind-alphafold-3-dna-rna-modeling}}</ref>

=== Sports ===
DeepMind researchers have applied machine learning models to the sport of [[Association football|football]], often referred to as soccer in North America, modelling the behaviour of football players, including the goalkeeper, defenders, and strikers during different scenarios such as penalty kicks. The researchers used heat maps and cluster analysis to organize players based on their tendency to behave a certain way during the game when confronted with a decision on how to score or prevent the other team from scoring. 

The researchers mention that machine learning models could be used to democratize the football industry by automatically selecting interesting video clips of the game that serve as highlights. This can be done by searching videos for certain events, which is possible because video analysis is an established field of machine learning. This is also possible because of extensive sports analytics based on data including annotated passes or shots, sensors that capture data about the players movements many times over the course of a game, and game theory models.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Advancing sports analytics through AI research |url=https://www.deepmind.com/blog/advancing-sports-analytics-through-ai-research |access-date=29 April 2022 |website=DeepMind |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tuyls |first1=Karl |last2=Omidshafiei |first2=Shayegan |last3=Muller |first3=Paul |last4=Wang |first4=Zhe |last5=Connor |first5=Jerome |last6=Hennes |first6=Daniel |last7=Graham |first7=Ian |last8=Spearman |first8=William |last9=Waskett |first9=Tim |last10=Steel |first10=Dafydd |last11=Luc |first11=Pauline |date=6 May 2021 |title=Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI |url=https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12505 |journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research |language=en |volume=71 |pages=41–88 |doi=10.1613/jair.1.12505 |s2cid=227013043 |issn=1076-9757|doi-access=free |arxiv=2011.09192 }}</ref>

The team is working on extending the model to other ancient languages, including [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]].<ref name=":1" />

===Materials science===
In November 2023, Google DeepMind announced an Open Source Graph Network for Materials Exploration (GNoME). The tool proposes millions of materials previously unknown to chemistry, including several hundred thousand stable crystalline structures, of which 736 had been experimentally produced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the time of the release.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Merchant |first1=Amil |last2=Batzner |first2=Simon |last3=Schoenholz |first3=Samuel S. |last4=Aykol |first4=Muratahan |last5=Cheon |first5=Gowoon |last6=Cubuk |first6=Ekin Dogus |date=December 2023 |title=Scaling deep learning for materials discovery |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=624 |issue=7990 |pages=80–85 |doi=10.1038/s41586-023-06735-9 |issn=1476-4687|doi-access=free |pmid=38030720 |pmc=10700131 |bibcode=2023Natur.624...80M }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Google DeepMind's new AI tool helped create more than 700 new materials |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/ |access-date=2 January 2024 |website=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}</ref> However, according to [[Anthony Cheetham]], GNoME did not make "a useful, practical contribution to the experimental materials scientists."<ref name="404media">{{cite web|title=Is Google's AI Actually Discovering 'Millions of New Materials?'|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=April 11, 2024|website=[[404 Media]]|url=https://www.404media.co/google-says-it-discovered-millions-of-new-materials-with-ai-human-researchers/}}</ref> A review article by Cheetham and Ram Seshadri were unable to identify any "strikingly novel" materials found by GNoME, with most being minor variants of already-known materials.<ref name="404media" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cheetham|first1=Anthony K.|last2=Seshadri|first2=Ram|author-link1=Anthony Cheetham|title=Artificial intelligence driving materials discovery?

=== Mathematics ===
====AlphaTensor====
In October 2022, DeepMind released [[AlphaTensor]], which used reinforcement learning techniques similar to those in AlphaGo, to find novel [[Matrix multiplication algorithm|algorithms for matrix multiplication]].<ref name=AlphaTensor1>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03166-w |title=DeepMind AI invents faster algorithms to solve tough maths puzzles |date=5 October 2022 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |last=Hutson |first=Matthew|doi=10.1038/d41586-022-03166-w |pmid=36198824 |s2cid=252737506 }}</ref><ref name=AlphaTensor2>{{cite web |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/05/1060717/deepmind-uses-its-game-playing-ai-to-best-a-50-year-old-record-in-computer-science/ |title=DeepMind's game-playing AI has beaten a 50-year-old record in computer science |date=5 October 2022 |website=[[MIT Technology Review]] |first=Will Douglas |last=Heaven}}</ref> In the special case of multiplying two 4×4 matrices with [[integer]] entries, where only the evenness or oddness of the entries is recorded, AlphaTensor found an algorithm requiring only 47 distinct multiplications; the previous optimum, known since 1969, was the more general [[Strassen algorithm]], using 49 multiplications.<ref name="quantamag">{{cite news |date=November 2022 |title=AI Reveals New Possibilities in Matrix Multiplication |work=Quanta Magazine |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-reveals-new-possibilities-in-matrix-multiplication-20221123/ |access-date=26 November 2022}}</ref> Computer scientist Josh Alman described AlphaTensor as "a proof of concept for something that could become a breakthrough," while [[Virginia Vassilevska Williams|Vassilevska Williams]] called it "a little overhyped"<ref name="quantamag" /> despite also acknowledging its basis in reinforcement learning as "something completely different" from previous approaches.<ref name=AlphaTensor2 />

====AlphaGeometry====
{{main|AlphaGeometry}}
AlphaGeometry is a [[neuro-symbolic AI]] that was able to solve 25 out of 30 geometry problems of the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], a performance comparable to that of a gold medalist.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Zia |first=Tehseen |date=January 24, 2024 |title=AlphaGeometry: DeepMind's AI Masters Geometry Problems at Olympiad Levels |url=https://www.unite.ai/alphageometry-how-deepminds-ai-masters-geometry-problems-at-olympian-levels/ |access-date=2024-05-03 |website=Unite.ai}}</ref>

Traditional geometry programs are [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic engines]] that rely exclusively on human-coded [[Rule-based system|rules]] to generate rigorous proofs, which makes them lack flexibility in unusual situations. AlphaGeometry combines such a symbolic engine with a specialized [[large language model]] trained on [[synthetic data]] of geometrical proofs. When the symbolic engine doesn't manage to find a formal and rigorous proof on its own, it solicits the large language model, which suggests a geometrical construct to move forward. However, it is unclear how applicable this method is to other domains of mathematics or reasoning, because symbolic engines rely on domain-specific rules and because of the need for synthetic data.<ref name=":3" />

====AlphaProof====
AlphaProof is an AI model, which couples a pre-trained language model with the AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm. AlphaZero has previously taught itself how to master games. The pre-trained language model used in this combination is the [[Fine-tuning (deep learning)|fine-tuning]] of a [[Gemini (language model)|Gemini]] model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty. For this purpose, mathematical statements are defined in the formal language [[Lean (proof assistant)|Lean]].

In April 2016, ''[[New Scientist]]'' obtained a copy of a [[data sharing]] agreement between DeepMind and the [[Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust]]. The latter operates three London hospitals where an estimated 1.6 million patients are treated annually. The agreement shows DeepMind Health had access to admissions, discharge and transfer data, accident and emergency, pathology and radiology, and critical care at these hospitals. This included personal details such as whether patients had been diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], suffered from [[major depressive disorder|depression]] or had ever undergone an [[abortion]] in order to conduct research to seek better outcomes in various health conditions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data |title=Revealed: Google AI has access to huge haul of NHS patient data |first=Hal |last=Hodson |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=29 April 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030722-900-big-data-if-theres-nothing-to-hide-why-be-secretive/ |title=Leader: If Google has nothing to hide about NHS data, why so secretive? |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=4 May 2016 }}</ref>

A complaint was filed to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), arguing that the data should be pseudonymised and encrypted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450296175/ICO-probes-Google-DeepMind-patient-data-sharing-deal-with-NHS-Hospital-Trust |title=ICO probes Google DeepMind patient data-sharing deal with NHS Hospital Trust |first=Caroline |last=Donnelly |work=[[Computer Weekly]] |date=12 May 2016 }}</ref> In May 2016, ''New Scientist'' published a further article claiming that the project had failed to secure approval from the Confidentiality Advisory Group of the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2088056-exclusive-googles-nhs-deal/ |title=Did Google's NHS patient data deal need ethical approval? |first=Hal |last=Hodson |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=25 May 2016 |access-date=28 May 2016 }}</ref>

In 2017, the ICO concluded a year-long investigation that focused on how the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust tested the app, Streams, in late 2015 and 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616142219/https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2017/07/royal-free-google-deepmind-trial-failed-to-comply-with-data-protection-law/|url=https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2017/07/royal-free-google-deepmind-trial-failed-to-comply-with-data-protection-law/|title=Royal Free - Google DeepMind trial failed to comply with data protection law|date=17 August 2017|website=ico.org.uk|language=en|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-date=16 June 2018 }}</ref> The ICO found that the Royal Free failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it provided patient details to DeepMind, and found several shortcomings in how the data was handled, including that patients were not adequately informed that their data would be used as part of the test. DeepMind published its thoughts<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deepmind.com/blog/ico-royal-free/ |title=The Information Commissioner, the Royal Free, and what we've learned |website=DeepMind |access-date=15 February 2018}}</ref> on the investigation in July 2017, saying "we need to do better" and highlighting several activities and initiatives they had initiated for transparency, oversight and engagement. This included developing a patient and public involvement strategy<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/patients/|title=For Patients |website=DeepMind |access-date=15 February 2018}}</ref> and being transparent in its partnerships.

In May 2017, ''Sky News'' published a leaked letter from the National Data Guardian, Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]], revealing that in her "considered opinion" the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free took place on an "inappropriate legal basis".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/google-received-16-million-nhs-patients-data-on-an-inappropriate-legal-basis-10879142/ |title=Google received 1.6 million NHS patients' data on an 'inappropriate legal basis' |first=Alexander J |last=Martin |work=[[Sky News]] |date=15 May 2017 |access-date=16 May 2017 }}</ref> The Information Commissioner's Office ruled in July 2017 that the Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of 1.6 million patients to DeepMind.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Hern |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/03/google-deepmind-16m-patient-royal-free-deal-data-protection-act |title=Royal Free breached UK data law in 1.6m patient deal with Google's DeepMind |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 July 2017}}</ref>

== DeepMind Ethics and Society ==
In October 2017, DeepMind announced a new research unit, DeepMind Ethics & Society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/why-we-launched-deepmind-ethics-society/|title=Why we launched DeepMind Ethics & Society|work=DeepMind Blog|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> Their goal is to fund external research of the following themes: privacy, transparency, and fairness; economic impacts; governance and accountability; managing AI risk; AI morality and values; and how AI can address the world's challenges. As a result, the team hopes to further understand the ethical implications of AI and aid society to seeing AI can be beneficial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-ethics-and-society-artificial-intelligence|title=DeepMind's new AI ethics unit is the company's next big move|last=Temperton|first=James|work=Wired (UK)|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

This new subdivision of DeepMind is a completely separate unit from the partnership of leading companies using AI, academia, civil society organizations and nonprofits of the name [[Partnership on AI|Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society]] of which DeepMind is also a part.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=DeepMind announces ethics group to focus on problems of AI|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/google-deepmind-ai-artificial-intelligence-ethics-group-problems|access-date=8 December 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 October 2017}}</ref> The DeepMind Ethics and Society board is also distinct from the mooted AI Ethics Board that [[Google]] originally agreed to form when acquiring DeepMind.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=DeepMind announces ethics group to focus on problems of AI |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/google-deepmind-ai-artificial-intelligence-ethics-group-problems |access-date=12 June 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=4 October 2017}}</ref>
