{{short description|A type of camouflage used to hamper facial recognition software}}
'''Computer vision dazzle''' also known as '''CV dazzle''', '''dazzle makeup''', or '''anti-surveillance makeup''', is a type of [[camouflage]] used to hamper [[facial recognition software]], inspired by [[dazzle camouflage]] used by warships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/computer-vision-dazzle-anti-surveillance-facial-recognition-technology-moma-ps1 |title=Yes, There's a Way to Outsmart Facial Recognition Technology—And It Comes Down to Your Makeup |last=Valenti |first=Lauren |date=March 30, 2018 |website=Vogue |access-date=February 21, 2019}}</ref> CV dazzle combines stylized makeup, asymmetric hair, and sometimes infrared lights built in to glasses or clothing to break up detectable facial patterns recognized by computer vision algorithms in much the same way that warships contrasted color and used sloping lines and curves to distort the structure of a vessel. It has been shown to be somewhat successful at defeating [[face detection]] software in common use, including that employed by [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Melanson |first=Donald |url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/15/student-thwarts-face-detection-software-with-cv-dazzle-makeup/ |title=Student thwarts face detection software with 'CV Dazzle' makeup |publisher=Engadget |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2010/03/31/computer-vision-dazzle-makeup/ |title=Computer Vision Dazzle Makeup |publisher=today and tomorrow |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125132358/http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2010/03/31/computer-vision-dazzle-makeup/ |archive-date=January 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> CV dazzle attempts to block detection by facial recognition technologies such as [[DeepFace]] "by creating an 'anti-face'".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Anti-Surveillance State: Clothes and Gadgets Block Face Recognition Technology, Confuse Drones and Make You (Digitally) Invisible |url=http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/anti-surveillance-state-clothes-and-gadgets-block-face-recognition-technology |website=AlterNet |date=21 April 2015 |accessdate=3 November 2015 |first=Janet |last=Burns}}</ref> It uses occlusion, covering certain facial features; transformation, altering the shape or colour of parts of the face; and a combination of the two.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Facilitating Fashion Camouflage Art |first1=Ranran |last1=Feng |first2=Balakrishnan |last2=Prabhakaran |publisher=ACM |journal=Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Multimedia |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-4503-2404-5 |pages=793–802 |series=MM '13 |doi=10.1145/2502081.2502121}}</ref> Prominent artists employing this technique include Adam Harvey<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvey |first=Adam |url=http://cvdazzle.com/ |title=CV Dazzle: Camouflage from Computer Vision |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Stone |first=Zara |url=http://fusion.net/modern_life/story/face-detection-tech-workarounds-steal-google-glasses-18980 |title=How to Steal Google Glasses Using Technology |publisher=Fusion |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027203007/http://www.fusion.net/modern_life/story/face-detection-tech-workarounds-steal-google-glasses-18980 |archive-date=October 27, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Meltzer |first=Tom |url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/31/anti-drone-hoodie-big-brother |title=The anti-drone hoodie that helps you beat Big Brother's spy in the sky |publisher=The Guardian |date=March 31, 2013 |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref> and [[Jillian Mayer]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Caplan |first=B. |url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2013/08/optic_nerve_video_festival_jil.php |title=Optic Nerve Video Festival: Jillian Mayer Versus the Surveillance State |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>
