==Early life and education==
Paglen earned a B.A. degree in religious studies in 1998 from the [[University of California at Berkeley]], a [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] degree in 2002 from [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|the School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], and a Ph.D. in [[Geography]] in 2008 from the University of California at Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/994/|title=Trevor Paglen|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|access-date=2017-10-13|archive-date=2017-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013173321/https://www.macfound.org/fellows/994/|url-status=live}}</ref>

While at UC Berkeley, Paglen lived in the [[Berkeley Student Cooperative]], residing in Chateau, Fenwick, and Rochdale co-ops.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Loh|first=Madeline|title=Alumni in the News|url=https://bsc.coop/docs/alumni-newsletter/2018-Spring-BSC-Alumni-Newsletter.pdf|access-date=2021-08-27|archive-date=2021-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827124135/https://bsc.coop/docs/alumni-newsletter/2018-Spring-BSC-Alumni-Newsletter.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Work ==
[[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2015, said that Paglen, whose "ongoing grand project [is] the murky world of global state surveillance and the ethics of drone warfare", "is one of the most conceptually adventurous political artists working today, and has collaborated with scientists and human rights activists on his always ambitious multimedia projects."<ref name="ohagan-guardian-2015" /> His visual work such as his "Limit Telephotography" and "The Other Night Sky" series have received widespread attention for both his technical innovations and for his conceptual project that involves simultaneously making and negating documentary-style truth-claims.<ref>Keenan, Tom. "Disappearances: The Photographs of Trevor Paglen" Aperture, No. 191. Summer 2008</ref> The contrasts between secrecy and revelation, evidence and abstraction distinguish Paglen's work. With that the artist presents not so much "evidence" as admonitions to awareness.<ref>{{Cite news|title=6 November 2013|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=8 June 2016|title=Trevor Paglen|url=https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/actual-revolution-chelseas-jack-shainman-gallery-transforms-into-headquarters-for-an-artist-run-super-pac-6488/attachment/trevor-paglen/|access-date=30 August 2020|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|archive-date=5 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805142047/https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/actual-revolution-chelseas-jack-shainman-gallery-transforms-into-headquarters-for-an-artist-run-super-pac-6488/attachment/trevor-paglen/|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was an [[Eyebeam Atelier|Eyebeam]] Commissioned Artist in 2007. 

In 2008 the Berkeley Art Museum devoted a comprehensive solo exhibition to his work.

Paglen features in the nerd-culture documentary ''[[Traceroute (film)|Traceroute]]'' (2016).

''[[Orbital Reflector]]'' was a reflective, mylar sculpture by Paglen intended to be the first "purely artistic" object in space. The temporary satellite, containing an inflatable mylar balloon with reflective surface, launched into space 3 December 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=Heavens to shine with new 'star' as first space sculpture prepares for launch |work=The Telegraph |date=2018-08-12 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/08/11/heavens-shine-new-star-first-space-sculpture-prepares-launch/ |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235 |df=mdy-all |access-date=2021-09-09 |archive-date=2021-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210909063551/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/08/11/heavens-shine-new-star-first-space-sculpture-prepares-launch/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Sohn |first1=Timothy |title=SpaceX Is Launching a Piece of Art Into Orbit |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2018-11-28 |url=https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-is-launching-a-piece-of-art-into-orbit/ |issn=1059-1028 |df=mdy-all |access-date=2021-09-09 |archive-date=2021-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211016224612/https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-is-launching-a-piece-of-art-into-orbit/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Experimental Geography ===
Paglen is credited with coining the term "Experimental Geography" to describe practices coupling experimental cultural production and art-making with ideas from [[Critical geography|critical human geography]] about the production of space, materialism, and praxis. The 2009 book ''Experimental Geography: Radical Approaches to Landscape, Cartography, and Urbanism'' is largely inspired by Paglen's work.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smallwood|first=Christine|date=2009-01-28|title=Back Talk: Nato Thompson|journal=The Nation|language=en-US|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/back-talk-nato-thompson/|access-date=2021-10-28|issn=0027-8378|archive-date=2021-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028032612/https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/back-talk-nato-thompson/|url-status=live}}</ref>
