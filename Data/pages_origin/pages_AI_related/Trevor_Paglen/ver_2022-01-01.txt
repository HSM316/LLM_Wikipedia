== Work ==
[[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2015, said that Paglen, whose "ongoing grand project [is] the murky world of global state surveillance and the ethics of drone warfare", "is one of the most conceptually adventurous political artists working today, and has collaborated with scientists and human rights activists on his always ambitious multimedia projects."<ref name="ohagan-guardian-2015" /> His visual work such as his "Limit Telephotography" and "The Other Night Sky" series have received widespread attention for both his technical innovations and for his conceptual project that involves simultaneously making and negating documentary-style truth-claims.<ref>Keenan, Tom. "Disappearances: The Photographs of Trevor Paglen" Aperture, No. 191. Summer 2008</ref> The contrasts between secrecy and revelation, evidence and abstraction distinguish Paglen's work.

He was an [[Eyebeam Atelier|Eyebeam]] Commissioned Artist in 2007.

Paglen is featured in the nerd culture documentary, ''[[Traceroute (film)|Traceroute]]'' (2016).

''[[Orbital Reflector]]'' was a reflective, mylar sculpture by Paglen launched into space a temporary satellite in 2018.  The objective was to create the first "purely artistic" object in space. The satellite, containing an inflatable mylar balloon with reflective surface, launched into space 3 December 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=Heavens to shine with new 'star' as first space sculpture prepares for launch |work=The Telegraph |date=2018-08-12 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/08/11/heavens-shine-new-star-first-space-sculpture-prepares-launch/ |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Sohn |first1=Timothy |title=SpaceX Is Launching a Piece of Art Into Orbit |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2018-11-28 |url=https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-is-launching-a-piece-of-art-into-orbit/ |issn=1059-1028 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Experimental Geography ===
Paglen is credited with coining the term "Experimental Geography" to describe practices coupling experimental cultural production and art-making with ideas from critical human geography about the production of space, materialism, and praxis. The 2009 book ''Experimental Geography: Radical Approaches to Landscape, Cartography, and Urbanism'' is largely inspired by Paglen's work.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smallwood|first=Christine|date=2009-01-28|title=Back Talk: Nato Thompson|language=en-US|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/back-talk-nato-thompson/|access-date=2021-10-28|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>

==Publications==
Paglen has published a number of books. ''[[Torture Taxi]]'' (2006), (co-authored with investigative journalist [[Adam Clay Thompson]]) was the first book to comprehensively describe the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] program. ''I Could Tell You But Then You Would Have to be Destroyed by Me'' (2007), is a look at the world of [[black project]]s through unit patches and memorabilia created for top-secret programs.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/01/healthscience/01patc.php Logos offer a guide to secret military programs], International Herald Tribune, April 2, 2008.</ref> ''Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon's Secret World'' (2009) is a broader look at secrecy in the United States.<ref>Paglen, Trevor "Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon's Secret World" New York: Dutton, 2009</ref> ''The Last Pictures'' (2012) is a collection of 100 images to be placed on permanent media and launched into space on [[EchoStar]] XVI, as a repository available for future civilizations (alien or human) to find.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Book|url=http://creativetime.org/projects/the-last-pictures/the-book/}}</ref>
