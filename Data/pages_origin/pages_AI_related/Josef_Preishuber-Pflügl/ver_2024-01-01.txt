Preishuber-Pflügl<ref>[https://at.linkedin.com/in/josefpreishuberpfluegl LinkedIn Josef Preishuber-Pflügl]</ref> was a design engineer, project manager and product manager at [[Philips Semiconductors]], where he got involved in [[RFID]] for his diploma thesis. His work led him through the development of LF (<135&nbsp;kHz), HF (13.56&nbsp;MHz) and UHF (860-960&nbsp;MHz) [[RFID]] products and systems.

Changing to [[CISC Semiconductor]] GmbH from 2003-2023, Preishuber-Pflügl set up the company's [[RFID]] and [[Near Field Communication|NFC]]<ref>[https://www.seibersdorf-laboratories.at/emv-fachtagung/archiv/nfc-fachtagungen/nfc-fachtagung-2016/vortragende/abstract-preishuber-pfluegl-cisc NFC Fachtagung]</ref> activities and expanded the international standardization work on RFID. In 2003 he became convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] SC31 WG3/SG1 "RFID performance and conformance test methods", which continued its work as WG4/SG6 since 2008. The group developed the performance and conformance standards ISO/IEC 18046 and ISO/IEC 18047 applicable for [[ISO/IEC 18000]] [[RFID testing]]. In 2014 he became convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] SC31 WG7 "RFID Security", which develops [[ISO/IEC 29167]]. Currently, he is driver in standardization in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[CENELEC]], [[ETSI]] and [[GS1]] [[EPCglobal]] and convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] SC31 WG4 "RF Communications" that covers RFID, RTLS, Security and related conformance and performance test methods.

In 2011 he received the [http://www.iec.ch/about/awards/1906/1906_criteria.htm IEC 1906 Award] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612230537/http://www.iec.ch/about/awards/1906/1906_criteria.htm |date=2011-06-12 }}<ref>[http://www.cisc.at/_documents/MediaCoverage/2011_IEC_1906_Award_2011_Josef_Preishuber-Pfluegl.pdf IEC 1906 Award certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330145935/http://www.cisc.at/_documents/MediaCoverage/2011_IEC_1906_Award_2011_Josef_Preishuber-Pfluegl.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }}</ref> by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) as Expert of [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]], Information Technology.

In 2012 he became co-author of the ''RFID Handbook''<ref>[http://www.rfid-handbook.de/german/ RFID Handbuch "Grundlagen und praktische Anwendungen induktiver Funkanlagen, Transponder und kontaktloser Chipkarten"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123094756/http://rfid-handbook.de/german/ |date=2009-11-23 }} {{ISBN|978-3-446-42992-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rfid-handbook.de/german/ RFID Handbuch "Grundlagen und praktische Anwendungen induktiver Funkanlagen, Transponder und kontaktloser Chipkarten"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123094756/http://rfid-handbook.de/german/ |date=2009-11-23 }} {{ISBN|978-3-446-43943-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rfid-handbook.de/the-book/german-edition/die-autoren.html |title=RFID-Handbuch - Autoren |access-date=2015-08-11 |archive-date=2015-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524015717/http://rfid-handbook.de/the-book/german-edition/die-autoren.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> of Klaus Finkenzeller.

In the intensive discussion of [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) and RFID he first used the term "[[RFID]]/[[Near field communication|NFC]] providing the last meter of the IoT", which derived from the common term "last kilometer" in infrastructure networks. The Anglo-American terms "last mile" was first used in public in his speech on "RFID and NFC: Providing the Last Yards for IoT"[http://www.rfidjournalevents.com/brasil/agenda/iot-workshop] on 8 October 2015. As input for the [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] Plenary the respective committee SC31 used then "IoT's First Meter".

In 2019 he received the [https://www.aimglobal.org/uploads/1/2/4/5/124501539/aim_awards_2023.pdf AIM Ted Williams Award], followed by the highest [https://www.aimglobal.org/awards.html AIM award], the [https://www.aimglobal.org/uploads/1/2/4/5/124501539/aim_awards_2023.pdf Richard Dilling Award], in 2023.

In 2023 he founded his own company [https://www.innobir.com innobir e.U.] offering wireless technology services with the particular focus on NFC, RAIN RFID and UWB, as well as on international standardization and radio regulations.<ref>[https://firmen.wko.at/innobir-eu/k%C3%A4rnten/?firmaid=2f76dfba-e6e8-4b0f-a939-24c1738eb38a WKO innobir e.U.]</ref>
