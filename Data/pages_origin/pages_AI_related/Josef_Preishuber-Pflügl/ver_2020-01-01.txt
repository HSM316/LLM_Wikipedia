Preishuber-Pflügl was a design engineer, project manager and product manager at [[Philips Semiconductors]], where he got involved in [[RFID]] for his diploma thesis. His work led him through the development of LF (<135&nbsp;kHz), HF (13.56&nbsp;MHz) and UHF (860-960&nbsp;MHz) [[RFID]] products and systems.

Changing to [[CISC Semiconductor]] GmbH in 2003, Preishuber-Pflügl set up the company's [[RFID]] and [[Network File Control|NFC]] activities and expanded the international standardization work on RFID. In 2003 he became convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] SC31 WG3/SG1 "RFID performance and conformance test methods", which continued its work as WG4/SG6 since 2008. The group developed the performance and conformance standards ISO/IEC 18046 and ISO/IEC 18047 applicable for [[ISO/IEC 18000]] [[RFID testing]]. In 2014 he became convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] SC31 WG7 "RFID Security", which develops [[ISO/IEC 29167]]. Currently, he is driver in standardization in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[CENELEC]], [[ETSI]] and [[GS1]] [[EPCglobal]] and convener of [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] SC31 WG4 "RF Communications" that covers RFID, RTLS, Security and related conformance and performance test methods.

In 2011 he received the [http://www.iec.ch/about/awards/1906/1906_criteria.htm IEC 1906 Award]<ref>[http://www.cisc.at/_documents/MediaCoverage/2011_IEC_1906_Award_2011_Josef_Preishuber-Pfluegl.pdf IEC 1906 Award certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330145935/http://www.cisc.at/_documents/MediaCoverage/2011_IEC_1906_Award_2011_Josef_Preishuber-Pfluegl.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }}</ref> by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) as Expert of [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]], Information Technology.

In 2012 he became co-author of the ''RFID Handbook''<ref>[http://www.rfid-handbook.de/german/ RFID Handbuch "Grundlagen und praktische Anwendungen induktiver Funkanlagen, Transponder und kontaktloser Chipkarten"] {{ISBN|978-3-446-42992-5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rfid-handbook.de/german/ RFID Handbuch "Grundlagen und praktische Anwendungen induktiver Funkanlagen, Transponder und kontaktloser Chipkarten"] {{ISBN|978-3-446-43943-6}}</ref><ref>[http://rfid-handbook.de/the-book/german-edition/die-autoren.html RFID-Handbuch - Autoren]</ref> of Klaus Finkenzeller.

In the intensive discussion of [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) and RFID he first used the term "[[RFID]]/[[Near field communication|NFC]] providing the last meter of the IoT", which derived from the common term "last kilometer" in infrastructure networks. The Anglo-American terms "last mile" was first used in public in his speech on "RFID and NFC: Providing the Last Yards for IoT"[http://www.rfidjournalevents.com/brasil/agenda/iot-workshop] on 8 October 2015. As input for the [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] Plenary the respective committee SC31 used then "IoT's First Meter".

In 2019 he received the [https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.aimglobal.org/resource/resmgr/aim_awards/2019_aim_award_winners_list_.pdf AIM Ted Williams Award]<ref>[https://www.aimglobal.org/page/Awards_Home AIM Awards]</ref>.
