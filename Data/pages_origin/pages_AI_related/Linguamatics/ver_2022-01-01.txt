The core software, "I2E", is used by a number of companies to either extend their own software or to publish their data.

[[Copyright Clearance Center]] uses I2E to produce searchable [[Search engine indexing|indexes]] of material that would otherwise be unsearchable due to copyright.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.com/ccc-and-linguamatics-combined-solution/|title=The combined CCC and Linguamatics solution}}</ref>

[[Thomson Reuters]] produces Cortellis Informatics Clinical Text Analytics, which depends on I2E to make clinical data accessible and searchable.<ref name="thom"/>

[[Pipeline Pilot]] can integrate I2E as part of a workflow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/linguamatics-integrate-i2e-text-mining-software-accelrys-pipeline-pilot|title=Linguamatics to Integrate I2E Text-Mining Software with Accelrys' Pipeline Pilot}}</ref>

[[ChemAxon]] can be used alongside I2E to allow [[named entity recognition]] of chemicals within [[unstructured data]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/linguamatics-and-chemaxon-announce-project-to-enhance-text-mining-chemistry|title=Linguamatics and ChemAxon Announce Project to Enhance Text Mining in Chemistry}}</ref>
