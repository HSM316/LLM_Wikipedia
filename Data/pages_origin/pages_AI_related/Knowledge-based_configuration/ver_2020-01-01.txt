'''Knowledge-based configuration''', or also referred to as '''product configuration''' or '''product customization''', is an activity of [[Personalization|customising]] a product to meet the needs of a particular customer. The product in question may consist of mechanical parts, services, and software. Knowledge-based configuration is a major application area for [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and it is based on modelling of the configurations in a manner that allows the utilisation of AI techniques for searching for a valid configuration to meet the needs of a particular customer.<ref group="A" name="Stum97"/><ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/><ref group="A" name="Soin98"/><ref group="A" name="Felf01"/><ref group="A" name="Wang11"/><ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/><ref group="B" name="HMR2008"/><ref group="B" name="FS2006"/>

==Background==
Knowledge-based configuration (of complex products and services) has a long history as an [[artificial intelligence]] application area, see, e.g.<ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/><ref group="A" name="Stum97"/><ref group="A" name="a1"/><ref group="A" name="a2"/><ref group="A" name="a3"/><ref group="A" name="a4"/><ref group="A" name="a5"/><ref group="A" name="Mitt89"/> Informally, configuration can be defined as a "special case of design activity, where the artifact being configured is assembled from instances of a fixed set of well-defined component types which can be composed conforming to a set of constraints".<ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/> Such constraints<ref group="B" name="RBW2006"/> are representing technical restrictions, restrictions related to economic aspects, and conditions related to production processes. The result of a configuration process is a product configuration (concrete configuration), i.e., a list of instances and in some cases also connections between these instances. Examples of such configurations are computers to be delivered or financial service portfolio offers (e.g., a combination of loan and corresponding risk insurance).

==Configuration systems==
'''Configuration systems'''<ref group="B" name="FHBT2014"/><ref group="A" name="Stum97"/><ref group="A" name="Sabi98"/> or also referred to as '''configurators''' or '''mass customization toolkits''',<ref group="A" name="a11"/> are one of the most successfully applied [[Artificial Intelligence]] technologies. Examples are the automotive industry,<ref group="A" name="a4"/><ref group="B" name="HW2012"/> the telecommunication industry,<ref group="A" name="a2"/> the computer industry,<ref group="A" name="a1"/><ref group="A" name="a9"/> and power electric transformers.<ref group="A" name="a3"/> Starting with rule-based approaches such as R1/[[XCON]],<ref group="A" name="a1"/> model-based representations of knowledge (in contrast to rule-based representations) have been developed which strictly separate product domain knowledge from the problem solving one - examples thereof are the [[constraint satisfaction problem]], the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], and different [[answer set programming]] (ASP) representations. There are two commonly cited conceptualizations of configuration knowledge.<ref group="A" name="Soin98"/><ref group="A" name="Felf01"/> The most important concepts in these are components, ports, resources and functions.  This separation of product domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge increased the effectiveness of configuration application development and maintenance,<ref group="A" name="a2"/><ref group="A" name="a4"/><ref group="A" name="a5"/><ref group="A" name="a10"/> since changes in the product domain knowledge do not affect search strategies and vice versa.

Configurators are also often considered as "[[open innovation]] toolkits", i.e., tools which support customers in the product identification phase.<ref group="A" name="a12a1"/> In this context customers are innovators who articulate their requirements leading to new innovative products.<ref group="A" name="a12a1"/><ref group="A" name="a14"/><ref group="A" name="a26"/>  "Mass Confusion" <ref group="A" name="a15"/> – the overwhelming of customers by a large number of possible solution alternatives (choices) – is a phenomenon which often comes with the application of configuration technologies. This phenomenon motivated the creation of personalized configuration environments taking into account a customer’s knowledge and preferences.<ref group="A" name="a13"/><ref group="A" name="a7"/>

==Configuration process==
Core configuration, i.e., guiding the user and checking the consistency of user requirements with the knowledge base, solution presentation and translation of configuration results into [[bill of materials]] (BOM) are major tasks to be supported by a configurator.<ref group="A" name="a12a"/><ref group="B" name="BMU2012"/><ref group="A" name="Wang11"/><ref group="A" name="a11"/><ref group="A" name="a16"/> Configuration knowledge bases are often built using proprietary languages.<ref group="A" name="a5"/><ref group="A" name="a13"/><ref group="A" name="a12"/>
In most cases knowledge bases are developed by knowledge engineers who elicit product, marketing and sales knowledge from domain experts. Configuration knowledge bases are composed of a formal description of the structure of the product and further constraints restricting the possible feature and component combinations.

Configurators known as [[Characteristic based product configurator|characteristic based product configurators]] use sets of discrete variables that are either binary or have one of several values, and these variables define every possible product variation.

==Software and service configuration==
Recently, knowledge based configuration has been extended to service and software configuration. Modeling software configuration has been based on two main approaches: feature modeling,<ref group="A" name="a20"/><ref group="B" name="a21"/> and component-connectors.<ref group="A" name="a22"/> Kumbang [[domain ontology]] combines the previous approaches building on the tradition of knowledge based configuration.<ref group="A" name="a23"/>
