The '''Fourth Industrial Revolution''' (or '''Industry 4.0''') is the ongoing [[automation]] of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale [[machine-to-machine]] communication (M2M) and the [[internet of things]] (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is Industry 4.0?

== History ==
The phrase ''Fourth Industrial Revolution'' was first introduced by [[Klaus Schwab]], executive chairman of the [[World Economic Forum]], in a 2015 article published by ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-12-12/fourth-industrial-revolution/ |title=The Fourth Industrial Revolution|last=Schwab|first=Klaus|date=2015-12-12|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> "Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution" was the 2016 theme of the [[World Economic Forum#Annual meeting in Davos|World Economic Forum Annual Meeting]], in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Marr|first=Bernard|title=Why Everyone Must Get Ready For The 4th Industrial Revolution|language=en|work=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/04/05/why-everyone-must-get-ready-for-4th-industrial-revolution/#5af877b33f90|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref>

On October 10, 2016, the Forum announced the opening of its Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/10/new-forum-center-to-advance-global-cooperation-on-fourth-industrial-revolution/|title=New Forum Center to Advance Global Cooperation on Fourth Industrial Revolution|date=October 10, 2016|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref> This was also subject and title of Schwab's 2016 book.<ref>{{cite book

=== First Industrial Revolution ===
The [[First Industrial Revolution]] was marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to it is between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the United States. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger [[middle class]]. It also had an effect on British industry at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Industrial Revolution and Work in Nineteenth-Century Europe - 1992, Page xiv by David Cannadine, Raphael Samuel, Charles Tilly, Theresa McBride, Christopher H.

=== Second Industrial Revolution ===
The [[Second Industrial Revolution]], also known as the Technological Revolution, is the period between 1871 and 1914 that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. Increasing electrification allowed for factories to develop the modern production line. It was a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity, which also caused a surge in unemployment since many factory workers were replaced by machines.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Electricity|url=https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/history-electricity/}}</ref>

=== Third Industrial Revolution ===
The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the [[Digital Revolution]], occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two world wars, resulting from a slowdown of industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|global financial crisis in 1929]] followed by the [[Great Depression]] affected many industrialized countries. The production of the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1 computer]], which used binary [[floating-point numbers]] and [[Boolean logic]], a decade later, was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. The next significant development in communication technologies was the [[supercomputer]], with extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process; machinery began to abrogate the need for human power.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History – Future of Industry|url=https://www.sanayidegelecek.com/en/sanayi-4-0/tarihsel-gelisim/}}</ref>

=== German Strategy ===
The term "Industrie 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the [[German government]], which promotes the [[Digital Revolution|computerization]] of manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0 - BMBF|url=https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.html|author=BMBF-Internetredaktion|date=21 January 2016|website=Bmbf.de|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> The term "Industrie 4.0" was publicly introduced in the same year at the [[Hannover Fair]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Industrie 4.0: Mit dem Internet der Dinge auf dem Weg zur 4. industriellen Revolution|url=http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|date=1 April 2011|website=Vdi-nachrichten.com|language=de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304101009/http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|archive-date=4 March 2013|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref> In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The workgroup members and partners are recognized as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0. On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented. This working group was headed by Siegfried Dais, of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Henning Kagermann, of the [[German Academy of Science and Engineering]].<ref>[http://www.plattform-i40.de Industrie 4.0 Plattform] Last download on 15. Juli 2013</ref>

As Industry 4.0 principles have been applied by companies, they have sometimes been rebranded. For example, the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]] has branded its own Industry 4.0 research project M4.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=Time to join the digital dots|url=https://www.aero-mag.com/meggitt-applied-research-technology-group-data-capture/|date=2018-06-22|language=en|accessdate=2018-07-25}}</ref>

The discussion of how the shift to Industry 4.0, especially [[digitization]], will affect the labour market is being discussed in Germany under the topic of [[Work 4.0]].<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0''.</ref>

The characteristics of the German government's Industry 4.0 strategy involve the strong customization of products under the conditions of highly flexible (mass-) production.<ref>{{cite web|title=This Is Not the Fourth Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/01/the_world_economic_forum_is_wrong_this_isn_t_the_fourth_industrial_revolution.html|date=29 January 2016|via=Slate}}</ref> The required automation technology is improved by the introduction of methods of self-optimization, self-configuration,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtC3DAfLTxw Selbstkonfiguierende Automation für Intelligente Technische Systeme], Video, last download on 27.

== Design principles and goals==
There are four design principles identified as integral to Industry 4.0:<ref name="Definition-I4.0">Hermann, Pentek, Otto, 2016: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7427673&newsearch=true&queryText=industrie%204.0%20design%20principles Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios], accessed on 4 May 2016</ref>
* Interconnection — the ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of things, or the internet of people (IoP)<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|last=Bonner|first=Mike|title=What is Industry 4.0 and What Does it Mean for My Manufacturing?|language=en-us|url=https://blog.viscosity.com/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-my-manufacturing|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>
* Information transparency — the transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with comprehensive information to make decisions. Inter-connectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality<ref name="auto" />
* Technical assistance — the technological facility of systems to assist humans in decision-making and problem-solving, and the ability to help humans with difficult or unsafe tasks<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Everyone Must Know About Industry 4.0|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/06/20/what-everyone-must-know-about-industry-4-0/|last=Marr|first=Bernard|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>
* Decentralized decisions — the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interference, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level<ref>Gronau, Norbert, Marcus Grum, and Benedict Bender. "Determining the optimal level of autonomy in cyber-physical production systems." 2016 IEEE 14th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN). IEEE, 2016. DOI:10.1109/INDIN.2016.7819367</ref>

== Components ==
[[File:5G Sender und Empfänger.jpg|thumb|5G Cell Tower]]

The Fourth Industrial Revolution consists of many components when looking closely into our society and current digital trends. To understand how extensive these components are, here are some contributing digital technologies as examples:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=How To Define Industry 4.0: Main Pillars Of Industry 4.0|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326557388|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref>
* Mobile devices
* Internet of things (IoT) platforms
* Location detection technologies (electronic identification)
* Advanced human-machine interfaces
* Authentication and fraud detection
* 3D printing
* Smart sensors
* Big analytics and advanced processes
* Multilevel customer interaction and customer profiling
* Augmented reality/ wearables
* On-demand availability of computer [[system resource]]s
*Data visualization and triggered "live" training<ref name=":0" />

Mainly these technologies can be summarized into four major components, defining the term “Industry 4.0” or “smart factory”:<ref name=":0" />
* Cyber-physical systems
* IoT
* On-demand availability of computer system resources
* Cognitive computing<ref name=":0" />

Industry 4.0 networks a wide range of new technologies to create value. Using [[cyber-physical system]]s that monitor physical processes, a virtual copy of the physical world can be designed. Characteristics of cyber-physical systems include the ability to make decentralized decisions independently, reaching a high degree of autonomy.<ref name=":0" />

The value created in Industrie 4.0, can be relied upon electronic identification, in which the smart manufacturing require set technologies to be incorporated in the manufacturing process to thus be classified as in the development path of Industrie 4.0 and no longer digitisation. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index – Managing the Digital Transformation of Companies|url=https://en.acatech.de/publication/industrie-4-0-maturity-index-managing-the-digital-transformation-of-companies/|access-date=2020-12-21|website=acatech - National Academy of Science and Engineering|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Primary Drivers===
*Digitization and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains — Industry 4.0 integrates processes vertically, across the entire organization, including processes in product development, manufacturing, structuring, and service; horizontally, Industry 4.0 includes internal operations from suppliers to customers as well as all key value chain partners.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Industry 4.0: Building the digital enterprise.|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/industries-4.0/landing-page/industry-4.0-building-your-digital-enterprise-april-2016.pdf|last=Geissbauer|first=Dr. R}}</ref>
*Digitization of product and services — integrating new methods of data collection and analysis–such as through the expansion of existing products or creation of new digitised products–helps companies to generate data on product use in order to refine products<ref name=":1" />
*Digital business models and customer access — customer satisfaction is a perpetual, multi-stage process that requires modification in real-time to adapt to the changing needs of consumers<ref name=":1" />

== Biggest trends ==
In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the trend towards [[automation]] and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, industrial internet of things,<ref>{{Cite web|title=IIOT AND AUTOMATION|url=https://www.punetechtrol.com/blogs/iiot-and-automation}}</ref> [[cloud computing]],<ref name="Definition-I4.0" /><ref>[[Jürgen Jasperneite]]:''[http://www.computer-automation.de/steuerungsebene/steuernregeln/fachwissen/article/93559/0/Was_hinter_Begriffen_wie_Industrie_40_steckt/ Was hinter Begriffen wie Industrie 4.0 steckt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401204034/http://www.computer-automation.de/steuerungsebene/steuernregeln/fachwissen/article/93559/0/Was_hinter_Begriffen_wie_Industrie_40_steckt/|date=1 April 2013}}'' in ''Computer & Automation'', 19 December 2012 accessed on 23 December 2012</ref><ref>Kagermann, H., W.

=== Smart factory ===
The Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters what has been called a "smart factory". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Baotong|last2=Wan|first2=Jiafu|last3=Shu|first3=Lei|last4=Li|first4=Peng|last5=Mukherjee|first5=Mithun|last6=Yin|first6=Boxing|date=2018|title=Smart Factory of Industry 4.0: Key Technologies, Application Case, and Challenges|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8207346|journal=IEEE Access|volume=6|pages=6505–6519|doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783682|s2cid=3809961|issn=2169-3536|doi-access=free}}</ref> Over the internet of things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in synchronic time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the [[value chain]].<ref name="Definition-I4.0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Padovano|first1=Antonio|last2=Longo|first2=Francesco|last3=Nicoletti|first3=Letizia|last4=Mirabelli|first4=Giovanni|date=2018-01-01|title=A Digital Twin based Service Oriented Application for a 4.0 Knowledge Navigation in the Smart Factory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896318315143|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|series=16th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing INCOM 2018|language=en|volume=51|issue=11|pages=631–636|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.389|issn=2405-8963|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Predictive maintenance ===
Industry 4.0 can also provide predictive maintenance, due to the use of technology and the IoT sensors. Predictive maintenance – which can identify maintenance issues in live – allows machine owners to perform cost-effective maintenance and determine it ahead of time before the machinery fails or gets damaged.&nbsp; For example, a company in LA could understand if a piece of equipment in Singapore is running at an abnormal speed or temperature. They could then decide whether or not it needs to be repaired.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Are You Ready For The Fourth Industrial Revolution?|url=https://theonebrief.com/are-you-ready-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/|date=2017-05-04|website=The One Brief|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

=== 3D printing ===
[[File:Relativity Stargate 3D Printer.jpg|thumb|Relativity Stargate 3D Printer]]
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is said to have extensive dependency on [[3D printing]] technology.&nbsp; Some advantages of 3D printing for industry are that 3D printing can print many geometric structures, as well as simplify the product design process. It is also relatively environmentally friendly. In low-volume production, it can also decrease lead times and total production costs. Moreover, it can increase flexibility, reduce warehousing costs and help the company towards the adoption of a mass customization business strategy. In addition, 3D printing can be very useful for printing spare parts and installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Yong|last2=Stecke|first2=Kathryn E.|last3=Li|first3=Dongni|date=2018-01-17|title=The evolution of production systems from Industry 2.0 through Industry 4.0|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=848–861|doi=10.1080/00207543.2017.1403664|issn=0020-7543|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The determining factor is the pace of change. The correlation of the speed of technological development and, as a result, socio-economic and infrastructural transformations with human life allow us to state a qualitative leap in the speed of development, which marks a transition to a new time era.<ref>[https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=39147614 Shestakova I.

=== Smart sensors ===

Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0 but also for other “smart ” megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities, and smart factories.<ref>Imkamp, D., Berthold, J., Heizmann, M., Kniel, K., Manske, E., Peterek, M., Schmitt, R., Seidler, J., and Sommer, K.-D.: Challenges and trends in manufacturing measurement technology – the “Industrie 4.0” concept, J. Sens. Sens. Syst., 5, 325–335, https://doi.org/10.5194/jsss-5-325-2016, 2016</ref>

Smart sensors are devices, which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. 
With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation effort to a great extent and help realize a dense array of sensors.<ref>A.A. Kolomenskii, P.D. Gershon, H.A. Schuessler, Sensitivity and
detection limit of concentration and adsorption measurements by
laser-induced surface-plasmon resonance, Appl. Opt. 36 (1997)
6539–6547</ref>

The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognized and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to the statement "Industry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems."<ref>Arnold, H.: Kommentar Industrie 4.0: Ohne Sensorsysteme geht nichts, available at: http://www.elektroniknet.de/messen-testen/ sonstiges/artikel/110776/ (last access: 10 March 2018), 2014</ref>

However, there are few issues, such as time synchronization error, data loss, and dealing with large amounts of harvested data, which all limit the implementation of full-fledged systems. Moreover, additional limits on these functionalities represents the battery power.
One example of the integration of smart sensors in the electronic devices, is the case of smart watches, where sensors receive the data from the movement of the user, process the data and as a result, provide the user with the information about how many steps they have walked in a day and also converts the  data into calories burned.

===== Agriculture and Food Industries =====

Smart sensors in these two fields are still in the testing stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Partha Pratim|date=2017-01-01|title=Internet of things for smart agriculture: Technologies, practices and future direction|url=https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-ambient-intelligence-and-smart-environments/ais440|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=395–420|doi=10.3233/AIS-170440|issn=1876-1364}}</ref>
These innovative connected sensors collect, interpret and communicate the information available in the plots (leaf area, vegetation index, chlorophyll, hygrometry, temperature, water potential, radiation). Based on this scientific data, the objective is to enable real-time monitoring via a smartphone with a range of advice that optimizes plot management in terms of results, time and costs.
On the farm, these sensors can be used to detect crop stages and recommend inputs and treatments at the right time. As well as controlling the level of irrigation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Diogo|last2=Corista|first2=Pedro|last3=Gião|first3=João|last4=Ghimire|first4=Sudeep|last5=Sarraipa|first5=João|last6=Jardim-Gonçalves|first6=Ricardo|date=June 2017|title=Towards smart agriculture using FIWARE enablers|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8280066|journal=2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)|pages=1544–1551|doi=10.1109/ICE.2017.8280066|isbn=978-1-5386-0774-9|s2cid=3433104}}</ref>

The food industry requires more and more security and transparency and full documentation is required. This new technology is used as a tracking system as well as the collection of human data as well as product data.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Otles|first1=Semih|title=15 - Industry 4.0: The Smart Factory of the Future in Beverage Industry|date=2019-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128152607000158|work=Production and Management of Beverages|pages=439–469|editor-last=Grumezescu|editor-first=Alexandru Mihai|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|language=en|isbn=978-0-12-815260-7|access-date=2020-09-26|last2=Sakalli|first2=Aysegul|editor2-last=Holban|editor2-first=Alina Maria}}</ref>

=== Economic ===
* High economic costs
* Business model adaptation
* Unclear economic benefits/excessive investment<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

=== Social ===
* Privacy concerns
* Surveillance and distrust
* General reluctance to change by stakeholders
* Threat of redundancy of the corporate IT department
* Loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes, especially for blue collar workers<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Longo|first1=Francesco|last2=Padovano|first2=Antonio|last3=Umbrello|first3=Steven|date=January 2020|title=Value-Oriented and Ethical Technology Engineering in Industry 5.0: A Human-Centric Perspective for the Design of the Factory of the Future|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/12/4182|journal=Applied Sciences|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=4182|doi=10.3390/app10124182|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Political ===
* Lack of regulation, standards and forms of certifications
* Unclear legal issues and data security <ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

=== Organizational ===
* IT security issues, which are greatly aggravated by the inherent need to open up those previously closed production shops
* Reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication (M2M), including very short and stable latency times
* Need to maintain the integrity of production processes
* Need to avoid any IT snags, as those would cause expensive production outages
* Need to protect industrial know-how (contained also in the control files for the industrial automation gear)
* Lack of adequate skill-sets to expedite the transition towards a fourth industrial revolution
* Low top management commitment
* Insufficient qualification of employees <ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />

==Applications==
The aerospace industry has sometimes been characterized as "too low volume for extensive automation"; however, Industry 4.0 principles have been investigated by several aerospace companies, and technologies have been developed to improve productivity where the upfront cost of automation cannot be justified. One example of this is the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]]'s project, M4.<ref name="auto1"/>

The increasing use of the [[Industrial Internet of Things]] is referred to as Industry 4.0 at Bosch, and generally in Germany. Applications include machines that can predict failures and trigger maintenance processes autonomously or self-organized coordination that react to unexpected changes in production.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Internet of Things and the future of manufacturing &#124; McKinsey & Company|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/the_internet_of_things_and_the_future_of_manufacturing|author1=Markus Liffler|author2=Andreas Tschiesner|date=6 January 2013|website=Mckinsey.com|accessdate=2016-11-30}}</ref>

Industry 4.0 inspired Innovation 4.0, a move toward digitization for academia and [[research and development]].<ref name=Polymer/> In 2017, the £81m Materials Innovation Factory (MIF) at the [[University of Liverpool]] opened as a center for computer aided materials science,<ref>{{cite web |title=Formulus |url=https://www.cas.org/products/formulus |website=Develop Safe and Effective Products with Formulus® |accessdate=17 August 2020}}</ref> where robotic formulation,<ref>{{cite news |title=Innovation 4.0: A Digital Revolution for R&D |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/manufacturing/2019/09/innovation-40-digital-revolution-rd |accessdate=17 August 2020 |publisher=New Statesman}}</ref> data capture and modeling are being integrated into development practices.<ref name=Polymer>{{cite journal |last1=McDonagh |display-authors=etal |first1=James |title=What Can Digitization Do For Formulated Product Innovation and Development |journal=Polymer International |date=31 May 2020 |doi=10.1002/pi.6056 |url=https://figshare.com/articles/What_Can_Digitization_Do_For_Formulated_Product_Innovation_and_Development/11763864 }}</ref>
