=== First Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
The [[First Industrial Revolution]] was marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to was between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the United States. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger [[middle class]]. It also had an effect on British industry at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Industrial Revolution and Work in Nineteenth-Century Europe - 1992, Page xiv by David Cannadine, Raphael Samuel, Charles Tilly, Theresa McBride, Christopher H.

=== Second Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
The [[Second Industrial Revolution]], also known as the Technological Revolution, is the period between 1871 and 1914 that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. Increasing electrification allowed for factories to develop the modern production line. It was a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity, which also caused a surge in unemployment since many factory workers were replaced by machines.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Electricity|url=https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/history-electricity/}}</ref>

=== Third Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Digital Revolution}}
The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the [[Digital Revolution]], occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two world wars, resulting from a slowdown of industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. The production of the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1 computer]], which used binary [[floating-point numbers]] and [[Boolean logic]], a decade later, was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. The next significant development in communication technologies was the [[supercomputer]], with extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process; machinery began to abrogate the need for human power.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History – Future of Industry|url=https://www.sanayidegelecek.com/en/sanayi-4-0/tarihsel-gelisim/}}</ref>

== Fourth Industrial Revolution ==
In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the trend towards [[automation]] and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include [[Cyber-physical_system|cyber-physical systems (CPS)]], IoT, industrial internet of things,<ref>{{Cite web|title=IIOT AND AUTOMATION|url=https://www.punetechtrol.com/blogs/iiot-and-automation}}</ref> [[cloud computing]],<ref name="Definition-I4.0">Hermann, Pentek, Otto, 2016: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7427673&newsearch=true&queryText=industrie%204.0%20design%20principles Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios], accessed on 4 May 2016</ref><ref>[[Jürgen Jasperneite]]:''[http://www.computer-automation.de/steuerungsebene/steuernregeln/fachwissen/article/93559/0/Was_hinter_Begriffen_wie_Industrie_40_steckt/ Was hinter Begriffen wie Industrie 4.0 steckt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401204034/http://www.computer-automation.de/steuerungsebene/steuernregeln/fachwissen/article/93559/0/Was_hinter_Begriffen_wie_Industrie_40_steckt/|date=1 April 2013}}'' in ''Computer & Automation'', 19 December 2012 accessed on 23 December 2012</ref><ref>Kagermann, H., W.

=== Key themes===
Four themes are presented that summarize an Industry 4.0:<ref name="Definition-I4.0"/>
* Interconnection — the ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of things, or the internet of people (IoP)<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|last=Bonner|first=Mike|title=What is Industry 4.0 and What Does it Mean for My Manufacturing?|language=en-us|url=https://blog.viscosity.com/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-my-manufacturing|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>
* Information transparency — the transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with comprehensive information to make decisions. Inter-connectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality<ref name="auto"/>
* Technical assistance — the technological facility of systems to assist humans in decision-making and problem-solving, and the ability to help humans with difficult or unsafe tasks<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marr|first=Bernard|title=What Everyone Must Know About Industry 4.0|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/06/20/what-everyone-must-know-about-industry-4-0/|access-date=2020-05-27|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>
* Decentralized decisions — the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interference, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level<ref>Gronau, Norbert, Marcus Grum, and Benedict Bender. "Determining the optimal level of autonomy in cyber-physical production systems." 2016 IEEE 14th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN). IEEE, 2016. DOI:10.1109/INDIN.2016.7819367</ref>

=== Distinctiveness===
Proponents of the Fourth Industrial Revolution suggest it is a distinct revolution rather than simply a prolongation of the Third Industrial Revolution.<ref name="faff"/> This is due to the following characteristics: 
* Velocity — exponential speed at which incumbent industries are affected and displaced<ref name="faff"/>
* Scope and systems impact - the large amount of sectors and firms that are affected<ref name="faff"/>
* Paradigm shift in technology policy — new policies designed for this new way of doing are present. An example is Singapore's formal recognition of Industry 4.0 in its innovation policies.

Critics of the concept dismiss Industry 4.0 as a marketing strategy. They suggest that although revolutionary changes are identifiable in distinct sectors, there is no systemic changes so far. In addition, the pace of recognition of Industry 4.0 and policy transition varies across countries; the definition of Industry 4.0 is not harmonized.

The application of the Fourth Industrial Revolution operates through:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=How To Define Industry 4.0: Main Pillars Of Industry 4.0|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326557388|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-09}}</ref>
* Mobile devices
* Internet of things (IoT) platforms
* Location detection technologies (electronic identification)
* Advanced human-machine interfaces
* Authentication and fraud detection
* Smart sensors
* Big analytics and advanced processes
* Multilevel customer interaction and customer profiling
* Augmented reality/ wearables
* On-demand availability of computer [[system resource]]s
* Data visualization and triggered "live" training<ref name=":0"/>

Mainly these technologies can be summarized into four major components, defining the term “Industry 4.0” or “smart factory”:<ref name=":0"/>
* [[Cyber-physical system]]s
* [[Internet of things]] (IoT)
* On-demand availability of computer system resources
* [[Cognitive computing]]<ref name=":0"/>

Industry 4.0 networks a wide range of new technologies to create value. Using [[cyber-physical system]]s that monitor physical processes, a virtual copy of the physical world can be designed. Characteristics of cyber-physical systems include the ability to make decentralized decisions independently, reaching a high degree of autonomy.<ref name=":0"/>

The value created in Industrie 4.0, can be relied upon electronic identification, in which the smart manufacturing require set technologies to be incorporated in the manufacturing process to thus be classified as in the development path of Industrie 4.0 and no longer digitisation. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index – Managing the Digital Transformation of Companies|url=https://en.acatech.de/publication/industrie-4-0-maturity-index-managing-the-digital-transformation-of-companies/|access-date=2020-12-21|website=acatech - National Academy of Science and Engineering|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Primary drivers===

==== Digitization and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains ====
Industry 4.0 integrates processes vertically, across the entire organization, including processes in product development, manufacturing, structuring, and service; horizontally, Industry 4.0 includes internal operations from suppliers to customers as well as all key value chain partners.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Industry 4.0: Building the digital enterprize.|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/industries-4.0/landing-page/industry-4.0-building-your-digital-enterprise-april-2016.pdf|last=Geissbauer|first=Dr. R}}</ref>

==== Digitization of product and services ====
Integrating new methods of data collection and analysis–such as through the expansion of existing products or creation of new digitized products–helps companies to generate data on product use in order to refine products<ref name=":1"/>

==== Digital business models and customer access ====
Customer satisfaction is a perpetual, multi-stage process that requires modification in real-time to adapt to the changing needs of consumers<ref name=":1"/>

== Trends ==
=== Smart factory ===



Smart Factory is the vision of a production environment in which production facilities and logistics systems are organized without human intervention. 

The Smart Factory is no longer a vision. While different model factories represent the feasible, many enterprizes already clarify with examples practically, how the Smart Factory functions.

The technical foundations on which the Smart Factory - the intelligent factory - is based are cyber-physical systems that communicate with each other using the Internet of Things and Services. An important part of this process is the exchange of data between the product and the production line. This enables a much more efficient connection of the Supply Chain and better organisation within any production environment.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters what has been called a "smart factory". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Baotong|last2=Wan|first2=Jiafu|last3=Shu|first3=Lei|last4=Li|first4=Peng|last5=Mukherjee|first5=Mithun|last6=Yin|first6=Boxing|date=2018|title=Smart Factory of Industry 4.0: Key Technologies, Application Case, and Challenges|journal=IEEE Access|volume=6|pages=6505–6519|doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783682|s2cid=3809961|issn=2169-3536|doi-access=free}}</ref> Over the internet of things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in synchronic time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the [[value chain]].<ref name="Definition-I4.0"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Padovano|first1=Antonio|last2=Longo|first2=Francesco|last3=Nicoletti|first3=Letizia|last4=Mirabelli|first4=Giovanni|date=2018-01-01|title=A Digital Twin based Service Oriented Application for a 4.0 Knowledge Navigation in the Smart Factory|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|series=16th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing INCOM 2018|language=en|volume=51|issue=11|pages=631–636|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.389|issn=2405-8963|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Predictive maintenance ===
Industry 4.0 can also provide predictive maintenance, due to the use of technology and the IoT sensors. Predictive maintenance – which can identify maintenance issues in live – allows machine owners to perform cost-effective maintenance and determine it ahead of time before the machinery fails or gets damaged.&nbsp; For example, a company in Los Angeles could understand if a piece of equipment in Singapore is running at an abnormal speed or temperature. They could then decide whether or not it needs to be repaired.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Are You Ready For The Fourth Industrial Revolution?|url=https://theonebrief.com/are-you-ready-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/|date=2017-05-04|website=The One Brief|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

=== 3D printing ===

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is said to have extensive dependency on [[3D printing]] technology.&nbsp; Some advantages of 3D printing for industry are that 3D printing can print many geometric structures, as well as simplify the product design process. It is also relatively environmentally friendly. In low-volume production, it can also decrease lead times and total production costs. Moreover, it can increase flexibility, reduce warehousing costs and help the company towards the adoption of a mass customization business strategy. In addition, 3D printing can be very useful for printing spare parts and installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Yong|last2=Stecke|first2=Kathryn E.|last3=Li|first3=Dongni|date=2018-01-17|title=The evolution of production systems from Industry 2.0 through Industry 4.0|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=848–861|doi=10.1080/00207543.2017.1403664|issn=0020-7543|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The determining factor is the pace of change. The correlation of the speed of technological development and, as a result, socio-economic and infrastructural transformations with human life allow us to state a qualitative leap in the speed of development, which marks a transition to a new time era.<ref>[https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=39147614 Shestakova I. G.&nbsp;New temporality of digital civilization: the future has already come // // Scientific and Technical Journal of St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University. Humanities and social sciences. 2019. # 2. P.20-29]</ref>

=== Smart sensors ===

Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0 but also for other “smart” megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities, and smart factories.<ref>Imkamp, D., Berthold, J., Heizmann, M., Kniel, K., Manske, E., Peterek, M., Schmitt, R., Seidler, J., and Sommer, K.-D.: Challenges and trends in manufacturing measurement technology – the “Industrie 4.0” concept, J. Sens. Sens. Syst., 5, 325–335, https://doi.org/10.5194/jsss-5-325-2016, 2016</ref>

Smart sensors are devices, which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. 
With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation effort to a great extent and help realize a dense array of sensors.<ref>A.A. Kolomenskii, P.D. Gershon, H.A. Schuessler, Sensitivity and
detection limit of concentration and adsorption measurements by
laser-induced surface-plasmon resonance, Appl. Opt. 36 (1997)
6539–6547</ref>

The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognized and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to the statement "Industry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems."<ref>Arnold, H.: Kommentar Industrie 4.0: Ohne Sensorsysteme geht nichts, available at: http://www.elektroniknet.de/messen-testen/ sonstiges/artikel/110776/ (last access: 10 March 2018), 2014</ref>

However, there are few issues, such as time synchronization error, data loss, and dealing with large amounts of harvested data, which all limit the implementation of full-fledged systems. Moreover, additional limits on these functionalities represents the battery power.
One example of the integration of smart sensors in the electronic devices, is the case of smart watches, where sensors receive the data from the movement of the user, process the data and as a result, provide the user with the information about how many steps they have walked in a day and also converts the  data into calories burned.

==== Agriculture and Food Industries ====
[[File:IFarm.fi Vertical farm Finland.jpg|thumb|Hydroponic Vertical farming]]

Smart sensors in these two fields are still in the testing stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Partha Pratim|date=2017-01-01|title=Internet of things for smart agriculture: Technologies, practices and future direction|url=https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-ambient-intelligence-and-smart-environments/ais440|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=395–420|doi=10.3233/AIS-170440|issn=1876-1364}}</ref>
These innovative connected sensors collect, interpret and communicate the information available in the plots (leaf area, vegetation index, chlorophyll, hygrometry, temperature, water potential, radiation).

=== Germany ===
The term "Industrie 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the [[German government]] and specifically relates to that project policy, rather than a wider notion of a Fourth Industrial Revolution of 4IR.<ref name=":5"/> which promotes the [[Digital Revolution|computerization]] of manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|author=BMBF-Internetredaktion|date=21 January 2016|title=Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0 - BMBF|url=https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.html|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Bmbf.de}}</ref> The term "Industrie 4.0" was publicly introduced in the same year at the [[Hannover Fair]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1 April 2011|title=Industrie 4.0: Mit dem Internet der Dinge auf dem Weg zur 4. industriellen Revolution|url=http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304101009/http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|archive-date=4 March 2013|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Vdi-nachrichten.com|language=de}}</ref> Renowned German professor [[Wolfgang Wahlster]] is sometimes called the inventor of the "[[Industry 4.0]]" term.<ref name="Sensors_2020_08">{{cite journal|last1=Szajna|first1=Andrzej|last2=Stryjski|first2=Roman|last3=Wozniak|first3=Waldemar|last4=Chamier-Gliszczynski|first4=Norbert|last5=Kostrzewski|first5=Mariusz|date=22 August 2020|title=Assessment of Augmented Reality in Manual Wiring Production Process with Use of Mobile AR Glasses|journal=Sensors|publisher=MDPI|volume=20|issue=17|page=4755|bibcode=2020Senso..20.4755S|doi=10.3390/s20174755|pmc=7506974|pmid=32842693|doi-access=free}}</ref> In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The workgroup members and partners are recognized as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0. On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented. This working group was headed by Siegfried Dais, of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Henning Kagermann, of the [[German Academy of Science and Engineering]].<ref>[http://www.plattform-i40.de Industrie 4.0 Plattform] Last download on 15. Juli 2013</ref>

As Industry 4.0 principles have been applied by companies, they have sometimes been rebranded. For example, the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]] has branded its own Industry 4.0 research project M4.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|date=2018-06-22|title=Time to join the digital dots|url=https://www.aero-mag.com/meggitt-applied-research-technology-group-data-capture/|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}</ref>

The discussion of how the shift to Industry 4.0, especially [[digitization]], will affect the labour market is being discussed in Germany under the topic of [[Work 4.0]].<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0''.</ref>

The characteristics of the German government's Industry 4.0 strategy involve the strong customization of products under the conditions of highly flexible (mass-) production.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 January 2016|title=This Is Not the Fourth Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/01/the_world_economic_forum_is_wrong_this_isn_t_the_fourth_industrial_revolution.html|via=Slate}}</ref> The required automation technology is improved by the introduction of methods of self-optimization, self-configuration,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtC3DAfLTxw Selbstkonfiguierende Automation für Intelligente Technische Systeme], Video, last download on 27.

Another major project is the BMBF project RES-COM,<ref>{{cite web|title=Herzlich willkommen auf den Internetseiten des Projekts RES-COM - RES-COM Webseite|url=http://www.res-com-projekt.de/|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Res-com-projekt.de}}</ref> as well as the Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries".<ref>{{cite web|date=19 October 2016|title=RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries" - English|url=http://www.production-research.de/|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Production-research.de}}</ref> In 2015, the [[European Commission]] started the international [[Horizon 2020]] research project CREMA (Providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on the [[XaaS]] and Cloud model) as a major initiative to foster the Industry 4.0 topic.<ref>{{cite web|date=21 November 2016|title=H2020 CREMA - Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing|url=http://www.crema-project.eu|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Crema-project.eu}}</ref>

=== Indonesia ===
Another example is Making Indonesia 4.0, with a focus on improving industrial performance.<ref name="Scott-Kemmis et al. 2021"/> 

=== South Africa ===
South Africa appointed a Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2019, consisting of about 30 stakeholders with a background in academia, industry and government.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021">{{cite book|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377433/PDF/377433eng.pdf.multi|title=UNESCO Science Report: the Race Against Time for Smarter Development.|date=11 June 2021|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-100450-6|editor1-last=Schneegans|editor1-first=S.|location=Paris|editor2-last=Straza|editor2-first=T.|editor3-last=Lewis|editor3-first=J.}}</ref><ref name="Kraemer-Mbula et al. 2021">{{cite book|author1=Kraemer-Mbula|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377475/PDF/377475eng.pdf.multi|title=Southern Africa.

=== South Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has had a Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution since 2017.  The Republic of Korea’s I-Korea strategy (2017) is focusing on new growth engines that include AI, drones and autonomous cars, in line with the government’s innovation-driven economic policy.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021"/>

=== Uganda ===
Uganda adopted its own National 4IR Strategy in October 2020 with emphasis on e-governance, urban management (smart cities), health care, education, agriculture and the digital economy; to support local businesses, the government was contemplating introducing a local start-ups bill in 2020 which would require all accounting officers to exhaust the local market prior to procuring digital solutions from abroad.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021"/>

=== United Kingdom ===
In a policy paper published in 2019, the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy]], titled "Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution", outlined the need to evolve current regulatory models to remain competitive in evolving technological and social settings.<ref name=":6"/>

==Industry applications ==
The aerospace industry has sometimes been characterized as "too low volume for extensive automation"; however, Industry 4.0 principles have been investigated by several aerospace companies, and technologies have been developed to improve productivity where the upfront cost of automation cannot be justified. One example of this is the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]]'s project, M4.<ref name="auto1"/>

The increasing use of the [[Industrial Internet of Things]] is referred to as Industry 4.0 at [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and generally in [[Germany]]. Applications include machines that can predict failures and trigger maintenance processes autonomously or self-organized coordination that react to unexpected changes in production.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Internet of Things and the future of manufacturing &#124; McKinsey & Company |author1=Markus Liffler |author2=Andreas Tschiesner |date=6 January 2013 |website=Mckinsey.com |access-date=2016-11-30 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/the_internet_of_things_and_the_future_of_manufacturing}}</ref>

Industry 4.0 inspired Innovation 4.0, a move toward digitization for academia and [[research and development]].<ref name=Polymer/> In 2017, the £81M Materials Innovation Factory (MIF) at the [[University of Liverpool]] opened as a center for computer aided materials science,<ref name=cas20>{{cite web |title=Formulus |url=https://www.cas.org/products/formulus |website=Develop Safe and Effective Products with Formulus® |access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref> where robotic formulation,<ref name=robform>{{cite news |title=Innovation 4.0: A Digital Revolution for R&D |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/manufacturing/2019/09/innovation-40-digital-revolution-rd |access-date=17 August 2020 |publisher=New Statesman}}</ref> data capture and modeling are being integrated into development practices.<ref name=Polymer>{{cite journal |last1=McDonagh |display-authors=etal |first1=James |title=What Can Digitization Do For Formulated Product Innovation and Development |journal=Polymer International |date=31 May 2020 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=248–255 |doi=10.1002/pi.6056 |url=https://figshare.com/articles/What_Can_Digitization_Do_For_Formulated_Product_Innovation_and_Development/11763864 }}</ref>
