A part of this phase of industrial change is the joining of technologies like [[artificial intelligence]], [[CRISPR gene editing|gene editing]], to [[Robotics|advanced robotics]] that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological worlds.<ref name=":5"/><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=UK Gov Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy|date=11 June 2019|title=Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution|access-date=2021-11-18|website=GOV.UK|language=en}}</ref>

Throughout this, fundamental shifts are taking place in how the global production and supply network operates through ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology, large-scale [[machine-to-machine]] communication (M2M), and the [[internet of things]] (IoT). This integration results in increasing automation, improving communication and self-monitoring, and the use of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is Industry 4.0?

=== First Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
The First Industrial Revolution was marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to was between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the United States. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger middle class.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Industrial Revolution and Work in Nineteenth-Century Europe – 1992, Page xiv by David Cannadine, Raphael Samuel, Charles Tilly, Theresa McBride, Christopher H.

=== Second Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, is the period between 1871 and 1914 that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. Increasing electrification allowed for factories to develop the modern [[production line]]. It was a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity, which also caused a surge in unemployment since many factory workers were replaced by machines.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Electricity|url=https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/history-electricity/}}</ref>

=== Third Industrial Revolution ===
{{Main|Digital Revolution}}
The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two world wars, resulting from a slowdown of industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. The production of the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1 computer]], which used binary [[floating-point numbers]] and [[Boolean logic]], a decade later, was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. The next significant development in communication technologies was the [[supercomputer]], with extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process; machinery began to abrogate the need for human power.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History – Future of Industry|url=https://www.sanayidegelecek.com/en/sanayi-4-0/tarihsel-gelisim/}}</ref>

=== Key themes===
'''Industry 4.0 increases operational efficiency.'''
Four themes are presented that summarize an Industry 4.0:<ref name="Definition-I4.0"/>
* Interconnection – the ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of things, or the internet of people (IoP)<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|last=Bonner|first=Mike|title=What is Industry 4.0 and What Does it Mean for My Manufacturing?|language=en-us|url=https://blog.viscosity.com/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-my-manufacturing|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>
* Information transparency – the transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with comprehensive information to make decisions. Inter-connectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality<ref name="auto"/>
* Technical assistance – the technological facility of systems to assist humans in decision-making and problem-solving, and the ability to help humans with difficult or unsafe tasks<ref>{{Cite web|last=Marr|first=Bernard|title=What Everyone Must Know About Industry 4.0|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/06/20/what-everyone-must-know-about-industry-4-0/|access-date=2020-05-27|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>
* Decentralized decisions – the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interference, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level<ref>Gronau, Norbert, Marcus Grum, and Benedict Bender. "Determining the optimal level of autonomy in cyber-physical production systems." 2016 IEEE 14th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN). IEEE, 2016. DOI:10.1109/INDIN.2016.7819367</ref>

=== Distinctiveness===
Proponents of the Fourth Industrial Revolution suggest it is a distinct revolution rather than simply a prolongation of the Third Industrial Revolution.<ref name="faff"/> This is due to the following characteristics: 
* [[Velocity]] — exponential speed at which incumbent industries are affected and displaced<ref name="faff"/>
* Scope and systems impact – the large amount of sectors and firms that are affected<ref name="faff"/>
* Paradigm shift in technology policy – new policies designed for this new way of doing are present. An example is Singapore's formal recognition of Industry 4.0 in its innovation policies.

Critics of the concept dismiss Industry 4.0 as a marketing strategy. They suggest that although revolutionary changes are identifiable in distinct sectors, there is no systemic change so far. In addition, the pace of recognition of Industry 4.0 and policy transition varies across countries; the definition of Industry 4.0 is not harmonized. One of the most known figures is [[Jeremy Rifkin]] who "agree[s] that digitalization is the hallmark and defining technology in what has become known as the Third Industrial Revolution".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/information-technology/article/21967057/the-2016-world-economic-forum-misfires-with-its-fourth-industrial-revolution-theme | title=StackPath }}</ref> However, he argues that "that the evolution of digitalization has barely begun to run its course and that its new configuration in the form of the Internet of Things represents the next stage of its development".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/information-technology/article/21967057/the-2016-world-economic-forum-misfires-with-its-fourth-industrial-revolution-theme | title=StackPath }}</ref>

=== Components ===

* [[Augmented reality]]/[[wearables]]
* On-demand availability of computer [[system resource]]s
* Data visualization and triggered "live" training<ref name=":0"/>{{clarify|date=April 2022}}

Mainly these technologies can be summarized into four major components, defining the term "Industry 4.0" or "smart factory":<ref name=":0"/>
* [[Cyber-physical system]]s
* [[Internet of things]] (IoT)
* On-demand availability of computer system resources (e.g. [[cloud computing]])
* [[Cognitive computing]]<ref name=":0"/>

Industry 4.0 networks a wide range of new technologies to create value. Using [[cyber-physical system]]s that monitor physical processes, a virtual copy of the physical world can be designed. Characteristics of cyber-physical systems include the ability to make decentralized decisions independently, reaching a high degree of autonomy.<ref name=":0"/>

The value created in Industry 4.0, can be relied upon electronic identification, in which the smart manufacturing require set technologies to be incorporated in the manufacturing process to thus be classified as in the development path of Industry 4.0 and no longer [[digitisation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index – Managing the Digital Transformation of Companies|url=https://en.acatech.de/publication/industrie-4-0-maturity-index-managing-the-digital-transformation-of-companies/|access-date=2020-12-21|website=acatech – National Academy of Science and Engineering|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Primary drivers===

==== Digitization and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains ====
Industry 4.0 integrates processes vertically, across the entire organization, including processes in product development, manufacturing, structuring, and service; horizontally, Industry 4.0 includes internal operations from suppliers to customers as well as all key value chain partners.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Industry 4.0: Building the digital enterprize.|url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/industries-4.0/landing-page/industry-4.0-building-your-digital-enterprise-april-2016.pdf|last=Geissbauer|first=Dr. R}}</ref>

==== Digitization of product and services ====
Integrating new methods of data collection and analysis–such as through the expansion of existing products or creation of new digitized products–helps companies to generate data on product use to refine products<ref name=":1"/>

==== Digital business models and customer access ====
Customer satisfaction is a perpetual, multi-stage process that requires modification in real-time to adapt to the changing needs of consumers<ref name=":1"/>

== Trends ==
=== Smart factory ===
{{Main|Smart manufacturing}}
Smart Factory is the vision of a production environment in which production facilities and logistics systems are organized without human intervention.

The Smart Factory is no longer a vision. While different model factories represent the feasible, many enterprises already clarify with examples practically, how the Smart Factory functions.

The technical foundations on which the Smart Factory – the intelligent factory – is based are cyber-physical systems that communicate with each other using the Internet of Things and Services. An important part of this process is the exchange of data between the product and the production line. This enables a much more efficient connection of the Supply Chain and better organisation within any production environment.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters what has been called a "smart factory". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Baotong|last2=Wan|first2=Jiafu|last3=Shu|first3=Lei|last4=Li|first4=Peng|last5=Mukherjee|first5=Mithun|last6=Yin|first6=Boxing|date=2018|title=Smart Factory of Industry 4.0: Key Technologies, Application Case, and Challenges|journal=IEEE Access|volume=6|pages=6505–6519|doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783682|s2cid=3809961|issn=2169-3536|doi-access=free}}</ref> Over the internet of things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in synchronic time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the [[value chain]].<ref name="Definition-I4.0"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Padovano|first1=Antonio|last2=Longo|first2=Francesco|last3=Nicoletti|first3=Letizia|last4=Mirabelli|first4=Giovanni|date=1 January 2018|title=A Digital Twin based Service Oriented Application for a 4.0 Knowledge Navigation in the Smart Factory|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|series=16th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing INCOM 2018|language=en|volume=51|issue=11|pages=631–636|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.389|issn=2405-8963|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Predictive maintenance ===
Industry 4.0 can also provide predictive maintenance, due to the use of technology and the IoT sensors. Predictive maintenance – which can identify maintenance issues in live – allows machine owners to perform cost-effective maintenance and determine it ahead of time before the machinery fails or gets damaged.&nbsp; For example, a company in Los Angeles could understand if a piece of equipment in Singapore is running at an abnormal speed or temperature. They could then decide whether or not it needs to be repaired.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Are You Ready For The Fourth Industrial Revolution?|url=https://theonebrief.com/are-you-ready-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/|date=4 May 2017|website=The One Brief|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

=== 3D printing ===

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is said to have extensive dependency on [[3D printing]] technology.&nbsp; Some advantages of 3D printing for industry are that 3D printing can print many geometric structures, as well as simplify the product design process. It is also relatively environmentally friendly. In low-volume production, it can also decrease lead times and total production costs. Moreover, it can increase flexibility, reduce warehousing costs and help the company towards the adoption of a mass customization business strategy. In addition, 3D printing can be very useful for printing spare parts and installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yin|first1=Yong|last2=Stecke|first2=Kathryn E.|last3=Li|first3=Dongni|date=17 January 2018|title=The evolution of production systems from Industry 2.0 through Industry 4.0|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=848–861|doi=10.1080/00207543.2017.1403664|issn=0020-7543|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The determining factor is the pace of change. The correlation of the speed of technological development and, as a result, socio-economic and infrastructural transformations with human life allows one to state a qualitative leap in the speed of development, which marks a transition to a new time era.<ref>[https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=39147614 Shestakova I. G.&nbsp;New temporality of digital civilization: the future has already come // // Scientific and Technical Journal of St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University. Humanities and social sciences. 2019. # 2. P.20-29]</ref>

=== Smart sensors ===

Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0 but also for other "smart" megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities, and smart factories.<ref>Imkamp, D., Berthold, J., Heizmann, M., Kniel, K., Manske, E., Peterek, M., Schmitt, R., Seidler, J., and Sommer, K.-D.: Challenges and trends in manufacturing measurement technology – the "Industrie 4.0" concept, J. Sens. Sens. Syst., 5, 325–335, https://doi.org/10.5194/jsss-5-325-2016, 2016</ref>

Smart sensors are devices, which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. 
With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation effort to a great extent and help realize a dense array of sensors.<ref>A.A. Kolomenskii, P.D. Gershon, H.A. Schuessler, Sensitivity and
detection limit of concentration and adsorption measurements by
laser-induced surface-plasmon resonance, Appl. Opt. 36 (1997)
6539–6547</ref>

The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognized and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to the statement "Industry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems."<ref>Arnold, H.: Kommentar Industrie 4.0: Ohne Sensorsysteme geht nichts, available at: http://www.elektroniknet.de/messen-testen/ sonstiges/artikel/110776/ (last access: 10 March 2018), 2014</ref>

However, there are a few issues, such as time synchronization error, data loss, and dealing with large amounts of harvested data, which all limit the implementation of full-fledged systems. Moreover, additional limits on these functionalities represents the battery power. One example of the integration of smart sensors in the electronic devices, is the case of smart watches, where sensors receive the data from the movement of the user, process the data and as a result, provide the user with the information about how many steps they have walked in a day and also converts the  data into calories burned.

==== Agriculture and food industries ====

Smart sensors in these two fields are still in the testing stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Partha Pratim|date=1 January 2017|title=Internet of things for smart agriculture: Technologies, practices and future direction|url=https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-ambient-intelligence-and-smart-environments/ais440|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=395–420|doi=10.3233/AIS-170440|issn=1876-1364}}</ref> These innovative connected sensors collect, interpret and communicate the information available in the plots (leaf area, vegetation index, chlorophyll, hygrometry, temperature, water potential, radiation). Based on this scientific data, the objective is to enable real-time monitoring via a smartphone with a range of advice that optimizes plot management in terms of results, time and costs. On the farm, these sensors can be used to detect crop stages and recommend inputs and treatments at the right time. As well as controlling the level of irrigation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Diogo|last2=Corista|first2=Pedro|last3=Gião|first3=João|last4=Ghimire|first4=Sudeep|last5=Sarraipa|first5=João|last6=Jardim-Gonçalves|first6=Ricardo|date=June 2017|title=Towards smart agriculture using FIWARE enablers|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8280066|journal=2017 International Conference on Engineering, Technology and Innovation (ICE/ITMC)|pages=1544–1551|doi=10.1109/ICE.2017.8280066|isbn=978-1-5386-0774-9|s2cid=3433104}}</ref>

=== Germany ===
The term "Industrie 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the [[German government]] and specifically relates to that project policy, rather than a wider notion of a Fourth Industrial Revolution of 4IR.<ref name=":5"/> which promotes the [[Digital Revolution|computerization]] of manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|author=BMBF-Internetredaktion|date=21 January 2016|title=Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0 – BMBF|url=https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.html|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Bmbf.de}}</ref> The term "Industrie 4.0" was publicly introduced in the same year at the [[Hannover Fair]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1 April 2011|title=Industrie 4.0: Mit dem Internet der Dinge auf dem Weg zur 4. industriellen Revolution|url=http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304101009/http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1|archive-date=4 March 2013|access-date=2016-11-30|website=Vdi-nachrichten.com|language=de}}</ref> Renowned German professor [[Wolfgang Wahlster]] is sometimes called the inventor of the "[[Industry 4.0]]" term.<ref name="Sensors_2020_08">{{cite journal|last1=Szajna|first1=Andrzej|last2=Stryjski|first2=Roman|last3=Wozniak|first3=Waldemar|last4=Chamier-Gliszczynski|first4=Norbert|last5=Kostrzewski|first5=Mariusz|date=22 August 2020|title=Assessment of Augmented Reality in Manual Wiring Production Process with Use of Mobile AR Glasses|journal=Sensors|publisher=MDPI|volume=20|issue=17|page=4755|bibcode=2020Senso..20.4755S|doi=10.3390/s20174755|pmc=7506974|pmid=32842693|doi-access=free}}</ref> In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The workgroup members and partners are recognized as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0. On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented. This working group was headed by Siegfried Dais, of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Henning Kagermann, of the [[German Academy of Science and Engineering]].<ref>[http://www.plattform-i40.de Industrie 4.0 Plattform] Last download on 15. Juli 2013</ref>

As Industry 4.0 principles have been applied by companies, they have sometimes been rebranded. For example, the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]] has branded its own Industry 4.0 research project M4.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|date=22 June 2018|title=Time to join the digital dots|url=https://www.aero-mag.com/meggitt-applied-research-technology-group-data-capture/|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en}}</ref>

The discussion of how the shift to Industry 4.0, especially [[digitization]], will affect the labour market is being discussed in Germany under the topic of [[Work 4.0]].<ref>Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0''.</ref>

The federal government in Germany through its ministries of the BMBF and BMWi, is a leader in the development of the I4.0 policy. Through the publishing of set objectives and goals for enterprises to achieve, the German federal government attempts to set the direction of the digital transformation. However, there is a gap between German enterprise's collaboration and knowledge of these set policies.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last=Keller |first=Matthias |date=2021 |title=I4.0 Strategy and Policy Integration in The German Machining Industry |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359005363 |journal=KU Leuven}}</ref> The biggest challenge which SMEs in Germany are currently facing regarding digital transformation of their manufacturing processes is ensuring that there is a concrete IT and application landscape to support further digital transformation efforts.<ref name=":7" />

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia, the digital transformation dubbed as the 4th Industrial Revolution by [[Klaus Schwab]] and the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2015 started with the restoration of independence in 1991. Although a latecomer to the [[Information revolution|Information Revolution]] due to 50 years of [[Soviet occupation of Estonia|Soviet Occupation]], Estonia [[Leapfrogging|leapfrogged]] to the digital era, while skipping the analogue connections almost completely. The early decisions made by Prime Minister [[Mart Laar]] on the course of the country's economic development led to the establishment of what is today known as [[e-Estonia]], one of the worlds most [[Digital Nations|digitally advanced nations]]. 

According to the goals set in the Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Digiühiskonna arengukava 2030 {{!}} Majandus- ja Kommunikatsiooniministeerium |url=https://www.mkm.ee/digiriik-ja-uhenduvus/digiuhiskonna-arengukava-2030 |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=www.mkm.ee}}</ref> next leaps in the country's digital transformation will be switching to event based and proactive services, both in private and business environment, as well as developing a green, AI-powered and human-centric digital government.

=== Indonesia ===
Another example is Making Indonesia 4.0, with a focus on improving industrial performance.<ref name="Scott-Kemmis et al. 2021"/>

=== South Africa ===
South Africa appointed a Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2019, consisting of about 30 stakeholders with a background in academia, industry and government.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021">{{cite book|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377433/PDF/377433eng.pdf.multi|title=UNESCO Science Report: the Race Against Time for Smarter Development.|date=11 June 2021|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-100450-6|editor1-last=Schneegans|editor1-first=S.|location=Paris|editor2-last=Straza|editor2-first=T.|editor3-last=Lewis|editor3-first=J.}}</ref><ref name="Kraemer-Mbula et al. 2021">{{cite book|author1=Kraemer-Mbula|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377475/PDF/377475eng.pdf.multi|title=Southern Africa.

=== South Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has had a Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution since 2017.  The Republic of Korea's I-Korea strategy (2017) is focusing on new growth engines that include AI, drones and autonomous cars, in line with the government's innovation-driven economic policy.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021"/>
===Spain===
See [[Science and technology in Spain]]

=== Uganda ===
Uganda adopted its own National 4IR Strategy in October 2020 with emphasis on e-governance, urban management (smart cities), health care, education, agriculture and the digital economy; to support local businesses, the government was contemplating introducing a local start-ups bill in 2020 which would require all accounting officers to exhaust the local market prior to procuring digital solutions from abroad.<ref name="UNESCO Science Report 2021"/>

=== United Kingdom ===
In a policy paper published in 2019, the UK's [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy]], titled "Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution", outlined the need to evolve current regulatory models to remain competitive in evolving technological and social settings.<ref name=":6"/>

=== United States ===
The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] in 2019 published a paper called 'The Industrial Internet of things (IIOT): Opportunities, Risks, Mitigation'. The base pieces of critical infrastructure are increasingly digitized for greater connectivity and optimization. Hence, its implementation, growth and maintenance must be carefully planned and safeguarded. The paper discusses not only applications of [[Industrial internet of things|IIOT]] but also the associated risks. It has suggested some key areas where risk mitigation is possible. To increase coordination between the public, private, law enforcement, academia and other stakeholders the DHS has formed has new agency called [[National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center]] (NCCIC).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ayala |first1=Mario |last2=Cantu |first2=Rob |date=2019 |title=THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS (IIOT): OPPORTUNITIES, RISKS, MITIGATIO |url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ia/ia_iiot-intercommections.pdf |journal=Department of Homeland Security-Publications |pages=34 |via=DHS}}</ref>

==Industry applications ==
The aerospace industry has sometimes been characterized as "too low volume for extensive automation"; however, Industry 4.0 principles have been investigated by several aerospace companies, and technologies have been developed to improve productivity where the upfront cost of automation cannot be justified. One example of this is the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]]'s M4 project.<ref name="auto1"/>

The increasing use of the [[industrial internet of things]] is referred to as Industry 4.0 at [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and generally in Germany. Applications include machines that can predict failures and trigger maintenance processes autonomously or self-organized coordination that react to unexpected changes in production.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Internet of Things and the future of manufacturing &#124; McKinsey & Company |author1=Markus Liffler |author2=Andreas Tschiesner |date=6 January 2013 |website=Mckinsey.com |access-date=2016-11-30 |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-internet-of-things-and-the-future-of-manufacturing}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

With the consistent development on automation of everyday tasks, some saw the benefit in the exact opposite of automation where self-made products are valued more than those that involved automation.<ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology">{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Michael|last2=Mochon|first2=Daniel|last3=Ariely|first3=Dan|title=The IKEA effect: When labor leads to love|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|date=9 September 2011|volume=22|issue=3|pages=453–460|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.08.002|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12136084}}</ref> This valuation is named the '[[IKEA effect]]', a term coined by [[Michael I.
