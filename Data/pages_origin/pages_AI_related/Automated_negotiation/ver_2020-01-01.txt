'''Automated negotiation''' is a form of interaction in systems that are composed of multiple [[Intelligent agent|autonomous agents]], in which the aim is to reach agreements through an iterative process of making offers.<ref name="Far02">{{cite journal|last1=Faratin|first1=P.|last2=Sierra|first2=C.|last3=Jennings|first3=N.R.|title=Using similarity criteria to make issue trade-offs in automated negotiations|journal=Artificial Intelligence|date=December 2002|volume=142|issue=2|pages=205–237|doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(02)00290-4}}</ref> Automated negotiation can be employed for many tasks human negotiators regularly engage in, such as [[bargaining]] and [[Collaborative decision-making software|joint decision making]].

== History ==

Through digitization, the beginning of the 21st century has seen a growing interest in the automation of negotiation and e-negotiation systems,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kersten|first1=Gregory E.|last2=Lai|first2=Hsiangchu|title=Negotiation Support and E-negotiation Systems: An Overview|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|date=10 October 2007|volume=16|issue=6|pages=553–586|doi=10.1007/s10726-007-9095-5}}</ref> for example in the setting of [[e-commerce]]. This interest is fueled by the promise of automated agents being able to negotiate on behalf of human negotiators, and to find better outcomes than human negotiators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Raz|last2=Kraus|first2=Sarit|title=Can automated agents proficiently negotiate with humans?|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 January 2010|volume=53|issue=1|pages=78|doi=10.1145/1629175.1629199}}</ref>

== Examples ==

Examples of automated negotiation include:

* [[Online dispute resolution]], in which disagreements between parties are settled.
* [[Sponsored search auction]], where bids are placed on advertisement keywords.
* [[Content negotiation]], in which [[user agents]] negotiate over HTTP about how to best represent a web resource.
* [[Decision support system|Negotiation support systems]], in which negotiation decision-making activities are supported by an [[information system]].
