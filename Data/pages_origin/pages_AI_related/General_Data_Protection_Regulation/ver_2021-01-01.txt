The '''General Data Protection Regulation''' (EU) [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 2016/679] ('''GDPR''') is a [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]] in [[EU law]] on [[data protection]] and privacy in the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of [[personal data]] outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for [[international business]] by unifying the regulation within the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Presidency of the Council: "Compromise text. Several partial general approaches have been instrumental in converging views in Council on the proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation in its entirety. The text on the Regulation which the Presidency submits for approval as a General Approach appears in annex," 1000000000000 pages, 11 June 2015, PDF|access-date=30 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225181657/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|archive-date=25 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  Superseding the [[Data Protection Directive]] 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of [[personal data]] of individuals (formally called ''data subjects'' in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.

Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place ''appropriate technical and organizational measures'' to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using [[pseudonymization]] or full [[Data anonymization|anonymization]] where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation ([[consent]], contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.

Data controllers must clearly disclose any [[data collection]], declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a [[Data portability|portable]] copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, and the right to have their [[Data erasure|data erased]] under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a ''data protection officer'' (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report [[data breach]]es to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.

The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016, and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], not a [[directive (European Union)|directive]], it is directly binding and applicable, but does provide flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.

The regulation became a model for many national laws outside EU, including Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and Kenya. The [[California Consumer Privacy Act]] (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.<ref>Francesca Lucarini, [https://advisera.com/eugdpracademy/blog/2020/04/13/gdpr-vs-ccpa-what-are-the-main-differences/ "The differences between the California Consumer Privacy Act and the GDPR"], ''Advisera''</ref>

==Contents==
The GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eckerson Group|url=https://www.eckerson.com/articles/gdpr-reference-guide-all-99-articles-in-25-minutes|access-date=2020-12-06|website=www.eckerson.com}}</ref>

===General provisions===
The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects data from EU residents), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like [[Cloud computing|cloud service providers]]), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,<ref>'''Article 3(2)''': This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:
(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or
(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.</ref> the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18)

According to the [[European Commission]], "Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual."<ref>https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/</ref> The precise definitions of terms such as "personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller", and "processor" are stated in '''Article 4''' of the Regulation.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu">{{cite web|access-date=21 March 2018|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035823/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether '''Article 48'''<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/> of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. '''Article 48''' states that any judgement of a court or [[tribunal]] and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state.<ref name="Article 30"/> The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/680/oj/eng|title=Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA|date=4 May 2016}}</ref> that provides rules on personal data exchanges at national, European, and international levels.

A single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location of its "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a "[[one-stop shop]]" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU<ref>The Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation. A guide for in-house lawyers, Hunton & Williams LLP, June 2015, p. 14</ref><ref name=":1" /> ('''Articles 46–55''' of the GDPR). A [[European Data Protection Board]] (EDPB) co-ordinates the SAs. EDPB thus replaces the '''Article 29''' Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations ('''Articles 2(2)(a)''' and '''88''' of the GDPR).

===Principles===
Unless a data subject has provided informed consent to data processing for one or more purposes, personal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis to do so. '''Article 6''' states the lawful purposes are:<ref name="32016R0679">{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106021830/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|archive-date=6 November 2017|url-status=live}}.</ref>
* (a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;
* (b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;
* (c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;
* (d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;
* (e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;
* (f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] (especially in the case of children).<ref name="Article 30"/>

If informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing,<ref>[https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum General_Data_Protection_Regulation]</ref> consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for ('''Article 7'''; defined in '''Article 4'''). Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded,<ref>[https://westminstercollege.edu/student-life/the-forum#comments-f0774046-beef-6cf4-9016-ff000033899e_en newsmyynews]</ref> and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be "bundled" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely-given. (Recital 32)

Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. ('''Article 7(3)''') A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. ('''Article 7(4)''') Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old ('''Article 8(1)'''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|title=Age of consent in the GDPR: updated mapping|website=iapp.org|access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527023437/https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable ('''Article 8''').<ref name="privacyassociation">[https://www.privacyassociation.org/media/presentations/A12_EU_DP_Regulation_PPT.pdf "How the Proposed EU Data Protection Regulation Is Creating a Ripple Effect Worldwide"]. Judy Schmitt, Florian Stahl. 11 October 2012. Retrieved 3 January 2013.</ref>

If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).<ref name="guardian-unneeded"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kamleitner|first1=Bernadette|last2=Mitchell|first2=Vince|date=2019-10-01|title=Your Data Is My Data: A Framework for Addressing Interdependent Privacy Infringements|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0743915619858924|journal=Journal of Public Policy & Marketing|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=433–450|doi=10.1177/0743915619858924|s2cid=201343307|issn=0743-9156}}</ref>>

===Rights of the data subject===
====Transparency and modalities====
'''Article 12''' requires that the data controller provides information to the 'data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.'<ref name="Article 30"/>

====Information and access====
The [[right of access to personal data|right of access]] ('''Article 15''') is a data subject right.<ref name="eujournalpublication" /> It gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data ('''Article 15(3)'''); furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes of the processing ('''Article 15(1)(a)'''), with whom the data is shared ('''Article 15(1)(c)'''), and how it acquired the data ('''Article 15(1)(g)''').

A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099|title=Guidelines on the right to data portability|last=Article 29 Working Party|publisher=European Commission|year=2017|access-date=15 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629062729/http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In practice however providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's [[Siri]], where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier which the manufacturer restricts access to,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=Michael|last2=Binns|first2=Reuben|last3=Ausloos|first3=Jef|title=When data protection by design and data subject rights clash|journal=International Data Privacy Law|volume=8|issue=2|pages=105–123|doi=10.1093/idpl/ipy002|year=2018|doi-access=free}}</ref> or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on [[device fingerprint]]s that can be challenging to capture, send and verify.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuiderveen Borgesius|first=Frederik J.|date=April 2016|title=Singling out people without knowing their names – Behavioural targeting, pseudonymous data, and the new Data Protection Regulation|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=256–271|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2015.12.013|issn=0267-3649}}</ref>

Both data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to [[data portability]] is provided by '''Article 20''' of the GDPR.<ref name=":0">[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf Proposal for the EU General Data Protection Regulation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024154/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf |date=3 December 2012 }}. European Commission. 25 January 2012. Retrieved 3 January 2013.</ref>

====Rectification and erasure====
A ''[[right to be forgotten]]'' was replaced by a more limited ''right of erasure'' in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.<ref name="1 Essex Court">{{cite web|last1=Baldry|first1=Tony|author-link=Tony Baldry|last2=Hyams|first2=Oliver|title=The Right to Be Forgotten|url=http://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=1 Essex Court|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019005028/https://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|archive-date=19 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 12 March 2014 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605050912/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|archive-date=5 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> '''Article 17''' provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds within 30 days, including noncompliance with '''Article 6(1)''' (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data<ref name="Article 30"/> (see also ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González|Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González]]'').

====Right to object and automated decisions====
'''Article 21''' of the GDPR <ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/|title=Right to object|date=30 August 2019|website=ico.org.uk|access-date=14 November 2019}}</ref> allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing, sales, or non-service related purposes. This means the data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data.

There are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example if:

# Legal or official authority is being carried out
# 'Legitimate interest' where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the data subject with a service they signed up for. 
# A task being carried out for public interest.

GDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication the controller has with them. This should be clear and separate from any other information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of their data.

There are instances the controller can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objection request is 'manifestly unfounded' or 'excessive' therefore each case of objection should be looked at individually<ref name=":4" />

===Controller and processor===
To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures which meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. '''Article 25''' requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include [[pseudonymization|pseudonymising]] personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).<ref name="Article 30"/>

When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly [[privacy policy|informed]] about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR,  including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to [[#Right of access|view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed]], their right to obtain a [[Data portability|portable copy of the stored data]], the right to [[#Data erasure|erasure of data under certain circumstances]], the right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis, and the right to file complaints with a [[national data protection authority|Data Protection Authority]]. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-notices-transparency-and-control/privacy-notices-under-the-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/|title=Privacy notices under the EU General Data Protection Regulation|date=19 January 2018|website=ico.org.uk|access-date=22 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523101041/https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-notices-transparency-and-control/privacy-notices-under-the-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/principles-gdpr/what-information-must-be-given-individuals-whose-data-collected_en|title=What information must be given to individuals whose data is collected?|publisher=Europa (web portal)|access-date=23 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523102419/https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/principles-gdpr/what-information-must-be-given-individuals-whose-data-collected_en|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Data protection impact assessments ('''Article 35''') have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.

'''Article 25''' requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.

A report<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – ENISA|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405171636/https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|archive-date=5 April 2017}}</ref> by the [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.

====Pseudonymisation====
According to the GDPR, [[Pseudonymization|pseudonymisation]] is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete [[data anonymisation]]).<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418230748/https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/|date=18 April 2018}} Published by Dativa, 17 April 2018</ref> An example is [[Encryption software|encryption]], which renders the original data unintelligible and the process cannot be reversed without access to the correct [[Encryption|decryption key]]. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.

Another example of pseudonymisation is [[tokenization (data security)|tokenisation]], which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting [[data at rest]] that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. [[Tokenization (data security)|Tokenisation]] does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.

Pseudonymisation is a [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy-enhancing technology]] and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/looking-to-comply-with-gdpr-heres-a-primer-on-anonymization-and-pseudonymization/|title=Looking to comply with GDPR?

According to '''Article 30''',<ref name="Article 30">{{Cite web|title=REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL ('''article 30''')|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e3265-1-1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628174534/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e3265-1-1#d1e3265-1-1|archive-date=28 June 2017|access-date=7 June 2017}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref> records of processing activities have to be maintained by each organisation matching one of following criteria:

* employing more than 250 persons;
* the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;
* the processing is not occasional;
* processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. 

Such requirements may be modified by each EU country. The records shall be in electronic form and the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.

Records of controller shall contain all of the following information:

* the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer;
* the purposes of the processing;
* a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;
* the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;
* where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;
* where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;
* where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).

Records of processor shall contain all of the following information:

* the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;
* the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;
* where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the
* documentation of suitable safeguards;
* where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).<ref name="Article 30"/>

====Security of personal data====
'''Article 33''' states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined ('''Article 34'''). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach ('''Article 33''').

However, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption ('''Article 34''').<ref name="Article 30"/>

====Data protection officer====
{{See also|European Commission Data Protection Officer}}
'''Article 37''' requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by a public authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences ('''Articles 9''' and '''Article 10''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – Art. 37|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122015414/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679|archive-date=22 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.<ref name="Article 30"/>

A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.

The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, [[data security]] (including dealing with [[Attack (computing)|cyberattacks]]) and other critical [[business continuity]] issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations, the DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/explaining-gdpr-data-subject-requests|title=Explaining GDPR Data Subject Requests|website=TrueVault|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44100|title=Guidelines on Data Protection Officers|access-date=27 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629063312/http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44100|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations ('''Article 27'''). This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|title=Global reach of the GDPR: What is at stake?|work=Lexology|last=Jankowski|first=Piper-Meredith|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041216/https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Remedies, liability and penalties===
{{See also|GDPR fines and notices}}
Besides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following '''Article 83''' GDPR the following sanctions can be imposed:

* a warning in writing in cases of first and non-intentional noncompliance

** noncompliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to '''Article 58(2)''' or failure to provide access in violation of '''Article 58(1)'''<ref name="Article 30"/>

== Exemptions ==
These are some cases which aren't addressed in the GDPR specifically, thus are treated as exemptions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-20|title=Exemptions|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/|access-date=2020-11-11|website=ico.org.uk|language=en}}</ref>

* Personal or household activities
* Law Enforcement
* National Security<ref name="Article 30" />
When the GDPR was being created, it was strictly created for the regulation of personal data which goes into the hands of companies. What isn't covered by the GDPR are your non commercial information or household activities.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-22|title=The "Household Exemption" In GDPR|url=https://www.fff-legal.com/the-household-exemption-in-gdpr/|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Fenech Farrugia Fiott Legal {{!}} A Leading Law Firm in Malta|language=en-US}}</ref> An example of these household activities may be emails between two high school friends.

In addition, the GDPR does not apply when data is potentially linked to a police investigation. Even though it's not covered by the GDPR, the Data Protection Act of 2018, Part 3 explicitly covers these grounds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Data Protection Act 2018, Part 3|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/3/enacted}}</ref>

Finally, when the data comes to national security, it is out of the GPDR's boundaries, so it is covered by the Data Protection Act of 2018, Part 2 Chapter 3.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Data Protection Act 2018, Part 2 Chapter 3|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/2/chapter/3/enacted}}</ref>

Conversely, an entity or more precisely an "enterprise" has to be engaged in "economic activity" to be covered by the GDPR.{{efn|Refer GDPR article{{nbsp}}4(18): 'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.<ref name="Article 30"/>}} Economic activity is defined broadly under [[European Union competition law]].<ref name="wehlander-2016">{{cite book

== Applicability outside of the European Union ==
The GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) if they are engaged in the "offering of goods or services" (regardless of whether a payment is required) to data subjects within the EEA, or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects within the EEA (Article 3(2)). The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasken.com/en/knowledge/2019/11/the-extra-territorial-scope-of-the-gdpr/|title=The (Extra) Territorial Scope of the GDPR: The Right to Be Forgotten|website=Fasken.com|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] for non-EU establishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2018/04/01_speirs/|title=Extraterritorial Scope of GDPR: Do Businesses Outside the EU Need to Comply?|publisher=American Bar Association|language=en|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> 

=== EU Representative ===
Under Article 27, non-EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee within the European Union, an "EU Representative", to serve as a point of contact for their obligations under the regulation. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensure compliance with this GDPR. A natural (individual) or moral (corporation) person can play the role of an EU Representative.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art. 27(4) GDPR}}</ref> The non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document (letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. The said designation can only be given in writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art. 27(1) GDPR}}</ref>

An establishment's failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of the regulation and relevant obligations, which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to €10&nbsp;million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. The intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of the infringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravating factors.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art. 83(1),(2)&(4a) GDPR}}</ref>

An establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasional processing that does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing.<ref name="Article 30"/> Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art. 27(2) GDPR}}</ref>

=== Third countries ===
Chapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countries outside of the EEA — known as ''third countries'' — unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the third country's data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the European Commission (Article 45).<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.dlapiper.com/privacymatters/uk-gdpr-brexit-flowchart/|title=UK: Understanding the full impact of Brexit on UK: EU data flows|date=23 September 2019|website=Privacy Matters|publisher=[[DLA Piper]]|language=en-US|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/on-data-protection-the-uk-says-it-will-go-it-alone-it-probably-wont/|title=On data protection, the UK says it will go it alone.

===United Kingdom implementation===
The applicability of GDPR in the United Kingdom is affected by [[Brexit]]. Although the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, it remains subject to EU law, including GDPR, until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.<ref name=":5" /> The United Kingdom granted [[royal assent]] to the [[Data Protection Act 2018]] on 23 May 2018, which augmented the GDPR, including aspects of the regulation that are to be determined by national law, and criminal offences for knowingly or recklessly obtaining. redistributing, or retaining personal data without the consent of the data controller.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/may/new-data-protection-act-finalised-uk/|title=New Data Protection Act finalised in the UK|website=Out-Law.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525120311/https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/may/new-data-protection-act-finalised-uk/|archive-date=25 May 2018|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441814/New-UK-Data-Protection-Act-not-welcomed-by-all|title=New UK Data Protection Act not welcomed by all|work=Computer Weekly|access-date=25 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524143548/https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441814/New-UK-Data-Protection-Act-not-welcomed-by-all|archive-date=24 May 2018}}</ref>

Under the [[European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018]], existing and relevant EU law will be transposed into local law upon completion of the transition, and the GDPR will be amended by [[Statutory instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] to remove certain provisions no longer needed due to the UK's non-membership in the EU. Thereafter, the regulation will be referred to as "UK GDPR".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145180/google-uk-user-data-processing-ireland-usa-authorities-data-protection-gdpr-cloud-act|title=Google shifts authority over UK user data to the US in wake of Brexit|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=20 February 2020|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /> The UK will not restrict the transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR. However, the UK will become a ''third country'' under the EU GDPR, meaning that personal data may not be transferred to the country unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the European Commission performs an adequacy decision on the suitability of British data protection legislation (Chapter V). As part of the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], the European Commission committed to perform an adequacy assessment.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

In April 2019, the UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) issued a proposed code of practice for social networking services when used by minors, enforceable under GDPR, which also includes restrictions on "[[Like button|like]]" and "streak" mechanisms in order to discourage [[social media addiction]], and use of this data for processing interests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47933521|title=Under-18s face 'like' and 'streaks' limits|date=15 April 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Greenfield|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/15/facebook-urged-to-ditch-like-feature-in-uk-online-child-safety-drive|title=Facebook urged to disable 'like' feature for child users|date=15 April 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 April 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Despite the mixed reception of GDPR, companies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices with GDPR. The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice.

Academic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law, "is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime. That said, the ideas contained within the GDPR are not entirely European, nor new. The GDPR’s protections can be found – albeit in weaker, less prescriptive forms – in U.S. privacy laws and in Federal Trade Commission settlements with companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hoofnagle|first1=Chris|last2=van der Sloot |first2=Bart|last3=Borgesius | first3=Frederik Zuiderveen|date=10 February 2019 |title=The European Union general data protection regulation: what it is and what it means|journal=Information & Communications Technology Law|volume=28|pages=65–98|doi=10.1080/13600834.2019.1573501|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Despite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously-obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). [[Phishing]] scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|title=Scammers are using GDPR email alerts to conduct phishing attacks|last=Afifi-Sabet|first=Keumars|date=3 May 2018|work=IT PRO|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041641/http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="guardian-unneeded">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|title=Most GDPR emails unnecessary and some illegal, say experts|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=21 May 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528054755/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/eu-govt-and-public-health-sites-lousy-with-adtech-study-finds/|title=EU gov't and public health sites are lousy with adtech, study finds|website=TechCrunch|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6dbacf74-471b-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3|title=EU citizens being tracked on sensitive government websites|website=Financial Times|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>

The deluge of GDPR-related notices also inspired [[internet meme|memes]], including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means (such as an [[Ouija]] board or [[Star Wars opening crawl|''Star Wars'' opening crawl]]), suggesting that [[Santa Claus]]'s "naughty or nice" list was a violation, and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Shipping Forecast]] announcer. A blog, ''GDPR Hall of Shame'', was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices, and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation's requirements. Its author remarked that the regulation "has a lot of nitty gritty, in-the-weeds details, but not a lot of information about how to comply", but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply, making some of its responses unjustified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|title=Fall asleep in seconds by listening to a soothing voice read the EU's new GDPR legislation|work=The Verge|access-date=16 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015346/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|title=How Europe's GDPR Regulations Became a Meme|work=Wired|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618002541/https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|archive-date=18 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|title=The Internet Created a GDPR-Inspired Meme Using Privacy Policies|work=Adweek|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617221720/https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/happy-gdpr-day-gdpr-hall-of-shame|title=Help, my lightbulbs are dead!

In December 2019, ''Politico'' reported that Ireland and Luxembourg — two smaller EU countries that have had a reputation as a [[Tax haven|tax havens]] and (especially in the case of Ireland) as a base for European subsidiaries of U.S. [[big tech]] companies, were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR, with Ireland citing the complexity of the regulation as a factor. Critics interviewed by ''Politico'' also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states, the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities, and a lack of cooperation between member states.<ref>{{Cite web|title='We have a huge problem': European regulator despairs over lack of enforcement|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/we-have-a-huge-problem-european-regulator-despairs-over-lack-of-enforcement/|last=Vinocur|first=Nicholas|date=27 December 2019|website=Politico|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

Therefore, data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation. As a result, studies have suggested for a better control through authorities.<ref name=":7" />  

According to the GDPR, end-users' [[consent]] should be valid, freely given, specific, informed and active.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last1=Human|first1=Soheil|last2=Cech|first2=Florian|date=2021|editor-last=Zimmermann|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-last=Howlett|editor2-first=Robert J.|editor3-last=Jain|editor3-first=Lakhmi C.|title=A Human-Centric Perspective on Digital Consenting: The Case of GAFAM|journal=Human Centred Intelligent Systems|series=Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies|volume=189|language=en|location=Singapore|publisher=Springer|pages=139–159|doi=10.1007/978-981-15-5784-2_12|isbn=978-981-15-5784-2|url=https://epub.wu.ac.at/7523/1/HCIS2020_A%20Human-centric%20Perspective%20on%20Digital%20Consenting_The%20Case%20of%20GAFAM_Soheil%20Human_Florian%20Cech.pdf}}</ref> However, the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the [[Big Tech]], i.e. [[Google]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Microsoft]] (GAFAM), use [[Dark pattern|dark patterns]] in their consent obtaining mechanisms, which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent.<ref name=":8" />
