The '''General Data Protection Regulation''' (EU) [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj 2016/679] ('''GDPR''') is a [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]] in [[EU law]] on [[data protection]] and privacy for all individual citizens of the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). It also addresses the transfer of [[personal data]] outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for [[international business]] by unifying the regulation within the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|title=Presidency of the Council: "Compromise text. Several partial general approaches have been instrumental in converging views in Council on the proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation in its entirety. The text on the Regulation which the Presidency submits for approval as a General Approach appears in annex," 201 pages, 11 June 2015, PDF|access-date=30 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225181657/http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9565-2015-INIT/en/pdf|archive-date=25 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Superseding the [[Data Protection Directive]] 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of [[personal data]] of individuals (formally called ''data subjects'' in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to any enterprise established in the EEA or—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship—that is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.

Controllers of personal data must put in place ''appropriate technical and organizational measures'' to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using [[pseudonymization]] or full [[Data anonymization|anonymization]] where appropriate), and use the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available without explicit, informed [[consent]], and cannot be used to identify a subject without additional information (which must be stored separately). No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under a lawful basis specified by the regulation, or unless the data controller or processor has received an unambiguous and individualized affirmation of consent from the data subject. The data subject has the right to revoke this consent at any time.

A processor of personal data must clearly disclose any [[data collection]], declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Data subjects have the right to request a [[Data portability|portable]] copy of the data collected by a processor in a common format, and the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a ''data protection officer'' (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report any [[data breach]]es within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.

The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016, and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], not a [[directive (European Union)|directive]], it is directly binding and applicable, but does provide flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.

==Contents==
The GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions.

===I General provisions===
The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects data from EU residents), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like [[Cloud computing|cloud service providers]]), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,<ref>'''Article 3(2)''': This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:
(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or
(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.</ref> the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18)

According to the [[European Commission]], "Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.<ref>https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/</ref> The precise definitions of terms such as "personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller" and "processor", are stated in '''Article 4''' of the Regulation.<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu">{{cite web|accessdate=21 March 2018|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035823/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether '''Article 48'''<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/> of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. '''Article 48''' states that any judgement of a court or [[tribunal]] and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state. The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/680/oj/eng|title=Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA|date=4 May 2016}}</ref> that provides rules on personal data exchanges at national, European, and international levels.

A single set of rules will apply to all EU member states. Each member state will establish an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state will co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it will have a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location of its "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority will act as a "[[one-stop shop]]" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU<ref>The Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation. A guide for in-house lawyers, Hunton & Williams LLP, June 2015, p. 14</ref><ref name=":1" /> ('''Articles 46–55''' of the GDPR). A [[European Data Protection Board]] (EDPB) will co-ordinate the SAs. EDPB will replace the '''Article 29''' Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations ('''Articles 2(2)(a)''' and '''88''' of the GDPR).

===II Principles===
Unless a data subject has provided informed consent to data processing for one or more purposes, personal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis to do so. '''Article 6''' states the lawful purposes are:<ref name="32016R0679">{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – 32016R0679 – EN – EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106021830/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|archive-date=6 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}.</ref>
* (a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;
* (b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;
* (c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;
* (d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;
* (e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;
* (f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] (especially in the case of children).

If informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for ('''Article 7'''; defined in '''Article 4'''). Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be "bundled" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely-given. (Recital 32)

Data subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. ('''Article 7(3)''') A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. ('''Article 7(4)''') Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old ('''Article 8(1)'''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|title=Age of consent in the GDPR: updated mapping|website=iapp.org|access-date=26 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527023437/https://iapp.org/resources/article/age-of-consent-in-the-gdpr-updated-mapping/|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable ('''Article 8''').<ref name="privacyassociation">[https://www.privacyassociation.org/media/presentations/A12_EU_DP_Regulation_PPT.pdf "How the Proposed EU Data Protection Regulation Is Creating a Ripple Effect Worldwide"]. Judy Schmitt, Florian Stahl. 11 October 2012. Retrieved 3 January 2013.</ref>

If consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).<ref name="guardian-unneeded"/>

===III Rights of the data subject===
====1 Transparency and modalities====
'''Article 12''' requires that the data controller provides information to the 'data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.'

====2 Information and Access====
The [[right of access to personal data|right of access]] ('''Article 15''') is a data subject right.<ref name="eujournalpublication" /> It gives citizens the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data ('''Article 15(3)'''); furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes of the processing ('''Article 15(1)(a)'''), with whom the data is shared ('''Article 15(1)(c)'''), and how it acquired the data ('''Article 15(1)(g)''').

A data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099|title=Guidelines on the right to data portability|last=Article 29 Working Party|publisher=European Commission|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=15 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629062729/http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In practice however providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's [[Siri]], where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier which the manufacturer restricts access to,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Veale|first=Michael|last2=Binns|first2=Reuben|last3=Ausloos|first3=Jef|title=When data protection by design and data subject rights clash|journal=International Data Privacy Law|volume=8|issue=2|pages=105–123|doi=10.1093/idpl/ipy002|df=dmy-all|year=2018}}</ref> or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on [[device fingerprint]]s that can be challenging to capture, send and verify.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuiderveen Borgesius|first=Frederik J.|date=April 2016|title=Singling out people without knowing their names – Behavioural targeting, pseudonymous data, and the new Data Protection Regulation|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=256–271|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2015.12.013|issn=0267-3649|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Both data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to [[data portability]] is provided by '''Article 20''' of the GDPR.<ref name=":0">[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf Proposal for the EU General Data Protection Regulation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203024154/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf |date=3 December 2012 }}. European Commission. 25 January 2012. Retrieved 3 January 2013.</ref>

====3 Rectification and erasure====
A ''[[right to be forgotten]]'' was replaced by a more limited ''right of erasure'' in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.<ref name="1 Essex Court">{{cite web|last1=Baldry|first1=Tony|authorlink=Tony Baldry|last2=Hyams|first2=Oliver|title=The Right to Be Forgotten|url=http://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=1 Essex Court|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019005028/https://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|archive-date=19 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=European Parliament legislative resolution of 12 March 2014 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|access-date=1 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605050912/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2014-0212&language=EN|archive-date=5 June 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> '''Article 17''' provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds within 30 days, including noncompliance with '''Article 6(1)''' (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data (see also ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González|Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González]]'').

====4 Right to object and automated decisions====
'''Article 21''' of the GDPR <ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-object/|title=Right to object|date=2019-08-30|website=ico.org.uk|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing, sales, or non-service related purposes. This means you must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent you from processing their personal data.

There are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example if:

# Legal or official authority is being carried out
# 'Legitimate interest' where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide you with a service you signed up for. 
# A task being carried out for public interest.

GDPR is also clear that you must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication you have with them. This should be clear and separate from any other information you are providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of your data.

There are instances you can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objection request is 'manifestly unfounded' or 'excessive' therefore each case of objection should be looked at individually<ref name=":4" />

===IV Controller and processor===
To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures which meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. '''Article 25''' requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include [[pseudonymization|pseudonymising]] personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).

When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly [[privacy policy|informed]] about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR,  including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to [[#Right of access|view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed]], their right to obtain a [[Data portability|portable copy of the stored data]], the right to [[#Data erasure|erasure of data under certain circumstances]], the right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely [[algorithm]]ic basis, and the right to file complaints with a [[national data protection authority|Data Protection Authority]]. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-notices-transparency-and-control/privacy-notices-under-the-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/|title=Privacy notices under the EU General Data Protection Regulation|date=19 January 2018|website=ico.org.uk|access-date=22 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523101041/https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/privacy-notices-transparency-and-control/privacy-notices-under-the-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/principles-gdpr/what-information-must-be-given-individuals-whose-data-collected_en|title=What information must be given to individuals whose data is collected?|publisher=Europa (web portal)|access-date=23 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523102419/https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/principles-gdpr/what-information-must-be-given-individuals-whose-data-collected_en|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Data protection impact assessments ('''Article 35''') have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.

'''Article 25''' requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.

A report<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – ENISA|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405171636/https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design|archive-date=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> by the [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.

====1 Pseudonymisation====
The GDPR refers to [[Pseudonymization|pseudonymisation]] as a process that is required when data is stored (as an alternative to the other option of complete [[data anonymisation]])<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418230748/https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ |date=18 April 2018 }} Published by Dativa, 17 April 2018</ref> to transform personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. An example is [[Encryption software|encryption]], which renders the original data unintelligible and the process cannot be reversed without access to the correct [[Encryption|decryption key]]. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.

Another example of pseudonymisation is [[tokenization (data security)|tokenisation]], which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting [[data at rest]] that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.

Pseudonymisation is a [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy-enhancing technology]] and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iapp.org/news/a/looking-to-comply-with-gdpr-heres-a-primer-on-anonymization-and-pseudonymization/|title=Looking to comply with GDPR?

====2 Records of processing activities ====
Records of processing activities must be maintained that include purposes of the processing, categories involved and envisaged time limits. The records must be made available to the supervisory authority on request ('''Article 30''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e3265-1-1|title=REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL ('''article 30''')|website=|url-status=live|access-date=7 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628174534/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e3265-1-1#d1e3265-1-1|archive-date=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====3 Security of personal data====
'''Article 33''' states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined ('''Article 34'''). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach ('''Article 33''').

However, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption ('''Article 34''').

====4 Data protection officer====
{{See also|European Commission Data Protection Officer}}
'''Article 37''' requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by a public authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences ('''Articles 9''' and '''Article 10''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679|title=EUR-Lex – Art. 37|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122015414/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679|archive-date=22 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.

A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.

The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, [[data security]] (including dealing with [[Attack (computing)|cyberattacks]]) and other critical [[business continuity]] issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations, the DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.truevault.com/learn/explaining-gdpr-data-subject-requests|title=Explaining GDPR Data Subject Requests|website=TrueVault|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44100|title=Guidelines on Data Protection Officers|website=|access-date=27 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629063312/http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44100|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations ('''Article 27'''). This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|title=Global reach of the GDPR: What is at stake?|work=Lexology|last=Jankowski|first=Piper-Meredith|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041216/https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b3db89a5-ac63-4fcb-9d71-b08c00a609e3|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==== EU Representative ====
An EU Representative is an EU-based designee or “ambassador” of a non-EU establishment (Data Controller or Data Processor) that is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU. A natural (individual) or moral (corporation) person can play the role of an EU Representative. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensure compliance with this GDPR.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art. 27(4) GDPR}}</ref> The purpose of such representation is to enable the European data protection supervisory authorities to ensure compliance with the GDPR, by being able to control or supervise the activities of the non-EU establishments that are subject to the GDPR, through their respective representatives in the EU.

Only non-EU establishments that are subject to the GDPR are obliged to designate an EU Representative.   It is worth reiterating the fact that a non-EU establishment shall be subject to the GDPR if it regularly undertakes one of the following activities: (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the EU; and/or (b) the monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects in the EU, as far as their behaviour takes place within the EU.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art. 3(2) GDPR}}</ref> This provision concerns any company that offers goods or services online to EU customers or uses cookies or similar technologies to track EU data subjects. Such establishments must comply with the GDPR, and thus are obliged to designate an EU Representative.

However, a non-EU establishment is exempted from designating an EU Representative when the processing is only occasional and does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in '''Article 9(1)''' GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in '''Article 10''' GDPR, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing. Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art. 27(2) GDPR}}</ref>

If a foreign company that is subject to the GDPR refuses to designate an EU Representative as required, then the former is infringing the GDPR and runs the risk of being imposed an administrative fine of up to ten million Euros or up to 2 percent of a company's total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Ignorance of the GDPR would not be an excuse, and the intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of the infringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravating factors.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art. 83(1),(2)&(4a) GDPR}}</ref>

Just like Heads of State designate their ambassadors with letters of credence, the non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document (letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. The said designation can only be given in writing (GDPR Art. 27(1)}.

===VIII Remedies, liability and penalties===

The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice. A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent to record calls. Additionally, when recording has commenced, should the caller withdraw their consent, then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording and ensure the recording does not get stored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xewave.io/how-smart-businesses-can-avoid-gdpr-penalties-when-recording-calls/|title=How Smart Businesses Can Avoid GDPR Penalties When Recording Calls|website=xewave.io|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414011044/https://www.xewave.io/how-smart-businesses-can-avoid-gdpr-penalties-when-recording-calls/|archive-date=14 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Academic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law, "is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime. That said, the ideas contained within the GDPR are not entirely European, nor new. The GDPR’s protections can be found – albeit in weaker, less prescriptive forms – in U.S. privacy laws and in Federal Trade Commission settlements with companies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoofnagle|first=Chris|last2=van der Sloot |first2=Bart|last3=Borgesius | first3=Frederik Zuiderveen|date=10 February 2019 |title=The European Union general data protection regulation: what it is and what it means|journal=Information & Communications Technology Law|volume=28|pages=65–98|doi=10.1080/13600834.2019.1573501}}</ref>

Despite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously-obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). [[Phishing]] scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|title=Scammers are using GDPR email alerts to conduct phishing attacks|last=Afifi-Sabet|first=Keumars|date=3 May 2018|work=IT PRO|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526041641/http://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/31058/scammers-are-using-gdpr-email-alerts-to-conduct|archive-date=26 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="guardian-unneeded">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|title=Most GDPR emails unnecessary and some illegal, say experts|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=21 May 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528054755/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/gdpr-emails-mostly-unnecessary-and-in-some-cases-illegal-say-experts|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/eu-govt-and-public-health-sites-lousy-with-adtech-study-finds/|title=EU gov't and public health sites are lousy with adtech, study finds|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6dbacf74-471b-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3|title=EU citizens being tracked on sensitive government websites|website=Financial Times|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>

The deluge of GDPR-related notices also inspired [[internet meme|memes]], including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means (such as an [[Ouija]] board or [[Star Wars opening crawl|''Star Wars'' opening crawl]]), suggesting that [[Santa Claus]]'s "naughty or nice" list was a violation, and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Shipping Forecast]] announcer. A blog, ''GDPR Hall of Shame'', was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices, and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation's requirements. Its author remarked that the regulation "has a lot of nitty gritty, in-the-weeds details, but not a lot of information about how to comply", but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply, making some of its responses unjustified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|title=Fall asleep in seconds by listening to a soothing voice read the EU's new GDPR legislation|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015346/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17413390/gdpr-legislation-asleep-in-seconds-listening-meditation-app-peter-jefferson|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|title=How Europe's GDPR Regulations Became a Meme|work=Wired|access-date=2018-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618002541/https://www.wired.com/story/gdpr-memes/|archive-date=18 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|title=The Internet Created a GDPR-Inspired Meme Using Privacy Policies|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617221720/https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-internet-created-a-gdpr-inspired-meme-using-privacy-policies/|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/happy-gdpr-day-gdpr-hall-of-shame|title=Help, my lightbulbs are dead!

On April 3, 2019, [[Google]] were fined a record £44m for failing to comply with GDPR. CNIL, France's data protection office, found that Google had been guilty of breaking EU privacy rules by failing to acquire adequate consent from its users regarding the data used for personalised advertising. The regulator also found that Google didn't provide clear and easily accessible information to consumers regarding data collection and retention.<ref>https://bobsbusiness.co.uk/record-gdpr-fine-for-google-2/</ref>

The development of fines is tracked by various web services, e.g. by [https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ Enforcementtracker].

The impact of GDPR on consumers is however quite limited. A study<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intotheminds.com/blog/en/gdpr-statistics-europe/|title=European GDPR statistics: evolution of the number of complaints per country|last=|first=|date=2019-11-29|website=IntoTheMinds|language=en-BE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref> published in November 2019 shows that the number of complaints sent to DPA (Data Protection Authorities) in 2018 hardly reached 3 per 10000 inhabitants. 24 countries were studied and statistics show great discrepancies: from 0,17 complaint per 10000 inhabitants to 8.6 in Ireland. In some countries (Greece, Iceland) the number of complaints even decreased in 2018, questioning the actual impact of the regulation.

Finally, it is worthwhile to consider that for any privacy regulation to make a meaningful difference in the amount of data that is collected by any one entity, the transparency imposed by regulation has to be followed by the availability of adequate alternatives. Regulation like GDPR can promote transparency that can fix market failures, but cannot in itself create effective markets. This can be accomplished by a combination of legislation and standardization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbarel.com/analysis/policy/time-to-reclaim-the-internet|title=Time to reclaim the Internet|website=Hagai Bar-El on Security|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>

=== International laws ===
Mass adoption of these new privacy standards by international companies have been cited as an example of the "[[Brussels effect]]", a phenomenon wherein European laws and regulations are used as a global baseline due to their gravitas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/24/the-gdpr-is-in-effect-should-u-s-companies-be-afraid/|title=The GDPR Is in Effect: Should U.S. Companies Be Afraid?|last=Roberts|first=Jeff John|date=25 May 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528010135/http://fortune.com/2018/05/24/the-gdpr-is-in-effect-should-u-s-companies-be-afraid/|archive-date=28 May 2018|url-status=live|access-date=28 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The U.S. state of [[California]] passed the [[California Consumer Privacy Act]] on 28 June 2018, taking effect 1 January 2020: it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR. Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective, as a collection of state-level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/10/23/california-data-privacy-law-gdpr/|title=Commentary: California's New Data Privacy Law Could Begin a Regulatory Disaster|website=Fortune|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/california-unanimously-passes-historic-privacy-bill|title=California Unanimously Passes Historic Privacy Bill|work=Wired|access-date=2018-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629224553/https://www.wired.com/story/california-unanimously-passes-historic-privacy-bill/|archive-date=29 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/california-passed-version-gdpr/314079/|title=Marketers and tech companies confront California's version of GDPR|access-date=2018-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629211518/http://adage.com/article/digital/california-passed-version-gdpr/314079/|archive-date=29 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==United Kingdom implementation==
It's true that with the [[United Kingdom]] [[Brexit|scheduled to leave the European Union]], the UK granted [[royal assent]] to the ''[[Data Protection Act 2018]]'' on 23 May 2018, which contains equivalent regulations and protections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/may/new-data-protection-act-finalised-uk/|title=New Data Protection Act finalised in the UK|website=Out-Law.com|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525120311/https://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2018/may/new-data-protection-act-finalised-uk/|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441814/New-UK-Data-Protection-Act-not-welcomed-by-all|title=New UK Data Protection Act not welcomed by all|work=Computer Weekly|access-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524143548/https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441814/New-UK-Data-Protection-Act-not-welcomed-by-all|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the UK leaves the EU, it will become a ''third country'' for the purposes of the transfer of personal data outside the EU.
