'''Babelfy''' is a software [[algorithm]] for the disambiguation of text written in any language. Specifically, Babelfy performs the tasks of [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] [[Word Sense Disambiguation]] (i.e., the disambiguation of common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) and [[Entity Linking]] (i.e. the disambiguation of mentions to encyclopedic entities like people, companies, places, etc.).<ref>A. Moro, A. Raganato, R. Navigli. [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/TACL_2014_Babelfy.pdf Entity Linking meets Word Sense Disambiguation: a Unified Approach]. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2, pp. 231-244, 2014.</ref> Babelfy is based on the [[BabelNet]] multilingual semantic network and performs disambiguation and entity linking in three steps:

* It associates with each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of the BabelNet semantic network, i.e., either [[concept]] or [[named entity]], a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices. This is a preliminary step which needs to be performed only once, independently of the input text.
* Given an input [[Written text|text]], it extracts all the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, lists the possible [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] according to the [[semantic network]].
* It creates a [[Graph (data structure)|graph-based]] semantic interpretation of the whole text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed semantic signatures. It then extracts a dense [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of this representation and selects the best candidate meaning for each fragment.

As a result, the text, written in any of the 271 [[language]]s supported by BabelNet, is output with possibly overlapping semantic annotations.
