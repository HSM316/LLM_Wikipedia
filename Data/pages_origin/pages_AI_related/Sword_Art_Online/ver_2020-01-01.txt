==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Sword Art Online characters}}

===Setting===
The light novel series spans several [[virtual reality]] worlds, beginning with the game, ''Sword Art Online'' (''SAO''), which is set in a world known as ''Aincrad''. Each world is built on a [[game engine]] called the World Seed, which was initially developed specifically for ''SAO'' by [[List of Sword Art Online characters#Heathcliff|Akihiko Kayaba]], but was later duplicated for ''ALfheim Online'' (''ALO''), and later willed to Kirito, who had it leaked online with the successful intention of reviving the virtual reality industry.

===Plot===
In 2022, a virtual reality [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (VRMMORPG) called ''Sword Art Online'' (''SAO'') is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.

On November 6, 10,000 players log into ''SAO''{{'}}s mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of ''SAO'', if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.

One of the players, named [[Kirito (Sword Art Online)|Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya]], is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous [[closed beta]]. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a [[portmanteau]] of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named [[Asuna (Sword Art Online)|Asuna Yuuki]], forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.

In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 ''SAO'' players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Asuna's father Shouzou Yuuki who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another ''SAO'' survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on "The [[Yggdrasil|World Tree]]" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called ''Alfheim Online'' (''ALO''). Assisted in-game by his cousin [[Leafa|Suguha "Leafa" Kirigaya]] and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from ''SAO''), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ''ALO'' are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 ''SAO'' players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ''ALO'' to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a [[Package (package management system)|package]] program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.

Soon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called ''Gun Gale Online'' (''GGO''), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named [[Sinon (Sword Art Online)|Shino "Sinon" Asada]], he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in ''SAO''. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.

Kazuto is later recruited to test an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played, to help develop an artificial intelligence for the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]] (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, when Black injures Kazuto with [[suxamethonium chloride]], the MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him. Meanwhile, it is revealed that UnderWorld was created as part of an experiment to create [[artificial intelligence]] that could be used for military purposes.

[[Reki Kawahara]] wrote the first volume in 2001 as a competition entry for the 2002 [[ASCII Media Works]] {{nihongo|Dengeki Game Novel Prize|電撃ゲーム小説大賞|Dengeki Game Shōsetsu Taishō|extra=now [[Dengeki Novel Prize]]}}, but refrained from submitting it as he had exceeded the page limit; he instead published it as a web novel under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori.<ref name="afterword vol.1">Afterword of the first light novel volume</ref> Over time, he added three further main arcs and several short stories, which like the first arc Aincrad, were later adapted into the light novels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-03-01/understanding-sword-art-online/.112843|title=Understanding Sword Art Online|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 1, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124152400/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-03-01/understanding-sword-art-online/.112843|archive-date=January 24, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Afterword of the sixth light novel volume</ref><ref name="wordgear novel">{{cite web|url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|author=Fumio Kunori (Reki Kawahara)|title=web novel|work=WordGear|language=Japanese|access-date=July 7, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EV8ijtat?url=http://wordgear.x0.com/novel/|archive-date=February 17, 2013|df=}}</ref> In 2008, he participated in the competition again by writing ''[[Accel World]]'', this time winning the Grand Prize.

For the protagonist Kirito, Kawahara was asked if Kirito's personality and character were based on his own; he answered that he usually does not put aspects of himself into his characters,<ref name="inquisitr"/> and jokingly remarked: "but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]].

Richard Eisenbeis of [[Kotaku]] hails ''Sword Art Online'' as the smartest series in recent years, praising its deep insight on the psychological aspects of [[virtual reality]] on the human psyche, its sociological views on creating a realistic economy and society in a [[massively multiplayer online game]] setting, and the writing staff's ability to juggle a wide variety of genres within the series.<ref name="Eisenbeis1">{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|title=''Sword Art Online'' Is the Smartest Anime I’ve Seen in Years (And It’s Only Half-Done)|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|date=September 28, 2012|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710060715/https://kotaku.com/sword-art-online-is-the-smartest-anime-i-ve-seen-in-yea-5947171|archive-date=July 10, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=July 10, 2019|df=}}</ref> Eisenbeis particularly noted how the romance between Kirito and Asuna is explored bringing "definition to exactly what love is like in a virtual world."<ref name="Eisenbeis1" /> However, at the time of this preliminary review, he had only watched the first 12 episodes of the series.<ref name="Eisenbeis1" /> He has since gone on to review the second half of the series, lauding its excellent use of plot twists and praising its well-written and believable villain. However, he felt that some of the initial positive aspects of the series were lost in the second half, such as the focus on psychological repercussions and social interactions that could be realistically seen in an online game. Criticism was also levied towards the aspect of turning Asuna into a damsel in distress, stating that a female lead as strong as her was "reduced to nothing but the quest item the male lead is hunting for." Eisenbeis closes his review of the series by stating in regards to the two halves, "Both, however, are enjoyable for what they are."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|title=''Sword Art Online''{{'}}s Second Half Isn't Quite as Brilliant as Its First|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|date=December 26, 2012|website=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710060539/https://kotaku.com/sword-art-onlines-second-half-isnt-quite-as-brilliant-5971194|archive-date=July 10, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=July 10, 2019|df=}}</ref>

While the anime received more criticism in western media, the light novels received praise mainly in latter arcs like Mother Rosario and Alicization.

Together they do an excellent job at conveying the various emotions present here: warmth, fear, frustration, and melancholy.
