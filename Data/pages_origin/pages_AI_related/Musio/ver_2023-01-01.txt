'''Musio''' is a [[social robot]] designed by AKA Intelligence, powered by MUSE, an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] engine for communication developed by AKA. Using deep learning algorithms, Musio converses with people, recognizes objects and understands people's facial expressions.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/19/business/tech/ai-robot-touted-future-english-learning-tool-japanese-kids/#.V2ircriLSUk AI robot touted as future English-learning tool for Japanese kids], Japan Times, 2015.11.19</ref><ref>[http://time.com/3901769/musio-robot/ Meet the Chatty Robot Who Wants to Outsmart Every Other Toy], Times, 2015.06.02</ref> Additionally, Musio has an emotional engine, which lets it express facial expressions when conversing with someone. Different sounds and facial colours are shown with animations. When multiple users are present and registered with Musio, each interaction is different. This is affected based on each person's emotional state when talking to Musio, past discussions and subjects discussed. In May 2015, Musio was first introduced to the world through the global crowdfunding site [[Indiegogo]]. AKA Intelligence raised 201% of the needed funding, resulting in a total of just over $100k.<ref>[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/musio-your-curious-new-friend#/ Musio: Your Curious New Friend], Indiegogo, 2016.11.08</ref>

== MUSE ==
MUSE is the deep learning-based AI engine for communication that powers Musio. It attempts to understand the user via textual language, oral language, gestures and facial expressions. This way, MUSE can communicate with the user as a whole. AKA Intelligence built the machine learning system on the neuroscience to interplay between structure (i.e. rule-based) and antistructure methods (i.e. statistical).<ref>[http://www.akaintelligence.com/ Deep learning quantum engine], AKA Intelligence, 2016.11.10</ref>

== Sophy ==
Sophy is Musio's companion [[robot]] that allows Musio to interact with various study materials. Using an optical LED Sensor (OID) and low-energy Bluetooth connection, Sophy can "read" information and send it to Musio. When Sophy needs to communicate to the user, a tactile feedback motor is used. This can be felt in a series of Morse-code to know exactly what the message is. A Morse-code manual is provided with Sophy.<ref>[https://themusio.com/download/Sophy%20User's%20Guide%20(ENG).pdf/ Sophy User Guide]{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sophy User Guide, 2016.11.12</ref>

== Purpose ==
Musio is a social robot for educational purposes, specifically to help people who wish to improve their English speaking abilities. With the help of a WI-FI connection, Musio can talk freely about different subjects with people. A whole range of questions can be asked, and with the use an inference abilities, Musio can understand what a person is talking about and remembering past questions. Apart from simple questions and answers, a natural fluid conversation can be carried out.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/musio-ai-robot/ Adorable AI-powered robot Musio just wants to be your friend], Engadget, 2015.06.01</ref> In addition, an assistant OID partner device, Sophy linked with Musio provides learning opportunities from a wide range of educational material. Two of the many abilities Musio has is "Pronunciation Checkup" and "Grammar Correction." These help with pronunciations and grammar, especially if the user is not a native English speaker.
