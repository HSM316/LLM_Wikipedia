'''Musio''' is a [[social robot]] designed by AKA Intelligence, powered by MUSE, an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] engine developed for communication, specifically to help people who wish to improve their English conversational skills.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} Using learning algorithms, Musio converses with people, and recognizes objects and understands people's facial expressions.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/19/business/tech/ai-robot-touted-future-english-learning-tool-japanese-kids/#.V2ircriLSUk AI robot touted as future English-learning tool for Japanese kids], Japan Times, 2015.11.19</ref><ref>[http://time.com/3901769/musio-robot/ Meet the Chatty Robot Who Wants to Outsmart Every Other Toy], Times, 2015.06.02</ref> Musio also has an emotional engine, which lets it express facial expressions and related sounds. In May 2015, Musio was crowdfunded on [[Indiegogo]], where 201% of the needed funding was raised, resulting in a total of just over $100k.<ref>[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/musio-your-curious-new-friend#/ Musio: Your Curious New Friend], Indiegogo, 2016.11.08</ref>

== Purpose ==
Musio is designed for educational purposes, specifically to help people who wish to improve their English speaking abilities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} Apart from simple questions and answers, a natural conversation can be carried out.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/01/musio-ai-robot/ Adorable AI-powered robot Musio just wants to be your friend], Engadget, 2015.06.01</ref> In addition, an assistant OID partner device, named Sophy, provides learning opportunities from a wide range of educational material. Musio includes "Pronunciation Checkup" and "Grammar Correction," among other features, to help with pronunciation and grammar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

== Sophy ==
Sophy is Musio's companion [[robot]] that allows Musio to interact with various study materials. Using an optical LED Sensor (OID) and low-energy Bluetooth connection, Sophy can "read" information and send it to Musio. When Sophy needs to communicate to the user, a tactile feedback motor is used. This can be felt in a series of Morse-code taps to convey the message. A Morse-code manual is provided with Sophy.<ref>[https://themusio.com/download/Sophy%20User's%20Guide%20(ENG).pdf/ Sophy User Guide]{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sophy User Guide, 2016.11.12</ref>

== MUSE ==
MUSE is the deep learning-based AI engine for communication that powers Musio.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} It attempts to understand the user via textual language, oral language, gestures and facial expressions. AKA Intelligence built the machine learning system on the neuroscience to interplay between structure (i.e. rule-based) and antistructure methods (i.e. statistical).<ref>[http://www.akaintelligence.com/ Deep learning quantum engine], AKA Intelligence, 2016.11.10</ref>
