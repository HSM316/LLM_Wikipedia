For such low area fractions, the clusters have a finite mean size<ref name=":0" /> while at larger area fractions (30% or higher), a complete phase separation has been reported.<ref name=":1" /> The dynamics of the finite-size clusters are very rich, exhibiting either crystalline order or amorphous packing. The finite size of the clusters comes from a balance between attachment of new particles to pre-existing clusters and breakdown of large clusters into smaller ones, which has led to the term "living clusters".<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" />

== Mechanism for synthetic systems ==
The precise mechanism leading to the appearance of clusters is not completely elucidated and is a current field of research for many systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Focus: Particle Clustering Phenomena Inspire Multiple Explanations|journal = Physics|volume = 6|url = https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/134|access-date = 2015-09-22|date = 2013-12-11|last1 = Ball|first1 = Philip|doi = 10.1103/physics.6.134}}</ref> A few different mechanisms have been proposed, which could be at play in different experimental setups.

Self-propelled particles can accumulate in a region of space where they move with a decreased velocity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Theory of continuum random walks and application to chemotaxis|journal = Physical Review E|date = 1 October 1993|pages = 2553–2568|volume = 48|issue = 4|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.48.2553|pmid = 9960890|first = Mark J.|last = Schnitzer|bibcode = 1993PhRvE..48.2553S}}</ref> After accumulation, in regions of high particle density, the particles move more slowly because of steric hindrance.

Alternatively, clustering and phase-separation could be due to the presence of inter-particle attractive forces, as in equilibrium suspensions. Active forces would then oppose this phase separation by pulling apart the particles in the cluster,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Reentrant phase behavior in active colloids with attraction|journal = Physical Review E|date = 26 July 2013|pages = 012305|volume = 88|issue = 1|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.88.012305|pmid = 23944461|first = Gabriel S.|last = Redner|first2 = Aparna|last2 = Baskaran|first3 = Michael F.|last3 = Hagan|bibcode = 2013PhRvE..88a2305R|arxiv = 1303.3195}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Living Clusters and Crystals from Low-Density Suspensions of Active Colloids|journal = Physical Review Letters|date = 11 December 2013|pages = 245702|volume = 111|issue = 24|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.245702|first = B.

First, single particles can exist independently if their propulsion forces are sufficient to escape from the cluster. Secondly, a large cluster can break into smaller pieces due to the build-up of internal stress: as more and more particles enter the cluster, their propulsive forces add up until they break down its cohesion. 

Diffusiophoresis is also a commonly cited mechanism for clustering and collective behavior, involving the attraction or repulsion of particles to each other in response to ion gradients.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> [[Diffusiophoresis]] is a process involving the gradients of electrolyte or non-electrolyte concentrations interacting with charged (electrophoretic interactions) or neutral (chemophoretic interactions) particles in solution and with the double layer of any walls or surfaces (electroosmotic interactions).<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" />

In experiments, arguments have been put forward in favor of any of the above mechanisms. For carbon-coated silica beads, attractive interactions are seemingly negligible and phase-separation is indeed seen at large densities.<ref name=":1" /> For other experimental systems, however, attractive forces often play a larger role.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" />
