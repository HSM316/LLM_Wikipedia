{{Short description|Moral behaviours of man-made machines}}
'''Machine ethics''' (or '''machine morality''', '''computational morality''', or '''computational ethics''') is a part of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] concerned with adding or ensuring moral behaviors of [[design|man-made]] machines that use artificial intelligence, otherwise known as [[Intelligent agent|artificial intelligent agents]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moor |first1=J.H. |title=The Nature, Importance, and Difficulty of Machine Ethics |journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=18–21 |doi=10.1109/MIS.2006.80 |year=2006 |s2cid=831873 }}</ref> Machine ethics differs from other ethical fields related to [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. It should not be confused with [[computer ethics]], which focuses on human use of computers. It should also be distinguished from the [[philosophy of technology]], which concerns itself with technology's grander social effects.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boyles |first1=Robert James |title=A Case for Machine Ethics in Modeling Human-Level Intelligent Agents |url=https://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_22/boyles_june2018.pdf |website=Kritike |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>

==Definitions==
[[James H. Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines as ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>
*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, they have the potential to act unethically. Moor gives a hypothetical example, the "Goodman agent", named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year, so any dates after 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late 20th century. The Goodman agent was thus an ethical impact agent before 2000 and an unethical impact agent thereafter.
*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human safety, these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.
*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions, machines that have algorithms to act ethically.
*'''Full ethical agents''': These are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. But they also have human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features (i.e., have [[free will]], [[consciousness]], and [[intentionality]]).
(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)

== History ==

Before the 21st century the ethics of machines had largely been the subject of [[science fiction]], mainly due to computing and [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) limitations. Although the definition of "machine ethics" has evolved since, the term was coined by Mitchell Waldrop in the 1987 ''[[AI Magazine|AI]]'' magazine article "A Question of Responsibility":<blockquote>One thing that is apparent from the above discussion is that intelligent machines will embody values, assumptions, and purposes, whether their programmers consciously intend them to or not. Thus, as computers and robots become more and more intelligent, it becomes imperative that we think carefully and explicitly about what those built-in values are. Perhaps what we need is, in fact, a theory and practice of machine ethics, in the spirit of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]].<ref name="Waldrop1987">{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=Mitchell |date=Spring 1987 |title=A Question of Responsibility |journal=AI Magazine |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v8i1.572}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2004, ''Towards Machine Ethics''<ref>Anderson, M., Anderson, S., and Armen, C. (2004) "Towards Machine Ethics" in Proceedings of the AAAI Workshop on Agent Organization: Theory and Practice, AAAI Press [https://aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2004/WS-04-02/WS04-02-008.pdf]</ref> was presented at the AAAI Workshop on Agent Organizations: Theory and Practice.<ref>[https://aaai.org/Library/Workshops/ws04-02.php AAAI Workshop on Agent Organization: Theory and Practice, AAAI Press]</ref> Theoretical foundations for machine ethics were laid out.

At the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics, researchers met for the first time to consider implementation of an ethical dimension in autonomous systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Papers from the 2005 AAAI Fall Symposium |url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archive-date=2014-11-29}}</ref> A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition ''Machine Ethics''<ref name="Anderson2011">{{Cite book |title=Machine Ethics |date=July 2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-11235-2 |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan Leigh}}</ref> that stems from that symposium.

In 2007, ''AI'' magazine published "Machine Ethics: Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent",<ref name="anderson">Anderson, M. and Anderson, S. (2007). [http://ieet.org/archive/AIMagFinal.pdf Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent]. ''AI Magazine'', Volume 28(4).</ref> an article that discussed the importance of machine ethics, the need for machines that represent ethical principles explicitly, and challenges facing those working on machine ethics. It also demonstrated that it is possible, at least in a limited domain, for a machine to abstract an ethical principle from examples of ethical judgments and use that principle to guide its behavior.

In 2009, [[Oxford University Press]] published ''Moral Machines, Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'',<ref name="Wallach&Allen2009">{{cite book |last1=Wallach |first1=Wendell |url=https://archive.org/details/moralmachinestea0000wall |title=Moral machines : teaching robots right from wrong |last2=Allen |first2=Colin |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195374049 |url-access=registration}}</ref> which it advertised as "the first book to examine the challenge of building artificial moral agents, probing deeply into the nature of human decision making and ethics." It cited 450 sources, about 100 of which addressed [[#Focuses of machine ethics|major questions]] of machine ethics.

In 2011, [[Cambridge University Press]] published a collection of essays about machine ethics edited by Michael and Susan Leigh Anderson,<ref name="Anderson2011" /> who also edited a special issue of ''IEEE Intelligent Systems'' on the topic in 2006.<ref name="Anderson2006">{{cite journal |date=July–August 2006 |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Susan Leigh |title=Special Issue on Machine Ethics |url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/mags/ex/2006/04/x4toc.htm |url-status=dead |journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=10–63 |doi=10.1109/mis.2006.70 |issn=1541-1672 |s2cid=9570832 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126025029/http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/mags/ex/2006/04/x4toc.htm |archive-date=2011-11-26}}</ref> The collection focuses on the challenges of adding ethical principles to machines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Siler |first1=Cory |year=2015 |title=Review of Anderson and Anderson's Machine Ethics |journal=Artificial Intelligence |volume=229 |pages=200–201 |doi=10.1016/j.artint.2015.08.013 |s2cid=5613776 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Areas of focus==
=== AI control problem ===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}

Some scholars, such as Bostrom and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that, if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]", this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the [[mountain gorilla]]'s fate depends on human goodwill, so might humanity's fate depend on a future superintelligence's actions.<ref name="superintelligence">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', Bostrom and Russell assert that while the future of AI is very uncertain, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.

This presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators without inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm them. The danger of not [[design]]ing control right "the first time" is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent us from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include "capability control" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and "motivational control" (one way of building an AI whose goals are [[AI alignment|aligned]] with human or optimal values). A number of organizations are researching the AI control problem, including the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], the [[Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Future of Life Institute]].

===Algorithms and training===

AI paradigms have been debated, especially their efficacy and bias. Bostrom and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision trees]] (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | author-link1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | author-link2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year= 2011 | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]] | access-date= 2011-06-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | archive-date= 2016-03-04 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In contrast, Chris Santos-Lang has argued in favor of neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable than machines to criminal [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]].<ref name="SantosLang2002">{{cite web | url= http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111203030304/http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | archive-date= 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name="SantosLang2014">{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=2014 |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |volume=74 |publisher=Springer | location=Switzerland | pages=111–127 | chapter=Moral Ecology Approaches to Machine Ethics| chapter-url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8|series=Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering |isbn=978-3-319-08107-6 }}</ref>

In 2009, in an experiment at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale]] of [[Lausanne]]'s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, AI robots were programmed to cooperate with each other and tasked with searching for a beneficial resource while avoiding a poisonous one.<ref name="PopSci_2009-08-18">{{Cite news |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other |title=Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other |work=Popular Science |date=August 18, 2009 |first=Stuart |last=Fox}}</ref> During the experiment, the robots were grouped into clans, and the successful members' digital genetic code was used for the next generation, a type of algorithm known as a genetic algorithm. After 50 successive generations in the AI, one clan's members discovered how to distinguish the beneficial resource from the poisonous one. The robots then learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource from other robots.<ref name="PopSci_2009-08-18"/> In the same experiment, the same robots also learned to behave selflessly and signaled danger to other robots, and died to save other robots.<ref name="SantosLang2002"/> Machine ethicists have questioned the experiment's implications. In the experiment, the robots' goals were programmed to be "terminal", but human motives typically require never-ending learning.

=== Autonomous weapons systems ===

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might acquire autonomy, and to what degree they could use it to pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability to find power sources on their own and to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence". They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there are other potential hazards and pitfalls.<ref name="nytimes july09">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html |title=Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man |first=John |last=Markoff |work=New York Times |date=July 25, 2009}}</ref>

=== Integration of artificial general intelligences with society ===
[[File:Hospital delivery robot having priority to elevators.jpg|thumb|A hospital [[delivery robot]] in front of elevator doors stating "Robot Has Priority", a situation that may be regarded as [[reverse discrimination]] in relation to humans]]
Preliminary work has been conducted on methods of integrating [[artificial general intelligence]]s (full ethical agents as defined above) with existing legal and social frameworks. Approaches have focused on their legal position and rights.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sotala|first1=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Machine learning bias ===
{{further|Algorithmic bias}}
[[Big data]] and [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s have become popular in numerous industries, including [[online advertising]], [[credit rating]]s, and criminal sentencing, with the promise of providing more objective, data-driven results, but have been identified as a potential way to perpetuate social inequalities and [[discrimination]].<ref name="NYT2016">{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html|title=Artificial Intelligence's White Guy Problem|date=25 June 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="ProPublica2016">{{cite news|author1=Julia Angwin |author1-link=Julia Angwin |author2=Surya Mattu |author3=Jeff Larson |author4=Lauren Kircher|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing|title=Machine Bias: There's Software Used Across the Country to Predict Future Criminals.

The U.S. judicial system has begun using [[quantitative risk assessment software]] when making decisions related to releasing people on bail and sentencing in an effort to be fairer and reduce the [[United States incarceration rate|imprisonment rate]]. These tools analyze a defendant's criminal history, among other attributes. In a study of 7,000 people arrested in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], [[Florida]], only 20% of people predicted to commit a crime using the county's [[risk assessment]] scoring system proceeded to commit a crime.<ref name="ProPublica2016" /> A 2016 [[ProPublica]] report analyzed [[recidivism]] risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe [[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]] system, and looked at outcomes over two years. The report found that only 61% of those deemed high-risk committed additional crimes during that period. The report also flagged that African-American defendants were far more likely to be given high-risk scores than their white counterparts.<ref name="ProPublica2016" /> It has been argued that such pretrial risk assessments violate [[Equal Protection]] rights on the basis of race, due to factors including possible discriminatory intent by the algorithm itself, under a theory of partial legal capacity for artificial intelligences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=C.|last2=Nunez|first2=A.|date=2022|title=Automating Judicial Discretion: How Algorithmic Risk Assessments in Pretrial Adjudications Violate Equal Protection Rights on the Basis of Race|journal=[[Law & Inequality]]|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=371–407|url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1680&context=lawineq|doi=10.24926/25730037.649|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2016, the [[Obama Administration|Obama administration]]'s Big Data Working Group—an overseer of various big-data regulatory frameworks—released reports warning of "the potential of encoding discrimination in automated decisions" and calling for "equal opportunity by design" for applications such as credit scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2016_0504_data_discrimination.pdf|title=Big Data: A Report on Algorithmic Systems, Opportunity, and Civil Rights|last1=Executive Office of the President|date=May 2016|publisher=Obama White House}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/05/04/big-risks-big-opportunities-intersection-big-data-and-civil-rights|title=Big Risks, Big Opportunities: the Intersection of Big Data and Civil Rights|date=4 May 2016|publisher=Obama White House}}</ref> The reports encourage discourse among policy-makers, citizens, and academics alike, but recognize that no solution yet exists for the encoding of bias and discrimination into algorithmic systems.

==Ethical frameworks and practices==

===Practices===
In March 2018, in an effort to address rising concerns over machine learning's impact on [[human rights]], the [[World Economic Forum]] and [[Global Future Council on Human Rights]] published a [[white paper]] with detailed recommendations on how best to prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/how-to-prevent-discriminatory-outcomes-in-machine-learning/|title=How to Prevent Discriminatory Outcomes in Machine Learning|website=World Economic Forum |date=12 March 2018 |access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref> The World Economic Forum developed four recommendations based on the ''UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights'' to help address and prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning:<ref name=":0" />

# '''Active inclusion''': Development and design of machine learning applications must actively seek a diversity of input, especially of the norms and values of populations affected by the output of AI systems.
# '''[[Fairness (machine learning)|Fairness]]''': People involved in conceptualizing, developing, and implementing machine learning systems should consider which definition of fairness best applies to their context and application, and prioritize it in the machine learning system's architecture and evaluation metrics.
# '''Right to understanding''': Involvement of machine learning systems in decision-making that affects individual rights must be disclosed, and the systems must be able to explain their decision-making in a way that is understandable to end users and reviewable by a competent human authority. Where this is impossible and rights are at stake, leaders in the design, deployment, and regulation of machine learning technology must question whether it should be used.
# '''Access to redress''': Leaders, designers, and developers of machine learning systems are responsible for identifying the potential negative human rights impacts of their systems. They must make visible avenues for redress for those affected by disparate impacts, and establish processes for the timely redress of any discriminatory outputs.

In January 2020, Harvard University's [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society]] published a meta-study of 36 prominent sets of principles for AI, identifying eight key themes: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and [[explainable artificial intelligence|explainability]], fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fjeld|first1=Jessica|last2=Achten|first2=Nele|last3=Hilligoss|first3=Hannah|last4=Nagy|first4=Adam|last5=Srikumar|first5=Madhulika|date=2020|title=Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for AI|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3518482|s2cid=214464355|issn=1556-5068|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:42160420}}</ref> Researchers at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]] conducted a similar meta-study in 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jobin|first1=Anna|last2=Ienca|first2=Marcello|last3=Vayena|first3=Effy|author-link3=Effy Vayena|date=2019|title=The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines|journal=Nature Machine Intelligence|volume=1|issue=9|pages=389–399|doi=10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2| arxiv=1906.11668|s2cid=201827642|issn=2522-5839|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This is called [[casuistry]], and could be implemented through research on the Internet. The consensus from a million past decisions would lead to a new decision that is democracy-dependent.<ref name="anderson"/> [[Bruce M.

One thought experiment focuses on a ''Genie Golem'' with unlimited powers presenting itself to the reader. This Genie declares that it will return in 50 years and demands that it be provided with a definite set of morals it will then immediately act upon. This experiment's purpose is to spark discourse over how best to handle defining sets of ethics that computers may understand.<ref>Nazaretyan, A. (2014). A. H. Eden, J. H. Moor, J. H. Søraker and E.

Some recent work attempts to reconstruct AI morality and control more broadly as a problem of mutual contestation between AI as a [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian subjectivity]] on the one hand and humans or institutions on the other hand, all within a [[Discipline and Punish|disciplinary apparatus]]. Certain desiderata need to be fulfilled: ''embodied self-care, embodied intentionality, imagination'' and ''reflexivity,'' which together would condition AI's emergence as an ethical subject capable of self-conduct.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=D’Amato |first=Kristian |date=2024-04-09 |title=ChatGPT: towards AI subjectivity |url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-024-01898-z |journal=AI & Society |language=en |doi=10.1007/s00146-024-01898-z |issn=0951-5666|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==In fiction==
In [[science fiction]], movies and novels have played with the idea of sentient robots and machines.

[[Neill Blomkamp]]'s ''[[Chappie (film)|Chappie]]'' (2015) enacts a scenario of being able to transfer one's consciousness into a computer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brundage |first1=Miles |last2=Winterton |first2=Jamie |title=Chappie and the Future of Moral Machines |url=https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/chappie-robot-ethics-the-film-raises-interesting-questions-about-morality.html |website=Slate |date=17 March 2015 |access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> [[Alex Garland]]'s 2014 film ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' follows an [[Android (robot)|android]] with artificial intelligence undergoing a variation of the [[Turing Test]], a test administered to a machine to see whether its behavior can be distinguished from that of a human. Films such as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999) incorporate the concept of machines turning on their human masters.

Asimov considered the issue in the 1950s in ''[[I, Robot]]''. At the insistence of his editor [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], he proposed the Three Laws of Robotics to govern artificially intelligent systems. Much of his work was then spent testing his three laws' boundaries to see where they break down or create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances.<ref name=Asimov2008>{{Cite book

In his post-apocalyptic scenario, he questions whether empathy is an entirely human characteristic. The book is the basis for the 1982 science-fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.
