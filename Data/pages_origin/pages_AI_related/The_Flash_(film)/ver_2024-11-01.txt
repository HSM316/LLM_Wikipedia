'''''The Flash''''' is a 2023 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / Flash]]. Directed by [[Andy Muschietti]] from a screenplay by [[Christina Hodson]] and a story by [[Joby Harold]] and the writing team of [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]], it is the 13th film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). [[Ezra Miller]] stars as [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry]], who travels back in time to prevent his mother's death and becomes stranded in an alternate past. [[Sasha Calle]] also stars in her film debut, alongside [[Michael Shannon]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Maribel Verdú]], [[Kiersey Clemons]], [[Antje Traue]], and [[Michael Keaton]].

Development of a film based on the Flash began in the late 1980s, with multiple writers and directors attached to the project through 2014. The film was then redeveloped as a part of the DCEU, with Miller cast as the title character. Multiple directors were attached to the film over the following years, with [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], [[Rick Famuyiwa]], and the duo of Daley and Goldstein all departing the project over creative differences. Muschietti and Hodson joined the film in July 2019, and pre-production began in January 2020. The film is influenced by the comic book storyline ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011) and features other DC characters, such as Calle's [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and multiple versions of [[Batman]], including [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Keaton's portrayal]] from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992). Filming took place from April to October 2021 at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]] and on location around the United Kingdom.

''The Flash'' premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]], on June 12, 2023, and was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 16, following multiple delays caused by the director changes and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor, action sequences, and the performances, but criticized the visual effects and [[third act]]. It was also a <!--Do NOT REMOVE "box-office bomb" as, per MOS:ACCLAIMED, it is attributed to multiple high-quality, reliable sources in the body of the article.-->[[box-office bomb]], grossing $271&nbsp;million worldwide against a budget of $200–220&nbsp;million.<!--Do NOT REMOVE "box-office bomb" as, per MOS:ACCLAIMED, it is attributed to multiple high-quality, reliable sources in the body of the article.--> Its box office performance was attributed to factors such as [[Ezra Miller#Legal issues|Miller's legal issues and controversies]], the franchise's imminent reboot with the [[DC Universe (franchise)|DC Universe]] (DCU), an overall decline of the superhero genre, and the film's mixed reception and marketing practices.

== Plot ==
After helping [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] and [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]] stop a robbery in [[Gotham City]], [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen / The Flash]] revisits his childhood home, where he lived with his parents [[Nora Allen|Nora]] and [[Henry Allen (comics)|Henry]], before Henry's wrongful imprisonment for Nora's murder.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017) and ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'' (2021)}} On the day of her death, Nora sent Henry to the grocery store for a can of food that she forgot to buy, leaving her alone in the kitchen where she was killed by an unidentified assailant.{{efn|Identified off-screen as [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash]] by director [[Andy Muschietti]]<ref name="ReverseFlash" />}} Overcome by emotions, Barry accidentally uses the [[Speed Force]] to form a "Chronobowl" and [[Time travel in fiction|travels back in time]] to earlier that fateful day. Despite Bruce's warnings of time travel's unintended consequences, Barry places the can in Nora's cart at the store, so that his father will not have to leave the house. As he returns to the present, Barry is knocked out of the Chronobowl by an unknown [[Speedster (fiction)|speedster]] and arrives in an alternative 2013 where Nora is alive. He encounters his parents and his past self, and realizes this is the day he originally obtained his powers.

To ensure his past self gains superpowers, the two Barrys go to the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] Police Department, where Barry re-enacts the event for 2013-Barry to be struck by lightning. Both end up getting struck by the lightning, giving 2013-Barry powers, but causing Barry to lose his own. As Barry struggles to train 2013-Barry on properly using his powers, they learn that [[Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]] is preparing to invade Earth.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013)}} In an effort to fight Zod, the Barrys attempt to assemble the [[Justice League (DC Extended Universe)|Justice League]] but are unsuccessful; in this timeline, Diana cannot be located, [[Victor Stone (DC Extended Universe)|Victor Stone]] has not gained his abilities yet, and [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Arthur Curry]] never existed. They travel to [[Wayne Manor]], hoping to find Bruce, but instead find [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|an alternate version]] who has long retired. Bruce theorizes that using time travel to alter history affects events both prior to and after the alteration. They convince Bruce to return as Batman and help them find [[Superman (DC Extended Universe)|Kal-El / Superman]].

The Barrys and Batman locate a [[Kryptonian]] pod discovered in [[Siberia]]. Upon arrival, they instead find Kal-El's cousin, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], imprisoned in the facility. They rescue Kara and return to Wayne Manor. Barry enlists Bruce's help to regain his powers once more. The first two attempts fail, prompting Kara to fly Barry into a storm, where he regains his powers. Kara and Batman join the Barrys to fight Zod and his forces. During the battle, Kara learns that Zod had intercepted Kal-El's escape pod from Krypton and killed him while attempting to extract the Codex needed to repopulate the Kryptonian species. Zod reveals that the Codex is actually within Kara. Zod subdues and kills her, then extracts the Codex from her blood; meanwhile, Batman sacrifices himself in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Zod's ship.

The Barrys repeatedly time travel to save Batman and Kara but keep failing. Barry realizes that this sequence of events cannot be changed, but 2013-Barry keeps trying. As 2013-Barry travels, the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] starts to implode. The unknown speedster who initially knocked Barry out of the Speed Force returns and is revealed to be an older, future version of 2013-Barry who still believes he can defeat Zod and save his Earth. He becomes angry when Barry reveals his intention to reverse the changes he made to the timeline by letting Nora die. The elder 2013-Barry attempts to kill Barry, but instead impales young 2013-Barry, who sacrifices himself to save Barry and wipe his future self from the timeline. Barry reverts the timeline and comes to terms with his mother's death; however, he subtly alters the past by moving the tomato cans to a higher shelf. Returning to the present day, Barry attends Henry's court hearing, where the security footage now reveals Henry looking up to grab the tomato can, allowing for his exoneration. Barry is then contacted by Bruce, whose appearance has changed once again as a result of the timeline alteration.<!--There is no indication that the post-credits scene has any major plot significance; unless it is proven to be the case, please do not add this to the plot summary.-->

== Production ==
=== Development ===
==== Early attempts ====
Development on a film based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[the Flash]] began in the late 1980s when [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] hired comic book writer [[Jeph Loeb]] to write a screenplay.<ref name="LoebScript" /> Warner Bros. hired [[David S. Goyer]] to write, direct, and produce a new version of ''The Flash'' in December 2004 after he impressed them with his script for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).<ref name="GoyerHelm" /><ref name="GoyerChoice" /> Goyer approached [[Ryan Reynolds]] to portray [[Wally West|Wally West / The Flash]] after working with him on the [[Marvel Comics]]–based film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004) and intended to have the character [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] appear in a supporting role. Goyer was influenced for the film's tone by [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] and the Flash comic book runs by [[Mike Baron]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Geoff Johns]]. By early February 2007, Goyer left the project over creative differences with the studio,<ref name="GoyerChoice" /><ref name="GoyerBooted" /> and [[Shawn Levy]] was hired to direct and oversee the writing of a new draft written by [[Chris Brancato]], which used elements from Goyer's script.<ref name="LevyHelm" /><ref name="Brancato" /> Later that month, Warner Bros. announced the development of a [[Justice League]] film, with Michelle and [[Kieran Mulroney]] writing the screenplay.<ref name="JusticeLeague" /> [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] signed on to direct the film, titled ''[[Justice League: Mortal]]'', in September,<ref name="GeorgeMiller" /> with [[Adam Brody]] cast as the Flash.<ref name="AdamBrody" /> It was envisioned as the start of a franchise with planned sequels and spin-offs, including the Flash film.<ref name="GeorgeMiller" />

Levy left ''The Flash'' in October 2007 because of scheduling conflicts with ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' (2009). [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] took over as director and began developing the film as a spin-off from ''Justice League: Mortal'', with a focus on Wally West.<ref name="DobkinDirect" /> [[Craig Wright (playwright)|Craig Wright]] was writing a script for the film the next month,<ref name="WrightScript" /> before ''Justice League: Mortal'' was canceled and Warner Bros. set a 2008 release for ''The Flash''.<ref name="2008Release" /> Further development was delayed by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name="WGAStrikeDelay" /> [[Charles Roven]] joined the project as a producer by July 2009, with Geoff Johns consulting and writing a [[film treatment]] that [[Dan Mazeau]] adapted into a screenplay.<ref name="RovenJohns" /> In October, Roven said the studio was not confident enough in their take to green-light the film, though Mazeau disputed this and said the film was moving forward as planned.<ref name="RovenMazeauTalks" /> In June 2010, ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' (2011) writers [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and [[Marc Guggenheim]] were hired to write a new treatment for ''The Flash'' based on a recent comics run by Johns that featured Barry Allen.<ref name="GLFlashWriters" />

==== DC Extended Universe ====
Warner Bros. was planning a new [[shared universe]] of films based on DC by July 2013 and had tentative plans to release a ''Flash'' film in 2016.<ref name="2016Release" /> In October 2014, Warner Bros. and [[DC Films]] announced a slate of planned projects as part of the new [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). ''The Flash'' was set for release on March 23, 2018,<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> with [[Ezra Miller]] set to star in the film as [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen / The Flash]];<ref name="MillerFlash" /><ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> Miller first made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and ''[[Suicide Squad (2016 film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016),<ref name="MillerFlashBvS" /><ref name="MillerFlashSS" /> starred in the team-up film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017),<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> and briefly appeared in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover event "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" (2019–20), which acknowledged a wider [[DC Multiverse]], and in the [[Peacemaker season 1|first season]] of the series ''[[Peacemaker (TV series)|Peacemaker]]'' (2022).<ref name="KeatonTalks" /><ref name="MillerPeacemaker" /> Warner Bros. offered [[James Wan]] the choice of directing a movie about either [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Aquaman]] or the Flash, and he ultimately chose to make ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018).<ref name="Wan" /> By April 2015, [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] were writing a story treatment for the ''Flash'' film with the possibility of directing it.<ref name="LordMiller" /> After they decided to direct ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018) instead, [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] entered negotiations to write and direct the film based on Lord and Christopher Miller's treatment in October 2015. Grahame-Smith was set to make his [[directorial debut]] with the film, with Roven producing and [[Deborah Snyder|Deborah]] and [[Zack Snyder]] executive producing.<ref name="Grahame-SmithHelm" /> [[Jay Oliva]], a [[storyboard artist]] on several DCEU films and the series ''The Flash'' and director of the animated film ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' (2013), worked with Grahame-Smith on a storyboard and test which prompted the studio to [[greenlight]] the film.<ref name="OlivaAug2023" /> In February 2016, the film's release date was moved forward to March 16, 2018.<ref name="March2018Date" /> Grahame-Smith left the project that April, citing creative differences. Warner Bros. chose to retain his script,<ref name="Grahame-SmithOut" /> and he was still expected to be involved in the project moving forward, while Lord and Christopher Miller were also still involved as producers. A search for a replacement director began immediately.<ref name="Grahame-SmithOut2" />

[[Rick Famuyiwa]] was hired to take over as director in June 2016, with Warner Bros. feeling that Famuyiwa's vision for the film would resonate with younger audiences, and also be compatible with Grahame-Smith's existing script.<ref name="FamuyiwaDirect" /> Filming was expected to begin later in 2016 and was not believed to be delayed by the director change. Famuyiwa's top choice to portray the film's female lead, [[Iris West]], was [[Kiersey Clemons]], whom he had worked with on ''[[Dope (2015 film)|Dope]]'' (2015).<ref name="ClemonsTopChoice" /> [[Rita Ora]] and [[Lucy Boynton]] were also in the running for the role,<ref name="OraBoynton" /> but Clemons was cast as the character at the end of July.<ref name="ClemonsCast" /> At that time, Warner Bros. gave the film's release date to ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018), leaving ''The Flash'' without a release date.<ref name="NoMarch2018Date" /> In August, [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Victor Stone|Victor Stone / Cyborg]] from ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League''.<ref name="FisherCyborg" /> Famuyiwa completed a revision of the script a month later,<ref name="FamuyiwaRevision" /> when [[Gal Gadot]] was set to reprise her role as [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]] from ''Batman v Superman'', ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), and ''Justice League'',<ref name="GadotCast" /> and [[Billy Crudup]] was in negotiations to portray Barry's father, [[Henry Allen (comics)|Henry Allen]].<ref name="CrudupCast" /> Clemons and Crudup both filmed cameo appearances for ''Justice League'' after being cast in ''The Flash''.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /><ref name="ClemonsJL" /> Pre-production began by October ahead of a filming start in March 2017, scheduled before another commitment that Ezra Miller had in July. At the end of October, Famuyiwa left the project after not being able to "come together creatively" with the studio, which disagreed with the more mature direction that Famuyiwa wanted to take the film.<ref name="FamuyiwaOut" /> Oliva continued to work on the film with Famuyiwa for six-to-seven months until the director's exit, at which point Oliva transitioned to work on reshoots for ''Wonder Woman''. The film had been planned to be the start of a trilogy of ''Flash'' films with the character [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash]] serving as background antagonist to set him up as the main antagonist of the DCEU, and Oliva said the franchise was intended to conclude with a reboot adaptation of the [[DC Animated Universe]] (DCAU) series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (2004–2006) and ''The Flashpoint Paradox''.<ref name="OlivaAug2023" />

After Famuyiwa's exit, the film was put on hold while the studio searched for a new director and Ezra Miller prepared to film ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]'' (2018). During that time, Warner Bros. decided to take the film in a new direction, and in January 2017, [[Joby Harold]] was hired to do a page-one rewrite of the script.<ref name="HaroldRewrite" /> He handed in a draft by May, when the studio's top choices to direct were [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Matthew Vaughn]]. Both had expressed interest in the project, but had potential scheduling issues that could prevent them from taking it on.<ref name="ZemeckisVaughnShortlist" /> Raimi, [[Marc Webb]] and [[Jordan Peele]] had already turned down offers to direct the film,<ref name="RaimiWebbOffers" /><ref name="PeeleDecline" /> as did [[Ben Affleck]], who portrayed [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] in previous DCEU films.<ref name="AffleckPass" /> At the July 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the film was announced with the new title ''Flashpoint'', based on the [[Flashpoint (comics)|comic book of the same title]], in which Allen travels back in time to save his mother's life and accidentally creates an alternate time line.<ref name="FlashpointFreshStart" /> Dan Mazeau contributed to the script during this time.<ref name="MazeauScripts" /> Johns confirmed in November that the ''Flashpoint'' concept would allow the film to tell a unique story about [[Batman]], with the comic book storyline exploring a time line where [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Thomas Wayne]] is Batman;<ref name="ThomasWayneBatman" /> [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] expressed interest in reprising his role as Thomas Wayne from ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name="DeanMorganBatman" /> In January 2018, the filmmaking duo [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] entered negotiations to write and direct the film after the studio chose not to wait for Zemeckis's schedule to be free.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinTalks" /> Daley and Goldstein's [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] included depicting the Flash as a grounded imperfect superhero who is just learning his powers.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinMar2023" /> The duo were confirmed as directors in March,<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinDirect" /> and the film's title reverted to ''The Flash'' the next month.<ref name="MazeauScripts" /> Filming was expected to begin in [[Atlanta]] in February 2019,<ref name="Feb2019Filming" /><ref name="Feb2019AtlantaFilming" /> but Ezra Miller's commitments to ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore]]'' (2022) delayed filming again.<ref name="2021Release" /> ''The Flash'' was aiming for a 2021 release at that point.<ref name="2021Release" />

In mid-March 2019, Ezra Miller was revealed to be writing a new version of the film's script with comic book writer [[Grant Morrison]]. They disagreed with the lighthearted approach to the film that Daley and Goldstein were taking, though that was Warner Bros.' preferred direction for it. The new script could be submitted to the studio by the end of the month, and if the studio did not like Miller and Morrison's take, there was potential for the actor to leave the film; Miller's holding deal to star in the film was expected to end in May.<ref name="MillerMorrisonScript" /><ref name="MillerScreenwriterNewby" /> Morrison later said that Miller had not been happy with the prior scripts and approached Morrison with their ideas, and the pair were given two weeks by Warner Bros. to write the script in Scotland. Morrison described their script as "a Flash story",<ref name="MorrisonJun2022" /> which they felt was a more science-fiction story similar to ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985),<ref name="MorrisonAug2020" /> but said that the studio wanted to explore the multiverse and other DC characters with the film instead.<ref name="MorrisonJun2022" /> Morrison also denied reports that Miller wanted the film to have a dark tone and said their script had dark aspects related to the ''Flashpoint'' story.<ref name="MorrisonAug2020" /> The studio rejected Miller and Morrison's script in May but asked Miller to remain as star of the film.<ref name="MuschiettiDirect" /> Daley and Goldstein left the project in June, due to creative differences, and they chose to work on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves]]'' (2023) instead.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinMar2023" /> Daley and Goldstein's exit was confirmed in July, when Warner Bros. chose [[Christina Hodson]] to write a new screenplay for the film after writing its DC film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). [[Andy Muschietti]] entered negotiations to direct ''The Flash'', with his sister [[Barbara Muschietti|Barbara]] set to produce alongside Michael Disco. A January 2020 pre-production start was expected.<ref name="MuschiettiDirect" /> The involvement of Andy Muschietti and Hodson was confirmed in November 2019, and filming was expected to begin in 2021 after Miller finished filming ''The Secrets of Dumbledore''.<ref name="2021Filming" /> Around this time, as the screenplay kept being developed, Miller was approached apparently by [[Jim Lee]] to appear in the Arrowverse's "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event in a last minute addition during editing, who immediately agreed due to understanding the Flash's importance and role in the multiverse; Marc Guggenheim wrote the scene, though much of the scene was improvised on set by the actors, including the origins of the Flash's superhero name.<ref name="THRFanDome" /> The scene materialized thanks to the efforts of Lee and DC Entertainment's film Vice President Adam Schlagman, who ensured Guggenheim's scripts didn't conflict with ''The Flash'' film.<ref name="GuggenheimEWJan2020" /> When asked if the special implied Miller's Flash still existed or not, Guggenheim that was something for Warner Bros. to address.<ref name="GuggenheimVarietyJan2020" /> A month later, Warner Bros. scheduled ''The Flash'' for release on July 1, 2022.<ref name="July2022Date" />

=== Pre-production ===
[[File:Andrés Muschietti.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Andy Muschietti, the director of ''The Flash'']]
Andy Muschietti said in January 2020 that the film would still adapt elements of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' comic book storyline but that it would be telling a different version of that story.<ref name="FlashpointMuschietti" /> Muschietti explained that the studio wanted the film to adapt that storyline, saying this allowed them to incorporate its [[time travel]] elements with the Flash's [[origin story]] (in which his mother is killed and his father is wrongfully convicted for her murder) and to use the Batman character. He added that ''The Flash'' was similar to a [[suspense film]] compared to that comic, which he likened to the film ''[[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'' (1990), because of its build up and that the character's prior DCEU appearances provided the audience with more of an understanding and allowed for a more emotional experience.<ref name="FlashpointInspiration" /> In April 2020, the film's release was moved forward to June 3, 2022, when Warner Bros. shifted its schedule because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="June2022Date" /> That June, [[Michael Keaton]] entered early negotiations to reprise his role as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] from [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name="KeatonTalks" /> Fisher discussed his role as Cyborg in the film with Muschietti that month before Warner Bros. set a two-week shoot for Fisher to film what was referred to as a cameo appearance alongside other Justice League actors. Fisher said the studio only offered to pay him a fraction of his traditional salary for reprising the role.<ref name="FisherSpeaks" /><ref name="FisherApproached" /><ref name="FisherCameoOffer&March2021Filming" /> In August, Keaton was confirmed to be appearing in the film, and Affleck agreed to reprise his version of Batman. Muschietti explained that the film would be introducing the idea of the multiverse to general audiences by including multiple versions of characters and acknowledging past film franchises based on DC as alternate universes. It was important for Muschietti to include Affleck in the film since his version of Batman is the "baseline" for the DCEU, and he felt the introduction of Keaton's Batman would not work as well without first seeing the Flash's relationship with Affleck's Batman. Affleck chose to return, after saying he had retired from the character, because he would have a smaller role in the film.<ref name="BatmanVanityFair" />

During the virtual [[DC FanDome]] event "Explore the Multiverse" in September 2020, Barbara Muschietti said the film would feature many characters from the [[DC Universe]] and the Flash would serve as the bridge between them and their different time lines. She added that the film would be used to restart the continuity of the DCEU without disregarding the events of the prior films.<ref name="DCEURestart&Characters" /> Crudup, who left the film during the changes in directors, entered negotiations to rejoin the project a month later. Clemons's involvement was uncertain at that point.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /> The film's release was pushed back to November 4, 2022, due to further pandemic-related delays,<ref name="Nov2022Date" /> and filming was set to begin in March 2021 in London.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /><ref name="FisherCameoOffer&March2021Filming" /> Warner Bros. had written Cyborg out of the film by January 2021 after Fisher refused to work on any project that DC Films president [[Walter Hamada]] was involved in. Fisher said this was due to Hamada's handling of an investigation into the on-set behavior of ''Justice League''{{'s}} replacement director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name="FisherSpeaks" /><ref name="NoFisherCyborg" /> The role of Cyborg was not expected to be recast.<ref name="NoFisherCyborg" /> Andy and Barbara Muschietti arrived in the United Kingdom to prepare for production,<ref name="MuschiettisFilming" /> with filming set to begin in April at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], after Ezra Miller finished on ''The Secrets of Dumbledore''.<ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /><ref name="MuschiettisFilming" /> In February, construction for sets at Leavesden Studios had begun,<ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /><ref name="BarbaraMuschiettiFeb2021" /> Crudup was confirmed to be returning,<ref name="CalleSupergirl2" /> and [[Sasha Calle]] was cast as [[Supergirl]].<ref name="CalleSupergirl" /><ref name="CalleSupergirl2" /> Calle was chosen from a group of more than 425 actresses that also included [[Bruna Marquezine]] and [[Rachel Zegler]].<ref name="CalleSupergirl" /><ref name="MarquezineSupergirl" /><ref name="ZeglerSupergirl" /> All auditions for the role, as well as chemistry tests with Ezra Miller, took place over [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]].<ref name="CalleSupergirl" />

In March 2021, Clemons signed a new deal to star as Iris West in the film after her role in ''Justice League'' was cut (though the cameo was restored in the 2021 director's cut, ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'').<ref name="ClemonsRejoin" /> [[Maribel Verdú]] was cast to portray Barry Allen's mother, [[Nora Allen]], but Crudup was forced to drop out of the film because of scheduling conflicts with his series ''[[The Morning Show (American TV series)|The Morning Show]]''. The role of Henry Allen was expected to be recast.<ref name="Verdu" /> At the end of March, Keaton said he had received an older version of the script but had not yet read it and would have to read the latest draft before deciding if he could commit to the film. He also cited the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]] as a concern for his involvement, as well as balancing his other commitments.<ref name="KeatonMarch2021" /> Shortly after, [[Ron Livingston]] was cast to replace Crudup as Henry Allen, with Ian Loh cast as a young Barry Allen and [[Saoirse-Monica Jackson]] and [[Rudy Mancuso]] joining in undisclosed roles.<ref name="Livingston" /> Before filming began, Keaton was confirmed to be starring in the film,<ref name="KeatonYes" /> with Andy Muschietti believing Keaton's decision to join ''The Flash'' was due to the script that he had been sent. Muschietti said Keaton felt honored to play Batman again.<ref name="WhatConvincedKeaton" /> The Muschiettis formed a production company, Double Dream, to co-produce the film, and Marianne Jenkins was revealed as an executive producer.<ref name="MuschiettisStudio" /> Fisher said it would be a "bummer" if the situation surrounding his involvement in the film were not resolved,<ref name="FisherApril2021" /> and said he would return to the role of Cyborg for the film if Warner Bros. were to make amends with him.<ref name="FisherPossibleApril2021" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began on April 19, 2021,<ref name="FilmingStart" /> at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], in Watford, England,<ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /><ref name="BarbaraMuschiettiFeb2021" /> under the [[working title]] ''Baby Shower''.<ref name="WorkingTitle" /> [[Henry Braham]] served as cinematographer after previously working on DC's ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' (2021).<ref name="Braham" /> In early May, filming took place at [[Burghley House]] in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], which doubled for [[Wayne Manor]].<ref name="BurghleyHouseFilming" /> In mid-June, Ezra Miller, Clemons, Keaton, and Calle filmed scenes at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London, with the surrounding locations designed to portray [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]].<ref name="StPaulsCathedral" /> Filming was also set to occur later that month in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]]—doubling for [[Gotham City]]—for scenes with Affleck and Keaton.<ref name="EdinburghGlasgow" /><ref name="EdinburghGlasgow2" /> In late July, filming continued in Glasgow at [[Ingram Street]], [[George Square]], John Street, and Cochrane Street and involved several vehicles, while filming with the [[Batmobile]] occurred in George Square.<ref name="GlasgowJulyFilming" /> On July 29, filming was halted after a camera operator on a motorcycle shooting behind the [[Batcycle]] on Renfield Street collided with it near West George Street. The operator was injured but not "seriously hurt".<ref name="GlasgowFilmingAccident" /><ref name="VarietyFilmingAccident" /> In August, Braham said the film was "technically complex" despite not being based in reality and called the concept of featuring the different generations of comic books in it fantastic.<ref name="Braham" /> In early September, [[Luke Brandon Field]] said he had joined the cast.<ref name="Field" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 18, 2021.<ref name="FilmingWrap" />

=== Post-production ===
In December 2021, [[Michael Shannon]] and [[Antje Traue]] were revealed to be reprising their roles from ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) as [[General Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]] and [[Faora-Ul]], respectively. Former co-directors of the film Daley and Goldstein were also confirmed to be receiving story credit for the film alongside Hodson.<ref name="FlashZodFaora" /> [[Temuera Morrison]], who portrays Aquaman's father, [[Thomas Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Thomas Curry]], in ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018) and ''[[Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom]]'' (2023),<ref name="MorrisonA2" /> was reported to be in the film in February 2022.<ref name="Morrison" /> In March, Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the workload of visual effects vendors. ''The Flash'' was moved to June 23, 2023, to provide more time for VFX work to be completed; ''The Flash'' had around 2,500 visual effects shots.<ref name="Mar2022ReleaseChanges" /> In April 2022, [[Discovery, Inc.]] and WarnerMedia merged to become [[Warner Bros. Discovery]] (WBD), led by president and CEO [[David Zaslav]]. The new company was expected to restructure [[DC Entertainment]] and Zaslav began searching for an equivalent to [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] to lead the new subsidiary.<ref name="ZaslavApr2022" /> Also in April, the final writing credits for ''The Flash'' were revealed: Hodson received screenplay credit; Daley, Goldstein, and Harold received screen story credit; and off-screen credit for additional writing material went to [[Rebecca Drysdale]], Famuyiwa, Grahame-Smith, Johns, Lord, Christopher Miller, Ezra Miller, Morrison, and [[Adam Sztykiel]].<ref name="WGAWritingCredits" /> In May, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that an unspecified "high-profile" comic book film that would be released in 2023 had its script recently submitted to the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA), having a total of 45 writers involved in it throughout its development.<ref name="Deadline45Writers" /> Some commentators believed that the film was ''The Flash'', due to its lengthy development process.<ref name="ScreenRant45Writers" /><ref name="CBR45Writers" /> Miller later participated in "regularly scheduled [[additional photography]]" in mid-2022.<ref name="THRDCFilmsReset" />

Following several [[Controversies surrounding Ezra Miller|controversial incidents and arrests involving Miller]] throughout 2022, WBD considered various options for the film after previously hoping delaying its release would help avoid controversy. In August, WBD was considering three options: providing Miller an interview explaining their behavior and do limited press for the film should they choose to accept professional help, being released as planned; exclude Miller from all press of the film and recast their character in future projects should they choose to reject professional help; or cancel the film as a "last resort" if the situation further deteriorated. The latter was considered an "unprecedented move" due to its large budget, though it would have come after WBD already canceled the nearly complete $90&nbsp;million film ''[[Batgirl (film)|Batgirl]]'' that was being produced for the streaming service [[HBO Max]]. WBD was not considering recasting Miller's role in the film due to them portraying multiple characters and appearing in nearly every scene. It was also considered to be "key" for the studio's future DCEU plans and had been received well during [[test screening]]s despite Miller's legal troubles.<ref name="THRMillerAug2022" /> Zaslav reiterating that ''The Flash'' received positive responses from the studio, and that they were committed to releasing it in theaters.<ref name="THRDCFilmsReset" /><ref name="THRMillerAug2022" /> Miller released a public apology through their representative soon afterward and announced they were seeking professional treatment for "complex mental health issues".<ref name="MillerTreatmentApology" /> Soon after, Miller and their agent met with [[Michael De Luca]] and [[Pamela Abdy]], the co-chairpersons and co-CEOs of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, to apologize for their behavior.<ref name="MillerWBMeeting" /> Barbara Muschietti later rejected reports that the film's release would have been canceled due to Miller's actions.<ref name="EWFilmSafe" /> At the end of August, the visual effects were expected to be completed by the end of the year,<ref name="MillerWBMeeting" /> and were provided by [[DNEG]], [[Scanline VFX]], and [[Wētā FX]]. John "DJ" Desjardin served as the VFX supervisor after working on several DCEU films,<ref name="ArtOfVFX" /><ref name="Desjardin" /> while [[Paul Machliss]] and [[Jason Ballantine]] co-edited the film;<ref name="MachlissTechnology" /><ref name="BallantineGarrick" /> Ballantine previously worked on Muschietti's films ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017) and ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' (2019).<ref name="Ballantine" /> Machliss later said the film was the first to use new technology to feature different versions of an actor on-screen.<ref name="MachlissTechnology" /> Muschietti's initial cut of the film was around four hours long.<ref name="MuschiettiCameosNerdist" />

The ending of the film, which features Miller's Barry believing he successfully altered the timeline before realizing it has been further altered, changed multiple times during post-production due to changes in leadership at Warner Bros. throughout 2022. The originally filmed ending featured Calle's Supergirl and Keaton's Batman, reversing those characters' deaths from earlier in the film, and was planned by Hamada and Warner Bros. Pictures chairman [[Toby Emmerich]] to set up a sequel and a film based on the "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" (1985–1986) crossover storyline that was intended to reset the DCEU. After WBD was formed, Hamada and Emmerich exited their roles and De Luca and Abdy were set to temporarily oversee its DC productions. An alternate ending was filmed in September 2022 and included Miller, Calle, and Keaton alongside [[Henry Cavill]] and [[Gal Gadot]] in their DCEU roles of [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Superman]] and [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Wonder Woman]]. Calle remained in this scene, despite a planned ''Supergirl'' film having been canceled at this time, because executives did not want that character's last appearance to be her death and were open to Calle reprising her role. Cavill's involvement came after he made a cameo appearance in the DCEU film ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'' (2022) and was intended to setup a [[Untitled Man of Steel sequel|planned ''Man of Steel'' sequel]], and Gadot's appearance was intended to "keep Wonder Woman in the cultural conversation" while a sequel to ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017) and ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' (2020) was in development.<ref name="THREnding" /> Keaton had also been slated to reprise his role in ''Batgirl'' before it was shelved.<ref name="THRJul2023" />

Filmmaker [[James Gunn]] and producer [[Peter Safran]], who had worked on prior DCEU media, were hired as the co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the newly formed [[DC Studios]] at the end of October 2022.<ref name="GunnSafran" /> A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new franchise called the [[DC Universe (franchise)|DC Universe]] (DCU) that would be a "[[reboot (fiction)|soft reboot]]" of the DCEU.<ref name="GunnSafranTownHall" /><ref name="DCUSlateTHR6Qs" /> In December, the film's release date was moved forward to June 16, 2023, following positive test screenings.<ref name="Jun2023ReleaseUp" /> Cavill's involvement was revealed then along with [[Jason Momoa]] having a cameo as [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Aquaman]].<ref name="THRCavillMomoaDec2022" /> At that time, Gunn and Safran felt that including Cavill and Gadot's scenes in the ending could potentially promise audiences something that was not part of their future plans. WBD was also reconsidering retaining their scenes depending on those plans, which had not yet been finalized since ''The Flash'' did not yet achieve a [[picture lock]].<ref name="THRCavillMomoaDec2022" /><ref name="NoCavillGadot" /><ref name="THREnding" /> Cavill and Gadot's cameos in the ending were ultimately cut after DC Studios chose not to move forward with the sequels to ''Man of Steel'' and ''Wonder Woman 1984''. Cavill was paid $250,000 for his cameo,<ref name="NoCavillGadot" /> and his likeness was briefly used in the film through [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name="SupermanCGI" /> Gunn and Safran then arranged for [[George Clooney]] to reprise his role as another version of Batman from ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), replacing Affleck's version in the timeline, in a third version of the ending. This idea came after a recurring joke was made during production regarding how many versions of Batman could be included in the film. Clooney filmed his scenes with Miller for half a day in January 2023, in what was described as a "quick and efficient shoot". Clooney gave Miller advice on handling publicity and his behavior in-between takes, and Miller was said to have been in "top form". This ending with Clooney was kept a secret until the film's release.<ref name="THREnding" /> In March, Affleck revealed that he had filmed a scene with Gadot,<ref name="AffleckTHRMar2023" /> who appeared in an in-progress cut of the film screened at [[CinemaCon]] the following month.<ref name="CinemaConScreeningDeadline" />

Later in April 2023, Muschietti revealed some of the planned cameos that did not make the final film, including [[Lynda Carter]]'s Wonder Woman from the television series ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' (1975–1979), [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[Jor-El]] from ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), [[Burgess Meredith]]'s [[the Penguin]] and [[Cesar Romero]]'s [[the Joker]] from the series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (1966–1968), and [[Grant Gustin]]'s [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] from the Arrowverse continuity (2013–2023).<ref name="MuschiettiCameosNerdist" /> Gustin was not approached to appear in the film,<ref name="GustinNeverApproached" /> although another version of the Flash, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], does appear in the film's "Chronobowl" Speed Force sequence, with the character's likeness based on Ballantine.<ref name="BallantineGarrick" /><ref name="FlashGarrick" /> Multiple other cameos are featured in the film as part of the "Chronobowl" sequence. [[Nicolas Cage]] portrays an alternate version of Superman, who he was cast as in 1997 for Tim Burton's unproduced film ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]''. Cage filmed his scenes through [[volumetric capture]] and was [[De-aging in motion pictures|digitally de-aged]] for the role, which paid homage to a scene that producer [[Jon Peters]] wanted to include in Burton's film.<ref name="Cage" /><ref name="CageCGI" /> Cage originally filmed a different scene of his character standing in an alternate universe while witnessing its destruction. For that scene, Cage said that he conveyed the character's emotions in his eyes with no dialogue.<ref name="CageExplainsCameo" /> Previous incarnations of Superman, Batman, and Supergirl also appear in the sequence through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[deepfake]] technology, including [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Superman (1978 film series character)|Superman]] from the [[Superman (1978 film series)|1978–1987 ''Superman'' films]], [[Helen Slater]] as [[Supergirl (1984 film character)|Supergirl]] from ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' (1984), [[Adam West]] as Batman from the film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966) and the 1966 ''Batman'' series, and [[George Reeves]] as his version of Superman from ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'' (1951) and ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (1952–1958), through [[archive footage]].<ref name="FlashCameos" /> West's appearance was almost cut before Muschietti chose to retain it because he and Barbara felt personally attached to the series, which they watched [[rerun]]s of during their childhood in Argentina.<ref name="MuschiettiWestCameo" />

[[Benjamin Wallfisch]] was set to compose the film's score by April 2021 after previously working with Muschietti on ''It'' (2017) and ''It Chapter Two'' (2019). Wallfisch also previously wrote the score for DC's ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019).<ref name="Wallfisch" /> By late August 2022, Wallfisch was set to begin a scoring session at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.<ref name="MillerWBMeeting" /> Throughout the film, Wallfisch references [[Danny Elfman]]'s themes from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) due to [[Michael Keaton]]'s appearance in the film as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|his incarnation of Batman]].<ref name="BatmanTheme" /><ref name="BatmanTheme2" />

Miller debuted the first footage from the film at the virtual DC FanDome event in October 2021.<ref name="DCFanDome2021THR" /> They said there was not enough footage available to make a full trailer or teaser, but William Hughes at ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt the footage could comfortably be categorized as a teaser. He said being able to see it was proof of the film actually being made after its long and troubled production history.<ref name="DCFanDome2021AVClub" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'s}} Matt Patches and ''[[io9]]''{{'s}} James Whitbrook both highlighted the footage as the beginning of the DC multiverse on film, with its hints at Keaton's version of Batman and the reveal that Miller would portray multiple versions of Barry Allen.<ref name="DCFanDome2021Polygon" /><ref name="DCFanDome2021io9" /> In February 2022, more footage was released as part of a teaser for Warner Bros.' 2022 slate of DC films, which also included ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''Black Adam'' and ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'' (before ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'' were delayed to 2023).<ref name="Morrison" /><ref name="Mar2022ReleaseChanges" /> A new trailer was shown at Warner Bros.'

From September to November 2022, DC Comics published a three-issue prequel comic book limited series titled ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'', written by Kenny Porter with art by Ricardo López Ortiz, Juan Ferreyra, and [[Jason Howard]].<ref name="PrequelComic" /><ref name="PrequelComicIGN" /><ref name="PrequelComic2" /><ref name="PrequelComic3" /> It is set after the events of ''Justice League'' and depicts Batman training the Flash and the Flash's early days as he attempts to defeat the supervillains [[Girder (comics)|Girder]],<ref name="PrequelComic" /><ref name="PrequelComicIGN" /> [[Tar Pit (comics)|Tar Pit]],<ref name="PrequelComic2" /> and [[The Top (comics)|the Top]].<ref name="PrequelComic3" /> The first trailer for ''The Flash'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LVII]] on February 12, 2023, before playing in theaters ahead of ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]''.<ref name="SuperBowlTrailer" /><ref name="SuperBowlPromo" /> The trailer had the most engagement on social media, outpacing other trailers that were shown in the likes of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Rise of the Beasts]]'', with RelishMix reporting the trailer gained 97.4M views within a 24-hour period.<ref name="Trailer1Engagement" /> Many commentators highlighted Keaton's reprisal as Batman and Calle's role as Supergirl, and also noted the de-emphasized focus on Miller's Flash following their controversies. Charles Pulliam-Moore of ''[[The Verge]]'' particularly felt that "it's the other heroes they're [the Flash] going to be allying with who are likely to steal the show", and felt that Supergirl and Keaton's Batman were being posited as the film's "World's Finest", and expressed enthusiasm for Supergirl's role in the story.<ref name="VergeTrailer1" /> Alli Rosenbloom at [[CNN]] also praised Keaton's appearance, highlighting the usage of [[Danny Elfman]]'s score from ''Batman'', while ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]''{{'s}} Collier Jennings felt that trailer "certainly is working to sell the image that the wait was worth it".<ref name="CNNTrailer1" /><ref name="ColliderTrailer1" />

In April 2023, the [[Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products]] division and DC unveiled a series of merchandise to coincide with the release of the film, including toys produced by [[Mattel]], [[Funko]], [[Spin Master]], and [[McFarlane Toys]], costumes by Rubies and [[Puma (brand)|Puma]] shoes.<ref name="GizmodoMerchandise" /><ref name="WBDGlobalConsumerProducts" /> It was also announced that a visual companion would accompany the film's release, titled ''The Flash: The Official Visual Companion: The Scarlet Speedster from Page to Screen'', written by Richard Lotowcyz and published by Insight Editions.<ref name="WBDGlobalConsumerProducts" /> An in-progress cut of the film was screened at CinemaCon on April 25, 2023.<ref name="CinemaConScreeningTHR" /><ref name="CinemaConScreeningVariety" /> Executive officers had approximated that Warner Bros. had spent over $14&nbsp;million to promote the film via TV spots and trailers during the [[2023 NBA playoffs]].<ref name="THRMarketing" /> A second trailer and poster were released online the same day. Joshua Rivera at ''Polygon'' noted the trailer focused heavily on Keaton's Batman, including starting and ending with him, and felt it leaned into [[nostalgia]],<ref name="PolygonTrailer2" /> while David Crow of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' compared the trailer's tone and Batcave design to that of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005–2012).<ref name="DoGTrailer2" /> The final trailer was released on May 22, 2023, along with a new poster exclusive to the Chinese market. The trailer, set to [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]", confirmed the appearance of [[Jeremy Irons]], reprising his DCEU role as [[Alfred Pennyworth (DC Extended Universe)|Alfred Pennyworth]].<ref name="FinalTrailerIrons" /><ref name="FinalTrailerJoBlo" /> Shortly after the film's release, a six-part [[Apple Podcasts|Apple podcast]] titled ''The Flash: Escape the Midnight Circus'' was announced. [[Max Greenfield]] voices Barry Allen / Flash in the podcast, which takes place a few years after the film's ending. The podcast series was included with the film's physical home media release.<ref name="Podcast" /><ref name="Podcast2" />

Warner Bros. had difficulty marketing the film due to Miller's legal issues. Borys Kit and Aaron Couch of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that the studio focused on marketing the "film itself", rather than focusing on Miller; during press conferences, the studio opted to sideline Miller and pivoted towards Andy and Barbara Muschietti and Calle to promote the film. The studio also made intensive efforts to highlight Keaton's role as Batman to introduce nostalgia, though Kit and Couch felt the results were mixed, as they opined some felt it was derivative of ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021). Additionally, the studio provided advanced screenings to various figures, including [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Stephen King]], to improve discourse surrounding the film, while Zaslav and Gunn touted it as "among the greatest superhero movies of all time". Various insiders felt the marketing campaign was unconventional, who had felt Warner Bros. was setting very high expectations for the film.<ref name="THRMarketing" /> As such, Miller ultimately attended the film's premiere for photos only and would not be interviewed.<ref name="VarietyPremiereSecretSequel" />

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
''The Flash'' premiered on June 12, 2023, at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]],<ref name="VarietyPremiereSecretSequel" /> and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 16, 2023.<ref name="Jun2023ReleaseUp" /> The film was initially scheduled for release on March 23, 2018, when Warner Bros. first announced its slate of DCEU films,<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> before it was moved to March 16.<ref name="March2018Date" /> In July 2016, this release date was given to ''Tomb Raider'',<ref name="NoMarch2018Date" /> and ''The Flash'' was not given another release date until Muschietti's hiring in 2019, after which the film was slated for release on July 1, 2022.<ref name="July2022Date" /> It was then moved up to June 3,<ref name="June2022Date" /> before it was delayed to November 4, 2022, when Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name="Nov2022Date" /> The studio then delayed the release date to June 23, 2023, due the pandemic's impact on the workload of visual effects vendors,<ref name="Mar2022ReleaseChanges" /> before moving it forward a week to June 16 after positive test screenings.<ref name="Jun2023ReleaseUp" />

=== Home media ===
''The Flash'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] and on the [[non-fungible token]] (NFT) Eluvio [[blockchain]] by [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]] on July 18, 2023, making it one of the first feature films that had been recently released then to be made available in a blockchain.<ref name="DigitalRelease" /><ref name="NFT" /><ref name="NFT-2" /> This was followed by its release on the streaming service [[Max (streaming service)|Max]] on August 25, and on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on August 29, 2023.<ref name="DigitalRelease" />

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
''The Flash'' grossed $108.1&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and $163.2&nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $271.3&nbsp;million.<ref name="BOM" /><ref name="NUM" /> It was a <!--Do NOT REMOVE "box-office bomb" as, per MOS:ACCLAIMED, it is attributed to multiple high-quality, reliable sources in the body of the article.-->[[box-office bomb]],<ref name="Bomb" /><!--Do NOT REMOVE "box-office bomb" as, per MOS:ACCLAIMED, it is attributed to multiple high-quality, reliable sources in the body of the article.--> with projected losses for Warner Bros. to be as much as $200&nbsp;million.<ref name="DHNetProfit" /><ref name="LATWoes" /><ref name="USATodayBomb" /><ref name="BudgetBreakdown" />

In the United States and Canada, ''The Flash'' was released alongside ''[[Elemental (2023 film)|Elemental]]'' and ''[[The Blackening (film)|The Blackening]]'', and was initially projected to gross $68–85&nbsp;million from 4,234 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref name="VarietyBOP" /> It was also expected to gross $85–95&nbsp;million internationally, for a global opening of $155–165&nbsp;million.<ref name="DeadlineBOP" /> However, after making $24.1&nbsp;million on its first day (including from $9.7&nbsp;million Thursday night previews), weekend estimates were lowered to $60&nbsp;million.<ref name="DHDay1" /> It went on to have a $55&nbsp;million domestic opening, with an additional $75&nbsp;million from international markets, for a worldwide debut of $130&nbsp;million.<ref name="Opening" /><ref name="DHBadBO" /> In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film debuted atop the box office with £4.2&nbsp;million ($5.4&nbsp;million).<ref name="UKIrishBO" /> Several publications commented on its box office revenue, with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' calling it "snubbed" and ''[[/Film]]'' saying that the hype "proved to be hot air" following poor box-office returns. The poor box-office opening was attributed to various controversies surrounding Ezra Miller, mixed word-of-mouth, competition from ''[[Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse]]'', early hype being "unwarranted", the imminent DCU reboot, decline of the superhero movie genre (being labeled "superhero fatigue") and middling critical reviews.<ref name="THRBadBO" /><ref name="Bomb/Film" /> The film retained IMAX screens and other premium formats into the next weekend, which could have provided some padding from what was expected to be a steep box-office decline from its opening weekend.<ref name="IMAXScreen" /> In its second weekend, the film dropped 72% to $15.1&nbsp;million,<ref name="Week2Drop" /> the third-largest sophomore drop ever for a superhero film, behind ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' (2022) and ''[[Steel (1997 film)|Steel]]'' (1997).<ref name="BadDrop" /><ref name="DropGR" /> In its third weekend, the film dropped another 65% to $5.2&nbsp;million, losing 1,538 theaters and finishing in eighth place in the process.<ref name="Week3Drop" />

=== Critical response ===
''The Flash'' received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name="THRBadBO" /><ref name="MC" /><ref name="FlashNYT" /> Early reviews for the film generally praised the humor, action sequences, and the performances, but criticized the [[Three-act structure#Structure|third act]] and visual effects.<ref name="RTRoundup" /> On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 390 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Flash'' is funny, fittingly fast-paced, and overall ranks as one of the best DC movies in recent years."<ref name="RT" /> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 55 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref name="MC" /> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, tied with ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) as the lowest grade for a DCEU film, while [[PostTrak]] reported 77% of filmgoers gave it a positive score, with 59% saying they would definitely recommend it.<ref name="DHBadBO" />

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} David Fear identified the film as being the best in the DCEU, but cited the complicated production and Ezra Miller's legal controversies as detracting elements. Nevertheless, he acknowledged Miller's performance, and felt they could properly portray the two different Barrys well, but lamented "It is not what we'll talk about when we talk about Ezra Miller". He praised Keaton's and Calle's performances, feeling that Batman felt well into the narrative, while commenting the script was "primed for both nimbly quickening the action and slowing down enough to wink, nudge, and crack jokes". He expressed some criticism with the action sequences, comparing them to [[cutscene]]s, and the [[post-credits scene]], albeit noting they tend to be included in superhero films.<ref name="RSReview" /> Joshua Yehl of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the film a 7/10, praising Muschietti's direction and enjoyed its focus on Barry's "emotional journey". He enjoyed the film's logic and depiction of time-travel, crediting it for being original when depicting the "chrono bowl{{Sic}}" and the impact of friction, while adding it effectively implemented the Flash's origin story in the film. However, he disliked the inclusion of [[fan service]], the third act, and Supergirl's role in the film. Nevertheless, he praised Keaton and Affleck's performances as Batman, and also commended Calle's performance for doing "as much as she can given the thin nature of the role". Ultimately, he opined that it felt like a "love letter to the [[Snyderverse]]" and called it a "fitting [[swan song]]" for the DCEU.<ref name="IGNReview" /> [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a mostly positive albeit mixed review, appreciating its "relatively brisk" runtime and felt it was a comparatively better superhero film, enjoying the overall cast performances, saying the "overall vibe is upbeat", and praised Muschietti's direction and pacing. However, she criticized the beginning scene, as she did not enjoy the "creepy setup" of falling newborn babies and also couldn't ignore Miller's real-life controversies, and felt that the substantial presence of other characters had taken the film's focus away from establishing the Flash as an individual character.<ref name="NYTReview" />

From ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]'', Angelia Jade Bastién criticized the film for being too dependent upon previous DCEU elements and disliked that the film did not explore Barry's emotions following his mother's death, but instead used the event as a "springboard for uninspired multiverse plotting". She felt Miller's performance was acceptable and thought Calle's performance was limited by the script, but enjoyed Keaton's performance. Bastién disliked the visual aesthetic and use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], ultimately describing the film as "the cinematic equivalent of a snake eating its own tail" and "closing down of all the possibilities a multiverse is meant to represent".<ref name="VultureReview" /> David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised Miller's performance despite noting their legal troubles impacted the film's reception. He also enjoyed Calle's performance, calling her a "scene-stealer", and Keaton's "sadness" in portraying Batman. His biggest highlights was the opening sequence, feeling it strongly established the comedic tone, Hodson's writing and characterization of Barry as a "virginal nerd who has gone through college without managing to acquire much self-assurance, even after mastering his superpowers", and Muschietti's overall direction. However, he criticized the runtime and thought the final act was formulaic in terms of its depiction of CG-based action sequences and thought the nostalgic elements "often threatens to marginalize the central plotline" but still managed to "yield [[pathos]]" in the narrative.<ref name="THRreview" /> Reviewing the film for ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, summarizing his thoughts on the film as being "simultaneously thoughtful and clueless ... Like its sincere but often hapless hero, it keeps exceeding every expectation we might have for its competence only to instantly face-plant into the nearest wall". He felt that Miller's legal issues had undermined the film's comedy but credited Muschietti's direction and Hodson's writing for "taking its ideas and the pain of its characters seriously without devolving into glum, colorless machismo", enjoying how the film's science-fiction elements allowed it to provide a positive ending for the character while also noting other scientific and philosophical issues "raised elsewhere". However, he felt Miller's dual role was executed well and commended the accompanying visual effects, but he heavily criticized the use of CGI to depict alternate realities in the Chronobowl.<ref name="RogerEbert.comReview" />

The film's use of digital imagery to recreate the likenesses of deceased actors was criticized, with commentators questioning the ethics behind them;<ref name="IGNEthics" /> Andy Muschietti said the crew were given "total freedom" with these cameos.<ref name="CameoFreedom" /> Jack King from ''[[GQ]]'' expressed concerns that the use of actors such as [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Adam West]] was "the next step in the normalisation of a queasy, questionable trend in Hollywood, one in which actors are brought back from the grave using new computer techniques".<ref name="GQEthics" /> [[Tim Burton]], who directed the ''Batman'' films starring Keaton, expressed his distaste for Warner Bros. "misappropriat[ing]" his version of Batman and the film's reference to his unproduced film ''Superman Lives''.<ref name="BurtonMisappropriate" />

=== Accolades ===
''The Flash'' was nominated for Best Teaser at the 2022 [[Golden Trailer Awards]].<ref name="GoldenTrailerAwardsNom" /><ref name="GoldenTrailerAwardsWon" /> At the [[51st Saturn Awards]], it received nominations for [[Saturn Award for Best Comic-to-Film Motion Picture|Best Superhero Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor in a Film]] (Keaton).<ref name="SaturnAwardsNoms" /><ref name="SaturnAwardsWins" /> ''The Flash'' was nominated for and won the Emerging Technology Award at the [[22nd Visual Effects Society Awards]] for the development of "Volumetric Capture".<ref name="VESWin" /> Verdú won Best Female Performance in an International Production at the [[32nd Actors and Actresses Union Awards]].<ref name="SpanishActorsUnionAwards" />

== Future ==
By October 2022, a script for a sequel had been written by [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]], who wrote the ''Aquaman'' films, in the event ''The Flash'' performed well.<ref name="SequelScriptOct2022" /> The script reportedly included Keaton's Batman and Calle's Supergirl.<ref name="VarietyPremiereSecretSequel" /> Warner Bros. was not expected to retain Miller for future films because of the actor's controversies and legal issues,<ref name="THRMillerAug2022" /> although some Warner Bros. executives were open to continuing with Miller by January 2023, since they began treatment.<ref name="MillerWBJan2023" /> Later that month, DC Studios co-CEOs [[James Gunn]] and [[Peter Safran]] said there was potential for Miller to reprise their role in the new franchise, the [[DC Universe (franchise)|DC Universe]] (DCU), but a decision on the character had not been made.<ref name="DCUSlateGizmodo" /> Gunn confirmed that ''The Flash'' would reset the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the DCEU and, alongside ''[[Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom]]'', would lead into the DCU's first film, ''[[Superman (2025 film)|Superman]]'' (2025).<ref name="DCUSlateGizmodo" />

Andy Muschietti said in May 2023 that if he and Barbara were involved with a sequel, they would intend to have Miller return because they were the duo's preferred actor to portray the character.<ref name="MuschiettiMillerJun2023" /> Muschietti also expressed interest in featuring [[Eobard Thawne|Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash]] as an antagonist for a sequel after the character was responsible for Nora Allen's death in the film.<ref name="ReverseFlash" /> Ahead of ''The Flash''{{'s}} release the next month, a sequel was reported to be "on the table" with the potential for it to be [[greenlit]] being dependent on the film's box-office performance. ''[[TheWrap]]'' reported that ''The Flash'' needed to earn around the box-office gross of DC's ''The Batman'' ($770&nbsp;million) for a sequel to move forward.<ref name="FlashSequelProspects" /> The poor box-office performance of ''The Flash'' led many commentators to question the prospects of a sequel being made with some saying it was unlikely to happen,<ref name="LATWoes" /><ref name="USATodayBomb" /><ref name="BudgetBreakdown" /> and in October 2023, ''Variety'' reported that no actors from [[Zack Snyder]]'s DCEU films, including Miller, would reprise their roles in the DCU.<ref name="MillerNoReturn" />
