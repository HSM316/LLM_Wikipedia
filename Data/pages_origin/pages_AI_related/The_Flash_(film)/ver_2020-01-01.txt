==Cast==
* [[Ezra Miller]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / The Flash]]:
:A [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] police forensic investigator who can move at superhuman speeds and vibrate at a molecular level, through his abilities to access the [[Speed Force]]. On how his portrayal of The Flash would differ from that of [[Grant Gustin]]'s in [[The CW]]'s [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|TV series]], Miller explained, "Well, [first] it's going to be a movie [...] I'd like for it to be an exploration of a human being, a multi-dimensional human being, to speak." He added, "I'd like the character to have many dimensions. But really, I’d like him to have the usual dimensions we know and love, and then some extra ones that are part of the amazing consideration of this superhero. I hope to realize him as a person, and I think what's most exciting for me in superhero mythologies is when we feel the humanity of someone who is heroic — or the heroism of someone who is a flawed, deeply human person."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/13/ezra-miller-flash-justice-league | title=Ezra Miller on how his The Flash will differ from The CW's version | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=November 16, 2015 | accessdate=November 18, 2015 | first=James | last=Hibberd | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118064432/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/13/ezra-miller-flash-justice-league | archive-date=November 18, 2015 | url-status=live| df= }}</ref>
