'''''The Flash''''' is an upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. It is intended to be the twelfth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). The film will be directed by [[Andy Muschietti]] from a screenplay written by [[Christina Hodson]]. It will star [[Ezra Miller]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / The Flash]], with<!-- [[Kiersey Clemons]], [[Billy Crudup]],--> [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Michael Keaton]] in supporting roles. It is the fourth [[live-action]] theatrical film featuring the character, following ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016) and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), and will be the first full-length feature film centered around the character. In ''The Flash'', Allen traverses back in time to prevent his mother's murder and deals with the consequences of it.

Development on a film for the Flash began in the late 1980s, with a modern interpretation beginning in 2004. Multiple directors and writers became attached to the project from then through 2014, by when it was being developed for the DCEU, with Miller cast in the [[title role]]. [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] and [[Rick Famuyiwa]] were attached to direct at different points between 2015 and 2016 before dropping out, with the duo [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] developing the film from 2018 until their departure in March 2019; each left over creative differences. That July, Muschietti joined to direct with Hodson writing the script, which was intended to draw elements from the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline. Multiple actors were initially set to appear in the film, with casting under Muschietti's direction beginning in July 2020. Filming is expected to begin in April 2021 in London.

''The Flash'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 4, 2022.

<!--* [[Kiersey Clemons]] as [[Iris West]]: A journalist for the ''Picture News'' and love interest of Barry Allen.<ref name="ClemonsConfirmed" />

The interaction and relationship between Barry and Affleck's Wayne will bring an emotional level that we haven't seen before," He added. "It's Barry's movie, it's Barry's story, but their characters are more related than we think. They both lost their mothers to murder, and that's one of the emotional vessels of the movie. That's where the Affleck Batman kicks in."<ref name="BatmanVanityFair" />

== Production ==
=== Background ===
[[Warner Bros.]] hired comic book writer [[Jeph Loeb]] to write a screenplay for the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in the late 1980s, but the outing never materialized.<ref name="LoebScript" /> Development for a film adaptation was revived after the studio was impressed with [[David S. Goyer]]'s script for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), and he was offered his choice of a Flash or [[Green Lantern]] film adaptation.<ref name="GoyerChoice" /> In December 2004, it was announced that Goyer would be writing, producing and directing ''The Flash''.<ref name="GoyerHelm" /> He approached actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] for the role of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] after previously working together on ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004),<ref name="GoyerChoice" /> with the intention of also using [[Wally West]] as a supporting character.<ref name="GoyerBooted" /> Goyer's script, which he tonally compared to [[Sam Raimi]]'s work on the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]],<ref name="GoyerChoice" /> was influenced by seminal comic book runs by [[Mike Baron]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Geoff Johns]]. By 2007, however, Goyer dropped out of the project, citing creative differences with the studio.<ref name="GoyerBooted" />

With the financial success of ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (2006), Warner Bros. hired [[Shawn Levy]] to direct ''The Flash'' in February 2007. Levy would oversee the writing of a new draft, using elements of Goyer's script.<ref name="LevyHelm" /> Levy instead went to work on ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' (2009), and was replaced by [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] in October 2007. Dobkin developed ''The Flash'' as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Justice League Mortal'', focusing on the Wally West character.<ref name="DobkinDirect" /> [[Craig Wright (playwright)|Craig Wright]] was hired to write the script the next month,<ref name="WrightScript" /> and, after the collapse of ''Justice League Mortal'', Warner Bros. placed ''The Flash'' for a 2008 release date.<ref name="2008Release" /> The project became delayed by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name="WGAStrikeDelay" /> Warner Bros. then hired [[Charles Roven]] to produce ''The Flash'', with comic book writer [[Geoff Johns]] serving as a consult and co-writer. Johns created a new [[film treatment]], which was screenwriten by [[Dan Mazeau]].<ref name="RovenJohns" /> In an October 2009 interview, Roven stated that Warner Bros. was not confident enough in their take to greenlight the film. Mazeau disputed Roven's statement and said that the film was moving forward as planned.<ref name="RovenMazeauTalks" />

In June 2010, ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' (2011) writers [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]] and [[Marc Guggenheim]] were hired to pen a treatment for the film. The script was based on a recent comics run by Geoff Johns and used the Barry Allen incarnation of the character.<ref name="GLFlashWriters" /> In July 2013, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that the film was tentatively planned to be released in 2016.<ref name="2016Release" /> 

=== Development ===
In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced ''The Flash'' would be released on March 23, 2018, as the sixth installment of the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU), with [[Ezra Miller]] cast as Barry Allen.<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> By April 2015, [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] were writing a story treatment for the film.<ref name="LordMiller" /> In October 2015, [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] was in negotiations to direct and write the script, based off the treatment by Lord and Miller.<ref name="Grahame-SmithHelm" /> He departed the project due to creative differences in April 2016, however, Warner Bros. retained his script.<ref name="Grahame-SmithOut" />

By June 2016, Warner Bros. hired [[Rick Famuyiwa]] to take over the directing duties.<ref name="FamuyiwaDirect" /> In September 2016, Famuyiwa revealed that he had finished a revision of the script, and teased the possibility of [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]]'s [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] appearing.<ref name="FamuyiwaCyborg" /> A month later, he left the project, citing creative differences with the studio.<ref name="FamuyiwaOut" /> In January 2017, [[Joby Harold]] was hired to do a page-one rewrite of the script.<ref name="HaroldRewrite" /> By that May, [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Matthew Vaughn]] were shortlisted for the director's job,<ref name="ZemeckisVaughnShortlist" /> while [[Sam Raimi]] and [[Marc Webb]] turned down offers.<ref name="RaimiWebbOffers" /> At the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July, it was announced that the film was retitled ''Flashpoint'', based on the [[Flashpoint (comics)|comic book of the same title]].<ref name="FlashpointFreshStart" /> During this time, Dan Mazeau contributed to the script.<ref name="MazeauScripts" /> In September, Geoff Johns said the story of [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Thomas Wayne's Batman]] would be a key element in the plot;<ref name="ThomasWayneBatman" /> [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] expressed interest in reprising the role of Wayne from ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016).<ref name="DeanMorganBatman" /> In January 2018, the filmmaking duo [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] entered negotiations to write and direct. The studio had discussions with [[Ben Affleck]] to act as director, after Zemeckis could not free up his schedule, but Affleck passed on the opportunity.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinTalks" /><ref name="AffleckPass" /> Daley and Goldstein were confirmed as directors in March 2018.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinDirect" /> By April 2018, the ''Flashpoint'' concept had been dropped.<ref name="MazeauScripts" />

In March 2019, following creative differences with Daley and Goldstein's script, Miller teamed with [[Grant Morrison]] to write a new screenplay.<ref name="MillerMorrisonScript" /> By that July, Daley and Goldstein had left the project; [[Andy Muschietti]] and [[Christina Hodson]] entered negotiations to direct and write a new draft of the script, respectively. [[Barbara Muschietti]] additionally joined Michael Disco as the film's producers.<ref name="MuschiettiDirect" /> In November 2019, filming was expected to begin in 2021.<ref name="2021Filming" /> In January 2020, Andy Muschietti said the film would include elements from the ''Flashpoint'' comic book storyline,<ref name="FlashpointMuschietti" /> and that June, filming was set to start in the beginning of the following year.<ref name="KeatonTalks" /> By that September, Barbara Muschietti stated during the virtual [[DC FanDome]] event that the film would feature many characters from the [[DC Universe]] with the Flash serving as "the bridge between all of these characters and timelines" that are featured in it, which would be used to restart the continuity of the DCEU without disregarding what came prior.<ref name="DCEURestart&Characters" />

=== Casting ===
On October 15, 2014, it was announced that [[Ezra Miller]] would play the title role in the Flash solo film and in ''Justice League''.<ref name="MillerFlash" /> In July 2016, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Kiersey Clemons]] was Famuyiwa's top choice for the film's female lead role,<ref name="ClemonsTopChoice" /> while ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Borys Kit revealed that [[Rita Ora]] and [[Lucy Boynton]] were also among the list of top-runner actresses.<ref name="OraBoynton" /> Clemons was eventually confirmed to star as the female lead, [[Iris West]].<ref name="ClemonsConfirmed" /> In August, [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]] was confirmed to appear as [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone / Cyborg]] in the film.<ref name="FisherCyborg" /> In September, [[Billy Crudup]] was in negotiations to portray Barry's father [[Henry Allen (comics)|Henry Allen]] in the film.<ref name="CrudupCast" /> In September 2017, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that [[Gal Gadot]] will reprise her role as [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]].<ref name="GadotCast" />

In June 2020, [[Michael Keaton]] was in early talks to reprise his role as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] from [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) as an alternate universe version of [[Batman]] for the film,<ref name="KeatonTalks" /> and the following month, Fisher had been approached to reprise his role in the film along with the actors for other members of the [[Justice League]],<ref name="FisherApproached" /> in a cameo appearance.<ref name="FisherCameoOffer&March2021Filming" /> In August, Keaton was confirmed to appear, with Ben Affleck also reprising his version of [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] from the DCEU.<ref name="BatmanVanityFair" /> In October, Crudup entered early negotiations to re-join the project under a new deal with Warner Bros. after he had left the production due to the shifts in the writers and directors, while the involvement of Clemons was uncertain.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" />
