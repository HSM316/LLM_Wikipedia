'''''The Flash''''' is an upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Flash (Barry Allen)|of the same name]]. Produced by [[DC Films]], Double Dream, and The Disco Factory, and set for distribution by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is intended to be the twelfth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). The film is directed by [[Andy Muschietti]] from a screenplay by [[Christina Hodson]] and stars [[Ezra Miller]] as [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen / The Flash]] alongside [[Ron Livingston]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Kiersey Clemons]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Antje Traue]], [[Sasha Calle]], and [[Ben Affleck]]. In ''The Flash'', Allen travels back in time to prevent his mother's murder which brings unintended consequences.

Development of a film based on the Flash began by 2004, with multiple writers and directors attached to the project through 2014. The film was then redeveloped as a part of the DCEU, with Miller cast as the title character. Multiple directors were attached to the film over the following years, with [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], [[Rick Famuyiwa]], and the duo of [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] each departing the project due to creative differences. Muschietti and Hodson joined the film in July 2019, and pre-production began in January 2020. The film is influenced by the comic book storyline ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', featuring multiple DC Comics characters including Affleck and Keaton as different versions of [[Batman]]. Filming began in April 2021 at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], in England, and wrapped in October 2021.

''The Flash'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 4, 2022.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
==== Early attempts ====
Development of a film based on the [[DC Comics]] character the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] began in the late 1980s when [[Warner Bros.]] hired comic book writer [[Jeph Loeb]] to write a screenplay. That version of the film did not materialize,<ref name="LoebScript" /> and Warner Bros. hired [[David S. Goyer]] to write, direct, and produce ''The Flash'' in December 2004 after he impressed them with his script for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).<ref name="GoyerHelm" /><ref name="GoyerChoice" /> Goyer approached [[Ryan Reynolds]] to portray [[Wally West|Wally West / The Flash]] after working with him on the [[Marvel Comics]]-based film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004), and intended to have the character [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] appear in a supporting role. Goyer was influenced for the film's tone by [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] and the Flash comic book runs by [[Mike Baron]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Geoff Johns]]. By early February 2007, Goyer left the project due to creative differences with the studio,<ref name="GoyerChoice" /><ref name="GoyerBooted" /> and [[Shawn Levy]] was hired to direct and oversee the writing of a new draft written by [[Chris Brancato]], which used elements from Goyer's script.<ref name="LevyHelm" /><ref name="Brancato" /> Later that month, Warner Bros. announced the development of a [[Justice League]] film with Michelle and [[Kieran Mulroney]] writing the screenplay.<ref name="JusticeLeague" /> That September, [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] signed on to direct the film, entitled ''[[Justice League: Mortal]]'',<ref name="GeorgeMiller" /> with [[Adam Brody]] cast as the Flash.<ref name="AdamBrody" /> The film was envisioned as the start of a new franchise centered on DC Comics characters, with planned sequels and spin-offs including the Flash film.<ref name="GeorgeMiller" />

Levy left ''The Flash'' in October 2007 due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' (2009). [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] took over as director and began developing the film as a spin-off from ''Justice League: Mortal'' with a focus on Wally West.<ref name="DobkinDirect" /> [[Craig Wright (playwright)|Craig Wright]] was writing a script for the film the next month,<ref name="WrightScript" /> before ''Justice League: Mortal'' was canceled and Warner Bros. set a 2008 release for ''The Flash''.<ref name="2008Release" /> Further development was delayed due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name="WGAStrikeDelay" /> [[Charles Roven]] joined the project as a producer by July 2009, with Geoff Johns consulting and writing a [[film treatment]] that [[Dan Mazeau]] adapted into a screenplay.<ref name="RovenJohns" /> In October, Roven said the studio was not confident enough in their take to greenlight the film, though Mazeau disputed this and said the film was moving forward as planned.<ref name="RovenMazeauTalks" /> In June 2010, ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' (2011) writers [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and [[Marc Guggenheim]] were hired to write a new treatment for ''The Flash'' based on a recent comics run by Johns that featured Barry Allen.<ref name="GLFlashWriters" />

==== DC Extended Universe ====
Warner Bros. was planning a new [[shared universe]] of films based on DC Comics by July 2013, and had tentative plans to release a ''Flash'' film in 2016.<ref name="2016Release" /> In October 2014, Warner Bros. and [[DC Films]] announced a slate of planned projects as part of the new [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). ''The Flash'' was set for release on March 23, 2018,<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> with [[Ezra Miller]] set to star in the film in the role of [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen / The Flash]];<ref name="MillerFlash" /><ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> Miller first made [[cameo appearance]]s as the character in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016),<ref name="MillerFlashBvS" /><ref name="MillerFlashSS" /> starred in the team-up film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017),<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> and briefly appeared in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover event "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" (2019–20) which acknowledged a wider [[DC Multiverse]].<ref name="KeatonTalks" /> Warner Bros. offered [[James Wan]] the choice of directing a movie about either [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Aquaman]] or the Flash, and he ultimately chose to make ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018).<ref name="Wan" /> By April 2015, [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] were writing a story treatment for the ''Flash'' film with the possibility of directing it.<ref name="LordMiller" /> After they decided to direct ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018) instead, [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] entered negotiations to write and direct the film based on Lord and Miller's treatment in October 2015. Grahame-Smith was set to make his [[directorial debut]] with the film, with Roven producing, and [[Deborah Snyder|Deborah]] and [[Zack Snyder]] executive producing.<ref name="Grahame-SmithHelm" /> In February 2016, the film's release date was moved forward to March 16, 2018.<ref name="March2018Date" /> Grahame-Smith left the project that April, citing creative differences. Warner Bros. chose to retain his script,<ref name="Grahame-SmithOut" /> and he was still expected to be involved in the project moving forward, while Lord and Miller were also still involved as producers. A search for a replacement director began immediately.<ref name="Grahame-SmithOut2" />

[[Rick Famuyiwa]] was hired to take over as director in June 2016, with Warner Bros. feeling that Famuyiwa's vision for the film would both resonate with younger audiences and also be compatible with Grahame-Smith's existing script.<ref name="FamuyiwaDirect" /> Filming was expected to begin later in 2016 and was not believed to be delayed by the director change. Famuyiwa's top choice to portray the film's female lead, [[Iris West]], was [[Kiersey Clemons]] who he had worked with on ''[[Dope (2015 film)|Dope]]'' (2015).<ref name="ClemonsTopChoice" /> [[Rita Ora]] and [[Lucy Boynton]] were also in the running,<ref name="OraBoynton" /> but Clemons was cast in the role at the end of July.<ref name="ClemonsCast" /> At that time, Warner Bros. gave the film's release date to ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018), leaving ''The Flash'' without a release date.<ref name="NoMarch2018Date" /> In August, [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Victor Stone (DC Extended Universe)|Victor Stone / Cyborg]] from ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League''.<ref name="FisherCyborg" /> Famuyiwa completed a revision of the script a month later,<ref name="FamuyiwaRevision" /> when [[Gal Gadot]] was set to reprise her role as [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]] from ''Batman v Superman'', ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), and ''Justice League'',<ref name="GadotCast" /> and [[Billy Crudup]] was in negotiations to portray Barry's father [[Henry Allen (comics)|Henry Allen]].<ref name="CrudupCast" /> Clemons and Crudup both filmed cameo appearances for ''Justice League'' after being cast in ''The Flash''.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /><ref name="ClemonsJL" /> Pre-production began by October ahead of a filming start in March 2017, scheduled before another commitment that Miller had in July. At the end of October, Famuyiwa left the project after not being able to "come together creatively" with the studio, who disagreed with the more mature direction that Famuyiwa wanted to take the film.<ref name="FamuyiwaOut" />

The film was put on hold while the studio searched for a new director and Miller prepared to film ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]'' (2018). During that time, Warner Bros. decided to take the film in a new direction and in January 2017, [[Joby Harold]] was hired to do a page-one rewrite of the script.<ref name="HaroldRewrite" /> He handed in a draft by May, when the studio's top choices to direct were [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Matthew Vaughn]]. Both had expressed interest in the project, but had potential scheduling issues that could prevent them from taking it on.<ref name="ZemeckisVaughnShortlist" /> Sam Raimi, [[Marc Webb]], and [[Jordan Peele]] had already turned down offers to direct the film.<ref name="RaimiWebbOffers" /><ref name="PeeleDecline" /> At the July 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the film was announced with the new title ''Flashpoint'', based on the [[Flashpoint (comics)|comic book of the same title]] in which Allen travels back in time to save his mother's life and accidentally creates an alternate timeline.<ref name="FlashpointFreshStart" /> Dan Mazeau contributed to the script during this time.<ref name="MazeauScripts" /> Johns confirmed in November that the ''Flashpoint'' concept would allow the film to tell a unique story about [[Batman]], with the comic book storyline exploring a timeline where [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Thomas Wayne]] is Batman;<ref name="ThomasWayneBatman" /> [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] expressed interest in reprising his role as Thomas Wayne from ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name="DeanMorganBatman" />

In January 2018, the filmmaking duo [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] entered negotiations to write and direct the film. The studio had discussions with [[Ben Affleck]] to direct, but he passed on the project and the studio chose not to wait for Zemeckis's schedule to be free.<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinTalks" /><ref name="AffleckPass" /> Daley and Goldstein were confirmed as directors in March 2018,<ref name="DaleyGoldsteinDirect" /> and the film's title reverted to ''The Flash'' the next month.<ref name="MazeauScripts" /> Filming was expected to begin in February 2019, taking place in [[Atlanta]],<ref name="Feb2019Filming" /><ref name="Feb2019AtlantaFilming" /> but Miller's commitments to ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore]]'' (2022) delayed filming again.<ref name="2021Release" /> The film was aiming for a 2021 release at that point.<ref name="2021Release" /> In mid-March 2019, Miller was revealed to be writing a new version of the film's script with comic book writer [[Grant Morrison]]. Miller disagreed with the light-hearted approach to the film that Daley and Goldstein were taking, though that was Warner Bros.' preferred direction for the film. The new script could be submitted to the studio by the end of the month, and if the studio did not like Miller and Morrison's take there was potential for the actor to leave the film; Miller's holding deal to star in the film was expected to end in May.<ref name="MillerMorrisonScript" /><ref name="MillerScreenwriterNewby" /> The studio rejected Miller and Morrison's script in May, but asked Miller to remain as star on the film. Daley and Goldstein left the project in July, and Warner Bros. chose [[Christina Hodson]] to write a new screenplay for the film after writing their DC film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). [[Andy Muschietti]] entered negotiations to direct the film, with his sister [[Barbara Muschietti|Barbara]] set to produce alongside Michael Disco, and a January 2020 pre-production start expected.<ref name="MuschiettiDirect" /> The involvement of Andy Muschietti and Hodson was confirmed in November 2019, when filming was expected to begin in 2021 after Miller completed their commitments to the third ''Fantastic Beasts'' film.<ref name="2021Filming" /> A month later, Warner Bros. scheduled ''The Flash'' for release on July 1, 2022.<ref name="July2022Date" />

=== Pre-production ===
[[File:Andrés Muschietti.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Andy Muschietti, the director of ''The Flash'']]
Andy Muschietti said in January 2020 that the film would still adapt elements of the ''Flashpoint'' comic book storyline, but the film would be telling a different version of that story.<ref name="FlashpointMuschietti" /> In April, the film's release was moved forward to June 3, 2022, when Warner Bros. shifted their schedule due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="June2022Date" /> That June, [[Michael Keaton]] entered early negotiations to reprise his role as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] from [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name="KeatonTalks" /> Fisher discussed his role as Cyborg in the film with Muschietti that month, before Warner Bros. set a two-week shoot for Fisher to film what was referred to as a cameo appearance alongside other Justice League actors. Fisher said the studio only offered to pay him a fraction of his traditional salary for reprising the role.<ref name="FisherSpeaks" /><ref name="FisherApproached" /><ref name="FisherCameoOffer&March2021Filming" /> In August, Keaton was confirmed to be appearing in the film, and Ben Affleck agreed to reprise his version of [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] from previous DCEU films. Muschietti explained that the film would be introducing the idea of the multiverse to general audiences by including multiple versions of characters, and acknowledging past film franchises based on DC Comics as alternate universes from the DCEU. It was important for Muschietti to include Affleck in the film since his version of Batman is the "baseline" for the DCEU, and he felt the introduction of Keaton's Batman would not work as well without first seeing the Flash's relationship with Affleck's Batman. Affleck chose to return, after saying he had retired from the character, because he would have a smaller role in the film.<ref name="BatmanVanityFair" />

During the virtual [[DC FanDome]] event "Explore the Multiverse" in September 2020, Barbara Muschietti said the film would feature many characters from the [[DC Universe]] and the Flash would serve as the bridge between them and their different timelines. She added that the film would be used to restart the continuity of the DCEU without disregarding the events of the prior films.<ref name="DCEURestart&Characters" /> A month later, Crudup entered early negotiations to rejoin the project under a new deal, having left during the shifts in writers and directors. Clemons' involvement with the film at that point was uncertain.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /> The film's release was pushed back to November 4, 2022, due to further pandemic-related delays,<ref name="Nov2022Date" /> and filming was set to begin in March 2021 in London.<ref name="CrudupReturnTalks" /><ref name="FisherCameoOffer&March2021Filming" /> Warner Bros. had written Cyborg out of the film by January 2021 after Fisher refused to work on any project involving DC Films president [[Walter Hamada]], citing his handling of an investigation into the on-set behavior of ''Justice League''{{'}}s replacement director [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name="FisherSpeaks" /><ref name="NoFisherCyborg" /> The role of Cyborg was not expected to be recast.<ref name="NoFisherCyborg" /> Andy and Barbara Muschietti arrived in the United Kingdom that month to prepare for production,<ref name="MuschiettisFilming" /> with filming set to begin in April at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], after Miller completed their work on the ''Fantastic Beasts'' film.<ref name="MuschiettisFilming" /><ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /> In February, construction for sets at Leavesden Studios had begun,<ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /><ref name="BarbaraMuschiettiFeb2021" /> Crudup was confirmed to be returning as Henry Allen,<ref name="CalleSupergirl2" /> and [[Sasha Calle]] was set to portray [[Supergirl]].<ref name="CalleSupergirl" /><ref name="CalleSupergirl2" /> Calle was chosen from a group of more than 425 actresses that also included [[Bruna Marquezine]],<ref name="CalleSupergirl" /><ref name="MarquezineSupergirl" /> with all auditions for the part, as well as chemistry tests with Miller, taking place over [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]].<ref name="CalleSupergirl" />

In March 2021, Clemons signed a new deal to star as Iris West in the film, after her role in ''Justice League'' was cut but had been restored in the director's cut ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'' (2021).<ref name="ClemonsRejoin" /> Also that month, [[Maribel Verdú]] was cast to portray Barry Allen's mother [[Nora Allen]], but Crudup was forced to drop out of the film due to scheduling conflicts with his series ''[[The Morning Show (American TV series)|The Morning Show]]''. The role of Henry Allen was expected to be recast.<ref name="Verdu" /> At the end of March, Keaton said he had received an older version of the script but had not yet read it, and would have to read the latest draft before deciding if he could commit to the film. He also cited the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom]] as a concern for his involvement, as well as balancing his other commitments.<ref name="KeatonMarch2021" /> Shortly after, [[Ron Livingston]] was cast to replace Crudup as Henry Allen, with Ian Loh cast as a young Barry Allen, and [[Saoirse-Monica Jackson]] and [[Rudy Mancuso]] joining in undisclosed roles.<ref name="Livingston" /> Before filming began, Keaton was confirmed to be starring in the film,<ref name="KeatonYes" /> with Andy Muschietti believing Keaton's decision to join ''The Flash'' was due to the script that he had been sent. Muschietti said Keaton felt honored to play Batman again.<ref name="WhatConvincedKeaton" /> The Muschiettis formed a production company, Double Dream, to co-produce the film, and Marianne Jenkins was revealed as an executive producer.<ref name="MuschiettisStudio" /> Fisher said it would be a "bummer" if the situation surrounding his involvement in the film was not resolved,<ref name="FisherApril2021" /> and said he would return to the role of Cyborg for the film if Warner Bros. and Hamada released an apology to him.<ref name="FisherPossibleApril2021" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began on April 19, 2021,<ref name="FilmingStart" /> at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England,<ref name="LeavesdenFilming" /><ref name="BarbaraMuschiettiFeb2021" /> with [[Henry Braham]] serving as cinematographer.<ref name="Braham" /> In early May, filming took place at [[Burghley House]] in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England, with the location doubling for [[Wayne Manor]].<ref name="BurghleyHouseFilming" /> In mid-June, Miller, Clemons, Keaton, and Calle filmed scenes at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London, with the surrounding locations designed to double for [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]].<ref name="StPaulsCathedral" /> Filming was also set to occur later that month in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]]—doubling for [[Gotham City]]—for flashback scenes with Affleck and Keaton.<ref name="EdinburghGlasgow" /><ref name="EdinburghGlasgow2" /> In late July, filming continued in Glasgow at [[Ingram Street]], [[George Square]], John Street, and Cochrane Street, and involved several vehicles, while filming with the [[Batmobile]] occurred in George Square.<ref name="GlasgowJulyFilming" /> On July 29, filming was halted after a camera operator on a motorcycle shooting behind the [[Batcycle]] on Renfield Street collided with the Batcycle near West George Street and was injured, but not "seriously hurt".<ref name="GlasgowFilmingAccident" /><ref name="VarietyFilmingAccident" /> In early September, Luke Brandon Field revealed he had joined the cast.<ref name="Field" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 18, 2021.<ref name="FilmingWrap" />

=== Post-production ===
[[Paul Machliss]] serves as the editor of the film,<ref name="Machliss" /> while John "DJ" Desjardin serves as the visual effects supervisor for the film, after previously doing so for several DCEU films.<ref name="Desjardin" /> In December 2021, [[Michael Shannon]] and [[Antje Traue]] were revealed to be reprising their roles from ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) as [[General Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]] and [[Faora|Faora-Ul]], respectively. Former co-directors of the film, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, were also confirmed to be receiving story credit for the film alongside Hodson.<ref name="FlashZodFaora" />

[[Benjamin Wallfisch]] was set to compose the film's score by April 2021, reuniting with Andy Muschietti after working on his films ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017) and ''[[It Chapter Two]]'' (2019). Wallfisch also previously wrote the score for DC's ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019).<ref name="Wallfisch" />

== Marketing ==
Miller debuted the first footage from the film at the virtual [[DC FanDome]] event in October 2021.<ref name="DCFanDome2021THR" /> They said there was not enough footage available to make a trailer or teaser, but William Hughes at ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt the released footage could comfortably be categorized as a teaser. He noted that this was proof of the film actually being made after its long and troubled production history.<ref name="DCFanDome2021AVClub" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'s}} Matt Patches and ''[[io9]]''{{'s}} James Whitbrook both highlighted the footage as the beginning of the DC multiverse on film, with its hints at Keaton's version of Batman and the reveal that Miller would portray multiple versions of Barry Allen in the film.<ref name="DCFanDome2021Polygon" /><ref name="DCFanDome2021io9" />

== Release ==
''The Flash'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on November 4, 2022,<ref name="Nov2022Date" /> and will be available to stream on [[HBO Max]] 45 days later.<ref name="45DayWindow" /> The film was initially scheduled for release on March 23, 2018, when Warner Bros. first announced their slate of DCEU films,<ref name="DCFilmsSlate" /> before it was moved to March 16.<ref name="March2018Date" /> In July 2016, this release date was given to ''Tomb Raider'',<ref name="NoMarch2018Date" /> and ''The Flash'' was not given another release date until the hiring of Andy Muschietti in July 2019, after which the film was slated for release on July 1, 2022.<ref name="July2022Date" /> It was then moved up to June 3, 2022,<ref name="June2022Date" /> before being delayed to the November 2022 date after Warner Bros. shifted its release schedule due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="Nov2022Date" />
