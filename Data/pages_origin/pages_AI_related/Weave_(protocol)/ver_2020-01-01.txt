'''Weave''' is a network [[application layer]] [[Communication protocol|protocol]] and, in implementation, a comprehensive toolkit for building connected [[Internet of Things]]-class applications, with a primary and current focus on consumer and residential applications.<ref>[https://nest.com/weave/ "Weave"]. [[Nest_Labs|Nest Labs]]. Retrieved March 28, 2019.</ref>

Weave works across multiple [[IPv6]]-bearing link technologies such as [[Ethernet]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[Cellular_network|cellular]], and [[Thread_(network_protocol)|Thread]] and has adaptations for [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy|Bluetooth Low Energy]] point-to-point wireless links.

==History==
Weave was originally created by [[Nest Labs]] and launched in and with its Nest Protect (1st Generation) product in 2013<ref>Brown, Michael (October 1, 2015).
