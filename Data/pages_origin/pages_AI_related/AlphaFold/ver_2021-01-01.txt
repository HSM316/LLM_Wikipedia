{{short description|Artificial Intelligence (AI) program}}
'''AlphaFold''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] program developed by [[Google|Google's]] [[DeepMind]] which performs [[Protein structure prediction|predictions]] of [[protein structure]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AlphaFold |url=https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold |website=Deepmind |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref> The program is designed as a [[deep learning]] system.<ref name=mittr20201130>{{Cite web|title=DeepMind's protein-folding AI has solved a 50-year-old grand challenge of biology|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/30/1012712/deepmind-protein-folding-ai-solved-biology-science-drugs-disease/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref>

AlphaFold [[AI software]] has been notable in two major versions. A team of researchers who used AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) in December 2018. The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing [[Threading (protein sequence)|template structures]] were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. A team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020.<ref name=cnbc20201130>{{Cite news |last=Shead|first=Sam |date=2020-11-30 |title=DeepMind solves 50-year-old 'grand challenge' with protein folding A.I. |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solves-protein-folding-grand-challenge-with-alphafold-ai.html |access-date=2020-11-30|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref> The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group.<ref name=mittr20201130/> It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's [[Global distance test|global distance test (GDT)]], a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.<ref name=mittr20201130/><ref name=science20201130>Robert F.

AlphaFold 2's results at CASP were described as "astounding",<ref name=AlQuraishiTweet /> and transformational.<ref name=":5" /> Some researchers criticised the AlphaFold team for not making the method publicly available for independent verification and reimplementation;<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=AlQuraishi|first=Mohammed|date=2020-12-08|title=AlphaFold2 @ CASP14: "It feels like one's child has left home.".

[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|alt=three individual polypeptide chains at different levels of folding and a cluster of chains|Amino-acid chains, known as [[polypeptide]]s, fold to form a protein.]]

[[Protein]]s consist of chains of [[amino acid]]s which spontaneously fold, in a process called [[protein folding]], to form biologically important [[native state]] [[Protein tertiary structure|three dimensional structures]]. [[DNA|DNA sequences]] contain fundamental information about the sequences of these amino acids, but, the information about the protein folding and structures are determined by physical processes which can not be directly predicted from the DNA sequences.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=AlphaFold: Using AI for scientific discovery|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Deepmind}}</ref> Scientists look to experimental techniques such as [[X-ray crystallography]], [[Cryo-Electron Microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], which are both expensive and time-consuming to determine the target structures that proteins fold into.<ref name=":3" /> Such efforts have identified the structures of about 170,000 proteins over the last 60 years, while there are over 200 million known proteins across life forms.<ref name=science20201130/> There are numerous computational methods  of [[protein structure prediction]], but their accuracy has not been close to experimental techniques, thus limiting their value.

== Algorithm ==
While full details of AlphaFold's 2020 algorithms have not been publicly released, more are expected when DeepMind publishes scientific papers describing its methods and results.  DeepMind is known to have trained the program on over 170,000 proteins from a public repository of protein sequences and structures. The program uses a form of [[Attention (machine learning)|attention network]], a [[deep learning]] technique that focuses on having the [[AI]] [[AI software|algorithm]] identify parts of a larger problem, then piece it together to obtain the overall solution.<ref name=mittr20201130/> The overall training was conducted on processing power between 100 and 200 [[GPUs]].<ref name=mittr20201130/> Training the system on this hardware took "a few weeks", after which the program would take "a matter of days" to converge for each structure.<ref name=DeepMindAlpha2 />

=== AlphaFold 1, 2018 ===

'''AlphaFold 1'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> (2018) was built on work developed by various teams in the 2010s, work that looked at the large databanks of related DNA sequences now available from many different organisms (most without known 3D structures), to try to find changes at different [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] that appeared to be correlated, even though the residues were not consecutive in the main chain.  Such correlations suggest that the residues may be close to each other physically, even though not close in the sequence, allowing a [[contact map]] to be estimated.  Building on recent work prior to 2018, AlphaFold 1 extended this to estimate a probability distribution for just ''how'' close the residues might be likely to be—turning the contact map into a likely distance map.  It also used more advanced learning methods than previously to develop the inference.  Combining a [[statistical potential]] based on this probability distribution with the calculated local [[Gibbs free energy|free-energy]] of the configuration, the team was then able to use [[gradient descent]] to a solution that best fitted both.{{clarify|date=December 2020}}<ref>[[Mohammed AlQuraishi]] (May 2019), [https://ccsp.hms.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AlphaFold-at-CASP13-AlQuraishi.pdf AlphaFold at CASP13], ''Bioinformatics'', '''35'''(22), 4862–4865 {{doi|10.1093/bioinformatics/btz422}}.

More technically, Torrisi ''et al'' summarised in 2019 the approach of AlphaFold version 1 as follows:<ref>Torrisi, Mirko et al. (22 Jan. 2020), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7305407/ Deep learning methods in protein structure prediction]. ''Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal'' vol. '''18''' 1301-1310.  {{doi|10.1016/j.csbj.2019.12.011}} (CC-BY-4.0)</ref>
<blockquote>Central to AlphaFold is a distance map predictor implemented as a very deep [[residual neural network]]s with 220 residual blocks processing a representation of dimensionality 64×64×128 – corresponding to input features calculated from two 64 amino acid fragments. Each residual block has three layers including a 3×3 dilated convolutional layer – the blocks cycle through dilation of values 1, 2, 4, and 8. In total the model has 21 million parameters. The network uses a combination of 1D and 2D inputs, including [[evolutionary profiles]] from different sources and co-evolution features. Alongside a distance map in the form of a very finely-grained histogram of distances, AlphaFold predicts [[Ramachandran plot|Φ and Ψ angles]] for each residue which are used to create the initial predicted 3D structure. The AlphaFold authors concluded that the depth of the model, its large crop size, the large training set of roughly 29,000 proteins, modern Deep Learning techniques, and the richness of information from the predicted histogram of distances helped AlphaFold achieve a high contact map prediction precision.</blockquote>

=== AlphaFold 2, 2020 ===
[[File:AlphaFold 2 block design.png|thumb|500px|AlphaFold 2 block design. The two attention-based transformation modules can be seen in the middle of the design. <small>(Source:<ref name="DeepMindAlpha2" />)</small>]]
The 2020 version of the program ('''AlphaFold 2'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target -->, 2020) is significantly different from the original version that won CASP 13 in 2018, according to the team at DeepMind.<ref name=economist20201130/><ref name=KahnLessons>Jeremy Kahn, [https://fortune.com/2020/12/01/lessons-from-deepminds-a-i-breakthrough-eye-on-ai/ Lessons from DeepMind's breakthrough in protein-folding A.I.], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', 1 December 2020</ref>

The DeepMind team had identified that its previous approach, combining local physics with a guide potential derived from pattern recognition, had a tendency to over-account for interactions between residues that were nearby in the sequence compared to interactions between residues further apart along the chain.  As a result, AlphaFold 1 had a tendency to prefer models with slightly more [[Protein structure prediction#Protein structure and terminology|secondary structure]] ([[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet]]s) that was the case in reality (a form of [[overfitting]]).<ref name=Alpha2Abstract>John Jumper et al., conference abstract (December 2020)</ref>

The software design used in AlphaFold 1 contained a number of modules, each trained separately, that were used to produce the guide potential that was then combined with the physics-based energy potential.  AlphaFold 2 replaced this with a system of sub-networks coupled together into a single differentiable end-to-end model, based entirely on pattern recognition, which was trained in an integrated way as a single integrated structure.<ref name=KahnLessons /><ref name="block diagram">See block diagram.  Also John Jumper ''et al.'' (1 December 2020), [https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/presentations/2020_12_01_TS_predictor_AlphaFold2.pdf AlphaFold2 presentation], slide 10</ref> Local physics, in the form of energy refinement based on the [[AMBER]] model, is applied only as a final refinement step once the neural network prediction has converged, and only slightly adjusts the predicted structure.<ref name=Alpha2Abstract />

A key part of the 2020 system are two modules, believed to be based on a [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]] design, which are used to progressively refine a [[word embedding|vector of information]] for each relationship (or "[[Connectivity (graph theory)|edge]]" in graph-theory terminology) between an [[amino acid residue]] of the protein and another amino acid residue (these relationships are represented by the array shown in green); and between each amino acid position and each different sequences in the input [[sequence alignment]] (these relationships are represented by the array shown in red).<ref name="block diagram" />  Internally these refinement transformations contain layers that have the effect of bringing relevant data together and filtering out irrelevant data (the "attention mechanism") for these relationships, in a context-dependent way, learnt from training data.  These transformations are iterated, the updated information output by one step becoming the input of the next, with the sharpened residue/residue information feeding into the update of the residue/sequence information, and then the improved residue/sequence information feeding into the update of the residue/residue information.<ref name="block diagram" />  As the iteration progresses, according to one report, the "attention algorithm ... mimics the way a person might assemble a jigsaw puzzle: first connecting pieces in small clumps—in this case clusters of amino acids—and then searching for ways to join the clumps in a larger whole."<ref name=science20201130 />

The output of these iterations then informs the final structure prediction module,<ref name="block diagram" /> which also uses transformers,<ref>The structure module is stated to use a "3-d equivariant transformer architecture" (John Jumper ''et al.'' (1 December 2020), [https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/presentations/2020_12_01_TS_predictor_AlphaFold2.pdf AlphaFold2 presentation], slide 12).<br />  One design for a transformer network with [[Euclidean group|SE(3)]]-[[Equivariant map|equivariance]] was proposed in Fabian Fuchs ''et al'' [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10503.pdf SE(3)-Transformers: 3D Roto-Translation Equivariant Attention Networks], [[NeurIPS]] 2020; also [https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/se3transformer/ website].  It is not known how similar this may or may not be to what was used in AlphaFold.<br /> See also [https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/#s3.3 the blog post] by AlQuaraishi on this, or the [https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/alphafold2/ more detailed post] by Fabian Fuchs</ref> and is itself then iterated.  In an example presented by DeepMind, the structure prediction module achieved a correct topology for the target protein on its first iteration, scored as having a GDT_TS of 78, but with a large number (90%) of stereochemical violations – i.e. unphysical bond angles or lengths.  With subsequent iterations the number of stereochemical violations fell.  By the third iteration the GDT_TS of the prediction was approaching 90, and by the eighth iteration the number of stereochemical violations was approaching zero.<ref name=AF2iterations>John Jumper ''et al.''

As summed up by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reservations about this coverage have focussed in two main areas: "There is still a lot to be done" and: "We don't even know how they do it".<ref name=Spiegel_2>Christian Stöcker, [https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/lernende-maschinen-google-greift-nach-dem-leben-selbst-a-47424e26-a39d-4d62-9a89-bc06cd4647c0 Google greift nach dem Leben selbst] (Google is reaching for life itself), ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 6 December 2020</ref>

Although a 30-minute presentation about AlphaFold 2 was given on the second day of the CASP conference (December 1) by project leader John Jumper,<ref>John Jumper ''et al.'' (1 December 2020), [https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/presentations/2020_12_01_TS_predictor_AlphaFold2.pdf AlphaFold2]. Presentation given at CASP 14.</ref> it has been described as "exceedingly high-level, heavy on ideas and insinuations, but almost entirely devoid of detail".<ref name=":0" />  DeepMind are expected to publish a scientific paper giving an account of AlphaFold 2 in the proceedings volume{{when|date=December 2020}} of the CASP conference; but it is not known whether it will go beyond what was said in the presentation.

Speaking to ''[[El País]]'', researcher [[Alfonso Valencia]] said "The most important thing that this advance leaves us is knowing that this problem has a solution, that it is possible to solve it...  We only know the result. Google does not provide the software and this is the frustrating part of the achievement because it will not directly benefit science."<ref name=ElPais>Nuño Dominguez, [https://elpais.com/ciencia/2020-12-02/la-inteligencia-artificial-arrasa-en-uno-de-los-problemas-mas-importantes-de-la-biologia.html La inteligencia artificial arrasa en uno de los problemas más importantes de la biología] (Artificial intelligence takes out one of the most important problems in biology), ''[[El País]]'', 2 December 2020</ref> Nevertheless, as much as Google and DeepMind do release may help other teams develop similar AI systems, an "indirect" benefit.<ref name=ElPais />  In late 2019 DeepMind released much of the code of the first version of AlphaFold as open source; but only when work was well underway on the much more radical AlphaFold 2.  Another option it could take might be to make AlphaFold 2 structure prediction available as an online black-box subscription service.  Convergence for a single sequence has been estimated to require on the order of $10,000 worth of [[Tensor Processing Unit|wholesale compute time]].<ref name=Outeiral>Carlos Outeiral, [https://www.blopig.com/blog/2020/12/casp14-what-google-deepminds-alphafold-2-really-achieved-and-what-it-means-for-protein-folding-biology-and-bioinformatics/ CASP14: what Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 really achieved, and what it means for protein folding, biology and bioinformatics], Oxford Protein Informatics Group. (3 December)</ref> But this would deny researchers access to the internal states of the system, the chance to learn more qualitatively what gives rise to AlphaFold 2's success, and the potential for new algorithms that could be lighter and more efficient yet still achieve such results.  Fears of a potential for a lack of transparency by DeepMind have been contrasted with five decades of heavy public investment into the open [[Protein Data Bank]] and then also into open [[List of biological databases#Nucleic acid databases|DNA sequence repositories]], without which the data to train AlphaFold 2 would not have existed.<ref>Aled Edwards, [https://structural-genomics-consortium.medium.com/the-alphafold2-success-fc8f54998f29 The AlphaFold2 success: It took a village], via [[medium.com]], 5 December 2020</ref><ref>David Briggs, [https://www.skeptic.org.uk/2020/12/if-googles-alphafold2-really-has-solved-the-protein-folding-problem-they-need-to-show-their-working If Google’s Alphafold2 really has solved the protein folding problem, they need to show their working], ''[[The Skeptic (UK magazine)|The Skeptic]], 4 December 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-deepminds-brain-the-shape-of-things-to-come The Guardian view on DeepMind’s brain: the shape of things to come], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 December 2020</ref>

However it is not yet clear to what extent structure predictions made by AlphaFold 2 will hold up for proteins bound into complexes with other proteins and other molecules.<ref name=Ireland_rsb>Tom Ireland, [https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/biologist/158-biologist/features/2550-how-will-alphafold-change-bioscience-research How will AlphaFold change bioscience research?], ''The Biologist'', 4 December 2020</ref>   This was not a part of the CASP competition which AlphaFold entered, and not an eventuality it was internally designed to expect.  Where structures that AlphaFold 2 did predict were for proteins that had strong interactions either with other copies of themselves, or with other structures, these were the cases where AlphaFold 2's predictions tended to be least refined and least reliable.  As a large fraction of the most important biological machines in a cell comprise such complexes, or relate to how protein structures become modified when in contact with other molecules, this is an area that will continue to be the focus of considerable experimental attention.<ref name=Ireland_rsb />

With so little yet known about the internal patterns that AF2 learns to make its predictions, it is not yet clear to what extent the program may be impaired in its ability to identify novel folds, if such folds are not well represented in the existing protein structures known in structure databases.<ref name=curry>Stephen Curry, [http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/ No, DeepMind has not solved protein folding], Reciprocal Space (blog), 2 December 2020</ref><ref name=Ireland_rsb />  It is also not well known the extent to which protein structures in such databases, overwhelmingly of proteins that it has been possible to crystallise to X-ray, are representative of typical proteins that have not yet been crystallised.  And it is also unclear how representative the frozen protein structures in crystals are of the dynamic structures found in the cells ''in vivo''.  AlphaFold 2's difficulties with structures obtained by [[protein NMR]] methods may not be a good sign.

In respect of [[drug discovery]], Stephen Curry notes that while the resolution of AlphaFold 2's structures may be very good, the accuracy with which [[binding site]]s may need to be modelled may need to be even higher: typically 0.3 [[Angstrom|Å]] for [[Docking (molecular)|molecular docking]] studies to be possible.  So AlphaFold 2's structures may only be a limited help in such contexts.<ref name=curry /><ref name=Ireland_rsb />  Moreover, according to ''Science'' columnist [[Derek Lowe (chemist)|Derek Lowe]], because prediction of small-molecule binding even then is still not very good, computational prediction of drug targets is simply not in a position to take over as the "backbone" of corporate drug discovery—so "protein structure determination simply isn’t a rate-limiting step in drug discovery in general".<ref>[[Derek Lowe (chemist)|Derek Lowe]], [https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/25/whats-crucial-and-what-isnt In the Pipeline: What’s Crucial And What Isn’t], ''Science Translational Medicine'', 25 September 2019</ref> It has also been noted that even with a structure for a protein, to then understand how it functions, what it does, and how that fits within wider biological processes can still be very challenging.<ref>[[Philip Ball]], [https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/behind-the-screens-of-alphafold/4012867.article Behind the Screens of AlphaFold], ''[[Chemistry World]]'', 9 December 2020. See also [https://twitter.com/philipcball/status/1333822943630069760?s=20 tweets], 1 December</ref> Nevertheless, if better knowledge of protein structure could lead to better understanding of individual disease mechanisms and ultimately to better drug targets, or better understanding of the differences between human and animal models, ultimately that could lead to improvements.<ref>[[Derek Lowe (chemist)|Derek Lowe]], [https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/01/the-big-problems In the Pipeline: The Big Problems], ''Science Translational Medicine'', 1 December 2020</ref>

Finally, some have noted that even a perfect answer to the protein ''[[protein structure prediction|prediction]]'' problem would still leave questions about the protein ''[[protein folding|folding]]'' problem—understanding in detail how the folding process actually occurs in nature (and how sometimes they can also [[proteopathy|misfold]]).<!-- eg https://twitter.com/daviddesancho/status/1333520127556546562 and other tweets, but there must be other references --><ref>e.g. Greg Bowman, [https://foldingathome.org/2020/12/08/protein-folding-and-related-problems-remain-unsolved-despite-alphafolds-advance/ Protein folding and related problems remain unsolved despite AlphaFold's advance], [[Folding@home]] blog, 8 December 2020</ref>

But even with such caveats, AlphaFold 2 was described as a huge technical step forward and intellectual achievement.<ref>Cristina Sáez, [https://www.lavanguardia.com/ciencia/20201202/49848364758/alfonso-valencia-inteligencia-artificial-estructura-proteinas-deepmind.html El último avance fundamental de la biología se basa en la investigación de un científico español], ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', 2 December 2020.

== Applications ==
===SARS-CoV-2===
AlphaFold has been used to a predict structures of proteins of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], the causative agent of [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]]. The structures of these proteins were pending experimental detection in early 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|title=AI Can Help Scientists Find a Covid-19 Vaccine|language=en-us|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-can-help-find-scientists-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/|access-date=2020-12-01|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Results were examined by the scientists at the [[Francis Crick Institute]] in the United Kingdom before release into the larger research community. The team also confirmed accurate prediction against the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 [[spike protein]] that was shared in the [[Protein Data Bank]], an international open access database, before releasing the computationally determined structures of the under-studied protein molecules.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=Computational predictions of protein structures associated with COVID-19|url=https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Deepmind}}</ref> The team acknowledged that though these protein structures might not be the subject of ongoing therapeutical research efforts, they will add to the community's understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<ref name=":6" /> Specifically, AlphaFold 2's prediction of the structure of the ''Orf3a'' protein was very similar to the structure determined by researchers at [[University of California, Berkeley]] using [[Cryo-Electron Microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]]. This specific protein is believed to assist the virus in breaking out of the host cell once it replicates. This protein is also believed to play a role in triggering the inflammatory response to the infection.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How DeepMind's new protein-folding A.I. is already helping to combat the coronavirus pandemic.|url=https://fortune.com/2020/11/30/covid-protein-folding-deepmind-ai/|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Fortune|language=en}}</ref>
