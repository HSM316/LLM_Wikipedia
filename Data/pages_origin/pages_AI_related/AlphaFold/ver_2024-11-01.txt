AlphaFold software has had three major versions. A team of researchers that used AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th [[Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction]] (CASP) in December 2018. The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing [[Threading (protein sequence)|template structures]] were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. A team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP14 competition in November 2020.<ref name="cnbc20201130">{{Cite news|last=Shead|first=Sam|date=2020-11-30|title=DeepMind solves 50-year-old 'grand challenge' with protein folding A.I.|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solves-protein-folding-grand-challenge-with-alphafold-ai.html|access-date=2020-11-30|website=CNBC|language=en|archive-date=2021-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128182507/https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solves-protein-folding-grand-challenge-with-alphafold-ai.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group.<ref name="mittr20201130" /><ref name="Stoddart">{{cite journal |last1=Stoddart |first1=Charlotte |title=Structural biology: How proteins got their close-up |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=1 March 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-022822-1 |s2cid=247206999 |doi-access=free |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2022/structural-biology-how-proteins-got-their-closeup |access-date=25 March 2022 |archive-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407231646/https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2022/structural-biology-how-proteins-got-their-closeup |url-status=live }}</ref> It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's [[global distance test]] (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.<ref name="mittr20201130" /><ref name="science20201130">Robert F.

{{See also|Protein structure prediction|De novo protein structure prediction}}
[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|alt=three individual polypeptide chains at different levels of folding and a cluster of chains|Amino-acid chains, known as [[polypeptide]]s, fold to form a protein.]]

[[Protein]]s consist of [[Protein primary structure|chains of amino acid]]s which [[protein folding|spontaneously fold]] to form the [[Protein tertiary structure|three dimensional (3-D) structures]] of the proteins. The 3-D structure is crucial to understanding the biological function of the protein.

Protein structures can be determined experimentally through techniques such as [[X-ray crystallography]], [[Cryo-Electron Microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], which are all expensive and time-consuming.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=AlphaFold: Using AI for scientific discovery|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Deepmind|date=15 January 2020|archive-date=2022-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220307220937/https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery|url-status=live}}</ref> Such efforts, using the experimental methods, have identified the structures of about 170,000 proteins over the last 60 years, while there are over 200 million known proteins across all life forms.<ref name=science20201130/>

Over the years, researchers have applied numerous computational methods to [[Protein structure prediction#Ab initio protein modelling|predict the 3D structures of protein]]s from their amino acid sequences, but the accuracy of such methods has not been close to experimental techniques. [[CASP]], which was launched in 1994 to challenge the scientific community to produce their best protein structure predictions, found that [[Global distance test|GDT]] scores of only about 40 out of 100 can be achieved for the most difficult proteins by 2016.<ref name=science20201130/> AlphaFold started competing in the 2018 CASP using an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) [[deep learning]] technique.<ref name=":3" />

== Algorithm ==
DeepMind is known to have trained the program on over 170,000 proteins from a public repository of protein sequences and structures. The program uses a form of [[Attention (machine learning)|attention network]], a [[deep learning]] technique that focuses on having the [[AI]] identify parts of a larger problem, then piece it together to obtain the overall solution.<ref name=mittr20201130/> The overall training was conducted on processing power between 100 and 200 [[GPUs]].<ref name=mittr20201130/>

=== AlphaFold 1 (2018) ===
{{Anchor|AlphaFold 1}}

'''AlphaFold 1'''<!-- bolded per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] as a redirect target --> (2018) was built on work developed by various teams in the 2010s, work that looked at the large databanks of related DNA sequences now available from many different organisms (most without known 3D structures), to try to find changes at different [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] that appeared to be correlated, even though the residues were not consecutive in the main chain.  Such correlations suggest that the residues may be close to each other physically, even though not close in the sequence, allowing a [[contact map]] to be estimated.  Building on recent work prior to 2018, AlphaFold 1 extended this to estimate a probability distribution for just ''how'' close the residues might be likely to be—turning the contact map into a likely distance map.  It also used more advanced learning methods than previously to develop the inference.<ref>[[Mohammed AlQuraishi]] (May 2019), [https://ccsp.hms.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AlphaFold-at-CASP13-AlQuraishi.pdf AlphaFold at CASP13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122013208/https://ccsp.hms.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AlphaFold-at-CASP13-AlQuraishi.pdf|date=2021-11-22}}, ''Bioinformatics'', '''35'''(22), 4862–4865 {{doi|10.1093/bioinformatics/btz422}}.

The software design used in AlphaFold 1 contained a number of modules, each trained separately, that were used to produce the guide potential that was then combined with the physics-based energy potential.  AlphaFold 2 replaced this with a system of sub-networks coupled together into a single differentiable end-to-end model, based entirely on pattern recognition, which was trained in an integrated way as a single integrated structure.<ref name=KahnLessons /><ref name="block diagram">See block diagram.

A key part of the 2020 system are two modules, believed to be based on a [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]] design, which are used to progressively refine a [[word embedding|vector of information]] for each relationship (or "[[Connectivity (graph theory)|edge]]" in graph-theory terminology) between an [[amino acid residue]] of the protein and another amino acid residue (these relationships are represented by the array shown in green); and between each amino acid position and each different sequences in the input [[sequence alignment]] (these relationships are represented by the array shown in red).<ref name="block diagram" />  Internally these refinement transformations contain layers that have the effect of bringing relevant data together and filtering out irrelevant data (the "attention mechanism") for these relationships, in a context-dependent way, learnt from training data.  These transformations are iterated, the updated information output by one step becoming the input of the next, with the sharpened residue/residue information feeding into the update of the residue/sequence information, and then the improved residue/sequence information feeding into the update of the residue/residue information.<ref name="block diagram" />  As the iteration progresses, according to one report, the "attention algorithm ... mimics the way a person might assemble a jigsaw puzzle: first connecting pieces in small clumps—in this case clusters of amino acids—and then searching for ways to join the clumps in a larger whole."<ref name=science20201130 />{{Update inline|date=May 2024|reason=More information was made available in DeepMind's paper in July 2021 (see in particular the "Evoformer" part)}}

On the competition's preferred [[global distance test]] (GDT) measure of accuracy, the program achieved a median score of 92.4 (out of 100), meaning that more than half of its predictions were scored at better than 92.4% for having their atoms in more-or-less the right place,<ref>For the GDT_TS measure used, each atom in the prediction scores a quarter of a point if it is within {{cvt|8|Å|nm}} of the experimental position; half a point if it is within 4 Å, three-quarters of a point if it is within 2 Å, and a whole point if it is within 1 Å.</ref><ref>To achieve a GDT_TS score of 92.5, mathematically at least 70% of the structure must be accurate to within 1 Å, and at least 85% must be accurate to within 2 Å,</ref> a level of accuracy reported to be comparable to experimental techniques like [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref name=economist20201130>{{Cite news |date=2020-11-30 |title=DeepMind is answering one of biology's biggest challenges |newspaper=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/11/30/deepmind-is-answering-one-of-biologys-biggest-challenges |access-date=2020-11-30 |issn=0013-0613 |archive-date=2020-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203085450/https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/11/30/deepmind-is-answering-one-of-biologys-biggest-challenges |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":2" /> In 2018 AlphaFold 1 had only reached this level of accuracy in two of all of its predictions.<ref name=AlQuraishiTweet /> 88% of predictions in the 2020 competition had a GDT_TS score of more than 80.

Measured by the [[root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions|root-mean-square deviation]] (RMS-D) of the placement of the alpha-carbon atoms of the protein backbone chain, which tends to be dominated by the performance of the worst-fitted outliers, 88% of AlphaFold 2's predictions had an RMS deviation of less than 4 [[Angstrom|Å]] for the set of overlapped C-alpha atoms.<ref name=AlQuraishiTweet />  76% of predictions achieved better than 3 Å, and 46% had a C-alpha atom RMS accuracy better than 2 Å,<ref name=AlQuraishiTweet>Mohammed AlQuraishi, [https://twitter.com/MoAlQuraishi/status/1333383634649313280 CASP14 scores just came out and they're astounding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220804024406/https://twitter.com/MoAlQuraishi/status/1333383634649313280 |date=2022-08-04 }}, Twitter, 30 November 2020.</ref> with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of 2.1 Å for a set of overlapped CA atoms.<ref name=AlQuraishiTweet />  AlphaFold 2 also achieved an accuracy in modelling surface [[side chain]]s described as "really really extraordinary".

To additionally verify AlphaFold-2 the conference organisers approached four leading experimental groups for structures they were finding particularly challenging and had been unable to determine. In all four cases the three-dimensional models produced by AlphaFold 2 were sufficiently accurate to determine structures of these proteins by [[molecular replacement]].  These included target T1100 (Af1503), a small [[membrane protein]] studied by experimentalists for ten years.<ref name=science20201130/>

Of the three structures that AlphaFold 2 had the least success in predicting, two had been obtained by [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins|protein NMR]] methods, which define protein structure directly in aqueous solution, whereas AlphaFold was mostly trained on [[X-ray crystallography|protein structures in crystal]]s.  The third exists in nature as a [[Protein domain#Multidomain proteins|multidomain complex]] consisting of 52 identical copies of the same [[protein domain|domain]], a situation AlphaFold was not programmed to consider.  For all targets with a single domain, excluding only one very large protein and the two structures determined by NMR, AlphaFold 2 achieved a GDT_TS score of over 80.

== Applications ==

AlphaFold has been used to predict structures of proteins of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], the causative agent of [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]]. The structures of these proteins were pending experimental detection in early 2020.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=AI Can Help Scientists Find a Covid-19 Vaccine|language=en-us|magazine=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-can-help-find-scientists-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/|access-date=2020-12-01|issn=1059-1028|archive-date=2022-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220423195503/https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-ai-can-help-find-scientists-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Results were examined by the scientists at the [[Francis Crick Institute]] in the United Kingdom before release into the larger research community. The team also confirmed accurate prediction against the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 [[coronavirus spike protein|spike protein]] that was shared in the [[Protein Data Bank]], an international open-access database, before releasing the computationally determined structures of the under-studied protein molecules.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=Computational predictions of protein structures associated with COVID-19|url=https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Deepmind|date=4 August 2020|archive-date=2022-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325185435/https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19|url-status=live}}</ref> The team acknowledged that although these protein structures might not be the subject of ongoing therapeutical research efforts, they will add to the community's understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<ref name=":6" /> Specifically, AlphaFold 2's prediction of the structure of the ''[[ORF3a]]'' protein was very similar to the structure determined by researchers at [[University of California, Berkeley]] using [[Cryo-Electron Microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]]. This specific protein is believed to assist the virus in breaking out of the host cell once it replicates.
