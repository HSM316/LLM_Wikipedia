Academics have raised concerns about the potential for deep fakes to be used to promote disinformation and hate speech, and interfere with elections. The [[information technology]] industry and governments have responded with recommendations to detect and limit their use.

== History ==
[[File:53271755473 - Flickr - torstenbehrens.jpg|thumb|Portrait of actress [[Sydney Sweeney]] generated by [[Stable Diffusion]]]]
[[Photo manipulation]] was developed in the 19th century and soon applied to motion pictures. Technology steadily improved during the 20th century, and more quickly with the advent of [[digital video]].

Deepfake technology has been developed by researchers at academic institutions beginning in the 1990s, and later by amateurs in online communities.<ref name="Harwell-2019">{{Cite news |last=Harwell |first=Drew |date=12 June 2019 |title=Top AI researchers race to detect 'deepfake' videos: 'We are outgunned' |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/ |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |access-date=2019-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031051258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/ |archive-date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-ai-future-fake-news-may-be-easily-faked-video-ncna845726|title=Thanks to AI, the future of 'fake news' is being pioneered in homemade porn|last=Sanchez|first=Julian|date=8 February 2018|website=NBC News|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=9 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109084341/https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-ai-future-fake-news-may-be-easily-faked-video-ncna845726|url-status=live}}</ref> More recently the methods have been adopted by industry.<ref name="Porter-2019">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|title=Another convincing deepfake app goes viral prompting immediate privacy backlash|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-09-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903202859/https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Academic research ===
Academic research related to deepfakes is split between the field of [[computer vision]], a sub-field of computer science,<ref name="Harwell-2019" /> which develops techniques for creating and identifying deepfakes, and humanities and social science approaches that study the social, ethical and aesthetic implications of deepfakes.

==== Social science and humanities approaches to deepfakes ====
In cinema studies, deepfakes demonstrate how "the human face is emerging as a central object of ambivalence in the digital age".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bode |first1=Lisa |last2=Lees |first2=Dominic |last3=Golding |first3=Dan |date=2021-07-29 |title=The Digital Face and Deepfakes on Screen |journal=[[Convergence (journal)|Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=849–854 |doi=10.1177/13548565211034044 |issn=1354-8565 |s2cid=237402465|doi-access=free }}</ref> Video artists have used deepfakes to "playfully rewrite film history by retrofitting canonical cinema with new star performers".<ref name="Holliday-2021">{{Cite journal |last=Holliday |first=Christopher |date=2021-07-26 |title=Rewriting the stars: Surface tensions and gender troubles in the online media production of digital deepfakes |journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=899–918 |doi=10.1177/13548565211029412 |issn=1354-8565 |s2cid=237402548|doi-access=free }}</ref> Film scholar Christopher Holliday analyses how switching out the gender and race of performers in familiar movie scenes destabilizes gender classifications and categories.<ref name="Holliday-2021" /> The idea of "[[queering]]" deepfakes is also discussed in Oliver M.

The aesthetic potentials of deepfakes are also beginning to be explored. Theatre historian John Fletcher notes that early demonstrations of deepfakes are presented as performances, and situates these in the context of theater, discussing "some of the more troubling paradigm shifts" that deepfakes represent as a performance genre.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=John|date=2018|title=Deepfakes, Artificial Intelligence, and Some Kind of Dystopia: The New Faces of Online Post-Fact Performance|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/715916|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=70|issue=4|pages=455–471|doi=10.1353/tj.2018.0097|s2cid=191988083 |issn=1086-332X}}</ref>

While most English-language academic studies of deepfakes focus on the Western anxieties about disinformation and pornography, digital anthropologist Gabriele de Seta has analyzed the Chinese reception of deepfakes, which are known as ''huanlian'', which translates to "changing faces". The Chinese term does not contain the "fake" of the English deepfake, and de Seta argues that this cultural context may explain why the Chinese response has been more about practical regulatory responses to "fraud risks, image rights, economic profit, and ethical imbalances".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Seta|first=Gabriele|date=2021-07-30|title=Huanlian, or changing faces: Deepfakes on Chinese digital media platforms|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565211030185|journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|volume=27|issue=4|pages=935–953|doi=10.1177/13548565211030185|hdl=11250/2833613|s2cid=237402447|issn=1354-8565|hdl-access=free|access-date=9 February 2022|archive-date=10 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240610171616/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565211030185|url-status=live}}</ref>

A survey of deepfakes, published in May 2020, provides a timeline of how the creation and detection deepfakes have advanced over the last few years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yisroel|last2=Lee|first2=Wenke|date=2020-05-12|title=The Creation and Detection of Deepfakes: A Survey|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|doi=10.1145/3425780|arxiv=2004.11138|s2cid=216080410}}</ref> The survey identifies that researchers have been focusing on resolving the following challenges of deepfake creation:

* Generalization. High-quality deepfakes are often achieved by training on hours of footage of the target. This challenge is to minimize the amount of training data and the time to train the model required to produce quality images and to enable the execution of trained models on ''new'' identities (unseen during training).
* Paired Training. Training a supervised model can produce high-quality results, but requires data pairing. This is the process of finding examples of inputs and their desired outputs for the model to learn from. Data pairing is laborious and impractical when training on multiple identities and facial behaviors. Some solutions include self-supervised training (using frames from the same video), the use of unpaired networks such as Cycle-GAN, or the manipulation of network embeddings.
* Identity leakage. This is where the identity of the driver (i.e., the actor controlling the face in a reenactment) is partially transferred to the generated face. Some solutions proposed include attention mechanisms, few-shot learning, disentanglement, boundary conversions, and skip connections.
* Occlusions. When part of the face is obstructed with a hand, hair, glasses, or any other item then artifacts can occur. A common occlusion is a closed mouth which hides the inside of the mouth and the teeth. Some solutions include image segmentation during training and in-painting.
* Temporal coherence. In videos containing deepfakes, artifacts such as flickering and jitter can occur because the network has no context of the preceding frames. Some researchers provide this context or use novel temporal coherence losses to help improve realism. As the technology improves, the interference is diminishing.

Overall, deepfakes are expected to have several implications in media and society, media production, media representations, media audiences, gender, law, and regulation, and politics.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Karnouskos |first=Stamatis |title=Artificial Intelligence in Digital Media: The Era of Deepfakes |journal=IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society |date=2020 |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=1 |doi=10.1109/TTS.2020.3001312 |s2cid=221716206 |url=https://papers.duckdns.org/files/2020_Deepfakes.pdf |access-date=9 July 2020 |archive-date=14 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032923/https://papers.duckdns.org/files/2020_Deepfakes.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Techniques ==
Deepfakes rely on a type of [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] called an [[autoencoder]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alanzucconi.com/2018/03/14/understanding-the-technology-behind-deepfakes/|title=Understanding the Technology Behind DeepFakes|last=Zucconi|first=Alan|date=2018-03-14|website=Alan Zucconi|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=1 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101164537/https://www.alanzucconi.com/2018/03/14/understanding-the-technology-behind-deepfakes/|url-status=live}}</ref> These consist of an encoder, which reduces an image to a lower dimensional [[latent space]], and a decoder, which reconstructs the image from the latent representation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-03 |title=What is a Deepfake? |url=https://blog.synthesys.io/what-is-deepfake/ |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=Blog - Synthesys |archive-date=26 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626181456/https://blog.synthesys.io/what-is-deepfake/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Deepfakes utilize this architecture by having a universal encoder which encodes a person in to the latent space.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} The latent representation contains key features about their facial features and body posture. This can then be decoded with a model trained specifically for the target. This means the target's detailed information will be superimposed on the underlying facial and body features of the original video, represented in the latent space.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

A popular upgrade to this architecture attaches a [[generative adversarial network]] to the decoder. A [[General adversarial network|GAN]] trains a generator, in this case the decoder, and a discriminator in an adversarial relationship. The generator creates new images from the latent representation of the source material, while the discriminator attempts to determine whether or not the image is generated.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} This causes the generator to create images that mimic reality extremely well as any defects would be caught by the discriminator.<ref name="Wired-1059">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/|title=These New Tricks Can Outsmart Deepfake Videos—for Now|magazine=Wired|access-date=2019-11-09|issn=1059-1028|archive-date=3 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003055035/https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/|url-status=live}}</ref> Both algorithms improve constantly in a [[Zero-sum game|zero sum game]].

===Art===
In March 2018 the multidisciplinary artist Joseph Ayerle published the [[video art]]work ''Un'emozione per sempre 2.0'' (English title: ''The Italian Game''). The artist worked with Deepfake technology to create an ''AI actor,'' a synthetic version of 80s movie star [[Ornella Muti]], traveling in time from 1978 to 2018. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] referred this artwork in the study "Collective Wisdom".<ref>Katerina Cizek, William Uricchio, and Sarah Wolozin: Collective Wisdom | Massachusetts Institute of Technology [https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304015015/https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6|date=4 March 2020}}</ref> The artist used Ornella Muti's [[time travel]] to explore generational reflections, while also investigating questions about the role of provocation in the world of art.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/toscana/notizie/2017/11/03/ornella-muti-in-cortometraggio-a-firenze_36349008-ce7b-4c7e-8742-43e28f7225f4.html |title=ANSA {{!}} Ornella Muti in cortometraggio a Firenze |date=3 November 2017 |access-date=27 February 2020 |archive-date=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227220711/http://www.ansa.it/toscana/notizie/2017/11/03/ornella-muti-in-cortometraggio-a-firenze_36349008-ce7b-4c7e-8742-43e28f7225f4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> For the technical realization Ayerle used scenes of photo model [[Kendall Jenner]]. The program replaced Jenner's face by an AI calculated face of Ornella Muti. As a result, the AI actor has the face of the Italian actor Ornella Muti and the body of Kendall Jenner.

Deepfakes have been widely used in [[satire]] or to parody celebrities and politicians. The 2020 webseries ''[[Sassy Justice]]'', created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], heavily features the use of deepfaked public figures to satirize current events and raise awareness of deepfake technology.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-27 |title='South Park' creators launch new deepfake satire series 'Sassy Justice' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/south-park-creators-launch-new-deepfake-satire-series-sassy-justice-2800657 |access-date=2022-06-07 |website=NME |archive-date=10 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240610172120/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/south-park-creators-launch-new-deepfake-satire-series-sassy-justice-2800657 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Blackmail ===
Deepfakes can be used to generate blackmail materials that falsely incriminate a victim. A report by the American [[Congressional Research Service]] warned that deepfakes could be used to blackmail elected officials or those with access to [[classified information]] for [[espionage]] or [[Foreign electoral intervention|influence]] purposes.<ref name=CRS1>{{cite report |first2=Laurie A. |last2=Harris |first1=Kelley M. |last1=Tayler |date=June 8, 2021 |title=Deep Fakes and National Security |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11333 |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=1 |access-date=July 19, 2021 |archive-date=14 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220614195611/https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11333 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Alternatively, since the fakes cannot reliably be distinguished from genuine materials, victims of actual blackmail can now claim that the true artifacts are fakes, granting them plausible deniability. The effect is to void credibility of existing blackmail materials, which erases loyalty to blackmailers and destroys the blackmailer's control. This phenomenon can be termed "blackmail inflation", since it "devalues" real blackmail, rendering it worthless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultstate.com/2020/05/24/Podcast-18--Blackmail-Inflation/|last1=Limberg|first1=Peter|title=Blackmail Inflation|website=CultState|date=2020-05-24|access-date=2021-01-18|archive-date=24 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124155722/https://cultstate.com/2020/05/24/Podcast-18--Blackmail-Inflation/|url-status=live}}</ref> It is possible to utilize commodity GPU hardware with a small software program to generate this blackmail content for any number of subjects in huge quantities, driving up the supply of fake blackmail content limitlessly and in highly scalable fashion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://t.me/forKappy|title=For Kappy|website=Telegraph|date=2020-05-24|access-date=2021-01-18|archive-date=24 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124155641/https://t.me/forKappy|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Sockpuppets===
Deepfake photographs can be used to create [[sockpuppet (internet)|sockpuppets]], non-existent people, who are active both online and in traditional media. A deepfake photograph appears to have been generated together with a legend for an apparently non-existent person named Oliver Taylor, whose identity was described as a university student in the United Kingdom. The Oliver Taylor persona submitted opinion pieces in several newspapers and was active in online media attacking a British legal academic and his wife, as "terrorist sympathizers." The academic had drawn international attention in 2018 when he commenced a lawsuit in Israel against NSO, a surveillance company, on behalf of people in Mexico who alleged they were victims of NSO's [[phone hacking]] technology. ''Reuters'' could find only scant records for Oliver Taylor and "his" university had no records for him. Many experts agreed that the profile photo is a deepfake. Several newspapers have not retracted articles attributed to him or removed them from their websites. It is feared that such techniques are a new battleground in [[disinformation]].<ref>Reuters, 15 July 2020, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E Deepfake Used to Attack Activist Couple Shows New Disinformation Frontier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926073638/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E |date=26 September 2020 }}</ref>

Collections of deepfake photographs of non-existent people on [[social networks]] have also been deployed as part of Israeli [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] propaganda. The [[Facebook]] page "Zionist Spring" featured photos of non-existent persons along with their "testimonies" purporting to explain why they have abandoned their left-leaning politics to embrace [[right-wing politics]], and the page also contained large numbers of posts from [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and his son and from other Israeli right wing sources. The photographs appear to have been generated by "[[human image synthesis]]" technology, computer software that takes data from photos of real people to produce a realistic composite image of a non-existent person. In much of the "testimonies," the reason given for embracing the political right was the shock of learning of alleged [[incitement]] to violence against the prime minister. Right wing Israeli television broadcasters then broadcast the "testimonies" of these non-existent people based on the fact that they were being "shared" online. The broadcasters aired these "testimonies" despite being unable to find such people, explaining "Why does the origin matter?" Other Facebook fake profiles—profiles of fictitious individuals—contained material that allegedly contained such incitement against the right wing prime minister, in response to which the prime minister complained that there was a plot to murder him.<ref>972 Magazine, 12 August 2020, [https://www.972mag.com/leftists-for-bibi-deepfake-pro-netanyahu-propaganda-exposed/ "'Leftists for Bibi'?

Though fake photos have long been plentiful, faking motion pictures has been more difficult, and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not.<ref name="Bezmalinovic-2018" /> AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology, and that the problem is not a technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism.<ref name="Bezmalinovic-2018" /> Computer science associate professor [[Hao Li]] of the [[University of Southern California]] states that deepfakes created for malicious use, such as [[fake news]], will be even more harmful if nothing is done to spread awareness of deepfake technology.<ref name="Perfect">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/10/02/deepfake-technology|title=Perfect Deepfake Tech Could Arrive Sooner Than Expected|website=www.wbur.org|date=2 October 2019 |access-date=2019-11-09|archive-date=30 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030164611/https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/10/02/deepfake-technology|url-status=live}}</ref> Li predicted that genuine videos and deepfakes would become indistinguishable in as soon as half a year, as of October 2019, due to rapid advancement in [[artificial intelligence]] and computer graphics.<ref name="Perfect" /> Former [[Google]] fraud czar [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] has called deepfakes an area of "societal concern" and said that they will inevitably evolve to a point at which they can be generated automatically, and an individual could use that technology to produce millions of deepfake videos.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sonnemaker|first=Tyler|title=As social media platforms brace for the incoming wave of deepfakes, Google's former 'fraud czar' predicts the biggest danger is that deepfakes will eventually become boring|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ex-fraud-czar-danger-of-deepfakes-is-becoming-boring-2020-1|access-date=2021-04-14|website=Business Insider|archive-date=14 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414002924/https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ex-fraud-czar-danger-of-deepfakes-is-becoming-boring-2020-1|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Credibility of information ===
A primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium's content corresponds to the truth.<ref name="Bezmalinovic-2018" /><ref name="Vaccari">{{cite journal |last1=Vaccari |first1=Cristian |last2=Chadwick |first2=Andrew |title=Deepfakes and Disinformation: Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Political Video on Deception, Uncertainty, and Trust in News |journal=Social Media + Society |date=January 2020 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=205630512090340 |doi=10.1177/2056305120903408 |s2cid=214265502 |issn=2056-3051|doi-access=free }}</ref> Deepfakes are one of a number of tools for [[disinformation attack]], creating doubt, and undermining trust.

===Defamation===
Deepfakes possess the ability to damage individual entities tremendously.<ref name="Bateman-2020">{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=Jon|date=2020|title=Summary|journal=Deepfakes and Synthetic Media in the Financial System|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25783.6|pages=1–2|access-date=28 October 2020|archive-date=20 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420005800/https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25783.6|url-status=live}}</ref> This is because deepfakes are often targeted at one individual, and/or their relations to others in hopes to create a narrative powerful enough to influence public opinion or beliefs. This can be done through deepfake voice phishing, which manipulates audio to create fake phone calls or conversations.<ref name="Bateman-2020" /> Another method of deepfake use is fabricated private remarks, which manipulate media to convey individuals voicing damaging comments.<ref name="Bateman-2020" /> The quality of a negative video or audio does not need to be that high. As long as someone's likeness and actions are recognizable, a deepfake can hurt their reputation.<ref name="Deepfakes explained" />

In September 2020 Microsoft made public that they are developing a Deepfake detection software tool.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelion |first1=Leo |title=Deepfake detection tool unveiled by Microsoft |work=BBC News |date=September 2020 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53984114 |access-date=15 April 2021 |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414182803/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53984114 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Detection ===

==== Audio ====
Detecting fake audio is a highly complex task that requires careful attention to the audio signal in order to achieve good performance. Using deep learning, preprocessing of feature design and masking augmentation have been proven effective in improving performance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Ariel |last2=Rimon |first2=Inbal |last3=Aflalo |first3=Eran |last4=Permuter |first4=Haim H. |title=A study on data augmentation in voice anti-spoofing |journal=Speech Communication |date=June 2022 |volume=141 |pages=56–67 |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2022.04.005|arxiv=2110.10491 |s2cid=239050551 }}</ref>

The first generation <ref name="Scholar-search-2022a" /> used [[recurrent neural network]]s to spot spatio-temporal inconsistencies to identify visual artifacts left by the deepfake generation process. The algorithm achieved 96% accuracy on FaceForensics++, the only large-scale deepfake benchmark available at that time. The second generation <ref name="Scholar-search-2022b" /> used end-to-end deep networks to differentiate between artifacts and high-level semantic facial information using two-branch networks. The first branch propagates colour information while the other branch suppresses facial content and amplifies low-level frequencies using [[Blob detection#The Laplacian of Gaussian|Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)]]. Further, they included a new loss function that learns a compact representation of bona fide faces, while dispersing the representations (i.e. features) of deepfakes. VIMAL's approach showed state-of-the-art performance on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF benchmarks, and on [[#Volodymyr Zelenskyy|March 16, 2022]] (the same day of the release), was used to identify the deepfake of Volodymyr Zelensky out-of-the-box without any retraining or knowledge of the algorithm with which the deepfake was created. {{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

On September 29, 2020, deepfakes of [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] and [[Russia]]n President [[Vladimir Putin]] were uploaded to YouTube, created by a nonpartisan advocacy group [[RepresentUs]].<ref name="Hao-2020">{{Cite web |title=Deepfake Putin is here to warn Americans about their self-inflicted doom |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/29/1009098/ai-deepfake-putin-kim-jong-un-us-election/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030140905/https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/29/1009098/ai-deepfake-putin-kim-jong-un-us-election/ |archive-date=30 October 2020 |access-date=2020-10-07 |website=MIT Technology Review }}</ref>

The deepfakes of Kim and Putin were meant to air publicly as commercials to relay the notion that interference by these leaders in US elections would be detrimental to the United States' democracy. The commercials also aimed to shock Americans to realize how fragile democracy is, and how media and news can significantly influence the country's path regardless of credibility.<ref name="Hao-2020" /> However, while the commercials included an ending comment detailing that the footage was not real, they ultimately did not air due to fears and sensitivity regarding how Americans may react.<ref name="Hao-2020" />

On June 5, 2023, an unknown source broadcast a reported deepfake of Vladimir Putin on multiple radio and television networks.

=== Volodymyr Zelenskyy ===
On March 16, 2022, a one-minute long deepfake video depicting Ukraine's president [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] seemingly telling his soldiers to lay down their arms and surrender during the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] was circulated on social media.<ref name="Pawelec"/> Russian social media boosted it, but after it was debunked, Facebook and YouTube removed it. Twitter allowed the video in tweets where it was exposed as a fake, but said it would be taken down if posted to deceive people. Hackers inserted the disinformation into a live scrolling-text news crawl on TV station Ukraine 24, and the video appeared briefly on the station's website in addition to false claims that Zelenskyy had fled his country's capital, [[Kyiv]]. It was not immediately clear who created the deepfake, to which Zelenskyy responded with his own video, saying, "We don't plan to lay down any arms. Until our victory."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2022/03/16/1087062648/deepfake-video-zelenskyy-experts-war-manipulation-ukraine-russia | title=Deepfake video of Zelenskyy could be 'tip of the iceberg' in info war, experts warn | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=March 16, 2022 | access-date=March 17, 2022 | author=Allyn, Bobby | archive-date=29 March 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220329190821/https://www.npr.org/2022/03/16/1087062648/deepfake-video-zelenskyy-experts-war-manipulation-ukraine-russia | url-status=live }}</ref>

In Europe, the European Union's 2024 [[Artificial Intelligence Act]] (AI Act) takes a risk-based approach to regulating AI systems, including deepfakes. It establishes categories of "unacceptable risk," "high risk," "specific/limited or transparency risk", and "minimal risk" to determine the level of regulatory obligations for AI providers and users. However, the lack of clear definitions for these risk categories in the context of deepfakes creates potential challenges for effective implementation. Legal scholars have raised concerns about the classification of deepfakes intended for political misinformation or the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery. Debate exists over whether such uses should always be considered "high-risk" AI systems, which would lead to stricter regulatory requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Romero-Moreno |first=Felipe |date=29 March 2024 |title=Generative AI and deepfakes: a human rights approach to tackling harmful content |journal=International Review of Law, Computers & Technology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=297–326|doi-access=free |doi=10.1080/13600869.2024.2324540 |issn=1360-0869 |hdl-access=free |hdl=2299/20431}}</ref>
