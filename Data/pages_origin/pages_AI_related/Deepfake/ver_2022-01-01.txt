== History ==
[[Photo manipulation]] was developed in the 19th century and soon applied to [[Film|motion pictures]]. Technology steadily improved during the 20th century, and more quickly with [[digital video]].

Deepfake technology has been developed by researchers at academic institutions beginning in the 1990s, and later by amateurs in online communities.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/|title=Top AI researchers race to detect 'deepfake' videos: 'We are outgunned'|last=Harwell|first=Drew|date=12 June 2019|website=The Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=31 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031051258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-ai-future-fake-news-may-be-easily-faked-video-ncna845726|title=Thanks to AI, the future of 'fake news' is being pioneered in homemade porn|last=Sanchez|first=Julian|date=8 February 2018|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=9 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109084341/https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-ai-future-fake-news-may-be-easily-faked-video-ncna845726|url-status=live}}</ref> More recently the methods have been adopted by industry.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|title=Another convincing deepfake app goes viral prompting immediate privacy backlash|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-09-02|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903202859/https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Academic research ===
Academic research related to deepfakes lies predominantly within the field of [[computer vision]], a subfield of computer science.<ref name=":11" /> An early landmark project was the Video Rewrite program, published in 1997, which modified existing video footage of a person speaking to depict that person mouthing the words contained in a different audio track.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Bregler|first1=Christoph|last2=Covell|first2=Michele|last3=Slaney|first3=Malcolm|date=1997|title=Video Rewrite: Driving Visual Speech with Audio|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques|volume=24|pages=353–360|doi=10.1145/258734.258880|s2cid=2341707}}</ref> It was the first system to fully automate this kind of facial reanimation, and it did so using machine learning techniques to make connections between the sounds produced by a video's subject and the shape of the subject's face.<ref name=":6" />

Contemporary academic projects have focused on creating more realistic videos and on improving techniques.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Suwajanakorn|first1=Supasorn|last2=Seitz|first2=Steven M.|last3=Kemelmacher-Shlizerman|first3=Ira|date=July 2017|title=Synthesizing Obama: Learning Lip Sync from Audio|journal=ACM Trans.

In August 2018, researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] published a paper introducing a fake dancing app that can create the impression of masterful dancing ability using AI.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|last=Farquhar|first=Peter|date=2018-08-27|title=An AI program will soon be here to help your deepface dancing – just don't call it deepfake|language=en|work=Business Insider Australia|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/artificial-intelligence-ai-deepfake-dancing-2018-8|access-date=2018-08-27|archive-date=10 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410050633/https://www.businessinsider.com.au/artificial-intelligence-ai-deepfake-dancing-2018-8|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite news|title=Deepfakes for dancing: you can now use AI to fake those dance moves you always wanted|work=The Verge|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/26/17778792/deepfakes-video-dancing-ai-synthesis|access-date=2018-08-27|archive-date=17 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517055341/https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/26/17778792/deepfakes-video-dancing-ai-synthesis|url-status=live}}</ref> This project expands the application of deepfakes to the entire body; previous works focused on the head or parts of the face.<ref name=":9" />

Researchers have also shown that deepfakes are expanding into other domains such as tampering medical imagery.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yisroel|last2=Mahler|first2=Tom|last3=Shelef|first3=Ilan|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|date=2019|title=CT-GAN: Malicious Tampering of 3D Medical Imagery using Deep Learning|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/mirsky|language=en|pages=461–478|isbn=978-1-939133-06-9|access-date=18 June 2020|archive-date=20 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620075305/https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/mirsky|url-status=live}}</ref>  In this work, it was shown how an attacker can automatically inject or remove lung cancer in a patient's 3D CT scan. The result was so convincing that it fooled three radiologists and a state-of-the-art lung cancer detection AI. To demonstrate the threat, the authors successfully [https://gizmodo.com/researchers-demonstrate-malware-that-can-trick-doctors-1833786672 performed the attack on a hospital] in a [[White hat (computer security)|White hat penetration test]].

A survey of deepfakes, published in May 2020, provides a timeline of how the creation and detection deepfakes have advanced over the last few years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yisroel|last2=Lee|first2=Wenke|date=2020-05-12|title=The Creation and Detection of Deepfakes: A Survey|doi=10.1145/3425780|arxiv=2004.11138|s2cid=216080410}}</ref> The survey identifies that researchers have been focusing on resolving the following challenges of deepfake creation:

* Generalization.  High-quality deepfakes are often achieved by training on hours of footage of the target. This challenge is to minimize the amount of training data required to produce quality images and to enable the execution of trained models on ''new'' identities (unseen during training).
* Paired Training. Training a supervised model can produce high-quality results, but requires data pairing. This is the process of finding examples of inputs and their desired outputs for the model to learn from. Data pairing is laborious and impractical when training on multiple identities and facial behaviors. Some solutions include self-supervised training (using frames from the same video), the use of unpaired networks such as Cycle-GAN, or the manipulation of network embeddings.
* Identity leakage.  This is where the identity of the driver (i.e., the actor controlling the face in a reenactment) is partially transferred to the generated face. Some solutions proposed include attention mechanisms, few-shot learning, disentanglement, boundary conversions, and skip connections.
* Occlusions. When part of the face is obstructed with a hand, hair, glasses, or any other item then artifacts can occur. A common occlusion is a closed mouth which hides the inside of the mouth and the teeth. Some solutions include image segmentation during training and in-painting.
* Temporal coherence. In videos containing deepfakes, artifacts such as flickering and jitter can occur because the network has no context of the preceding frames. Some researchers provide this context or use novel temporal coherence losses to help improve realism. As the technology improves, the interference is diminishing.

Overall, deepfakes are expected to have several implications in media and society, media production, media representations, media audiences, gender, law, and regulation, and politics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karnouskos |first1=Stamatis |title=Artificial Intelligence in Digital Media: The Era of Deepfakes |journal=IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society |date=2020 |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=1 |doi=10.1109/TTS.2020.3001312 |s2cid=221716206 |url=https://papers.duckdns.org/files/2020_Deepfakes.pdf |access-date=9 July 2020 |archive-date=14 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032923/https://papers.duckdns.org/files/2020_Deepfakes.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Resurrection ===
Deepfakes technology can not only be used to fabricate messages and actions of others, but it can also be used to revive deceased individuals.

There has also been deepfake resurrection of pop cultural and historical figures who were murdered, for example, the member of [[The Beatles]], [[John Lennon]], murdered in [[1980]].{{cn|date=November 2021}}

== Techniques ==
[[File:Morphing madness.jpg|thumb|Deepfake technology used to create facial morphing]]
Deepfakes rely on a type of [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] called an [[autoencoder]].<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alanzucconi.com/2018/03/14/understanding-the-technology-behind-deepfakes/|title=Understanding the Technology Behind DeepFakes|last=Zucconi|first=Alan|date=2018-03-14|website=Alan Zucconi|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=1 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101164537/https://www.alanzucconi.com/2018/03/14/understanding-the-technology-behind-deepfakes/|url-status=live}}</ref> These consist of an encoder, which reduces an image to a lower dimensional [[latent space]], and a decoder, which reconstructs the image from the latent representation. Deepfakes utilize this architecture by having a universal encoder which encodes a person in to the latent space.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/what-the-heck-are-vae-gans-17b86023588a|title=What The Heck Are VAE-GANs?|last=Kan|first=C.

This can then be decoded with a model trained specifically for the target.<ref name=":14" /> This means the target's detailed information will be superimposed on the underlying facial and body features of the original video, represented in the latent space.<ref name=":14" />

A popular upgrade to this architecture attaches a [[generative adversarial network]] to the decoder.<ref name=":15" /> A [[General adversarial network|GAN]] trains a generator, in this case the decoder, and a discriminator in an adversarial relationship.<ref name=":15" /> The generator creates new images from the latent representation of the source material, while the discriminator attempts to determine whether or not the image is generated.<ref name=":15" /> This causes the generator to create images that mimic reality extremely well as any defects would be caught by the discriminator.<ref name=":16">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/|title=These New Tricks Can Outsmart Deepfake Videos—for Now|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-09|language=en|issn=1059-1028|archive-date=3 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003055035/https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/|url-status=live}}</ref> Both algorithms improve constantly in a [[Zero-sum game|zero sum game]].<ref name=":15" /> This makes deepfakes difficult to combat as they are constantly evolving; any time a defect is determined, it can be corrected.<ref name=":16" />

==Applications==
=== Blackmail ===
Deepfakes can be used to generate blackmail materials that falsely incriminate a victim. However, since the fakes cannot reliably be distinguished from genuine materials, victims of actual blackmail can now claim that the true artifacts are fakes, granting them plausible deniability. The effect is to void credibility of existing blackmail materials, which erases loyalty to blackmailers and destroys the blackmailer's control. This phenomenon can be termed "blackmail inflation", since it "devalues" real blackmail, rendering it worthless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultstate.com/2020/05/24/Podcast-18--Blackmail-Inflation/|last1=Limberg|first1=Peter|title=Blackmail Inflation|website=CultState|date=2020-05-24|access-date=2021-01-18|archive-date=24 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124155722/https://cultstate.com/2020/05/24/Podcast-18--Blackmail-Inflation/|url-status=live}}</ref> It is possible to repurpose commodity cryptocurrency mining hardware with a small software program to generate this blackmail content for any number of subjects in huge quantities, driving up the supply of fake blackmail content limitlessly and in highly scalable fashion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://t.me/forKappy|title=For Kappy|website=Telegraph|date=2020-05-24|access-date=2021-01-18|archive-date=24 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124155641/https://t.me/forKappy|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2018 the multidisciplinary artist Joseph Ayerle published the [[video art|video artwork]] ''Un'emozione per sempre 2.0'' (English title: ''The Italian Game''). The artist worked with Deepfake technology to create an ''AI actress'', a synthetic version of 80's movie star [[Ornella Muti]], traveling in time from 1978 to 2018. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] referred this artwork in the study "Collective Wisdom".<ref>Katerina Cizek, William Uricchio, and Sarah Wolozin: Collective Wisdom | Massachusetts Institute of Technology [https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304015015/https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6 |date=4 March 2020 }}</ref> The artist used Ornella Muti's [[time travel]] to explore generational reflections, while also investigating questions about the role of provocation in the world of art.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/toscana/notizie/2017/11/03/ornella-muti-in-cortometraggio-a-firenze_36349008-ce7b-4c7e-8742-43e28f7225f4.html |title=ANSA {{!}} Ornella Muti in cortometraggio a Firenze |date=3 November 2017 |access-date=27 February 2020 |archive-date=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227220711/http://www.ansa.it/toscana/notizie/2017/11/03/ornella-muti-in-cortometraggio-a-firenze_36349008-ce7b-4c7e-8742-43e28f7225f4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> For the technical realization Ayerle used scenes of photo model [[Kendall Jenner]].

===Internet meme===
In 2020, an [[internet meme]] emerged utilizing deepfakes to generate videos of people singing the chorus of {{nihongo|"Baka Mitai"|ばかみたい}}, a song from the game ''[[Yakuza 0]]'' in the video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]''. In the series, the melancholic song is sung by the player in a [[karaoke]] [[minigame]].

The [[Congressional Research Service]] cited unspecified evidence as showing that foreign [[Intelligence officer|intelligence operatives]] used deepfakes to create social media accounts with the purposes of [[Recruitment of spies|recruiting]] individuals with access to [[classified information]].<ref name=CRS1/>

===Sockpuppets===
Deepfake photographs can be used to create [[sockpuppet (internet)|sockpuppets]], non-existent people, who are active both online and in traditional media. A deepfake photograph appears to have been generated together with a legend for an apparently non-existent person named Oliver Taylor, whose identity was described as a university student in the United Kingdom. The Oliver Taylor persona submitted opinion pieces in several newspapers and was active in online media attacking a British legal academic and his wife, as "terrorist symphathizers." The academic had drawn international attention in 2018 when he commenced a lawsuit in Israel against NSO, a surveillance company, on behalf of people in Mexico who alleged they were victims of NSO's [[phone hacking]] technology. Reuters could find only scant records for Oliver Taylor and "his" university had no records for him. Many experts agreed that "his" photo is a deepfake. Several newspapers have not retracted "his" articles or removed them from their websites. It is feared that such techniques are a new battleground in [[disinformation]].<ref>Reuters, 15 July 2020, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E Deepfake Used to Attack Activist Couple Shows New Disinformation Frontier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926073638/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E |date=26 September 2020 }}</ref>

Collections of deepfake photographs of non-existent people on [[social networks]] have also been deployed as part of Israeli [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] propaganda. The [[Facebook]] page "Zionist Spring" featured photos of non-existent persons along with their "testimonies" purporting to explain why they have abandoned their left-leaning politics to embrace the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], and the page also contained large numbers of posts from [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and his son and from other Israeli right wing sources. The photographs appear to have been generated by "[[human image synthesis]]" technology, computer software that takes data from photos of real people to produce a realistic composite image of a non-existent person. In much of the "testimony," the reason given for embracing the political right was the shock of learning of alleged [[incitement]] to violence against the prime minister. Right wing Israeli television broadcasters then broadcast the "testimony" of these non-existent person based on the fact that they were being "shared" online. The broadcasters aired the story, even though the broadcasters could not find such people, explaining "Why does the origin matter?" Other Facebook fake profiles—profiles of fictitious individuals—contained material that allegedly contained such incitement against the right wing prime minister, in response to which the prime minister complained that there was a plot to murder him.<ref>972 Magazine, 12 August 2020, [https://www.972mag.com/leftists-for-bibi-deepfake-pro-netanyahu-propaganda-exposed/ "‘Leftists for Bibi’?

=== Credibility and authenticity ===
Though fake photos have long been plentiful, faking motion pictures has been more difficult, and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not.<ref name=":0" /> AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology, and that the problem is not a technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism.<ref name=":0" /> Deepfakes can be leveraged to defame, impersonate, and spread disinformation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Weaponised deep fakes: National security and democracy on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25129|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|archive-date=22 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022150916/https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25129|url-status=live}}</ref> The primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium's content corresponds to the truth.<ref name=":0" />

In this skit (aired 4 May 2016), Jimmy Fallon dressed up as Donald Trump and pretended to participate in a phone call with Barack Obama, conversing in a manner that presented him to be bragging about his primary win in Indiana.<ref name=":34">{{Cite web|title=The rise of the deepfake and the threat to democracy|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jun/22/the-rise-of-the-deepfake-and-the-threat-to-democracy|access-date=2020-11-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-date=1 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101063543/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jun/22/the-rise-of-the-deepfake-and-the-threat-to-democracy|url-status=live}}</ref> On 5 May 2019 a deepfake of Donald Trump (taken from this skit) was created.<ref name=":34" /> In this deepfake, Jimmy Fallon's face was transformed into Donald Trump's face (audio remained the same). This deepfake video was uploaded to YouTube by the founder of Derpfakes with a comedic intent.

==== Barack Obama deepfake ====
American actor [[Jordan Peele]], [[BuzzFeed]], and [[Monkeypaw Productions]] created and produced a deepfake of Barack Obama (uploaded to YouTube on 17 Apr 2018) that depicted Barack Obama cursing and calling Donald Trump names.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fagan|first=Kaylee|title=A viral video that appeared to show Obama calling Trump a 'dips---' shows a disturbing new trend called 'deepfakes'|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-deepfake-video-insulting-trump-2018-4|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Business Insider|archive-date=22 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922174210/https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-deepfake-video-insulting-trump-2018-4|url-status=live}}</ref> In this deepfake Peele's voice and mouth was transformed and manipulated into Obama's voice and face. The intent for this video was to portray the dangerous consequences and power of deepfakes, and how deepfakes can make anyone say anything.

=== Social media platforms ===

==== Twitter ====
[[Twitter]] is taking active measures to handle synthetic and manipulated media on their platform. In order to prevent disinformation from spreading, Twitter is placing a notice on tweets that contain manipulated media and/or deepfakes that signal to viewers that the media is manipulated.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=Help us shape our approach to synthetic and manipulated media|url=https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/synthetic_manipulated_media_policy_feedback.html|access-date=2020-10-07|website=blog.twitter.com|language=en-us|archive-date=28 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028211949/https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/synthetic_manipulated_media_policy_feedback.html|url-status=live}}</ref> There will also be a warning that appears to users who plan on retweeting, liking, or engaging with the tweet.<ref name=":02" /> Twitter will also work to provide users a link next to the tweet containing manipulated or synthetic media that links to a Twitter Moment or credible news article on the related topic—as a debunking action.<ref name=":02" /> Twitter also has the ability to remove any tweets containing deepfakes or manipulated media that may pose a harm to users’ safety.<ref name=":02" /> In order to better improve Twitter's detection of deepfakes and manipulated media, Twitter has asked users who are interesting in partnering with them to work on deepfake detection solutions to fill out a form (that is due 27 November 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|title=TechCrunch|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/twitter-drafts-a-deepfake-policy-that-would-label-and-warn-but-not-remove-manipulated-media/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|archive-date=14 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714032908/https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/twitter-drafts-a-deepfake-policy-that-would-label-and-warn-but-not-remove-manipulated-media/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Facebook ====
[[Facebook]] has taken efforts towards encouraging the creation of deepfakes in order to develop state of the art deepfake detection software. Facebook was the prominent partner in hosting the <u>Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)</u>, held December 2019, to 2114 participants who generated more than 35000 models.<ref name=":110">{{Cite web|title=Deepfake Detection Challenge Results: An open initiative to advance AI|url=https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge-results-an-open-initiative-to-advance-ai/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=ai.facebook.com|language=en|archive-date=29 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029023928/https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge-results-an-open-initiative-to-advance-ai|url-status=live}}</ref> The top performing models with the highest detection accuracy were analyzed for similarities and differences; these findings are areas of interest in further research to improve and refine  deepfake detection models .<ref name=":110" /> Facebook has also detailed that the platform will be taking down  media generated with artificial intelligence used to alter an individual's speech.<ref name=":210">{{Cite news|last=Paul|first=Katie|date=2020-02-04|title=Twitter to label deepfakes and other deceptive media|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-security-idUSKBN1ZY2OV|access-date=2020-10-07|archive-date=10 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010081053/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-security-idUSKBN1ZY2OV|url-status=live}}</ref> However, media that has been edited to alter the order or context of words in one's message would remain on the site but be labeled as false, since it was not generated by artificial intelligence.<ref name=":210" />

=== Detection ===
Most of the academic research surrounding deepfake seeks to detect the videos.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/06/18/researchers-use-facial-quirks-to-unmask-deepfakes/|title=Researchers use facial quirks to unmask 'deepfakes'|last1=18 June|first1=Kara Manke{{!}}|last2=201920 June|date=2019-06-18|website=Berkeley News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09|last3=2019|archive-date=9 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109021126/https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/06/18/researchers-use-facial-quirks-to-unmask-deepfakes/|url-status=live}}</ref> The most popular technique is to use algorithms similar to the ones used to build the deepfake to detect them.<ref name=":18" /> By recognizing patterns in how deepfakes are created the algorithm is able to pick up subtle inconsistencies.<ref name=":18" /> Researchers have developed automatic systems that examine videos for errors such as irregular blinking patterns of lighting.<ref name=":11" /> This technique has also been criticized for creating a "[[Zero sum game|Moving Goal post]]" where anytime the algorithms for detecting get better, so do the deepfakes.<ref name=":18" /> The Deepfake Detection Challenge, hosted by a coalition of leading tech companies, hope to accelerate the technology for identifying manipulated content.<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=https://deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai/|title=Join the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)|website=deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai|access-date=2019-11-08|archive-date=12 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112102819/https://deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai/|url-status=live}}</ref>

A team at the University of Buffalo published a paper in October 2020 outlining their technique of using reflections of light in the eyes of 
those depicted to spot deepfakes with a high rate of success, even without the use of an AI detection tool, at least for the time being.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title=Exposing GAN-Generated Faces Using Inconsistent Corneal Specular Highlights|eprint=2009.11924|last1=Hu|first1=Shu|last2=Li|first2=Yuezun|last3=Lyu|first3=Siwei|year=2020|class=cs.CV}}</ref>

Other techniques use [[blockchain]] to verify the source of the media.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-blockchain-solution-to-our-deepfake-problems/|title=The Blockchain Solution to Our Deepfake Problems|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-09|language=en|issn=1059-1028|archive-date=7 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107164023/https://www.wired.com/story/the-blockchain-solution-to-our-deepfake-problems/|url-status=live}}</ref> Videos will have to be verified through the ledger before they are shown on social media platforms.<ref name=":22" /> With this technology, only videos from trusted sources would be approved, decreasing the spread of possibly harmful deepfake media.<ref name=":22" />
