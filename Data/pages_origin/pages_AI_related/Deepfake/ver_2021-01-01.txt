== History ==
[[Photo manipulation]] was developed in the 19th century and soon applied to [[Film|motion pictures]]. Technology steadily improved during the 20th century, and more quickly with [[digital video]].

Deepfake technology has been developed by researchers at academic institutions beginning in the 1990s, and later by amateurs in online communities.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/12/top-ai-researchers-race-detect-deepfake-videos-we-are-outgunned/|title=Top AI researchers race to detect 'deepfake' videos: 'We are outgunned'|last=Harwell|first=Drew|date=12 June 2019|website=The Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-ai-future-fake-news-may-be-easily-faked-video-ncna845726|title=Thanks to AI, the future of 'fake news' is being pioneered in homemade porn|last=Sanchez|first=Julian|date=8 February 2018|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> More recently the methods have been adopted by industry.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|title=Another convincing deepfake app goes viral prompting immediate privacy backlash|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-09-02|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>

=== Academic research ===
Academic research related to deepfakes lies predominantly within the field of [[computer vision]], a subfield of computer science.<ref name=":11" /> An early landmark project was the Video Rewrite program, published in 1997, which modified existing video footage of a person speaking to depict that person mouthing the words contained in a different audio track.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Bregler|first1=Christoph|last2=Covell|first2=Michele|last3=Slaney|first3=Malcolm|date=1997|title=Video Rewrite: Driving Visual Speech with Audio|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques|volume=24|pages=353–360|doi=10.1145/258734.258880|s2cid=2341707}}</ref> It was the first system to fully automate this kind of facial reanimation, and it did so using machine learning techniques to make connections between the sounds produced by a video's subject and the shape of the subject's face.<ref name=":6" />

Contemporary academic projects have focused on creating more realistic videos and on improving techniques.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Suwajanakorn|first1=Supasorn|last2=Seitz|first2=Steven M.|last3=Kemelmacher-Shlizerman|first3=Ira|date=July 2017|title=Synthesizing Obama: Learning Lip Sync from Audio|journal=ACM Trans.

In August 2018, researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] published a paper introducing a fake dancing app that can create the impression of masterful dancing ability using AI.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|last=Farquhar|first=Peter|date=2018-08-27|title=An AI program will soon be here to help your deepface dancing – just don't call it deepfake|language=en|work=Business Insider Australia|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/artificial-intelligence-ai-deepfake-dancing-2018-8|access-date=2018-08-27}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite news|title=Deepfakes for dancing: you can now use AI to fake those dance moves you always wanted|work=The Verge|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/26/17778792/deepfakes-video-dancing-ai-synthesis|access-date=2018-08-27}}</ref> This project expands the application of deepfakes to the entire body; previous works focused on the head or parts of the face.<ref name=":9" />

Researchers have also shown that deepfakes are expanding into other domains such as tampering medical imagery.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yisroel|last2=Mahler|first2=Tom|last3=Shelef|first3=Ilan|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|date=2019|title=CT-GAN: Malicious Tampering of 3D Medical Imagery using Deep Learning|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/mirsky|language=en|pages=461–478|isbn=978-1-939133-06-9}}</ref>  In this work, it was shown how an attacker can automatically inject or remove lung cancer in a patient's 3D CT scan. The result was so convincing that it fooled three radiologists and a state-of-the-art lung cancer detection AI. To demonstrate the threat, the authors successfully [https://gizmodo.com/researchers-demonstrate-malware-that-can-trick-doctors-1833786672 performed the attack on a hospital] in a white hat penetration test.

A survey of deepfakes, published in May 2020, provides a timeline of how the creation and detection deepfakes have advanced over the last few years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yisroel|last2=Lee|first2=Wenke|date=2020-05-12|title=The Creation and Detection of Deepfakes: A Survey|doi=10.1145/3425780|doi-broken-date=26 December 2020|arxiv=2004.11138}}</ref> The survey identifies that researchers have been focusing on resolving the following challenges of deepfake creation:

* Generalization.  High-quality deepfakes are often achieved by training on hours of footage of the target. This challenge is to minimize the amount of training data required to produce quality images and to enable the execution of trained models on ''new'' identities (unseen during training).
* Paired Training. Training a supervised model can produce high-quality results, but requires data pairing. This is the process of finding examples of inputs and their desired outputs for the model to learn from. Data pairing is laborious and impractical when training on multiple identities and facial behaviors. Some solutions include self-supervised training (using frames from the same video), the use of unpaired networks such as Cycle-GAN, or the manipulation of network embeddings.
* Identity leakage.  This is where the identity of the driver (i.e., the actor controlling the face in a reenactment) is partially transferred to the generated face. Some solutions proposed include attention mechanisms, few-shot learning, disentanglement, boundary conversions, and skip connections.
* Occlusions. When part of the face is obstructed with a hand, hair, glasses, or any other item then artifacts can occur. A common occlusion is a closed mouth which hides the inside of the mouth and the teeth. Some solutions include image segmentation during training and in-painting.
* Temporal coherence. In videos containing deepfakes, artifacts such as flickering and jitter can occur because the network has no context of the preceding frames. Some researchers provide this context or use novel temporal coherence losses to help improve realism. As the technology improves, the interference is diminishing.

Overall, Deepfakes are expected to have several implications in media and society, media production, media representations, media audiences, gender, law, and regulation, and politics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karnouskos |first1=Stamatis |title=Artificial Intelligence in Digital Media: The Era of Deepfakes |journal=IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society |date=2020 |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=1 |doi=10.1109/TTS.2020.3001312 |s2cid=221716206 |url=https://papers.duckdns.org/files/2020_Deepfakes.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2020}}</ref>

=== Amateur development ===
The term deepfakes originated around the end of 2017 from a [[Reddit]] user named "deepfakes".<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjye8a/reddit-fake-porn-app-daisy-ridley|title=We Are Truly Fucked: Everyone Is Making AI-Generated Fake Porn Now|last=Cole|first=Samantha|date=24 January 2018|website=Vice|access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref> He, as well as others in the Reddit community r/deepfakes, shared deepfakes they created; many videos involved celebrities’ faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos,<ref name=":3" /> while non-pornographic content included many videos with actor [[Nicolas Cage]]’s face swapped into various movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2018/01/31/nicolas-cage-face-swapping-deepfakes/|title=People Are Using Face-Swapping Tech to Add Nicolas Cage to Random Movies and What Is 2018|last=Haysom|first=Sam|date=31 January 2018|website=Mashable|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

Other online communities remain, including Reddit communities that do not share pornography, such as r/SFWdeepfakes (short for "safe for work deepfakes"), in which community members share deepfakes depicting celebrities, politicians, and others in non-pornographic scenarios.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWdeepfakes/|title=r/SFWdeepfakes|website=Reddit|access-date=12 December 2018}}</ref> Other online communities continue to share pornography on platforms that have not banned deepfake pornography.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/deepfake-sites-reddit-ban/|title=Here's where 'deepfakes,' the new fake celebrity porn, went after the Reddit ban|last=Hathaway|first=Jay|date=8 February 2018|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=22 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Commercial development ===
In January 2018, a proprietary desktop application called FakeApp was launched.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/what-is-a-deepfake-and-how-are-they-made/|title=What is a Deepfake and How Are They Made?|date=2019-05-23|website=Online Tech Tips|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> This app allows users to easily create and share videos with their faces swapped with each other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/11/16992986/fakeapp-deepfakes-ai-face-swapping|title=I'm using AI to face-swap Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and I'm really bad at it|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2018-02-11|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> As of 2019, FakeApp has been superseded by open-source alternatives such as Faceswap and the command line-based DeepFaceLab.<ref name=":12">{{cite web|url=https://faceswap.dev|title=Faceswap is the leading free and Open Source multi-platform Deepfakes software.|date=15 October 2019|via=WordPress}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab|title=DeepFaceLab is a tool that utilizes machine learning to replace faces in videos.

Larger companies are also starting to use deepfakes.<ref name=":2" /> The mobile app giant [[Momo (software)|Momo]] created the application Zao which allows users to superimpose their face on television and movie clips with a single picture.<ref name=":2" /> The Japanese AI company DataGrid made a full body deepfake that can create a person from scratch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90407145/youve-been-warned-full-body-deepfakes-are-the-next-step-in-ai-based-human-mimicry|title=You've been warned: Full body deepfakes are the next step in AI-based human mimicry|last=Pangburn|first=D.

=== Resurrection ===
Deepfakes technology can not only be used to fabricate messages and actions of others, but it can also be used to revive individuals who have passed away. On 29 October 2020, Kim Kardashian posted a video of her late father [[Robert Kardashian]]; the face in the video of Robert Kardashian was created with deepfake technogy.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-31|title=Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and her dad: Should we make holograms of the dead?|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54753214|access-date=2020-11-11}}</ref> This hologram was created by the company Kaleida, where they use a combination of performance, motion tracking, SFX, VFX and DeepFake technologies in their [[Holography|hologram]] creation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Modems|first=The|date=2020-10-30|title=KANYE WEST GAVE KIM KARDASHIAN A HOLOGRAM OF HER FATHER FOR HER BIRTHDAY|url=https://www.themodems.com/post/kanye-west-gave-kim-kardashian-a-hologram-of-her-father-for-her-birthday|access-date=2020-11-11|website=themodems|language=en}}</ref>


There was also an instance where Joaquin Oliver, victim of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Parkland shooting]] was resurrected with deepfake technology. Oliver's parents teamed up on behalf of their organization Nonprofit Change the Ref, with McCann Health to produce this deepfake video advocating for gun-safety voting campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-02|title=Parkland victim Joaquin Oliver comes back to life in heartbreaking plea to voters|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/parkland-victim-joaquin-oliver-comes-back-life-heartbreaking-plea-voters/2285166|access-date=2020-11-11|website=adage.com|language=en}}</ref> In this deepfake message, it shows Joaquin encouraging viewers to vote.

Deepfakes rely on a type of [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] called an [[autoencoder]].<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alanzucconi.com/2018/03/14/understanding-the-technology-behind-deepfakes/|title=Understanding the Technology Behind DeepFakes|last=Zucconi|first=Alan|date=2018-03-14|website=Alan Zucconi|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> These consist of an encoder, which reduces an image to a lower dimensional latent space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the image from the latent representation. Deepfakes utilize this architecture by having a universal encoder which encodes a person in to the latent space.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://towardsdatascience.com/what-the-heck-are-vae-gans-17b86023588a|title=What The Heck Are VAE-GANs?|last=Kan|first=C. E.|date=2018-12-10|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The latent representation contains key features about their facial features and body posture. This can then be decoded with a model trained specifically for the target.<ref name=":14" /> This means the target's detailed information will be superimposed on the underlying facial and body features of the original video, represented in the latent space.<ref name=":14" />

A popular upgrade to this architecture attaches a [[generative adversarial network]] to the decoder.<ref name=":15" /> A [[General adversarial network|GAN]] trains a generator, in this case the decoder, and a discriminator in an adversarial relationship.<ref name=":15" /> The generator creates new images from the latent representation of the source material, while the discriminator attempts to determine whether or not the image is generated.<ref name=":15" /> This causes the generator to create images that mimic reality extremely well as any defects would be caught by the discriminator.<ref name=":16">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/these-new-tricks-can-outsmart-deepfake-videosfor-now/|title=These New Tricks Can Outsmart Deepfake Videos—for Now|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-09|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Both algorithms improve constantly in a [[Zero-sum game|zero sum game]].<ref name=":15" /> This makes deepfakes difficult to combat as they are constantly evolving; any time a defect is determined, it can be corrected.<ref name=":16" />

===Politics===

Deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well-known politicians in videos.

* During the [[2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election]] campaign, the Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party used similar technology to distribute a version of an English-language campaign advertisement by its leader, [[Manoj Tiwari]], translated into [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]] to target [[Haryana]] voters. A voiceover was provided by an actor, and AI trained using video of Tiwari speeches was used to lip-sync the video to the new voiceover. A party staff member described it as a "positive" use of deepfake technology, which allowed them to "convincingly approach the target audience even if the candidate didn't speak the language of the voter."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/jgedjb/the-first-use-of-deepfakes-in-indian-election-by-bjp|title=We've Just Seen the First Use of Deepfakes in an Indian Election Campaign|last=Christopher|first=Nilesh|date=2020-02-18|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>

===Art===
In March 2018 the multidisciplinary artist Joseph Ayerle published the [[video art|videoartwork]] ''Un'emozione per sempre 2.0'' (English title: ''The Italian Game''). The artist worked with Deepfake technology to create an ''AI actress'', a synthetic version of 80s movie star [[Ornella Muti]], traveling in time from 1978 to 2018. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] referred this artwork in the study "Creative Wisdom".<ref>Katerina Cizek, William Uricchio, and Sarah Wolozin: Collective Wisdom | Massachusetts Institute of Technology [https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/collective-wisdom-part-6]</ref> The artist used Ornella Muti's [[time travel]] to explore generational reflections, while also investigating questions about the role of provocation in the world of art.<ref>[http://www.ansa.it/toscana/notizie/2017/11/03/ornella-muti-in-cortometraggio-a-firenze_36349008-ce7b-4c7e-8742-43e28f7225f4.html ANSA | Ornella Muti in cortometraggio a Firenze]</ref> For the technical realization Ayerle used scenes of photo model [[Kendall Jenner]]. The Artificial Intelligence replaced Jenner's face by an AI calculated face of Ornella Muti. As a result, the AI actress has the face of the Italian actress Ornella Muti and the body of Kendall Jenner.

===Acting===
There has been speculation about deepfakes being used for creating digital actors for future films. Digitally constructed/altered humans have already been used in [[film]]s before, and deepfakes could contribute new developments in the near future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/in-the-age-of-deepfakes-could-virtual-actors-put-humans-out-of-business|title=In the age of deepfakes, could virtual actors put humans out of business?|last=Kemp|first=Luke|date=2019-07-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Deepfake technology has already been used to insert faces into existing films, such as the insertion of [[Harrison Ford]]'s young face onto Han Solo's face in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/17/17989214/harrison-ford-solo-movie-deepfake-technology|title=Harrison Ford is the star of Solo: A Star Wars Story thanks to deepfake technology|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|date=2018-10-17|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> and techniques similar to those used by deepfakes were used for the acting of Princess Leia in ''[[Rogue One]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612241/how-acting-as-carrie-fishers-puppet-made-a-career-for-rogue-ones-princess-leia/|title=How acting as Carrie Fisher's puppet made a career for Rogue One's Princess Leia|last=Winick|first=Erin|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>

===Internet meme===
In 2020, an [[internet meme]] emerged utilizing deepfakes to generate videos of people singing the chorus of {{nihongo|"Baka Mitai"|ばかみたい}}, a song from the video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]''. In the series, the melancholic song is sung by the player in a [[karaoke]] [[minigame]]. Most iterations of this meme use a 2017 video uploaded by user Dobbsyrules, who [[lip sync]]s the song, as a template.<ref>{{cite web |last1=C |first1=Kim |title=Coffin Dance and More: The Music Memes of 2020 So Far |url=https://www.musictimes.com/articles/82157/20200822/coffin-dance-and-more-the-music-memes-of-2020-so-far.htm |website=Music Times |accessdate=26 August 2020 |date=22 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sholihyn |first1=Ilyas |title=Someone deepfaked Singapore's politicians to lip-sync that Japanese meme song |url=https://www.asiaone.com/digital/someone-deepfaked-singapores-politicians-lip-sync-japanese-meme-song |accessdate=26 August 2020 |agency=[[AsiaOne]] |date=7 August 2020}}</ref>

=== Social media ===
Deepfakes have begun to see use in popular social media platforms, notably through Zao, a Chinese deepfake app that allows users to substitute their own faces onto those of characters in scenes from films and television shows such as ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/chinese-deepfake-app-zao-goes-viral-faces-immediate-criticism-over-user-data-and-security-policy/|title=Chinese Deepfake App Zao Goes Viral, Faces Immediate Criticism Over User Data And Security Policy|last=Damiani|first=Jesse|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> The app originally faced scrutiny over its invasive user data and privacy policy, after which the company put out a statement claiming it would revise the policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns|title=Another convincing deepfake app goes viral prompting immediate privacy backlash|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=2019-09-02|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> In January 2020 Facebook announced that it was introducing new measures to counter this on its platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/ahead-of-irish-and-us-elections-facebook-announces-new-measures-against-deepfake-videos-38840513.html|title=Ahead of Irish and US elections, Facebook announces new measures against 'deepfake' videos|website=Independent.ie|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>

===Sockpuppets===
Deepfake photographs can be used to create [[sockpuppet (internet)|sockpuppets]], non-existent persons, who are active both online and in traditional media. A deepfake photograph appears to have been generated together with a legend for an apparently non-existent person named Oliver Taylor, whose identity was described as a university student in the United Kingdom. The Oliver Taylor persona submitted opinion pieces in several newspapers and was active in online media attacking a British legal academic and his wife, as "terrorist symphathizers." Theacademic had drawn international attention in 2018 when he commenced a lawsuit in Israel against NSO, a surveillance company, on behalf of people in Mexico who alleged they were victims of NSO's [[phone hacking]] technology. Reuters could find only scant records for Oliver Taylor and "his" university had no records for him. Many experts agreed that "his" photo is a deepfake. Several newspapers have not retracted "his" articles or removed them from their websites. It is feared that such techniques are a new battleground in [[disinformation]].<ref>Reuters, 15 July 2020, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E Deepfake Used to Attack Activist Couple Shows New Disinformation Frontier]</ref>

Collections of deepfake photographs of non-existent people on [[social networks]] have also been deployed as part of Israeli [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] propaganda. The [[Facebook]] page "Zionist Spring" featured photos of non-existent persons along with their "testimonies" purporting to explain why they have abandoned their left-leaning politics to embrace the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], and the page also contained large numbers of posts from [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and his son and from other Israeli right wing sources. The photographs appear to have been generated by "[[human image synthesis]]" technology, computer software that takes data from photos of real people to produce a realistic composite image of a non-existent person. In much of the "testimony," the reason given for embracing the political right was the shock of learning of alleged [[incitement]] to violence against the prime minister. Right wing Israeli television broadcasters then broadcast the "testimony" of these non-existent person based on the fact that they were being "shared" online. The broadcasters aired the story, even though the broadcasters could not find such people, explaining "Why does the origin matter?" Other Facebook fake profiles—profiles of fictitious individuals—contained material that allegedly contained such incitement against the right wing prime minister, in response to which the prime minister complained that there was a plot to murder him.<ref>972 Magazine, 12 August 2020, [https://www.972mag.com/leftists-for-bibi-deepfake-pro-netanyahu-propaganda-exposed/ "‘Leftists for Bibi’?

==Concerns==
===Fraud===
Audio deepfakes have been used as part of [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] scams, fooling people into thinking they are receiving instructions from a trusted individual.<ref name=":20">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851248/deepfakes-ai-fake-audio-phone-calls-thieves-trick-companies-stealing-money|title=Thieves are now using AI deepfakes to trick companies into sending them money|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=5 Sep 2019|accessdate=13 Sep 2019}}</ref> In 2019, a U.K.-based energy firm's CEO was scammed over the phone when he was ordered to transfer €220,000 into a Hungarian bank account by an individual who used audio deepfake technology to impersonate the voice of the firm's parent company's chief executive.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/a-voice-deepfake-was-used-to-scam-a-ceo-out-of-243000/|title=A Voice Deepfake Was Used To Scam A CEO Out Of $243,000|last=Damiani|first=Jesse|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>

=== Credibility and authenticity ===
Though fake photos have long been plentiful, faking motion pictures has been more difficult, and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not.<ref name=":0" /> AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology, and that the problem is not a technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism.<ref name=":0" /> Deepfakes can be leveraged to defame, impersonate, and spread disinformation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Weaponised deep fakes: National security and democracy on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25129|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.jstor.org|language=en}}</ref> The primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium's content corresponds to the truth.<ref name=":0" />

Similarly, computer science associate professor [[Hao Li]] of the [[University of Southern California]] states that deepfakes created for malicious use, such as fake news, will be even more harmful if nothing is done to spread awareness of deepfake technology.<ref name="Perfect">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/10/02/deepfake-technology|title=Perfect Deepfake Tech Could Arrive Sooner Than Expected|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Li predicted that genuine videos and deepfakes would become indistinguishable in as soon as half a year, as of October 2019, due to rapid advancement in [[artificial intelligence]] and computer graphics.<ref name="Perfect" />

The consequences of a deepfake are not significant enough to destabilize the entire government system; however, deepfakes possess the ability to damage individual entities tremendously.<ref name=":72">{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=Jon|date=2020|title=Summary|journal=Deepfakes and Synthetic Media in the Financial System|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25783.6|pages=1–2}}</ref> This is because deepfakes are often targeted at one individual, and/or their relations to others in hopes to create a narrative powerful enough to influence public opinion or beliefs. This can be done through deepfake voice phishing, which manipulates audio to create fake phone calls or conversations.<ref name=":72" /> Another method of deepfake use is fabricated private remarks, which manipulate media to convey individuals voicing damaging comments.<ref name=":72" />

==== Example events ====
[[File:Dictators_-_Kim_Jong-Un_by_RepresentUs.webm|thumb|"Kim Jong-Un"]] 
Deepfakes of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian president Vladimir Putin have also been created by a nonpartisan advocacy group RepresentUs.<ref name=":82">{{Cite web|title=Deepfake Putin is here to warn Americans about their self-inflicted doom|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/29/1009098/ai-deepfake-putin-kim-jong-un-us-election/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref> These deepfakes were meant to air publicly as commercials to relay the notion that interference by these leaders in US elections would be detrimental to the United States' democracy; the commercial also aimed to shock Americans to realize how fragile democracy is, and how media and news can significantly influence the country's path regardless of credibility.<ref name=":82" /> However, these commercials did include an ending comment detailing that the footage was not real, and the commercials ultimately did not air due to fears and sensitivity regarding how Americans may react.<ref name=":82" /> 

A clip from Nancy Pelosi's speech at the Center for American Progress given on 22 May 2019 was slowed down, in addition to the pitch being altered, to make it seem as if she were drunk; however, critics argue that this is not a deepfake.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Towers-Clark|first=Charles|title=Mona Lisa And Nancy Pelosi: The Implications Of Deepfakes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2019/05/31/mona-lisa-and-nancy-pelosi-the-implications-of-deepfakes/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

===== Donald Trump deepfake =====
A deepfake of Donald Trump was easily created based on a skit Jimmy Fallon performed on NBC's The Tonight Show. In this skit (aired 4 May 2016), Jimmy Fallon dressed up as Donald Trump and pretended to participate in a phone call with Barack Obama, conversing in a manner that presented him to be bragging about his primary win in Indiana.<ref name=":34">{{Cite web|title=The rise of the deepfake and the threat to democracy|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jun/22/the-rise-of-the-deepfake-and-the-threat-to-democracy|access-date=2020-11-03|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> On 5 May 2019 a deepfake of Donald Trump (taken from this skit) was created.<ref name=":34" /> In this deepfake, Jimmy Fallon's face was transformed into Donald Trump's face (audio remained the same). This deepfake video was uploaded to YouTube by the founder of Derpfakes with a comedic intent.

===== Barack Obama deepfake =====
American actor Jordan Peele, [[BuzzFeed]], and Monkeypaw Productions created and produced a deepfake of Barack Obama (uploaded to YouTube on 17 Apr 2018) that depicted Barack Obama cursing and calling Donald Trump names.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fagan|first=Kaylee|title=A viral video that appeared to show Obama calling Trump a 'dips---' shows a disturbing new trend called 'deepfakes'|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-deepfake-video-insulting-trump-2018-4|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Business Insider}}</ref> In this deepfake Peele's voice and mouth was transformed and manipulated into Obama's voice and face. The intent for this video was to portray the dangerous consequences and power of deepfakes, and how deepfakes can make anyone say anything.

== Positive implications ==
Potential positive innovations have also emerged alongside the growing popularity and creation of deepfakes. For example, corporate training videos can be created using deepfaked avatars and their voices. An example of this is Synthesia, which uses deepfake technology with avatars to create personalized videos.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chandler|first=Simon|title=Why Deepfakes Are A Net Positive For Humanity|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/03/09/why-deepfakes-are-a-net-positive-for-humanity/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

[[Facebook]] has taken efforts towards encouraging the creation of deepfakes in order to develop state of the art deepfake detection software. Facebook was the prominent partner in hosting the <u>Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)</u>, held December 2019, to 2114 participants who generated more than 35000 models. <ref name=":110">{{Cite web|title=Deepfake Detection Challenge Results: An open initiative to advance AI|url=https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfake-detection-challenge-results-an-open-initiative-to-advance-ai/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=ai.facebook.com|language=en}}</ref> The top performing models with the highest detection accuracy were analyzed for similarities and differences; these findings are areas of interest in further research to improve and refine  deepfake detection models .<ref name=":110" /> Facebook has also detailed that the platform will be taking down  media generated with artificial intelligence used to alter an individual's speech. <ref name=":210">{{Cite news|last=Paul|first=Katie|date=2020-02-04|title=Twitter to label deepfakes and other deceptive media|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-security-idUSKBN1ZY2OV|access-date=2020-10-07}}</ref> However, media that has been edited to alter the order or context of words in one's message would remain on the site but be labeled as false, since it was not generated by artificial intelligence.<ref name=":210" />

=== Detection ===
Most of the academic research surrounding Deepfake seeks to detect the videos.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/06/18/researchers-use-facial-quirks-to-unmask-deepfakes/|title=Researchers use facial quirks to unmask 'deepfakes'|last1=18 June|first1=Kara Manke{{!}}|last2=201920 June|date=2019-06-18|website=Berkeley News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-09|last3=2019}}</ref> The most popular technique is to use algorithms similar to the ones used to build the deepfake to detect them.<ref name=":18" /> By recognizing patterns in how Deepfakes are created the algorithm is able to pick up subtle inconsistencies.<ref name=":18" /> Researchers have developed automatic systems that examine videos for errors such as irregular blinking patterns of lighting.<ref name=":11" /> This technique has also been criticized for creating a "[[Zero sum game|Moving Goal post]]" where anytime the algorithms for detecting get better, so do the Deepfakes.<ref name=":18" /> The Deepfake Detection Challenge, hosted by a coalition of leading tech companies, hope to accelerate the technology for identifying manipulated content.<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=https://deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai/|title=Join the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)|website=deepfakedetectionchallenge.ai|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>

Other techniques use [[Blockchain]] to verify the source of the media.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-blockchain-solution-to-our-deepfake-problems/|title=The Blockchain Solution to Our Deepfake Problems|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-09|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> Videos will have to be verified through the ledger before they are shown on social media platforms.<ref name=":22" /> With this technology, only videos from trusted sources would be approved, decreasing the spread of possibly harmful Deepfake media.<ref name=":22" />

In November 2019 China announced that deepfakes and other synthetically faked footage should bear a clear notice about their fakeness starting in 2020. Failure to comply could be considered a [[crime]] the [[Cyberspace Administration of China]] stated on its website.<ref name="Reuters2019">
