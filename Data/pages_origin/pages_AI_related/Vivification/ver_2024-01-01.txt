{{Short description|Operation on a description logic knowledge base}}
'''Vivification''' is an operation on a [[description logic]] knowledge base to improve performance of a [[semantic reasoner]].  Vivification replaces a [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] of concepts <math>C_1 \sqcup C_2 \ldots \sqcup C_n</math> by the ''[[least common subsumer]]'' of the concepts <math>C_1,C_2,\ldots C_n</math>.

The goal of this operation is to improve the performance of the reasoner by replacing a complex set of concepts with a single concept which subsumes the original concepts. 

For example, consider the example given in (Cohen 92):  Suppose we have the concept <math>\textrm{PIANIST(Jill)} \vee \textrm{ORGANIST(Jill)}</math>.  This concept can be vivified into a simpler concept <math>\textrm{KEYBOARD-PLAYER(Jill)}</math>.  This summarization leads to an approximation that may not be exactly equivalent to the original.

== An approximation ==
[[Knowledge base]] vivification is not necessarily exact. If the reasoner is operating under the [[open world assumption]] we may get surprising results.  In the previous example, if we replace the disjunction with the vivified concept,  we will arrive at a surprising results.  

First, we find that the reasoner will no longer classify Jill as either a pianist or an organist.  Even though <math>\textrm{ORGANIST}</math> and <math>\textrm{PIANIST}</math> are the only two sub-classes, under the OWA we can no longer classify Jill as playing one or the other.  The reason is that there may be another keyboard instrument (e.g. a harpsichord) that Jill plays but which does not have a specific subclass.
