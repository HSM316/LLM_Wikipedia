In [[Process philosophy|philosophy]], a '''process ontology''' refers to a universal model of the structure of the world as an ordered wholeness.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas}} Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Sohst, Wolfgang|url=http://www.xenomoi.de/product_info.php/info/p180_NEU--Prozessontologie--Ein-systematischer-Entwurf-der-Entstehung-von-Existenz-.html|title=Prozessontologie.

Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any [[empirical]] proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical [[phenomena]] can be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental ontology is the so-called [[substance theory]]. However, fundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times, because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as "[[energy]]," "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]", and those of the physical dimensions of [[space]] and [[time]].

In [[computer science]], a '''process ontology''' is a description of the components and their relationships that make up a process. A formal process ontology is an [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take advantage of the benefits of an [[upper ontology]]. [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning software]] can be used to perform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its constraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning ontology.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/old/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=9–26}}</ref>

== Processes ==
A process may be defined as a set of transformations of input elements into output elements with specific properties, with the transformations characterized by parameters and constraints, such as in manufacturing or biology. A process may also be defined as the [[workflow]]s and [[sequence of events]] inherent in processes such as manufacturing, engineering and [[business process]]es.

== Ontologies ==

=== PSL ===
{{main|Process Specification Language}}
The Process Specification Language (PSL) is a process ontology developed for the formal description and modeling of basic manufacturing, engineering and business processes. This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level of event-instances, object-instances, and timepoints. PSL’s top level is built around the following:<ref>{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|page=16}}</ref>
* Activity – a class or type of action, such as install-part, which is the class of actions in which parts are installed
* Activity-occurrence – an event or action that takes place at a specific place and time, such as a specific instance of install-part occurring at a specific [[timestamp]]
* Timepoint – a point in time
* Object – anything that is not a timepoint or an activity

=== Cyc ===
{{main|Cyc}}
In a process/planning ontology developed for the ontology Cyc, classes and relations above the ground level of PSL allow processes to be described purely at the type-level.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|title=Process Representation and Planning in Cyc: From Scripts and Scenes to Constraints|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf|publisher=Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI), University of Edinburgh|year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|first2=Jon|last2=Curtis<!--|title=A Process Ontology-->|title=Design of a Process Ontology: Vocabulary, Semantics, and Usage<!--|url=http://www.cyc.com/doc/white_papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf-->|url=https://archive.org/details/knowledgeenginee0000euro/page/263|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|work=Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management: Ontologies and the Semantic Web|year=2002|volume=2473|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|pages=[https://archive.org/details/knowledgeenginee0000euro/page/263 263–270]|doi=10.1007/3-540-45810-7_13|isbn=978-3-540-44268-4|url-access=registration}}</ref> The ground level of PSL uses the primitives of event-instance, object-instance, and timepoint description. The types above the ground level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology above this ground level use the following concepts:
* Process – formalized as a ''script''
* Aggregate process – a process at a level above that of a single episode of a process, to represent the numbers of participants in an action by ranges of integers and qualitative values like ''few'' or ''many''
* Script – a typical pattern of events that can be expected to re-occur
** a ''script'' has subevents, which means that ''scripts'' are composite events
* Scene – a subevent of a ''script''
* Roles/participants – specifies types of actors and objects that may play in the ''script'' or ''scene''
* Conditions – precondition(s) that must be true for a ''scene'' (event) to be executable, and postcondition(s) (effects) that must be true after a ''scene''
* Repetition – the number of repetitions of a process may be known, or may be unspecified, or may be repeated until a specific condition is true
* Properties of ordering and constitution of repeated subevents for composite processes:
** Begin-Ordered – subevents start at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** End-Ordered – subevents end at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** EndsBeforeEnd – subevents end before or at the same time as subevent instances which start before them
** Sequential – no overlapping subevents
** Terminating – there is a subevent after which no other subevents begin, and since all activities have a begin and end point, there is a time point at which the process ends
** Uniform – all subevents are of the same event type
* Identity – the identity of participants in a process, that actor(s) or object(s) playing a role in one ''scene'' or repetition are the same as those in another ''scene'' or repetition, is represented by constraints on possible participants

=== SUPER and DDPO ===
The project SUPER<ref>{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Business Process Ontology Framework (deliverable 1.1)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M12/D1.1.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=May 2007}}</ref> ('''S'''emantics '''U'''tilised for '''P'''rocess management within and between '''E'''nte'''R'''prises) has a goal of the definition of ontologies for Semantic Business Process Management (SBPM), but these ontologies can be reused in diverse environments. Part of this project is to define an Upper Process Ontology (UPO) that ties together all other SUPER ontologies. The results of the project SUPER include the UPO and a set of ontologies for processes and organizations.<ref>{{cite web|title=SUPER Ontologies|url=http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011224532/http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/ |archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Process Ontology Stack, Evolved Version (deliverable 1.5)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M36/D1.5.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=March 2009}}</ref> Most of the ontologies are written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], and some are also written in [[Open Configuration and Management Layer|OCML]].

[[Upper ontology#DOLCE and DnS|DnS]] (Descriptions and Situations), is a constructivist ontology that allows for context-sensitive redescriptions of the types and relations postulated by other given ontologies (or ground vocabularies). Together in DDPO, DOLCE and DnS are used to build a Plan Ontology that includes physical and non-physical objects (social entities, mental objects and states, conceptualizations, information objects, constraints), events, states, regions, qualities, and constructivist situations. The main target of DDPO is tasks, namely the types of actions, their sequencing, and the controls performed on them.

=== oXPDL ===
The ontology oXPDL<ref>{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Marmolowski, Mateusz |author3=Oren, Eyal |author4=Gaaloul, Walid |title=A Process Ontology for Business Intelligence|url=http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=April 2008}}</ref> is a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language ([[XPDL]]). The purpose of oXPDL is to model the semantics of XPDL process models in standardized Web ontology languages such as [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] and [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], while incorporating features of existing standard ontologies such as [[Process Specification Language|PSL]], [[RosettaNet]], and [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]].

=== GFO ===
{{main|General Formal Ontology}}
The General Formal Ontology<ref>{{cite web|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO)|url=http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo|publisher=Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=University of Leipzig}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Herre, Heinrich|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling|url=https://www.onto-med.de/sites/www.onto-med.de/files/files/uploads/Publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf|publisher=Research Department Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=IMISE University of Leipzig|year=2010}}</ref> ([[Upper ontology#General Formal Ontology .28GFO.29|GFO]]) is an ontology integrating processes and objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, such as the existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistant{{sic}}. A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances "remain identical" over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called "time boundaries") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.

The m3po ontology is written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]. The related ontology m3pl, written in [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] using the extension FLOWS (First Order Logic for Web Services), enables the extraction of choreography interfaces from workflow models.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |title=m3pl: A Work-FLOWS ontology extension to extract choreography interfaces|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantics for Business Process Management, in Conjunction with ESWC2006|date=June 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf}}</ref>

The m3po ontology combines features of the following reference models and languages:
* [[XPDL]] – a standard for exchanging workflow models, without runtime information, between different workflow management systems
* [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] – an ontology that allows the capture of the semantics of workflow models and enables translations of models between workflow management systems
* [[YAWL]] – a research workflow language that supports all workflow patterns directly
* [[BPEL]] – an executable business process language and includes an abstract protocol
* [[WS-CDL]] – a multi-party collaboration model

The m3po ontology is organized using five key aspects of workflow specifications and workflow management.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jablonski, S. |author2=Bussler, C. |title=Workflow Management: Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation|publisher=International Thomson Computer Press|year=1996}}</ref> Because different workflow models put a different emphasis on the five aspects, the most elaborate reference model for each aspect was used and combined into m3po.
* Functional and Behavioural – the most important concepts are ''processType'', ''processOccurrence'', ''activityType'' and ''activityOccurrence''
* Informational – defined by data and data-flow
* Organizational – defines who is responsible for carrying out a specific task; security related issues
* Operational – interaction of the workflows with their environment by manual tasks performed by users and automatic tasks performed by automated computer programs
* Orthogonal – scheduling based on time; integrity and failure recovery
