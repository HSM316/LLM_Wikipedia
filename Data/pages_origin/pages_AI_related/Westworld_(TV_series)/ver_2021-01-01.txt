'''''Westworld''''' is an American [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] and [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] television series created by [[Jonathan Nolan]] and [[Lisa Joy]]. Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] "hosts". The park caters to high-paying "guests" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, in the third season, the series' plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artificial intelligence]] named Rehoboam.

Nolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Westworld (season 2)|second season]], which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020 and concluded on May 3, 2020. In April 2020, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season.

''Westworld'' was critically acclaimed during its first season, receiving praise for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes and [[Ramin Djawadi]]'s musical score. The series continued to receive mostly positive reviews during its second and third seasons, though certain elements of its story and characterization have since come under criticism. The series has received numerous accolades, winning 9 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] out of 43 nominations. [[Thandie Newton]] won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2018.

==Summary==
Around 2058, Delos Inc. operates several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by "hosts": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.

In the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new "Reverie" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the "Man in Black" tries to find "the maze" he believes Arnold left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host based upon Arnold, who had died in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, in whom he saw the potential for sentience, believing they would be abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him.

Dolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her "daughter" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with five host cores in addition to Bernard's. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.

In the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body, Bernard's host copy, and that of others including a new Charlotte host. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human by the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what Dolores' plans are. Maeve is sought by Serac to help in his fight against Dolores, who he believes will bring down his plans for Rehoboam.

F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the "cold storage" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name="Hurwitz" />

For the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name="Pierce" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name="Fehrman" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name="Fehrman" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name="Pierce" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were "walk-in" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name="Fehrman" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name="Jones" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name="Jones" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name="Hurwitz" /><ref name="Fehrman" /><ref name="Jones" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name="Fehrman" />

===Design===
====Costumes====
Costume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed looking purely at [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch). Hat designs were described as the most challenging part of the process.<ref name="wild hat">{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/why-the-westworld-costumes-were-so-complicated-to-create/ |title=Why the Westworld costumes were so complicated to create |last=Holt |first=Bethan |date=November 9, 2016 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110004022/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/why-the-westworld-costumes-were-so-complicated-to-create/ |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref>

Patrick Clair acted as [[creative director]] for the title sequence,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |title=Westworld |publisher=Elastic |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005110043/http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |archive-date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |title=Opening Credits for HBO's 'Westworld' Released Online (Video) |date=October 3, 2016 |website=Culturess |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005144216/http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |archive-date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref> which took about five weeks to conceptualize.<ref name="conceptualize">{{Cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |title=Westworld |last=Perkins |first=Will |date=October 12, 2016 |website=[[Art of the Title]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015075108/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |archive-date=October 15, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>

Clair met with Nolan and Joy in February 2016 to discuss its development. He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name="simulacrum" /><ref name="conceptualize" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name="paranoid black paint" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano—"a primitive form of robot"—as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine "being created to be made redundant." Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name="simulacrum" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[All Is Full of Love]]", in a way that Clair called "a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics."<ref name="conceptualize" />

The sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name="conceptualize" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name="simulacrum">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>

The second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-opening-credits-explained-1105074 |title='Westworld': What the New Opening Credits Sequence Reveals About Season 2 |last=Wigler |first=Josh |date=April 24, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427171913/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-opening-credits-explained-1105074 |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |access-date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>

The editors of ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed ''Westworld'' fifth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–17 season. In writer Tim Surette's overall review, he notes the perfect concept of blending the western premise into a futuristic setting, saying, "Well, ''Westworld'' has both, ensuring that it will be an exciting mashup of genres that will disrupt a television landscape that typically says we can only have one or the other." He also added, "The look of the show and its fine cast swing open the saloon doors, but the real treat will be the intelligent discussion of whether or not robots will eventually kill us all. Thankfully, creator Jonathan Nolan already showed us he's the go-to guy for A.I. with ''Person of Interest''."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |title=Our 10 Most Anticipated New TV Shows of Fall 2016 |last=Surette |first=Tim |date=September 16, 2016 |website=[[TV Guide]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008191803/http://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Mary McNamara]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a lauded review, "It isn’t just great television, it’s vivid, thought-provoking television that entertains even as it examines the darker side of entertainment."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |title=HBO's multilayered update of 'Westworld' is TV's next big game-changer |last=McNamara |first=Mary |date=October 1, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109004145/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |archive-date=November 9, 2016 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref> For the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[David Wiegand]] wrote, "''Westworld'' isn’t easy to understand at first, but you will be hooked nonetheless by unusually intelligent storytelling, powerful visuals and exceptionally nuanced performances."<ref name=Wiegand/> ''[[Time&nbsp;(magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s chief critic Daniel D'Addario wrote, "Its carefully chosen details add up to a pulp spectacular that’s more thoughtful than any other of this fall’s new dramas."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4512789/hbo-westworld-review/ |title=Why HBO's Westworld Is Fall's Most Promising Drama |last=D’Addario |first=Daniel |date=September 29, 2017 |website=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214003627/http://time.com/4512789/hbo-westworld-review/ |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref>

[[Jeff Jensen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also lauded the series and said, "The depth of ''Westworld'' lies not in asking questions about memory, free will, and what makes us human, but in whether we can become more human than what we let ourselves to be, whether our stories can be richer and more meaningful than what the culture allows."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/30/westworld-review/ |title='Westworld': EW Review |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |date=September 30, 2016 |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225070425/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/30/westworld-review/ |archive-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' quipped, "''Westworld'' has fewer heroes than ''Game of Thrones'', which makes it a bit harder to warm up to, but like a good, thought-provoking puzzle, it is compelling and addictive."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/28/westworld-the-most-immersive-video-game-ever/JUgwHZ3cAGgtR3jdWjZrQK/story.html |title='Westworld': The most immersive video game ever |last=Gilbert |first=Matthew |date=September 29, 2016 |work=Boston Globe |access-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227061818/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/28/westworld-the-most-immersive-video-game-ever/JUgwHZ3cAGgtR3jdWjZrQK/story.html |archive-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> In a brief review from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Tim Goodman said, "Where ''Westworld'' is at its best is in the deeper issues that will unspool slowly, like a good mystery.
