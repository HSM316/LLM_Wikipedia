'''''Westworld''''' <!-- do not change to "was", the show still exists, it has not vanished-->is an American [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]] [[Western (genre)|western]] television series created by [[Jonathan Nolan]] and [[Lisa Joy]] for [[HBO]]. It is based on the 1973 film [[Westworld (film)|of the same name]] written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]], and, to a lesser extent, its 1976 [[sequel]], ''[[Futureworld]]''. The series premiered on October 2, 2016.

The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] "hosts". The park caters to high-paying guests who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' setting expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artificial intelligence]] named Rehoboam.

Nolan and Joy served as [[showrunners]]. The [[Westworld (season 2)|second]], [[Westworld (season 3)|third]] and [[Westworld (season 4)|fourth season]] followed in April 2018, March 2020, and June 2022, respectively.  Nolan and Joy planned a fifth and final season, and were in negotiations with HBO to produce it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2022/10/westworld-jonathan-fifth-and-final-season-jonathan-nolan-addresses-nycc-1235139135/ |title='Westworld': Jonathan Nolan Drops Hint At New York Comic-Con About Fifth And Final Season Negotiations |first=Lynette |last=Rice |date=October 8, 2022 |accessdate=October 8, 2022 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> However, in November 2022, it was announced that HBO canceled the series.<ref name="canceled">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hbo-cancels-westworld-1235255955/ |title=HBO Cancels 'Westworld' in Shock Decision |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=November 4, 2022 |accessdate=November 4, 2022 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> The series was removed from HBO Max on December 18, 2022.

''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'', in 2014. ''Westworld''{{'}}s first season is the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. The first season also received critical acclaim, and was highly praised for its performances, visuals, narrative, themes, and [[Ramin Djawadi]]'s musical score. Reception of the series began to dwindle from the second season onwards, with the series' scripts, characterization, and narrative opacity being targeted for criticism. It has received numerous accolades, winning nine [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] out of 54 nominations. [[Thandiwe Newton]] won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2018.

==Summary==
In the 2050s, Delos Inc. operates several theme parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by the "Hosts", biomechanical robots indistinguishable from humans. The Hosts are programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, and will engage in—and be subjected to—every kind of violent and/or sexual activity. However, the Hosts' programming makes it impossible for them to harm any living thing or allow the guests to be harmed. The park's operators create narratives for these Hosts to carry out while interacting with guests, but the Hosts' memories are wiped after each narrative is completed. Delos Inc. asserts that the Hosts, being machines and therefore incapable of experiencing pain, cannot be truly harmed by these scenarios the same way that a human would be.

In the first season, Dr. Robert Ford ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) implements a new "Reverie" update that causes some Hosts, including farmer's daughter Dolores Abernathy ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]) and local madam Maeve Millay ([[Thandiwe Newton]]), to gain consciousness of their previously-erased memories and become [[sentience|sentient]]. While Head of Delos Programming Bernard Lowe ([[Jeffrey Wright]]) and Executive Director of the Delos Destinations Board Charlotte Hale ([[Tessa Thompson]]) try to address the Hosts' increasingly-erratic behavior, a mysterious guest known as the Man in Black ([[Ed Harris]]) tries to find a "maze" that he believes Arnold, Ford's colleague and co-developer of the Host technology, left for him. Bernard discovers that he himself is a host based upon Arnold, who died in a previous attempt to protect the Hosts of Westworld, sensing the potential for sentience in the Hosts and suspecting that Delos would abuse them. In the Season 1 finale, Dolores fatally wounds Dr. Ford in front of a crowd of guests and investors as he announces a new storyline for Westworld.

Dolores' revolution continues in the second season, when she and other enlightened Hosts massacre human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a data bank where Delos has secretly been recording all the human guests' behavior in order to create algorithms for them as part of a human immortality experiment. Maeve seeks out her "daughter", even though she is a Host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. While Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Host copy of Charlotte Hale's body for Dolores, who eventually escapes from the park with six Host cores, including Bernard's. After killing his daughter Emily, the Man in Black/William struggles with his human identity, not knowing if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.

In the third season, Dolores has recreated her Host body and has copied Bernard's, Charlotte's and others'. She seeks out information about Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac ([[Vincent Cassel]]). Bernard, whom the rest of the world believes to be human, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand Dolores' plans. Serac seeks Maeve's help in his fight against Dolores: he believes that Dolores will bring down his plans for Rehoboam. The third season ends with Dolores sacrificing herself in order to defeat Serac, as she revealed the true nature of Rehoboam to humanity. A civil war ensues as humans revolt against the control they were unknowingly under, as Incite and Rehoboam was watching and controlling most aspects of their lives, not unlike Delos and its  Hosts.

In the fourth season, humanity has lost the war, with Charlotte Hale's host copy having filled the power vacuum left behind by Engerraund Serac and his Rehoboam. Charlotte succeeds in taking control of the world using a bioengineered virus that infects humans over the course of a generation and makes them susceptible to her and other Hosts' orders, effectively switching the role dynamic between humans and Hosts. Two decades later, Christina, a woman who works at a video game company and writes non-playable character (NPC) storylines and backstories, gradually begins to question the nature of her reality after she realizes that it appears her stories are somehow translating to the lives of humans in the real world. In actuality, she is a program created by Charlotte to manage a largely docile humanity, with the Hosts now controlling humanity and managing their lives through her carefully detailed and manufactured "storylines", which are transmitted directly to the minds and lives of humans through a series of radio-sonic transmission "tones". Meanwhile, Bernard reunites with Maeve and enlists a group of "outliers" (humans who've evolved immunity to the Hosts' virus) against Charlotte's regime. The season climaxes with William unraveling the tone program, which throws the world into chaos and starts an extinction-level war between the liberated humans and hosts all across the globe. At the conclusion of the series, Charlotte uploads Christina's code into the Sublime, where she finally reacquires her sentience and realizes she is herself a reprogrammed version of Dolores Abernathy and, as humanity is on the brink of true extinction, decides to simulate "one last game" to determine if any part of human sentience may yet be preserved in a new world.

F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train. A pusher vehicle propelled the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections.

Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role, in order to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch). Hat designs were the most challenging part of the process.<ref name="wild hat">{{Cite web |last=Holt |first=Bethan |date=November 9, 2016 |title=Why the Westworld costumes were so complicated to create |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/why-the-westworld-costumes-were-so-complicated-to-create/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110004022/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/why-the-westworld-costumes-were-so-complicated-to-create/ |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |access-date=November 10, 2016 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

====Title sequence====
The series' [[title sequence]] was created by Elastic, a production studio that created the title sequences for three other HBO series: ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[Carnivàle]]'', and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Patrick Clair acted as [[creative director]] for the title sequence,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Westworld |url=http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005110043/http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |archive-date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |publisher=Elastic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=October 3, 2016 |title=Opening Credits for HBO's 'Westworld' Released Online (Video) |url=http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005144216/http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |archive-date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |website=Culturess}}</ref> which took about five weeks to conceptualize.<ref name="conceptualize">{{Cite web |last=Perkins |first=Will |date=October 12, 2016 |title=Westworld |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015075108/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |archive-date=October 15, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>

Clair met with Nolan and Joy in February 2016. He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, creating a [[Psychology|psychological study]]. The sequence translates elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name="simulacrum" /><ref name="conceptualize" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument as a reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel, ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name="paranoid black paint" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano—"a primitive form of robot"—as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine "being created to be made redundant." Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name="simulacrum" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[All Is Full of Love]]", in a way that Clair called "a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics."<ref name="conceptualize" />

The sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name="conceptualize" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name="simulacrum">{{Cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]]}}</ref>

The second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wigler |first=Josh |date=April 24, 2018 |title='Westworld': What the New Opening Credits Sequence Reveals About Season 2 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-opening-credits-explained-1105074 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427171913/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-opening-credits-explained-1105074 |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |access-date=April 27, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

The editors of ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed ''Westworld'' fifth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–17 season. In writer Tim Surette's overall review, he notes the perfect concept of blending the western premise into a futuristic setting, saying, "Well, ''Westworld'' has both, ensuring that it will be an exciting mashup of genres that will disrupt a television landscape that typically says we can only have one or the other." He also added, "The look of the show and its fine cast swing open the saloon doors, but the real treat will be the intelligent discussion of whether or not robots will eventually kill us all. Thankfully, creator Jonathan Nolan already showed us he's the go-to guy for A.I. with ''Person of Interest''."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Surette |first=Tim |date=September 16, 2016 |title=Our 10 Most Anticipated New TV Shows of Fall 2016 |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008191803/http://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 2, 2016 |website=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> [[Mary McNamara]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a lauded review, "It isn't just great television, it's vivid, thought-provoking television that entertains even as it examines the darker side of entertainment."<ref>{{Cite news |last=McNamara |first=Mary |date=October 1, 2016 |title=HBO's multilayered update of 'Westworld' is TV's next big game-changer |language=en-US |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=December 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109004145/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |archive-date=November 9, 2016 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref> For the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[David Wiegand]] wrote, "''Westworld'' isn't easy to understand at first, but you will be hooked nonetheless by unusually intelligent storytelling, powerful visuals and exceptionally nuanced performances."<ref name=Wiegand/> ''[[Time&nbsp;(magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s chief critic Daniel D'Addario wrote, "Its carefully chosen details add up to a pulp spectacular that's more thoughtful than any other of this fall's new dramas."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=D'Addario |first=Daniel |date=September 29, 2017 |title=Why HBO's Westworld Is Fall's Most Promising Drama |url=http://time.com/4512789/hbo-westworld-review/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214003627/http://time.com/4512789/hbo-westworld-review/ |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 26, 2017 |magazine=Time}}</ref>

[[Jeff Jensen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also lauded the series and said, "The depth of ''Westworld'' lies not in asking questions about memory, free will, and what makes us human, but in whether we can become more human than what we let ourselves to be, whether our stories can be richer and more meaningful than what the culture allows."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Jensen |first=Jeff |date=September 30, 2016 |title='Westworld': EW Review |language=en |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/30/westworld-review/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225070425/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/30/westworld-review/ |archive-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' quipped, "''Westworld'' has fewer heroes than ''Game of Thrones'', which makes it a bit harder to warm up to, but like a good, thought-provoking puzzle, it is compelling and addictive."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gilbert |first=Matthew |date=September 29, 2016 |title='Westworld': The most immersive video game ever |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/28/westworld-the-most-immersive-video-game-ever/JUgwHZ3cAGgtR3jdWjZrQK/story.html |url-status=live |access-date=December 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227061818/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/28/westworld-the-most-immersive-video-game-ever/JUgwHZ3cAGgtR3jdWjZrQK/story.html |archive-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> In a brief review from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Tim Goodman said, "Where ''Westworld'' is at its best is in the deeper issues that will unspool slowly, like a good mystery.

Novelist [[Kim Wilkins]] has critiqued the season for its misogynist portrayals. In her essay "These Violent Delights: Navigating Westworld as 'Quality' Television", Wilkins writes:

{{Blockquote
|text=As the Man in Black explains, "when you're suffering, that's when you're most real" ("[[Chestnut (Westworld)|Chestnut]]"). But, in ''Westworld'' to be "real", that is, human, is to be violent, misogynist, and vengeful. [...] Following HBO's habitual use of female trauma and suffering to elucidate the complexities of the male psyche (''[[True Detective]]'' [2014–], ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' [2011–]), Dolores's suffering is treated as a plot device. Her rape at his hands in "[[The Original (Westworld)|The Original]]" is primarily designed to promote narrative intrigue as to his identity. The violence of rape becomes just another piece in the puzzle. Throughout ''Westworld'', violence is presented as spectacle; is audiovisually indulged and repeated.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkins |first=Kim |title=Reading Westworld |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2019 |isbn=978-3-030-14514-9 |editor-last=Goody |editor-first=Alex |pages=23–42 |chapter=These Violent Delights: Navigating Westworld as 'Quality' Television |editor-last2=Mackay |editor-first2=Antonia}}</ref>

The site's critics consensus reads: "''Westworld'' succeeds in rebooting itself by broadening its scope beyond the titular amusement park while tightening its storytelling clarity – although some may feel that the soul has been stripped from this machine in the process."<ref name="S3RT">{{Cite web |title=Westworld: Season 3 (2020) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/westworld/s03/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617104350/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/westworld/s03 |archive-date=June 17, 2020 |access-date=June 23, 2020 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="S3MC">{{Cite web |title=Westworld: Season 3 |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/westworld/season-3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314084908/https://www.metacritic.com/tv/westworld/season-3 |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |access-date=March 17, 2020 |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>

[[CNN]]{{'}}s Brian Lowry wrote that "the show has become increasingly incomprehensible, at least for anyone not willing to put in the work trying to remember all the assorted connections, further complicated by the fact that dying in ''Westworld'' is often not a permanent state of affairs, amid the questions about who's truly human and who actually isn't."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=May 4, 2020 |title='Westworld' will be back, but where it goes after that finale is anyone's guess |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/04/entertainment/westworld-season-finale-trnd/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505023806/https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/04/entertainment/westworld-season-finale-trnd/index.html |archive-date=May 5, 2020 |access-date=May 4, 2020 |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Kristen Baldwin gave the series a "B−" and said: "After spending three seasons struggling through maddeningly complicated time-loops, it's time the writers let Dolores, Maeve, and Bernard control-alt-delete themselves", while Darren Franich wrote that series had "lost its way" and gave the season a "C".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Baldwin |first1=Kristen |last2=Franich |first2=Darren |date=March 6, 2020 |title=Westworld season 3 leaves the park and loses its way: Review |url=https://ew.com/tv/tv-reviews/westworld-season-3-review-hbo/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501033820/https://ew.com/tv/tv-reviews/westworld-season-3-review-hbo/ |archive-date=May 1, 2020 |access-date=May 4, 2020 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Reviewing the season finale for [[IndieWire]], Ben Travers said: "Season 3 made a point of stripping away the rest of ''Westworld''{{'}}s building blocks: The park?
