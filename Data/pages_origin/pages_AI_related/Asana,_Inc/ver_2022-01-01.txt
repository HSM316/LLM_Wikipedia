== API and integrations ==

In April 2012, Asana released its [[API]] to third-party developers. Asana's open API provides a means to programmatically read information in Asana, input information into Asana, and create automations within Asana. This allows customers or third-party developers to build on the Asana platform and customize Asana to the unique way their teams work. Common use cases include automating repetitive tasks, chaining processes, automating reporting on tasks and projects, and syncing with databases or other tools.

The Asana API is a RESTful interface, allowing users to update and access much of their data on the platform. It provides predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with a wide variety of environments, from command-line utilities to browser plugins to native applications.

Asana has integrations with other SaaS tools, including [[Gmail]], [[Slack (software)|Slack]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Box (company)|Box]], [[Google Drive]], [[Zapier]], [[IFTTT]], [[Wufoo]], [[JotForm]], [[Okta (identity management)|Okta]], [[OneLogin]], [[Harvest (software)|Harvest]], Instagantt, [[Zendesk]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://asana.com/apps|title=Asana Apps and Integrations · Asana|work=Asana|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  [[Zoom (software)|Zoom]]<ref name=":5" /> and [[Qatalog]].
