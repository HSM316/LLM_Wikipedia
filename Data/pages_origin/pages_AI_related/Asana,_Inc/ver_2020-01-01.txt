== API and integrations ==
In April 2012, Asana released its [[API]] to third-party developers. Asana's open API provides a means to programmatically read information in Asana, input information into Asana, and create automations within Asana. This allows customers or third-party developers to build on the Asana platform and customize Asana to the unique way their teams work. Common use cases include automating repetitive tasks, chaining processes, automating reporting on tasks and projects, and syncing with databases or other tools.

The Asana API is a RESTful interface, allowing you to update and access much of your data on the platform. It provides predictable URLs for accessing resources, and uses built-in HTTP features to receive commands and return responses. This makes it easy to communicate with a wide variety of environments, from command-line utilities to browser plugins to native applications.

Asana has integrations with other SaaS tools, including [[Gmail]], [[Slack (software)|Slack]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Box (company)|Box]], [[Google Drive]], [[Zapier]], [[IFTTT]], [[Wufoo]], [[JotForm]], [[Okta (identity management)|Okta]], [[OneLogin]], [[Harvest (software)|Harvest]], Instagantt, and [[Zendesk]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://asana.com/apps|title=Asana Apps and Integrations · Asana|work=Asana|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}</ref>

==Reception==
Asana received a 4.5 / 5 from ''PC Magazine'' (October 13, 2017), which named it an Editors' Choice and called it "one of the best collaboration and productivity apps for teams."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2408011,00.asp|title=Asana|website=PCMAG|access-date=February 3, 2018}}</ref> The article remarked on Asana's "thoughtful design, fluid interactive elements, and generous member allotment."<ref name=":1" />

==Etymology==
Āsān means "easy to do" or "easy to learn" in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]].

[[Asana]] (the third “limb” of Ashtanga Yoga outlined by the sage Patanjali) means to be seated in a firm, pleasant, and relaxed position. [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]<ref>https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/asana/</ref>
