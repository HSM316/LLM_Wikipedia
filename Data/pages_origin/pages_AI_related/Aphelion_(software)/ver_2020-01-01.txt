== History and evolution ==
The development of Aphelion started in 1995 as a joint project of a French company, {{abbr|ADCIS|Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software}} S.A.,<ref>{{cite web|language = |title = About ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software)|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/AboutUs/Corporate.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 16 November 2015}}</ref> and an American company, Amerinex Applied Imaging, Inc. (AAI)<ref>{{cite web|language = |title = Amerinex Applied Imaging official web site|url = http://www.amerineximaging.com|website = amerineximaging.com|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref> Aphelion's image processing and analysis functions were made from operators available from the KBVision software developed and sold by Amerinex's predecessor, Amerinex Articifial Intelligence Inc. In the 1990s, the XLim<ref>{{cite techreport|language=fr|last1=Van Droogenbroeck|first1=Marc|trans-title=Xlim3D: Software for addressing image processing|title=Xlim3D : Un logiciel de traitement d'image|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/120647/1/VanDroogenbroeck2002Xlim3D.pdf|format=pdf|website=orbi.ulg.ac.be|date=25 January 2002|access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref> software library was developed at the [[Centre de Morphologie Mathématique|Center of Mathematical Morphology]] of [[Mines ParisTech]], and both companies carried out its development tasks.

The first [[Software versioning|version]] of Aphelion was completed and released in April 1996. Successive versions were released before the first official stable release in December 1996 at the Photonics East conference in [[Boston]] and the Solutions Vision show in [[Paris]] in January 1997, where at the latter it competed with Stemmer Imaging's {{abbr|CVB|Common Vision Blox}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonvisionblox.com/en/news/2015-11-common-vision-blox-2016-numerous-new-features/|title=Stemmer imaging at Solutions Vision conference in 1997|website=commonvisionblox.com|access-date=25 February 2016}}</ref> imaging toolbox.

In 1998, version 2.3 of Aphelion for [[Windows 98]]<ref name="Brochure98">{{Cite web|url=http://commonforall.adcis.net/pub/Aphelion%2023%20Brochure%201998%20FR.pdf|title=Official Aphelion 2.3 brochure (1998)|website=adcis.net|language=fr|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref> was released, and its user base was growing in both France and the United States. Version 3.0, totally rewritten to take advantage of [[Microsoft]]'s then-recent [[ActiveX]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commonforall.adcis.net/pub/Aphelion%2032%20Brochure%202004%20US.pdf|title=Official Aphelion 3.2 brochure (2004)|website=adcis.net|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> technology, was officially released in 2000. It also became available as a « Developer » version, for rapid prototyping of applications using its intuitive {{abbr|GUI|Graphical User Interface}} and the macro recording capability, and a « Core » version, including the full library as a set of ActiveX components to be used by [[software developer]]s, integrators and [[original equipment manufacturer]]s ({{abbr|OEM|original equipment manufacturer}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/AphelionThree/GeneralDescription.html|title=Aphelion 3.2 description|website=adcis.net|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>

As AAI turned its focus to [[Civil defense|security]], in 2001, ADCIS took the lead on developing Aphelion. {{abbr|AAI|Amerinex Applied Imaging}} focused on [[millimeter wave scanner]]s for concealed weapon detection at [[Airport security|airports]], and eventually merged with Millimetrics to become Millivision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millivision.com/about.html|title=About Millivision|website=millivision.com|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>

In 2004, {{abbr|ADCIS|Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software}} specified version 4.0 of Aphelion. The set of image processing/analysis functions was rewritten one more time to be compatible with the [[.NET Framework|.NET]]<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = Aphelion 2006 advertising|url = http://www.advancedimagingpro.com/pdf/ADI1206_Software_10_15.pdf|website = AdvancedImagingPro.com|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref> technology and the emergence of 64 bit architecture {{abbr|PC|Personal Computer}}s. In addition, the {{abbr|GUI|Graphical User Interface}} was redesigned to address two usage types: a semi-automatic use where the user is guided through the different steps of functions, and a fully automatic use where the expert user can quickly invoke imaging functions. Its first release was presented at the {{abbr|IPOT|Image Processing & Optical Technology}} exhibition in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom|{{abbr|UK|United Kingdom}}]] the same year. During the Vision Show in Paris in October 2008, the new Aphelion Lab product was launched for users that are not specialists in image processing.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|trans-title=ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software) presents its new Aphelion Lab software|title = ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software) lance son logiciel Aphelion Lab|url = http://visionindustrielle.free.fr/index.php/News/news-adcis-aphelion-lab.html|website = Vision Industrielle|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|language=fr|trans-title=ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software) at Vision Show 2008|title = ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software) au salon Vision Show 2008|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/AboutUs/VisionShow2008.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref> It is easier to use, and only includes fewer image processing functions. It was then included in the Aphelion Image Processing Suite, consisting of Aphelion Dev (replacing Aphelion Developer), Aphelion Lab, Aphelion {{abbr|SDK|Software Development Kit}} (replacing Aphelion Core), and a set of extensions.

Nowadays, {{abbr|ADCIS|Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software}} is still working on the suite, and updated versions with new extensions and functionalities continually become available from the websites of both companies. In 2015, support was added for very large images and scan microscope images<ref name="WhatsNew4_3">{{cite web|url=http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/VersionHistory_version_Aphelion43.html|title=What is new in Aphelion 4.3 release|website=adcis.net|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> (virtual slides compound into a very large [[JPEG 2000]] image) for high throughput imaging, and new specific extensions were also added. In late 2015, {{abbr|ADCIS|Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software}} announced Aphelion's port for [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s and [[smartphone]]s, for [[Vertical market software|vertical applications]].<ref>{{cite web|title = ADCIS (Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software) attended the innovation trophies 2015|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/AboutUs/InnovationTrophies2015.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref>

The name "Aphelion" comes from the [[Aphelion|astronomical term]] of the same name, meaning the point on a planet rotating around the [[Sun]] where it lies farthest from it, applying the term in a metaphorical sense{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. [[Unix]] was the [[operating system]] used on scientific [[workstation]]s in the 1990s, such as on the workstations manufactured by market leader [[Sun Microsystems]], which [[Windows]] suite Aphelion was quite removed from.

Aphelion is a software suite<ref>{{cite web|title = Aphelion Imaging Software Suite|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Products|website = adcis.net|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref> to be used for image processing and image analysis. It supports 2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]], monochrome, color, and multi-band images. It is developed by {{abbr|ADCIS|Advanced Concepts in Imaging Software}}, a French [[software house]] located in [[Saint-Contest]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[Normandy]].<ref>{{cite web|language = fr|trans-title = High technology companies in Calvados|title = Les hautes technologies dans le Calvados|url = http://calvados-strategie.com/fr/tic-t81.html|website = Calvados stratégie|access-date = 5 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023656/http://calvados-strategie.com/fr/tic-t81.html|archive-date = 2015-11-17|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Aphelion is widely used in the scientific/industry community to solve basic and complex imaging applications. First, the imaging application is quickly developed from the Graphical User Interface, involving a set of functions that can be automatically recorded into a macro command. The macro [[programming language|languages]] available in Aphelion (i.e. BasicScript, Python, and C#) help to [[Batch processing|process batch]] of images, and prompt the user if needed for specific parameters that are applied to the imaging functions. All Aphelion image processing functions are written in C++, and the Aphelion user interface is written in C#. C++ functions can be called from the C# language thanks the use of dedicated [[Wrapper function|wrappers]].<ref name="SDK2015">{{cite web|language = en|title = Official Aphelion SDK (Software Development Kit) brochure (2015)|url = http://www.adcis.net/pub/Aphelion%20SDK_FlyerEN.pdf|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref>

The main principle of image processing is to automatically process pixels of a [[digital image]], then extract one or more objects of interest (i.e. cells in the field of biology, inclusions in the field of material science) and compute one or more measurements on those objects to quantify the image and generate a verdict (good image, image with defects, cancerous cells). In other words, starting from an image, pixels are processed by a set of successive functions or operators until only measurements are computed and used as the input of a 3rd party system or a classification software that will classify objects of interest that have been extracted during the imaging process.

An acquisition system such as a [[digital camera]], a [[video camera]], an [[Optical microscope|optical]] or [[electron microscope]], a [[CT scan|medical scanner]], or a smartphone can be used to capture images. The set of values or [[pixel]]s can be processed as a 1D image (1D signal), a 2D image (array of pixel values corresponding to a monochrome or [[Channel (digital image)|color image]]), or a 3D image displayed using [[volume rendering]] (array of voxels in the 3D space) or displaying surfaces by using [[3D rendering]]. A 2D color image is made of 3 value pixels (typically [[RGB color model|Red, Green, and Blue]] information or another [[color space]]), and a 3D image is made of monochrome, color ([[indexed color]] are often used), [[multispectral image|multispectral]], or [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral]] data. When dealing with videos, an additional band is added corresponding to [[Time in physics|temporal information]].

The Aphelion Software Suite includes three base products, and a set of optional extensions for specific applications:
* Aphelion Lab:<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Aphelion Lab brochure (2015) |url=http://www.adcis.net/pub/Aphelion%20Lab%20brochure%20EN%20A4.pdf |website=adcis.net |access-date=19 November 2015 }}</ref> Entry-level package for non-experts in image processing. It helps to quickly [[image segmentation|segment]] an image in a semi-automatic or manual ways, and compute a set of measurements computed on objects of interest that have been extracted during the segmentation process. A set of [[wizard (software)|wizards]] guides the user from image acquisition to [[report generator|report generation]].
* Aphelion Dev:<ref name="BrochureDev">{{cite web|title = Official Aphelion Dev brochure (2015)|url = http://www.adcis.net/pub/Aphelion%20Dev%20brochure%20EN%20A4.pdf|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref> Full imaging environment including over 450 functions<ref>{{cite web|title = Aphelion 4.x function list|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/AphelionDev/ImageProcessingLibrary.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Aphelion 4.x 3D functions|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/Extensions/3DImageProcessing.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref> to develop and [[Software deployment|deploy]] an application that involves image processing and analysis. It also includes a set of [[Macro (computer science)#Application macros and scripting|macro-command]] languages to automate any application to be invoked from the user interface. It also helps to run the imaging algorithm on more than one image that are stored on disk, available on the network, or captured by an acquisition device. Aphelion libraries for image processing and visualization are provided in Aphelion Dev as DLLs and .Net components.
* Aphelion {{abbr|SDK|Software Development Kit}}:<ref name="SDK2015" /> A set of libraries to develop a stand-alone application with a custom interface based on the Aphelion libraries. This [[software development kit]] including display, processing and analysis [[Subroutine|function]]s that can be used by software developers and {{abbr|OEM|Original Equipment Manufacturer}}s. It is provided as DLLs and .Net components. The stand-alone application is typically developed in C# on one computer, and then deployed on multiple [[Personal computer|{{abbr|PC|Personal Computer}}]]s and systems.

A set of optional extensions can be added to the « Aphelion Dev » product, depending on the application.<ref>{{cite web|title = Distribution and Upgrade Path|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/AphelionDev/Distribution.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 5 November 2015}}</ref> An evaluation version of Aphelion can be run on a {{abbr|PC|Personal Computer}} for 30 days.<ref>{{cite web|title = Frequently asked questions about Aphelion|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Products/FAQs_category_General.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}} {{quote|text=It is possible to download a trial version of Aphelion from the web.}}</ref> A permanent version of Aphelion is available based on a perpetual license. [[Upgrade]]s are available through a maintenance agreement based on a yearly fee. [[Technical support]] is provided by the engineers who are developing the product.<ref>{{cite web|title = Aphelion technical support|url = http://www.adcis.net/en/Support/SupportTeam.html|website = adcis.net|access-date = 19 November 2015}}</ref>

The goal of image processing is usually to extract object(s) of interest in an image, and then to [[Machine learning|classify]] them based on some characteristics such as shape, density, position, etc. Using Aphelion, this goal is achieved by performing the following tasks:
# Load an image from disk or acquire an image using an acquisition device.
# Enhance the image [[Noise reduction|removing noise]] or modifying its contrast.
# Segment the image extracting objects of interest to be measured and analyzed. Typically, for simple applications, a [[Thresholding (image processing)|threshold]] is performed to generate a binary image. Then, [[Mathematical morphology|morphological operators]] are applied to clean the image and only keep objects of interest. Finally, a label value is given to each object based on its [[Connected space|connectivity]] (4 or 8 connectivity when a square grid is used), and the background of the image is given value zero.
# The set of objects can be manually edited by the user to remove artifacts, and alter their edges. Objects can then be measured in terms of shape, color, [[densitometry]], and then classified using the measurements.
# What has been developed above for one image can be applied to a batch of images thanks to the use of the macro-commands available in the Aphelion User Interface. It helps to generate more measurements and get a more robust algorithm working on multiple images.
# Statistical analysis can be performed on the measurements and [[Statistical classification|classifiers]] can be [[Supervised learning|trained]] if the number of objects is large enough and if descriptors or measurements are available to classify objects into classes or categories.

=== Theory ===
Image Processing and Analysis is a scientific [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] as well as statistics, and set theory are. Research people spend time to find new algorithms, new functions ([[Adaptive histogram equalization|adaptive contrast]], new color space definition,&nbsp;etc.), or even newer techniques such as [[deep learning]]. There is a very tight connection between image processing and classification ([[machine learning]]), which is part of the [[artificial intelligence]] field.

Aphelion can be used to develop new image processing operators that are easily inserted into the graphical user interface. Once the operator is available in the {{abbr|GUI|Graphical user interface}}, it can be tested, associated parameters can be altered, and it can even be called from a macro-command to be tested in an algorithm or a full batch of images.

New operators are added from time to time depending on customer requests, and new techniques that are developed in research labs. For example, works from Hanbury and [[Jean Serra|Serra]] on [[HSL and HSV|color spaces where the hue is represented as an angle]] (Hue Saturation Value, Hue Saturation Lightness, Hue Saturation Brightness or Hue Saturation Intensity) are proposing a new color space, {{abbr|IHSL|Improved Hue Saturation Lightness}} derived from {{abbr|HSL|Hue Saturation Lightness}} (Hue, Saturation, Lightness).<ref>{{cite techreport

Subjects of work or research as [[program optimization]], [[parallel computing]] with threads, [[distributed computing]] ([[Computer cluster|cluster]]s or [[Grid computing|grids]] of computers and [[video card]]s), [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] or new processor [[instruction set]]s usage, evolve according to the hardware progresses made regularly. The [[FLOPS|computer performances]] ever increase, changing the definition of reachable [[Real-time computing|real-time computations]]. Aphelion performances are sometime used as reference to compare optimizations.<ref>
