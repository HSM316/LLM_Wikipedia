'''Manav''' (Sanskrit: मानव, pronounced 'Maanav'/ Mɑnʌv, meaning "human") is [[India]]'s first [[humanoid robot]] which was developed in the laboratory of A-SET Training and Research Institutes by [[Diwakar Vaish]] (Head of [[Robotics]] and [[Research]], A-SET Training and Research Institutes) in late December 2014. It debuted at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay|IIT-Bombay]] [[Techfest]] 2014-15 in [[Mumbai]].

== Design ==
* Manav stands at 2 feet tall and has a weight of 2 kilograms. It is equipped with onboard [[sound processing]] and [[visual processing]] so it can respond to commands.
* Thanks to the onboard [[Central processing unit|processor]] and various [[sensor]]s, Manav can perform various activities like walking, dancing with the only requirement of human [[Audio signal processing|voice commands]].
* Manav has the capability of [[Binocular vision]] processing, giving it the ability to perceive depth and perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Meet Manav, India's first 3D-printed humanoid robot|url = http://www.livemint.com/Industry/rc86Iu7h3rb44087oDts1H/Meet-Manav-Indias-first-3Dprinted-humanoid-robot.html|accessdate = 2015-10-07|first = Beryl|last = Menezes}}</ref>
* The [[Robot]] was designed in a span of 2 months.
* Manav's outer body was designed in A-SET's own [[3D printing]] laboratory and is made of [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] plastic.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://3dprint.com/35204/3d-printed-manav-robot/|title = Soccer Playing, 3D Printed MANAV Robot Debuts at IIT Mumbai TechFest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = EDWARDS|first = TE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.livemint.com/Industry/rc86Iu7h3rb44087oDts1H/Meet-Manav-Indias-first-3Dprinted-humanoid-robot.html|title = Meet Manav, India's first 3D-printed humanoid robot|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Menezes|first = Beryl}}</ref><ref name="inside3dprinting">{{cite web|url=http://inside3dprinting.com/new-delhi-institutes-introduce-manav-indias-first-3d-printed-plastic-robot/|title=New Delhi Institutes Introduce Manav, India's First 3D-Printed Plastic Robot {{pipe}} Inside 3D Printing| publisher=inside3dprinting.com| accessdate=2015-10-07| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927205846/http://inside3dprinting.com/new-delhi-institutes-introduce-manav-indias-first-3d-printed-plastic-robot/|archivedate=2015-09-27}}</ref><ref name="ibtimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/indias-first-3d-printed-humanoid-robot-manav-launched-iit-mumbai-techfest-2015-619373|title=India's First 3D Printed Humanoid Robot 'Manav' Launched at IIT Mumbai TechFest 2015|publisher=ibtimes.co.in|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref><ref name="techentice">{{cite web|url=http://www.techentice.com/manav-indias-first-3d-printed-robot-from-iit-mumbai/|title=Manav- India's first 3D printed robot from IIT Mumbai|publisher=techentice.com|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref>
* Manav has a total of 21 [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], two of which provide the movement of the head allowing it to nod and look around. 1 degree of freedom goes to the waist which allows it to articulate the waist movement allowing for a more human-like movement.
* The robot comes with a rechargeable [[Lithium polymer battery]] which can keep it running for one hour.
* The Robot can be purchased with multiple micro-controllers and battery sizes according to the requirements of the user.
* The robot is also equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] connectivity.
