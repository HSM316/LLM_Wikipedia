'''Manav''' (Sanskrit: मानव, pronounced "Maanav"/Mɑnʌv, meaning "human") is a humanoid robot developed in the laboratory of A-SET Training and Research Institutes by [[Diwakar Vaish]] (Head of Robotics and Research, A-SET Training and Research Institutes) in late December 2014. It debuted at the [[IIT Bombay|IIT-Bombay]] Techfest 2014-2015 in [[Mumbai]].

== Technical specifications ==
Manav is 2 feet tall and weighs 2 kilograms. It has a rechargeable [[lithium polymer battery]]. Manav's outer body was designed in A-SET's [[3D printing]] laboratory and is made of [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) plastic.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://3dprint.com/35204/3d-printed-manav-robot/|title = Soccer Playing, 3D Printed MANAV Robot Debuts at IIT Mumbai TechFest|date = 7 January 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = EDWARDS|first = TE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.livemint.com/Industry/rc86Iu7h3rb44087oDts1H/Meet-Manav-Indias-first-3Dprinted-humanoid-robot.html|title = Meet Manav, India's first 3D-printed humanoid robot|date = 28 January 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Menezes|first = Beryl}}</ref><ref name="inside3dprinting">{{cite web|url=http://inside3dprinting.com/new-delhi-institutes-introduce-manav-indias-first-3d-printed-plastic-robot/|title=New Delhi Institutes Introduce Manav, India's First 3D-Printed Plastic Robot {{pipe}} Inside 3D Printing| publisher=inside3dprinting.com| accessdate=2015-10-07| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927205846/http://inside3dprinting.com/new-delhi-institutes-introduce-manav-indias-first-3d-printed-plastic-robot/|archivedate=2015-09-27}}</ref><ref name="ibtimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/indias-first-3d-printed-humanoid-robot-manav-launched-iit-mumbai-techfest-2015-619373|title=India's First 3D Printed Humanoid Robot 'Manav' Launched at IIT Mumbai TechFest 2015|date=5 January 2015 |publisher=ibtimes.co.in|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref><ref name="techentice">{{cite web|url=http://www.techentice.com/manav-indias-first-3d-printed-robot-from-iit-mumbai/|title=Manav- India's first 3D printed robot from IIT Mumbai|date=7 January 2015 |publisher=techentice.com|accessdate=2015-10-07}}</ref> It has a total of 21 degrees of freedom, two of which provide head movement allowing it to nod and look around. 1 degree of freedom goes to the waist which allows it to articulate the waist movement, allowing for a more human-like movement. The Robot is also equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] connectivity. It could perpetrate various activities like walking and dancing using human voice commands. It uses [[Binocular vision|binocular]] vision processing, giving it the ability to perceive depth and perspective.
