'''PRAC (Probabilistic Action Cores)''' is an [[natural language understanding|interpreter for natural-language]] instructions for [[robotics|robotic]] applications developed at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the [[University of Bremen]], [[Germany]], and is supported in parts by the [[European Commission]] and the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (DFG)]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |title =  Interpretation of Natural-language Robot Instructions: Probabilistic Knowledge Representation, Learning, and Reasoning |journal = PHD Thesis | year = 2017 | url = http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:46-00105882-13 |format = PDF}}</ref>

== Goals ==
The ultimate goal of the PRAC system is to make knowledge about everyday activities from websites like [[wikiHow]] available for service robots, such that they can autonomously acquire new high-level skills by browsing the [[World wide web|Web]].<ref>{{cite book |doi = 10.1109/IROS.2012.6385923 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.708.7035 |isbn = 978-1-4673-1736-8 |chapter = Everything robots always wanted to know about housework (But were afraid to ask) |title = 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems |pages = 243–250 |year = 2012 |last1 = Nyga |first1 = Daniel |last2 = Beetz |first2 = Michael }}</ref> PRAC addresses the problem that [[natural language]] is inherently vague and unspecific. To this end, PRAC maintains [[Statistical relational learning|probabilistic first-order knowledge bases]] over [[semantic network]]s represented in [[Markov logic network]]s. As opposed to other [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Machine learning|learning]] initiatives like [[Never-Ending Language Learning|NELL]] or [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], PRAC does not aim at answering questions in [[natural language]], but to disambiguate and infer information pieces that are missing in natural-language instructions, such that they can be executed by a robot. "This problem formulation is substantially different to the problem of text understanding for question answering or machine translation. In those reasoning tasks, the vagueness and ambiguity of natural-language expressions can often be kept and translated into other languages. In contrast, robotic agents have to infer missing information pieces and disambiguate the meaning of the instruction in order to perform the instruction successfully."<ref>{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |first2 = Michael |last2 = Beetz |title = Cloud-based Probabilistic Knowledge Services for Instruction Interpretation |journal = International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) | year = 2015 | url = http://www.acat-project.eu/modules/BibtexModule/uploads/PDF/nygabeetz2015a.pdf }}</ref> In addition to [[Probability Theory|probabilistic]] relational models, PRAC uses the principles of [[Case-based reasoning|analogical reasoning]] and [[instance-based learning]] to infer completions of roles in semantic networks.<ref>{{cite journal |first1 = Daniel |last1 = Nyga |first2 = Mareike |last2 = Picklum | first3 = Sebastian | last3 = Koralewski | first4 = Michael |last4 = Beetz |title = Instruction Completion through Instance-based Learning and Semantic Analogical Reasoning |journal = International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) | year = 2017}}</ref>

PRAC has been successfully applied to teach robots to conduct chemical experiments<ref>{{cite book |doi = 10.1109/IROS.2015.7354110 |isbn = 978-1-4799-9994-1 |chapter = Towards robots conducting chemical experiments |title = 2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) |pages = 5202–5208 |year = 2015 |last1 = Lisca |first1 = Gheorghe |last2 = Nyga |first2 = Daniel |last3 = Balint-Benczedi |first3 = Ferenc |last4 = Langer |first4 = Hagen |last5 = Beetz |first5 = Michael }}</ref> and to make pancakes and pizza from [[wikiHow]] articles.<ref>{{cite news |author= Will Knight |title=Robots Learn to Make Pancakes from WikiHow Articles | url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/540781/robots-learn-to-make-pancakes-from-wikihow-articles/ |quote=A robot called PR2 in Germany is learning to prepare pancakes and pizzas by carefully reading through WikiHow’s written directions.  |work=[[MIT Technology Review|MIT Tech Review]] |date= August 24, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-14 }}</ref>
