Predix as a cloud-based PaaS ([[platform as a service]]) is claimed to enable industrial-scale analytics for asset performance management (APM) and operations optimization by providing a standard way to connect machines, data, and people. GE expects Predix software to do for factories and plants what [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s iOS did for cell phones.<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Passeri|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13174112/1/ge-expects-predix-software-to-do-for-factories-what-apples-ios-did-for-cell-phones.html |title=GE Expects Predix Software to Do for Factories What Apple's iOS Did for Cell Phones |publisher=thestreet.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2015-06-29}}</ref> Built on [[Cloud Foundry]] [[Open-source software|open source]] technology, Predix provides a [[microservices]] based delivery model with a distributed architecture (cloud, and on-machine).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/0/8686.html|title=Predix - A Platform for the Industrial Internet Of Things|first=Sue|last=Gee|date=24 June 2015}}</ref>

== Overview ==
Predix aims towards system wide optimization and to create a detailed model that spans entire systems such as aircraft operations. The model allows better optimization of each part of the system (such as a turbine blade) as well as optimization of the entire system (such as airline operations).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2016/09/28/what-is-ge-predix-really-building/#4431c89b4822|title=What Is GE Predix Really Building?|first=Dan|last=Woods|date=28 September 2016}}</ref>

Predix is developed by GE Digital in [[San Ramon, California]] near [[Silicon Valley]] and originally its own business unit. In September 2015 it became re-integrated into General Electric's IT division.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21711079-american-industrial-giant-sprinting-towards-its-goal-german-firm-taking-more|title=Siemens and General Electric gear up for the internet of things|date=2016-12-03|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/analyzing-all-the-internet-of-things-at-ge-research-in-san-ramon-and-niskayuna/|title=Analyzing all the (Internet of) things at GE Research in San Ramon and Niskayuna|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>

In November 2016, [[Forrester Research]] published The Forrester Wave™: IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 and recognized GE's Predix as a leader in the evaluation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michele|last=Pelino|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+IoT+Software+Platforms+Q4+2016/-/E-RES136087 |title=The Forrester Wave™: IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 |publisher=[[Forrester Research]] |date=2016-11-15}}</ref>
