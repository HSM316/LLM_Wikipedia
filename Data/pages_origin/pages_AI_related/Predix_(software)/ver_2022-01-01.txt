'''Predix''', known as '''Predix Platform''' is an industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] software platform from [[GE Digital]]. It provides edge-to-cloud data connectivity, processing, analytics, and services to support industrial applications. The Platform has both [[Edge computing|edge]] and cloud components. Predix Cloud is hosted on [[AWS]].

== Overview ==
Predix Platform collects and transfers OT and IT data to the cloud by direct connector software or Predix Edge – an on-premises software product that also supports local analytics and applications processing. Predix Edge deployments can be managed at the local level and/or centrally from Predix Cloud.

In addition to data ingestion, processing and storage, Predix Platform provides a framework for operationalizing streaming and batch analytics processing.

Predix Essentials is a packaged and pre-configured version of the Predix Platform intended to immediately support GE Digital applications and typical IIoT use cases such as condition-based monitoring.

In November 2016, [[Forrester Research]] said GE Digital's Predix was one of eleven significant IoT packages.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michele|last=Pelino|url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+IoT+Software+Platforms+Q4+2016/-/E-RES136087 |title=IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 |publisher=[[Forrester Research]] |date=2016-11-15|quote=[W]e identified the 11 most significant IoT packages — Amazon Web Services (AWS), Ayla Networks, Cisco Jasper, Exosite, General Electric (GE), IBM, LogMeIn, Microsoft, PTC, SAP, and Zebra Technologies}}</ref>
