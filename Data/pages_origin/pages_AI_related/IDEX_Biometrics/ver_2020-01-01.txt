'''IDEX Biometrics ASA''', ({{Oslo Stock Exchange|IDEX}}) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[biometrics]] company, specialising in [[fingerprint]] imaging and [[fingerprint recognition]] technology. The company was founded 1996 and is headquartered in Oslo. In 2013 Idex opened two U.S.-based offices, one in Silicon Valley, California, and another in Boston, Massachusetts.

IDEX offers fingerprint sensor and biometric software for [[identity document|identity cards]], [[bank card|banking cards]], [[smart card]]s, [[access control]], healthcare, IOT and other security [[solution]]s. Fingerprint recognition is one form of [[biometric identification]], other examples being [[DNA]], [[face recognition]], [[iris recognition]] and [[retinal scan]] as well as identification based on behavioral patterns such as [[speaker recognition]], [[keystroke dynamics]] and [[signature recognition]].

==Technology==
IDEX's SmartFinger Film sensor technology is based on polymer process technologies and offers small, ultra-thin and flexible swipe fingerprint sensors.

IDEX holds early patents for low-cost [[capacitive]] fingerprint sensors and has a cross-licence with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] relating to this technology.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Biometric Update.com|title=IDEX gets fingerprint sensor patent license with Apple and AuthenTec|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201305/idex-gets-fingerprint-sensor-patent-license-with-apple-and-authentec/|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

IDEX has demonstrated mobile phone-related technology implementations running on an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform as well as a technology concept for finger print sensors built into the cover glass of mobile phones.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Biometric Update.com|title=IDEX to present mobile device fingerprint sensor concept at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201302/idex-to-present-mobile-device-fingerprint-sensor-concept-at-mobile-world-congress-in-barcelona/|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref> Finger recognition [[solution]]s for [[Apple iPhone]] and [[iPad]] using SmartFinger has been launched.<ref>{{Cite web|work=InfoTech|title=S.I.C.

IDEX's technology has also been integrated in biometric ISO-compliant cards.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Validus|title=IDEX and Validus Enter Into Strategic License Agreement to Supply the Next Generation of Biometric Powered Cards|url=http://www.findbiometrics.com/industry-news/i/7173/|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|work=IDEX|title=IDEX and Card Tech cooperate, showcase technology|url=http://www.idex.no/news/companynews/idex-and-card-tech-cooperate-showcase-technology/|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>

During 2013 IDEX added touch sensors to its planned product portfolio, in addition to swipe sensors. In November the company specified plans to deliver product
samples of touch sensors by mid 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Newsweb|title=IDEX interim report as at 30 September 2013|url=http://www.newsweb.no/newsweb/search.do?messageId=339751|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>

Since IDEX's announcement of a partnership with Safran Identity & Security (Morpho) in November 2016 to commercialize the first mass deployable biometric smart cards, OT (Oberthur Technologies) and Safran's Morpho business came together to become IDEMIA. In November 2017, IDEX announced continued development of innovative end-to-end biometric system solutions for payment cards with IDEMIA.<https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/11/24/1205671/0/en/IDEX-expands-partnership-with-IDEMIA-to-advance-biometric-contactless-card-solutions.html<
