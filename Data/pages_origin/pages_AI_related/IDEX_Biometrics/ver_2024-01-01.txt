'''IDEX Biometrics ASA''' ({{Oslo Stock Exchange|IDEX}}) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[biometrics]] company, specialising in [[fingerprint]] imaging and [[fingerprint recognition]] technology. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in [[Oslo]], but its main operation is in the US, with offices in New York and [[Massachusetts]]. The company also has offices in the UK and China.

IDEX offers fingerprint sensor and biometric software for [[identity document|identity cards]], [[bank card|banking cards]], [[smart card]]s, [[access control]], healthcare, IOT and other security solutions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is Endpoint Privilege Management |url=https://www.oneidentity.com/what-is-endpoint-privilege-management/ |access-date=2023-12-14 |website=One Identity |language=en}}</ref> Fingerprint recognition is one form of [[biometric identification]], other examples being [[DNA]], [[face recognition]], [[iris recognition]] and [[retinal scan]] as well as identification based on behavioral patterns such as [[speaker recognition]], [[keystroke dynamics]] and [[signature recognition]].

==Technology==
In 2010, IDEX SmartFinger Film was launched,<ref>[http://www.tu.no/it/2010/09/03/billig-fingerleser-i-plast Billig fingerleser i plast] (Teknisk Ukeblad, 3.9.2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.digi.no/850051/syltynn-norsk-sensor-for-fingeravtrykk Syltynn norsk sensor for fingeravtrykk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103042917/http://www.digi.no/850051/syltynn-norsk-sensor-for-fingeravtrykk}} (Teknisk Ukeblad, 30.9.2010)</ref> a thin and flexible fingerprint sensor that allows the entire fingerprint sensor system to be built into a standard plastic card, such as credit cards, bank cards and national ID cards. Such system-on-card solutions with a microprocessor running biometric algorithms and storage of biometric user data embedded ensure that biometric data never leaves the card itself. This safeguards privacy.<ref>[http://www.idex.no/ViewFile.aspx?id=813 Biometri og Bunnpris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514161216/http://www.idex.no/ViewFile.aspx?id=813}} (Finansavisen, 20.03.2012)</ref>

In the fall of 2012, IDEX changed its market focus. Until then, the company had emphasized the use of the technology in cards. The shift came after [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] acquired IDEX's competitor AuthenTec.<ref>[http://www.hegnar.no/bors/article700786.ece Apple blar opp milliarder for IT-selskap] (Hegnar Online, 7.7.2012)</ref> This acquisition was a harbinger that fingerprint readers would be built into mobile phones, IDEX believed, which was reiterated when Apple introduced its iPhone with a fingerprint reader in the fall of 2013.<ref>[http://www.dagensit.no/article2680334.ece - Apples lansering er bra for oss] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000424/http://www.dagensit.no/article2680334.ece}} (Dagens Næringsliv, 11.9.2013)</ref> Since then, several mobile manufacturers followed Apple's example and launched mobile phones with fingerprint solutions.<ref>[http://www.dagensit.no/article2662354.ece Norske Idex én av fire leverandører i verden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003751/http://www.dagensit.no/article2662354.ece}} (Dagens Næringsliv, 13.august 2013)</ref>

IDEX's SmartFinger Film sensor technology is based on polymer process technologies and offers small, ultra-thin and flexible swipe fingerprint sensors.

IDEX holds early patents for low-cost [[capacitive]] fingerprint sensors and has a cross-licence with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] relating to this technology.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Biometric Update.com|title=IDEX gets fingerprint sensor patent license with Apple and AuthenTec|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201305/idex-gets-fingerprint-sensor-patent-license-with-apple-and-authentec/|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

IDEX has demonstrated mobile phone-related technology implementations running on an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform, as well as a technology concept for fingerprint sensors built into the cover glass of mobile phones.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Biometric Update.com|title=IDEX to present mobile device fingerprint sensor concept at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona|url=http://www.biometricupdate.com/201302/idex-to-present-mobile-device-fingerprint-sensor-concept-at-mobile-world-congress-in-barcelona/|accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref> Finger recognition solutions for [[Apple iPhone]] and [[iPad]] using SmartFinger have been launched.<ref>{{Cite web|work=InfoTech|title=S.I.C.

IDEX's technology has also been integrated in biometric ISO-compliant cards.<ref>{{Cite web|work=Validus|title=IDEX and Validus Enter Into Strategic License Agreement to Supply the Next Generation of Biometric Powered Cards|url=http://www.findbiometrics.com/industry-news/i/7173/|accessdate=23 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|work=IDEX|title=IDEX and Card Tech cooperate, showcase technology|url=http://www.idex.no/news/companynews/idex-and-card-tech-cooperate-showcase-technology/|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> Fingerprint-based authentication of payment cards has gradually become the main focus of the company's efforts to commercialize its technology.<ref>{{Cite web|last=He|first=Serena|date=2021-02-11|title=IDEX Biometrics Works to Advance Biometric Payment Cards|url=https://identityreview.com/idex-biometrics-works-to-advance-biometric-payment-cards/|access-date=2021-08-31|website=Identity Review|language=en-US}}</ref>

In March 2021, the company started shipping TrustedBio, a new generation of sensors specifically targeting the card market.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-28|title=IDEX Biometrics shipping TrustedBio from mass production supply chain - Identity Week|url=https://identityweek.net/idex-biometrics-shipping-trustedbio-from-mass-production-supply-chain/|access-date=2021-09-10|website=identityweek.net|language=en-GB}}</ref>
