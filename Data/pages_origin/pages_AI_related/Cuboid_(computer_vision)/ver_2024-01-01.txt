{{Short description|Basic 3D shape extracted from a 2D image}}
In [[computer vision]], the term '''cuboid''' is used to describe a small [[Spatiotemporal gene expression|spatiotemporal]] volume extracted for purposes of [[activity recognition|behavior recognition]].<ref>{{Cite conference

== Production ==
Cuboids can be produced from both two-dimensional and three-dimensional images.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J. K.|last2=Xia|first2=Lu|date=2013|title=Spatio-temporal Depth Cuboid Similarity Feature for Activity Recognition Using Depth Camera|url=https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/html/Xia_Spatio-temporal_Depth_Cuboid_2013_CVPR_paper.html|pages=2834–2841}}</ref>

One method used to produce cuboids utilizes scene understanding (SUN) primitive databases, which are collections of pictures that already contain cuboids. By sorting through SUN primitive databases with machine learning tools, computers observe the conditions in which cuboids are produced in images from SUN primitive databases and can learn to produce cuboids from other images.<ref name=":0" />

RGB-D images, which are [[RGB color space|RGB]] images that also record the depth of each pixel, are occasionally used to produce cuboids because computers no longer need to determine the depth of an object, as they typically do because depth is already recorded.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Mishima|first1=Masashi|last2=Uchiyama|first2=Hideaki|last3=Thomas|first3=Diego|last4=Taniguchi|first4=Rin-ichiro|last5=Roberto|first5=Rafael|last6=Lima|first6=João Paulo|last7=Teichrieb|first7=Veronica|date=2019-01-06|title=Incremental 3D Cuboid Modeling with Drift Compensation|journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)|volume=19|issue=1|pages=178|doi=10.3390/s19010178|issn=1424-8220|pmc=6339002|pmid=30621340|bibcode=2019Senso..19..178M |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Cuboid production is sensitive to changes in color and illumination, blockage, and background clutter. This means that it is difficult for computers to produce cuboids of objects that are multicolored, irregularly illuminated, or partially covered, or if there are many objects in the background. This is partially due to the fact that algorithms for producing cuboids are still relatively simple.<ref name=":1" />

== Usage ==
Cuboids are created for [[point cloud]]-based three-dimensional maps and can be utilized in various situations such as augmented reality,<ref>{{Cite book|last=and|first=and|title=Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision |chapter=New calibration-free approach for augmented reality based on parameterized cuboid structure |date=September 1999|volume=1|pages=30–37 vol.1|doi=10.1109/ICCV.1999.791194|isbn=0-7695-0164-8|s2cid=45247014}}</ref> the automated control of cars, drones, and robots,<ref name=":2" /> and object detection.<ref name=":1" />

Cuboids allow for software to identify a scene through geometric descriptions in an “object-agnostic” fashion.<ref name=":0" />

Interest points, locations within images that are identified by a computer as essential to identifying the image, created from two-dimensional images can be used with cuboids for image matching, identifying a room or scene, and instance recognition. Interest points created from three dimensional images can be used with cuboids to recognize activities. This is possible because interest points aid software to focus on only the most important aspects of the images.<ref name=":1" />

RGB-D images and [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]] systems are used together in RGB-D SLAM systems, which are employed by [[Computer-aided design]] systems to generate point cloud-based three-dimensional maps.<ref name=":2" />

Most industrial [[Multiaxis machining|multi-axis machining]] tools use [[computer-aided manufacturing]] and subsequently work in cuboid work spaces.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Z.|last2=Wang|first2=G.|last3=Ji|first3=S.|last4=Wan|first4=Y.|last5=Yuan|first5=Q.|title=2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO) |chapter=Optimal design of a linear Delta robot for the prescribed cuboid dexterous workspace |date=December 2007|pages=2183–2188|doi=10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522508|isbn=978-1-4244-1761-2|s2cid=2186542}}</ref>
