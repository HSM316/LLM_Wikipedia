'''Feature Selection Toolbox''' (FST) is software primarily for [[feature selection]] in the [[machine learning]] domain,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.utia.cas.cz/separaty/2010/RO/somol-efficient%20feature%20subset%20selection%20and%20subset%20size%20optimization.pdf |title=Efficient Feature Subset Selection and Subset Size Optimization |author=Petr Somol |author2=Jana Novovičová |author3=Pavel Pudil |year=2010 |work=Pattern Recognition Recent Advances, INTECH |ISBN=978-953-7619-90-9 |pages=75–97 }}</ref> written in [[C++]], developed at the [[Institute of Information Theory and Automation]] (UTIA), of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]].

==Version 1==
The first generation of Feature Selection Toolbox (FST1) was a Windows application with user interface allowing users to apply several sub-optimal, optimal and mixture-based feature selection methods on data stored in a trivial proprietary textual flat file format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.utia.cas.cz/separaty/historie/somol-feature%20selection%20toolbox.pdf |title=Feature Selection toolbox |author=Petr Somol |author2=Pavel Pudil |year=2002 |work=Pattern Recognition vol.35, no.12, Elsevier |pages=2749–2759}}</ref>

==Version 3==
The third generation of Feature Selection Toolbox (FST3) was a [[Library (computing)|library]] without user interface, written to be more efficient and versatile than the original FST1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fst.utia.cz/download/FST3_Introduction_UTIA_TR2287.pdf |title=Introduction to Feature Selection Toolbox 3 – The C++ Library for Subset Search, Data Modeling and Classification |accessdate=2010-11-02 |author=Petr Somol |author2=Pavel Vácha |author3=Stanislav Mikeš |author4=Jan Hora |author5=Pavel Pudil |author6=Pavel Žid |year=2010 |work=UTIA Tech. Report No. 2287 |pages=1–12 }}</ref>

FST3 supports several standard [[data mining]] tasks, more specifically, [[data preprocessing]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]], but its main focus is on [[feature selection]]. In feature selection context, it implements several common as well as less usual techniques, with particular emphasis put on [[Thread (computer science)|threaded]] implementation of various sequential search methods (a form of [[hill-climbing]]). Implemented methods include individual feature ranking, floating search, oscillating search (suitable for very high-dimension problems) in randomized or deterministic form, optimal methods of [[branch and bound]] type, probabilistic class distance criteria, various classifier accuracy estimators, feature subset size optimization, feature selection with pre-specified feature weights, criteria ensembles, hybrid methods, detection of all equivalent solutions, or two-criterion optimization. FST3 is more narrowly specialized than popular software like the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]], [[RapidMiner]] or PRTools.<ref>[http://prtools.org/ PRTools]</ref>

By default, techniques implemented in the toolbox are predicated on the assumption that the data is available as a single flat file in a simple proprietary format or in Weka format ARFF, where each data point is described by a fixed number of numeric attributes. FST3 is provided without [[user interface]], and is meant to be used by users familiar both with [[machine learning]] and [[C++]] programming. The older FST1 software is more suitable for simple experimenting or educational purposes because it can be used with no need to code in C++.

==History==
* In 1999, development of the first Feature Selection Toolbox version started at UTIA as part of a PhD thesis. It was originally developed in Optima++ (later renamed Power++) RAD C++ environment.
* In 2002, the development of the first FST generation has been suspended, mainly due to end of [[Sybase]]'s support of the then used development environment.
* In 2002–2008, FST kernel was recoded and used for research experimentation within UTIA only.
* In 2009, 3rd FST kernel recoding from scratch begun.
* In 2010, FST3 was made publicly available in form of a C++ library without GUI. The accompanying webpage collects feature selection related links, references, documentation and the original FST1 available for download.
* In 2011, an update of FST3 to version 3.1 included new methods (particularly a novel dependency-aware feature ranking suitable for very-high-dimension recognition problems) and core code improvements.
