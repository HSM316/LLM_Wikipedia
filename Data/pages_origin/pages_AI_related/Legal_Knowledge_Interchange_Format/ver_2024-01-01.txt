The '''Legal Knowledge Interchange Format''' (LKIF) was developed in the European ESTRELLA project and was designed with the goal of becoming a standard for representing and interchanging policy, legislation and cases, including their justificatory arguments, in the legal domain. LKIF builds on and uses the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] for representing concepts and includes a reusable basic ontology of legal concepts. The core of LKIF consists of a combination of [[OWL-DL]] and [[Semantic Web Rule Language|SWRL]].<ref name="boer">Boer, Alexander, Thomas F.

LKIF was designed with two main roles in  mind: the translation of legal [[knowledge base|knowledge bases]] written in different representation formats and formalisms and to be a knowledge representation formalism which could be part of larger architectures for developing legal [[knowledge-based systems|knowledge systems]].<ref name="hoekstra">Hoekstra, Rinke, Joost Breuker, Marcello Di Bello, and Alexander Boer.
