A '''library system''' is a central organization created to manage and coordinate operations and services in or between different centers, buildings or [[Library branch|libraries branches]] and [[library]] patrons. They use a [[library classification]] to organize their volumes and nowadays also use an [[Integrated library system]] - an [[enterprise resource planning]] system for a library used to track items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed.<ref>Adamson, Veronica, ''et al.''

Some useful library automation software are: KOHA, Grennstone .LIBsis, and granthlaya.</ref> Many counties, states and universities have developed their own library systems. For example, the [[London Public Library]] in [[Canada]] has 16 branches, and the [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries]], in [[Finland]], has 63 libraries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iii.com/news/pr_display.php?id=559 | title=Helsinki Metropolitan Area Libraries (Finland) Upgrades to Sierra Services Platform | publisher=Innovative | type=Press release | date=5 February 2013 | accessdate=1 August 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044631/http://www.iii.com/news/pr_display.php?id=559 | archivedate=8 August 2014 }}</ref> Some countries, such as [[Venezuela]], have only one library system for the whole country; the [[National Library of Venezuela]] has 685 branches.
