== Overview ==
Apache Mynewt is a real-time operating system with a rich set of [[Library (computing)|libraries]] intended to make prototyping, deploying, and managing 32-bit [[microcontroller]] based [[Internet of things|IoT]] devices easy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1329158|title=Open RTOS Targets Net of Things|website=www.eetimes.com|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref> It is highly composable, to allow building [[embedded system]] applications (e.g., locks, medical devices, industrial IoT) across different types of microcontrollers. The name ''Mynewt'' is wordplay on the English word ''[[wikt:minute|minute]]'', meaning very small: the kernel is only 6 KB in size.

The OS is designed for connectivity, and comes with a full implementation of the [[Bluetooth low energy]] 4.2 stack. With the addition of BLE (supporting all Bluetooth 4.2 compliant security features except privacy) and various utilities such as the default file system, console, shell, logs, stats, etc., the image size is approximately 96 KB for the Nordic nRF51822 Bluetooth SoC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822 |title=nRF51822 |access-date=2016-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517194357/http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822 |archive-date=2016-05-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This size metric excludes the [[boot loader]] image.

== Core features ==
The core operating system supports:<sup>[[ChibiOS/RT|[3]]]</sup>
* Preemptive [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]]
* Tickless priority based [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]
* Programmable [[Programmable Interval Timer|timers]]
* System time
* [[Semaphore (programming)|Semaphores]]
* [[Mutex]]es
* Event [[Queue (data structure)|queues]]
* [[Memory management]] (allocation): [[Dynamic memory allocation|dynamic]] (heap) and [[Memory pool|pool]]
* Multi-stage software [[watchdog timer]] 
* Memory or [[data buffer]]s, to hold packet data as it moves up and down the [[Computer network|networking]] [[protocol stack]]
Other features and utilities include:
* [[Hardware abstraction]] layer with support for [[CPU time]], [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC), [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC), [[general-purpose input/output]] (GPIO), Inter-Integrated Circuit ([[I2C|I<sup>2</sup>C]]), [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM), [[serial port]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] (SPI), [[universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter]] (UART).
* Newtron [[flash file system]] (nffs) with minimal RAM usage and reliability features
* File system abstraction to allow client code to choose alternate [[file system]]s
* [[Terminal server|Console access]] and shell package
* Secure [[Booting|boot loader]] and [[image organizer]] (manager) that includes image integrity verification using [[SHA-256]] and optional [[digital signature]] verification of images before running them
* Test utilities to build [[regression testing]]
* Statistics and logs for all major packages
* JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]) encoder and decoder libraries
* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] interpreter

== Bluetooth low energy ==
The first network stack available in Mynewt is Bluetooth low energy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/high_performance/apache-mynewt-finds-a-home-on-arduino-srls-latest-sbcs-160520113001.html|title=Apache Mynewt finds a home on Arduino Srl's latest SBCs|website=www.linuxtoday.com|access-date=2016-05-24|archive-date=2016-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528022317/http://www.linuxtoday.com/high_performance/apache-mynewt-finds-a-home-on-arduino-srls-latest-sbcs-160520113001.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> and is called NimBLE. It complies with Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2.<ref>[https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2]</ref>

NimBLE includes both the host and controller components. Access to the controller source code makes the BLE performance highly configurable. For example, the BLE throughput can be adjusted by changing the connection intervals, data packet size, packet queue size etc. A use case requiring a large number of concurrent connections can similarly be configured, provided there is adequate RAM allocated. Example applications that demonstrate how to use available services are included in the package.

== Supported boards  ==
The [[operating system]] is designed for [[cross-platform]] use in [[embedded system]]s (devices) and microcontrollers. It includes board support packages for the following, {{as of|2023|07|lc=y}}:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core | title=Getting Help | website=[[GitHub]] }}</ref>

== Package management ==
The project includes the Newt Tool which is a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) based smart source [[package manager]] system for embedded systems development. Also, it allows composing builds with specified packages and compiler options, generating images and their digital signatures, and finally downloading and debugging the firmware on different targets.
