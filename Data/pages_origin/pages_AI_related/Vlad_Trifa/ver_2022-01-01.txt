==Career==

Vlad studied Computer Science at [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]].{{cn|date=November 2021}}

After graduating from EPFL, he went on to get his PhD in Computer Science at [[ETH Zurich]]. During his time as a PhD he also worked as a Research Associate for [[SAP SE|SAP]] where he met Dominique Guinard. Both focused on the Internet of Things at SAP especially looking at the integration of real-world devices such as wireless sensor networks to business processes and enterprise software (e.g., ERPs).
The complexity of these integrations at the time lead them to look simpler integration mechanisms. In 2007 they defined an application layer for the Internet of Things that uses Web standards called the Web of Things.<ref name="wot-blog">{{cite web

  |title=Web of Things, Team}}</ref> Vlad wrote his Ph.D thesis on the Web of Things, particularly looking at the real-time aspects of Things on the Web.<ref>*{{cite thesis

In 2011, Vlad co-founded [[EVRYTHNG]] together with Dominique Guinard, Niall Murphy and [[Andy Hobsbawm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://startupbeat.com/2012/12/14/backed-by-1m-in-seed-funding-from-atomico-evrythng-is-creating-the-smart-web-of-things-id3062/ |title=Backed by $1M in Seed funding from Atomico, EVRYTHNG is creating the smart 'Web of Things' |publisher=Startup Beat |date=14 December 2012 |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> The founding idea of EVRYTHNG was to create digital identities and Web APIs for all kinds of objects: from consumer goods to consumer electronics. As such EVRYTHNG was the first commercial Web of Things platform. Vlad served as the Chief Product Officer and then EVP of Research and Development at EVRYTHNG before joining [[Swisscom]] to lead the Swisscom Digital Lab at [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]].

In 2015, Vlad co-authored the Web Thing Model<ref>{{cite web
  |url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/wot-model/
  |title=Web Thing Model, W3C Member Submission}}</ref> which was accepted as an official [[W3C]] member submission. The Web Thing model is a first attempt at creating a simple Web based standard for the application layer of the [[Internet of Things]].<ref>{{cite web
