The '''Open Connectivity Foundation''' ('''OCF''') is an industry organization to develop standards, promote a set of [[interoperability]] guidelines, and provide a certification program for devices involved in the [[Internet of things]] (IoT). 
By 2016 it claimed to be one of the biggest industrial connectivity [[standards organization]]s for IoT.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://industrial-iot.com/2016/02/meet-the-open-connectivity-foundation-ocf/|title=IoT Standards Get a Big Push: Meet the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF)|date=23 February 2016|access-date=26 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531161545/https://industrial-iot.com/2016/02/meet-the-open-connectivity-foundation-ocf/|archive-date=31 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Its membership includes [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[Electrolux]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2016/02/20/new-open-connectivity-foundation-combines-open-interconnect-consortium-and-allseen-alliance/|title=Gigaom - New Open Connectivity Foundation combines Open Interconnect Consortium and AllSeen Alliance|author=Stowe Boyd|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/19/microsoft-intel-samsung-others-launch-iot-standards-group-open-connectivity-foundation/|title=Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, & others launch IoT standards group: Open Connectivity Foundation|author=Paul Sawers|work=VentureBeat|date=19 February 2016 }}</ref><ref name="MembersList">[http://openconnectivity.org/about/membership-list OCF Membership List]</ref>

The OCF delivers a framework that enables these requirements via a specification,<ref>[http://openconnectivity.org/upnp/specifications UPNP Specification Page]</ref><ref>[http://openconnectivity.org/resources/specifications OCF Specification Page]</ref> a reference implementation<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iotivity.org/ |title=OCF Reference Implementation Page |access-date=2016-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317104846/https://www.iotivity.org/ |archive-date=2016-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a certification program. [[IoTivity]], the open source reference implementation of the specifications, is actively developed by different members of the OCF.

==History==
The Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) began as an industry group to develop standards and certification for devices involved in the [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) based around the [[Constrained Application Protocol]] (CoAP).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Michael|title=Smart Home Show: The Open Interconnect Consortium|url=http://www.technology.fm/thesmarthomeshow/shs-2015-i02|publisher=TECHNOLOGY.FM|accessdate=6 March 2015|ref=fm}}</ref> OIC was created in July 2014 by [[Intel]], [[Broadcom]], and [[Samsung Electronics]].<ref>[http://www.cnet.com/news/intel-samsung-create-internet-of-things-group/ Intel, Samsung create Internet of Things group]</ref> Broadcom left the consortium shortly after it was established, due to a disagreement on how to handle intellectual property.<ref>[https://gigaom.com/2014/10/10/its-an-iot-standards-shakeup-as-broadcom-dumps-intels-open-interconnect-consortium/ It’s an IoT standards shakeup as Broadcom dumps Intel’s Open Interconnect Consortium]</ref>

In September 2015 a release candidate of the specification in version 1.0 for the core framework, smart home device, resource type, security and remote access capabilities was released.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151014235001/http://openinterconnect.org/oic-news-releases/open-interconnect-consortium-unveils-cloud-native-support-for-internet-of-things/ |OIC Candidate Specification 1.0 released]</ref>
By November, 2015, "diamond members" included [[Cisco Systems]], [[GE Digital|GE Software]], [[Intel]] and Samsung.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://openinterconnect.org/members/ |title=List of OIC members |access-date= October 28, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151113030957/http://openinterconnect.org/members/ |archive-date= November 13, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On February 19, 2016 the OIC changed its name to the Open Connectivity Foundation and added [[Microsoft]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[Electrolux]].<ref>[http://fortune.com/2016/02/19/microsoft-qualcomm-join-rebranded-internet-of-things-club/  Microsoft, Qualcomm Join Rebranded Internet of Things Club]</ref>

In November 2018 it was announced version 1 of the standard was ratified by [[International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO/IEC 30118-1:2018.<ref>[https://openconnectivity.org/announcements/open-connectivity-foundation-specification-achieves-recognition-by-international-standards-and-conformity-committees-driving-secure-interoperability-across-the-internet-of-things-worldwide The International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission Joint Technical Committee 1 approved the Open Connectivity Foundation Specification as an Internationally Recognized Internet of Things Standard]</ref>

In November, 2019, OCF released a draft "cloud API" for [[cloud computing]] services in addition to device-to-device and device-to-cloud service specifications.

By 2021, "diamond members" were [[Haier]], [[LG Corporation]] and Samsung.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://openconnectivity.org/foundation/membership-list/ |title=List of OCF members |access-date= October 28, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210507040555/https://openconnectivity.org/foundation/membership-list/ |archive-date=  May 7, 2021 }}</ref>
