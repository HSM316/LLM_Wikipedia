'''Knowledge compilation''' is a family of approaches for addressing the intractability of
a number of [[artificial intelligence]] problems.

A propositional model is compiled in an off-line phase in order to support some queries in [[polynomial time]]. Many ways of compiling a propositional models exist.<ref name="darwiche">Adnan Darwiche, Pierre Marquis, "[https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.989 A Knowledge Compilation Map]", Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 17 (2002) 229-264</ref>

Different compiled representations have different properties.
The three main properties are:
* The compactness of the representation
* The queries that are supported in polynomial time
* The transformations of the representations that can be performed in polynomial time

== Classes of representations ==

Some examples of [[Binary decision diagram|diagram classes]] include [[OBDD]]s, [[FBDD]]s, and non-deterministic OBDDs, as well as [[Multi-valued Decision Diagram|MDD]].

Some examples of [[Boolean formula|formula]] classes include [[Disjunctive normal form|DNF]] and [[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]].

Examples of circuit classes include [[Negation normal form|NNF]], DNNF, d-DNNF, and [[Sentential decision diagram|SDD]].

== Knowledge compilers ==

* c2d: supports compilation to d-DNNF
* d4: supports compilation to d-DNNF
* miniC2D: supports compilation to SDD
* KCBox: supports compilation to OBDD, OBDD[AND], and CCDD
