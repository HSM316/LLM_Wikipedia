'''''Talking Angela''''' is a videogame [[Application software|app]] (formerly a [[Chatbot|chatterbot]]), developed by Slovenian studio [[Outfit7]] as part of the ''[[Talking Tom & Friends]]'' series. It was released on November 13, 2012 and January 2012 for iPhone, iPod and iPad, January 2013 for Android, and January 2014 for [[Google Play]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.talkingangelafree | title=Talking Angela | publisher=Outfit7 | access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> The app's successor, the ''My Talking Angela'' app, was released in December 2014.

== Paedophile hoax==
In February 2014, ''Talking Angela'' was the subject of an Internet that it encourages children to disclose personal information about themselves, which is ostensibly then used by [[pedophile|paedophile]]s to identify the location of these children. The rumor, which was widely circulated on [[Facebook]] and various websites claiming to be dedicated to parenting, claims that Angela, the game's main character, asks the game's user for private personal information using the game's text-chat feature.<ref name="snopes">{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/angela.asp | title=Talking Angela | work=[[Snopes]] | date=19 February 2014 | access-date=10 May 2014 | author=Mikkelson, Barbara}}</ref> Other versions of the rumor even attribute the disappearance of a child to the app,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kovacs |first1=Eduard |date=24 February 2014 |title=Talking Angela Hoax: There Is a Man in the Cat's Eyes |url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/Talking-Angela-Hoax-There-Is-a-Man-in-the-Cat-s-Eyes-428898.shtml |access-date=1 December 2020 |website=[[Softpedia]]}}</ref> or claim that it is run by a  paedophile ring, while some go so far as to even claim that the user is recorded by the camera and can be seen in Angela's eyes.<ref>{{cite web |author=Azar, Kellee |date=20 February 2014 |title=Talking Angela app at center of hoax |url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/24776902/talking-angela-app-at-center-of-hoax#axzz31SUpeeJU |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512183057/http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/24776902/talking-angela-app-at-center-of-hoax#axzz31SUpeeJU |archive-date=12 May 2014 |access-date=11 May 2014 |work=My Fox DC |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It was debunked by [[Snopes.com]] soon afterwards. The site's owners, Barbara and David Mikkelson, reported that they had tried to "prompt" it to give responses asking for private information but were unsuccessful, even when asking it explicitly sexual questions.<ref name="snopes"/> While it is true that, in the game with child mode off, Angela does ask for the user's name, age and personal preferences to determine conversation topics, Outfit7 has said that this information is all "anonymized" and all personal information is removed from it. It is also impossible for a person to take control of what Angela says in the game, since the app is based on chat bot software.<ref name="today">{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/02/20/talking-angela-app-scare-hoax/5635337/ | title=Talking Angela app scare based on a hoax | work=[[USA Today]] | date=20 February 2014 | access-date=10 May 2014 | author=Lee, Jolie}}</ref>

In 2015, the hoax was revived again on Facebook, prompting online security company [[Sophos]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' to debunk it again.<ref name=":0" /> Sophos employee Paul Ducklin wrote on the company's blog that the message being posted on Facebook promoting the hoax was "close to 600 rambling, repetitious words, despite claiming at the start that it didn’t have words to describe the situation. It's ill-written, and borders on being illiterate and incomprehensible."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/17/talking-angela-app-children-facebook-chain-letter | title=No, the Talking Angela app is not dangerous for your children | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=17 February 2014 | access-date=10 May 2014 | author=Dredge, Stuart}}</ref> [[Bruce Wilcox]], one of the game's programmers, has attributed the hoax's popularity to the fact that the chatbot program in ''Talking Angela'' is so realistic.<ref name=cnet/>

However, genuine concern has been raised that the game's child mode may be too easy for children to turn off, which, if they did, would allow them to purchase "coins", which can be used as currency in the game, via iTunes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-talking-angela-app-completely-safe-your-children-1437287 | title=Why the Talking Angela App is Completely Safe For Your Children | work=[[International Business Times]] | date=20 February 2014 | access-date=10 May 2014 | author=Russon, Mary-Ann}}</ref> Disabling child mode also enables the chat feature, which, while it is not "connecting your children to  paedophiles", still raises concerns as well, according to Stuart Dredge, a journalist from ''The Guardian''. Dredge wrote that in chat mode, Angela asks for information such as the user's name.<ref name=":0">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/18/talking-angela-app-children-safety | title=What the Talking Angela app is really saying to your kids | work=The Guardian | date=20 February 2014 | access-date=12 May 2014 | author=Dredge, Stuart}}</ref>

===Impact===
The scare has significantly boosted the game's popularity, and is credited with helping the app make it into the top 10 free iPhone apps soon after the hoax became widely known in February 2015<ref>{{cite web |author=Smith, Josh |date=19 February 2014 |title=Talking Angela App Scare Skyrockets App to Top of Charts |url=http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/02/19/talking-angela-app/ |access-date=10 May 2014 |work=GottaBeMobile.com}}</ref> and 3rd most popular for all iPhone apps at the start of the following month.<ref name="cnet">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/talking-angela-programmer-talks-hoaxes-ai-mastery-q-a/ | title='Talking Angela' programmer talks hoaxes, AI mastery (Q&A) | work=[[CNET]] | date=1 March 2014 | access-date=10 May 2014 | author=Terdiman, Daniel}}</ref> By 2016, the chat feature, along with the camera function were removed from the app.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Rourke |first=Ciara |date=2019-05-14 |title=No, the Talking Angela app isn't secretly taking your child's picture |url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/14/viral-image/no-talking-angela-app-isnt-secretly-taking-your-ch/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=[[PolitiFact]] |language=en-US |quote=It seems that now the app doesn’t have a chatting option at all, regardless of the users’ age.
