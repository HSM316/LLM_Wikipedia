'''Yooreeka''' is a library for data mining, machine learning, [[soft computing]], and mathematical analysis. The project started with the code of the book "Algorithms of the Intelligent Web".<ref name="MarmanisBabenko2009">{{cite book|author1=Haralambos Marmanis|author2=Dmitry Babenko|title=Algorithms of the Intelligent Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YApAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Manning|isbn=978-1-933988-66-5}}</ref> Although the term "Web" prevailed in the title, in essence, the algorithms are valuable in any [[software]] application.

It covers all major algorithms and provides many examples.

Yooreeka 2.x is licensed under the [[Apache License]] rather than the somewhat more restrictive [[LGPL]] (which was the license of v1.x).

The library is written 100% in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language.
