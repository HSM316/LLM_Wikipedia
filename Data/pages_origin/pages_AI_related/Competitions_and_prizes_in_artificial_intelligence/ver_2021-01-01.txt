There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in [[artificial intelligence]].

==General machine intelligence==
The [[Rumelhart Prize|David E. Rumelhart prize]] is an annual award for making a "significant contemporary contribution to the theoretical foundations of human cognition".  The prize is $100,000.

The Human-Competitive Award<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.human-competitive.org/|title=Human Competitive|website=www.human-competitive.org}}</ref> is an annual challenge started in 2004 to reward results "competitive with the work of creative and inventive humans". The prize is $10,000.  Entries are required to use [[evolutionary computing]].

The [[IJCAI Award for Research Excellence]] is a biannual award given at the [[IJCAI]] conference to researcher in [[artificial intelligence]] as a recognition of [[excellence]] of their career.

The [[Kaggle]] - "the world's largest community of data scientists compete to solve most valuable problems".

==Conversational behaviour==
The [[Loebner prize]] is an annual competition to determine the best [[Turing test]] competitors. The winner is the computer system that, in the judges' opinions, demonstrates the "most human" conversational behaviour, they have an additional prize for a system that in their opinion passes a Turing test. This second prize has not yet been awarded.

==Automatic control==

===Pilotless aircraft===
[[Image:VT Searching.png|thumb|right|200px|International Aerial Robotics Competition]]
The [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]] is a long-running event begun in 1991 to advance the state of the art in fully autonomous air vehicles.  This competition is restricted to university teams (although industry and governmental sponsorship of teams is allowed).  Key to this event is the creation of flying robots which must complete complex missions without any human intervention.  Successful entries are able to interpret their environment and make real-time decisions based only on a high-level mission directive (e.g., "find a particular target inside a building having certain characteristics which is among a group of buildings 3 kilometers from the aerial robot launch point").  In 2000, a $30,000 prize was awarded during the 3rd Mission (search and rescue), and in 2008, $80,000 in prize money was awarded at the conclusion of the 4th Mission (urban reconnaissance).

===Driverless cars===
[[Image:desertToCity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darpa Grand Challenge]]
The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] is a series of competitions to promote [[driverless car]] technology, aimed at a congressional mandate stating that by 2015 one-third of the operational ground combat vehicles of the US Armed Forces should be unmanned.<ref>[http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge04/sponsor_toolkit/congress_lang.pdf Congressional Mandate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216094908/http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge04/sponsor_toolkit/congress_lang.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }} DARPA</ref> While the first race had no winner, the second awarded a $2 million prize for the autonomous navigation of a hundred-mile trail, using [[GPS]], computers and a sophisticated array of sensors. In November 2007, DARPA introduced the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]], a sixty-mile urban area race requiring vehicles to navigate through traffic. In November 2010 the US Armed Forces extended the competition with the $1.6 million prize [[Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge]] to consider cooperation between multiple vehicles in a simulated-combat situation.

==Games==
The [[World Computer Chess Championship]] has been held since 1970.  The International Computer Games Association continues to hold an annual [[Computer Olympiad]] which includes this event plus computer competitions for many other games.

The Ing Prize was a substantial money prize attached to the World [[Computer Go]] Congress, starting from 1985 and expiring in 2000.  It was a graduated set of handicap challenges against young professional players with increasing prizes as the handicap was lowered.  At the time it expired in 2000, the unclaimed prize was 400,000 NT dollars for winning a 9-stone handicap match.

The AAAI [[General Game Playing]] Competition is a competition to develop programs that are effective at [[General Game Playing|general game playing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://games.stanford.edu/competition/competition.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629220940/http://games.stanford.edu/competition/competition.html|url-status=dead|title=General Game Playing<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=June 29, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2007/aaai07game.php|title=AAAI-07 General Game Playing Competition|website=www.aaai.org}}</ref> Given a definition of a game, the program must play it effectively without human intervention.  Since the game is not known in advance the competitors cannot especially adapt their programs to a particular scenario.  The prize in 2006 and 2007 was $10,000.

The General Video Game AI Competition (GVGAI<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvgai.net/|title=The GVG-AI Competition|website=www.gvgai.net}}</ref>) poses the problem of creating artificial intelligence that can play a wide, and in principle unlimited, range of games. Concretely, it tackles the problem of devising an algorithm that is able to play any game it is given, even if the game is not known a priori. Additionally, the contests poses the challenge of creating level and rule generators for any game is given. This area of study can be seen as an approximation of General Artificial Intelligence, with very little room for game dependent heuristics. The competition runs yearly in different tracks: single player planning,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI2014Competition.pdf|title=Single Player Planning GVGAI}}</ref> two-player planning,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI20162PCompetition.pdf|title=Two-Player Planning GVGAI}}</ref> single player learning,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liujialin.tech/publications/GVGAISingleLearning_manual.pdf|title=Single Player Learning GVGAI}}</ref> level<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGLG.pdf|title=Level Generation GVGAI}}</ref> and rule<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGRuleGeneration.pdf|title=Rule Generation GVGAI}}</ref> generation, and each track prizes ranging from 200 to 500 US dollars for winners and runner-ups.

The 2007 Ultimate Computer Chess Challenge was a competition organised by [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] that pitted
[[Deep Fritz]] against [[Deep Junior]].  The prize was $100,000.

The annual [[Arimaa#Arimaa Challenge|Arimaa Challenge]] offered a $10,000 prize until the year 2020 to develop a program that plays the board game [[Arimaa]] and defeats a group of selected human opponents. In 2015, David Wu's bot bot_sharp beat the humans, losing only 2 games out of 9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2015/showGames.cgi|title=2015 Arimaa Challenge Match|website=arimaa.com}}</ref> As a result, the Arimaa Challenge was declared over and David Wu received the prize of $12,000 ($2,000 being offered by third-parties for 2015's championship).

[[2K Australia]] is offering a prize worth A$10,000 to develop a game-playing bot that plays a [[first-person shooter]].  The aim is to convince a panel of judges that it is actually a human player. The competition started in 2008 and was won in 2012. A new competition is planned for 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.botprize.org/|title=Bot Prize &#124; Robots, AI, and Media}}</ref>

The [[Google AI Challenge]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908001350/http://www.ai-contest.com/index.php]</ref> was a bi-annual online contest organized by the [[University of Waterloo]] Computer Science Club and sponsored by [[Google]] that ran from 2009 to 2011. Each year a game was chosen and contestants submitted specialized [[computer game bot|automated bots]] to play against other competing bots.

[[Cloudball]] had its first round in Spring 2012 and finished on June 15. It is an international artificial intelligence programming contest, where users continuously submit the actions their soccer teams will take in each time step, in simple high level C# code.
