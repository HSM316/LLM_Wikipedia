MIT Press {{ISBN|9780262018258}}.</ref> [[Training data]] consists of lists of items with some [[partial order]] specified between items in each list. This order is typically induced by giving a numerical or ordinal score or a binary judgment (e.g. "relevant" or "not relevant") for each item. The ranking model  purposes to rank, i.e. producing a [[permutation]] of items in new, unseen lists in a similar way to rankings in the training data.

== Applications ==

=== In information retrieval ===
[[File:MLR-search-engine-example.png|250px|thumb|A possible architecture of a machine-learned search engine.]]
Ranking is a central part of many [[information retrieval]] problems, such as [[document retrieval]], [[collaborative filtering]], [[sentiment analysis]], and [[online advertising]].

A possible architecture of a machine-learned search engine is shown in the accompanying figure.

Training data consists of queries and documents matching them together with relevance degree of each match. It may be prepared manually by human ''assessors'' (or ''raters'', as [[Google]] calls them),
<!-- "assessor" is the more standard term, used e.g. by TREC conference -->
who check results for some queries and determine [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] of each result. It is not feasible to check the relevance of all documents, and so typically a technique called pooling is used — only the top few documents, retrieved by some existing ranking models are checked. <!--
  TODO: write something about selection bias caused by pooling
--> Alternatively, training data may be derived automatically by analyzing ''clickthrough logs'' (i.e. search results which got clicks from users),<ref name="Joachims2002">{{citation

Training data is used by a learning algorithm to produce a ranking model which computes the relevance of documents for actual queries.

Typically, users expect a search query to complete in a short time (such as a few hundred milliseconds for web search), which makes it impossible to evaluate a complex ranking model on each document in the corpus, and so a two-phase scheme is used.<ref>{{citation |author1=B.

== Feature vectors ==
For the convenience of MLR algorithms, query-document pairs are usually represented by numerical vectors, which are called ''[[feature vector]]s''. Such an approach is sometimes called ''bag of features'' and is analogous to the [[bag of words]] model and [[vector space model]] used in information retrieval for representation of documents.

Components of such vectors are called ''[[feature (machine learning)|feature]]s'', ''factors'' or ''ranking signals''. They may be divided into three groups (features from [[document retrieval]] are shown as examples):
* ''Query-independent'' or ''static'' features — those features, which depend only on the document, but not on the query. For example, [[PageRank]] or document's length. Such features can be precomputed in off-line mode during indexing. They may be used to compute document's ''static quality score'' (or ''static rank''), which is often used to speed up search query evaluation.<ref name="manning-q-eval" /><ref>{{cite conference

 }}</ref>
* ''Query-dependent'' or ''dynamic'' features — those features, which depend both on the contents of the document and the query, such as [[TF-IDF]] score or other non-machine-learned ranking functions.
* ''[[Query-level feature]]s'' or ''query features'', which depend only on the query. For example, the number of words in a query.

Some examples of features, which were used in the well-known [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/letor-learning-rank-information-retrieval/  LETOR] dataset:
* TF, [[TF-IDF]], [[Okapi BM25|BM25]], and [[language modeling]] scores of document's [[Information retrieval|zone]]s (title, body, anchors text, URL) for a given query;
* Lengths and [[Inverse document frequency|IDF]] sums of document's zones;
* Document's [[PageRank]], [[HITS algorithm|HITS]] ranks and their variants.

Selecting and designing good features is an important area in machine learning, which is called [[feature engineering]].

== Evaluation measures ==
{{main|Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)#Offline_metrics}}

There are several measures (metrics) which are commonly used to judge how well an algorithm is doing on training data and to compare the performance of different MLR algorithms. Often a learning-to-rank problem is reformulated as an optimization problem with respect to one of these metrics.

Examples of ranking quality measures:
*[[Mean Average Precision|Mean average precision]] (MAP);
* [[Discounted cumulative gain|DCG]] and [[Normalized discounted cumulative gain|NDCG]];
* [[Precision (information retrieval)|Precision]]@''n'', NDCG@''n'', where "@''n''" denotes that the metrics are evaluated only on top ''n'' documents;
* [[Mean reciprocal rank]];
* [[Kendall's tau]];
* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman's rho]].

DCG and its normalized variant NDCG are usually preferred in academic research when multiple levels of relevance are used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276/handouts/lecture15-learning-ranking.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-14 |archive-date=2011-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104111500/http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs276/handouts/lecture15-learning-ranking.ppt |url-status=live }}</ref> Other metrics such as MAP, MRR and precision, are defined only for binary judgments.

Recently, there have been proposed several new evaluation metrics which claim to model user's satisfaction with search results better than the DCG metric:
* Expected reciprocal rank (ERR);<ref>{{citation

Both of these metrics are based on the assumption that the user is more likely to stop looking at search results after examining a more relevant document, than after a less relevant document.

== Approaches ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Tie-Yan Liu of Microsoft Research Asia has analyzed existing algorithms for learning to rank problems in his book ''Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval''.<ref name="liu" /> He categorized them into three groups by their input spaces, output spaces, hypothesis spaces (the core function of the model) and [[loss function]]s: the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approach. In practice, listwise approaches often outperform pairwise approaches and pointwise approaches. This statement was further supported by a large scale experiment on the performance of different learning-to-rank methods on a large collection of benchmark data sets.<ref name="Tax2015">{{citation |author1=Tax, Niek |author2=Bockting, Sander |author3=Hiemstra, Djoerd |journal=Information Processing & Management |volume=51 |issue=6 |title=A cross-benchmark comparison of 87 learning to rank methods |pages=757–772 |year=2015 |url=http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~hiemstra/papers/ipm2015.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2015.07.002 |access-date=2017-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809115827/http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~hiemstra/papers/ipm2015.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In this section, without further notice, <math>x</math> denotes an object to be evaluated, for example, a document or an image, <math>f(x)</math> denotes a single-value hypothesis, <math>h(\cdot)</math> denotes a bi-variate or multi-variate functions function and <math>L(\cdot)</math> denotes the loss function.  

=== Pointwise approach ===
In this case, it is assumed that each query-document pair in the training data has a numerical or ordinal score. Then the learning-to-rank problem can be approximated by a regression problem — given a single query-document pair, predict its score.  Formally speaking, the pointwise approach aims at learning a function <math>f(x)</math> predicting the real-value or ordinal score of a document <math>x</math> using the loss function <math>L(f, x_j, y_j)</math>. 

A number of existing [[Supervised learning|supervised]] machine learning algorithms can be readily used for this purpose. [[Ordinal regression]] and [[classification (machine learning)|classification]] algorithms can also be used in pointwise approach when they are used to predict the score of a single query-document pair, and it takes a small, finite number of values.

=== Pairwise approach ===
In this case, the learning-to-rank problem is approximated by a classification problem — learning a [[binary classifier]] <math>h(x_u, x_v)</math> that can tell which document is better in a given pair of documents. The classifier shall take two images as its input and the goal is to minimize a loss function <math>L(h; x_u, x_v, y_{u,v})</math>. The loss function may reflect the average number of [[Permutation#Inversions|inversions]] in ranking.

In many cases, the binary classifier <math>h(x_u, x_v)</math> is implemented with a scoring function <math>f(x)</math>.  As an example, RankNet <ref>{{cite document |last1=Burges |first1=Chris J. C. |last2=Shaked |first2=Tal |last3=Renshaw |first3=Erin |last4=Lazier |first4=Ari |last5=Deeds |first5=Matt |last6=Hamilton |first6=Nicole |last7=Hullender |first7=Greg |title=Learning to Rank using Gradient Descent |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-to-rank-using-gradient-descent |date=1 August 2005 |journal= |access-date=31 March 2021 |archive-date=26 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226045904/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-to-rank-using-gradient-descent/ |url-status=live }}</ref> adapts a probability model and defines <math>h(x_u, x_v)</math> as the estimated probability of the document <math>x_u</math> has higher quality than <math>x_v</math>: 

:<math>  P_{u, v}(f) = 
  \text{CDF} (f(x_u) - f(x_v)),
</math>
where <math>\text{CDF}(\cdot)</math> is a [[cumulative distribution function]], for example, the [[Logistic_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function|standard logistic CDF]], i.e.
:<math>
  \text{CDF}(x)
  =
  \frac{
    1
  }{
    1 + \exp\left[ - x \right]
  }. 
</math>

=== Listwise approach ===
These algorithms try to directly optimize the value of one of the above evaluation measures, averaged over all queries in the training data. This is difficult because most evaluation measures are not continuous functions with respect to ranking model's parameters, and so continuous approximations or bounds on evaluation measures have to be used.

Several conferences, such as [[Neural Information Processing Systems|NIPS]], [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|SIGIR]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] had workshops devoted to the learning-to-rank problem since mid-2000s (decade).

=== Practical usage by search engines ===
Commercial [[web search engine]]s began using machine learned ranking systems since the 2000s (decade). One of the first search engines to start using it was [[AltaVista]] (later its technology was acquired by [[Overture Services, Inc.|Overture]], and then [[Yahoo]]), which launched a [[gradient boosting]]-trained ranking function in April 2003.<ref>Jan O. Pedersen.

== Vulnerabilities ==

Similar to recognition applications in [[computer vision]], recent neural network based ranking algorithms are also found to be susceptible to covert [[generative adversarial network | adversarial attacks]], both on the candidates and the queries.<ref name="Zhou Niu Wang Zhang 2020">{{cite arXiv | last1=Zhou | first1=Mo | last2=Niu | first2=Zhenxing | last3=Wang | first3=Le | last4=Zhang | first4=Qilin | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | title=Adversarial Ranking Attack and Defense | year=2020 | class=cs.CV | eprint=2002.11293v2 }}</ref> With small perturbations imperceptible to human beings, ranking order could be arbitrarily altered. In addition, model-agnostic transferable adversarial examples are found to be possible, which enables black-box adversarial attacks on deep ranking systems without requiring access to their underlying implementations.<ref name="Zhou Niu Wang Zhang 2020" /><ref name="Li Ji Liu Hong pp. 4899–4908">{{cite journal | last1=Li | first1=Jie | last2=Ji | first2=Rongrong | last3=Liu | first3=Hong | last4=Hong | first4=Xiaopeng | last5=Gao | first5=Yue | last6=Tian | first6=Qi | title=Universal Perturbation Attack Against Image Retrieval | website=International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2019) | year=2019 | url=https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Li_Universal_Perturbation_Attack_Against_Image_Retrieval_ICCV_2019_paper.html | pages=4899–4908 | arxiv=1812.00552 | journal= | access-date=2020-07-04 | archive-date=2020-07-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706051031/https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Li_Universal_Perturbation_Attack_Against_Image_Retrieval_ICCV_2019_paper.html | url-status=live }}</ref> 

Conversely, the robustness of such ranking systems can be improved via adversarial defenses such as the Madry defense.<ref name="Madry Makelov Schmidt Tsipras 2017">{{cite arXiv | last1=Madry | first1=Aleksander | last2=Makelov | first2=Aleksandar | last3=Schmidt | first3=Ludwig | last4=Tsipras | first4=Dimitris | last5=Vladu | first5=Adrian | title=Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks | date=2017-06-19 | class=stat.ML | eprint=1706.06083v4 }}</ref>
