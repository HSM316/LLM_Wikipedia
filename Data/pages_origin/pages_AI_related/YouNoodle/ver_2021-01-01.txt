==History and structure==
YouNoodle was founded by Rebeca Hwang and Torsten Kolind in 2010. The company was spun off a project started by [[Bob Goodson]] and [[Kirill Makharinsky]] in 2007 with support from [[Peter Thiel]] ([[Founders Fund]]), [[Max Levchin]] ([[PayPal]]) and Charles Lho (Amicus Group), founding investor and Chairman of YouNoodle today. This project also spawned [[Quid (company)|Quid]] (Goodson) and indirectly [[Ostrovok]] (Makharinsky). Although also named YouNoodle, this project/company was discontinued in 2010, when the three new entities started operations.

The founders of the 2007-2010 entity were Goodson and Makharinsky, both former students of the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=richtel>{{cite news |author=Matt Richtel |authorlink=Matt Richtel |title=A Start-Up Says It Can Predict Others' Fate |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 18, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/technology/18vc.html |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref> Goodson had studied medieval English literature before moving from Oxford to California when Levchin, the co-founder of [[PayPal]], invited him to join a start-up there.<ref name=tyler_test>{{cite news |author=Richard Tyler |title=YouNoodle takes its own test |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=August 7, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/08/07/cnent207.xml |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Richard Tyler |title=Oxford's brightest head to Silicon Valley for dotcom riches |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=May 1, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/04/27/ccsil127.xml |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref> Makharinsky's degree was in [[applied mathematics]],<ref name=tyler>{{cite news |author=Richard Tyler |title=YouNoodle: The start-up valuation tool that claims to outguess gut instinct |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=August 7, 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/08/07/cnent107.xml |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref> and he was also encouraged to pursue opportunities in the United States by Levchin.<ref name=marshal>{{cite news |author=Matt Marshal |title=YouNoodle offers investors a "start-up predictor" |work=VentureBeat |date=February 18, 2008 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/02/18/younoodle-offers-investors-a-start-up-predictor/ |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref> Other significant employees included Hwang (co-founder of today's YouNoodle), a Stanford University doctoral student whose research is into [[social network]] theory.<ref name=ha>{{cite news |author=Anthony Ha |authorlink=Anthony Ha |title=YouNoodle's startup predictor wants to tell you how much your company is worth |work=VentureBeat |date=August 7, 2008 |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/08/07/younoodles-startup-predictor-wants-to-tell-you-how-much-a-company-is-worth/ |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref>

==Startup predictor==
YouNoodle's now discontinued "Startup predictor", part of the 2007-2010 entity and developed by Makharinsky and Hwang, uses mathematical models to predict the success of new businesses.<ref name=tyler/> The user fills in a questionnaire, which takes about half an hour to complete and concentrates on the business' concept, finances, founders and advisers.<ref name=gunnison>{{cite news |author=Liz Gunnison |title=A Crystal Ball for Startups |work=[[Cond√© Nast Portfolio]] |date=August 7, 2008 |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2008/08/07/a-crystal-ball-for-startups |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Rico Gagliano |title=Site lets you peek at a startup's future |work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]] |publisher=[[American Public Media]] |date=August 7, 2008 |url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/08/07/you_noodle |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref> Because the procedure is designed for very new companies, questions on revenue and traffic are not included.<ref name=ha/> The site then provides an estimate of what the company's value will be after three years and a score from 1 to 1000 representing its value as an investment.<ref name=gunnison/> The service is free for the startups themselves, but YouNoodle intends to charge third parties for access to the results.<ref name=arrington>{{cite news |author=Michael Arrington |authorlink=Michael Arrington |title=The (Highly Controversial) YouNoodle Startup Valuation Predictor Is Coming |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=August 5, 2008 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/05/the-highly-controversial-younoodle-startup-predictor-is-coming/ |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref>  (The level of detail required by the questionnaire makes it difficult for people without inside knowledge of a company to provide the data for a prediction on their own.<ref name=vascellaro>{{cite news |author=Jessica Vascellaro |authorlink=Jessica Vascellaro |title=Noodling Around On Startup Valuations |work=[[The Wall Street Journal|WSJ.com]] |date=August 6, 2008 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/biztech/2008/08/06/noodling-around-on-startup-valuations/ |accessdate=2008-08-13 }}</ref>)

The company's founders have declined to explain the algorithm in detail, but state that it takes into account the entrepreneurs' experience, networks and mutual relations. Information provided by companies which use the site's networking features is used to improve the algorithm.<ref name=richtel/> As of August 2008, the algorithm was based on data from 3,000 startups.<ref name=arrington/> In the same month the company had four [[patent]]s pending on the technology.<ref name=tyler/>
