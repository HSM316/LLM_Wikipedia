{{Short description|Sub-field of artificial intelligence}}
{{original research|date=January 2019}}
'''Argument technology''' is a sub-field of [[collective intelligence]] and [[artificial intelligence]] that focuses on applying computational techniques to the creation, identification, analysis, navigation, evaluation and visualisation of arguments and debates.

In the 1980s and 1990s, philosophical theories of [[argument]]s in general, and [[argumentation theory]] in particular, were leveraged to handle key computational challenges, such as modeling [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] and [[defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] reasoning and designing robust coordination protocols for [[multi-agent systems]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=van Eemeren|first1=Frans H.|title=Argumentation and Artificial Intelligence|date=2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9473-5_11|work=Handbook of Argumentation Theory|pages=615–675|editor-last=van Eemeren|editor-first=Frans H.|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-9473-5_11|isbn=978-90-481-9473-5|access-date=2021-12-08|last2=Garssen|first2=Bart|last3=Krabbe|first3=Erik C.

W.|editor4-last=Snoeck Henkemans|editor4-first=A. Francisca}}</ref> At the same time, mechanisms for computing ''semantics'' of [[Argumentation framework]]s were introduced as a way of providing a calculus of opposition for computing what it is reasonable to believe in the context of conflicting arguments.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Prakken |first1=Henry |title=The ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation: a tutorial |journal=Argument & Computation |date=2014 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=31–62 |doi=10.1080/19462166.2013.869766 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

With these foundations in place, the area was kick-started by a workshop held in the Scottish Highlands in 2000, the result of which was a book coauthored by philosophers of argument, rhetoricians, legal scholars and AI researchers.<ref name="sac">Reed, C. & Norman, T.J. (eds) Argumentation Machines. Kluwer, 2003.</ref> Since then, the area has been supported by various dedicated events such as the International Workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmna.info |title=Computational Models of Natural Argument |website=www.cmna.info}}</ref> which has run annually since 2001; the International Workshop on Argument in Multi Agent Systems (ArgMAS) annually since 2004; the Workshop on Argument Mining,<ref>For example: {{cite web |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/W19-45/ |title=Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Argument Mining – ACL Anthology |website=www.aclweb.org |publisher=[[Association for Computational Linguistics]] |date=August 2019 |access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref> annually since 2014, and the Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comma-conf.org |title=Computational Models of Argument conference series |website=www.comma-conf.org}}</ref> biennially since 2006. Since 2010, the field has also had its own journal, ''Argument & Computation'', which was published by Taylor & Francis until 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tarc |title=Journal of Argument & Computation |website=www.tandf.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221221912/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tarc |archive-date=2012-02-21 }}</ref> and since then by IOS Press.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iospress.nl/journal/argument-computation/ |title=Journal of Argument & Computation |website=www.iospress.nl|date=August 2023 }}</ref>

One of the challenges that argument technology faced was a lack of standardisation in the representation and underlying conception of argument in machine readable terms. Many different software tools for manual [[Argument map|argument analysis]], in particular, developed idiosyncratic and ad hoc ways of representing arguments which reflected differing underlying ways of conceiving of argumentative structure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheuer |first1=O. |last2=Loll |first2=F. |last3=Pinkwart |first3=N. |last4=McLaren |first4=B.M. |title=Computer-supported argumentation: A review of the state of the art |journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning |year=2010 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=43–102 |doi=10.1007/s11412-009-9080-x |s2cid=4473082 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220309167}}</ref> This lack of standardisation also meant that there was no interchange between tools or between research projects, and little re-use of data resources that were often expensive to create. To tackle this problem, the [[Argument Interchange Format]]<ref>{{Citation|last1=Rahwan|first1=Iyad|title=The Argument Interchange Format|date=2009|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_19|work=Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence|pages=383–402|editor-last=Simari|editor-first=Guillermo|place=Boston, MA|publisher=Springer US|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_19|isbn=978-0-387-98197-0|access-date=2021-12-08|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|bibcode=2009aai..book..383R |hdl=21.11116/0000-0002-CA71-B |editor2-last=Rahwan|editor2-first=Iyad|hdl-access=free}}</ref> set out to establish a common standard that captured the minimal common features of argumentation which could then be extended in different settings.

Since about 2018, argument technology has been growing rapidly, with, for example, [[IBM]]'s Grand Challenge, [[Project Debater]], results for which were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 2021;<ref name="Slonim 379–384">{{Cite journal|last1=Slonim|first1=Noam|last2=Bilu|first2=Yonatan|last3=Alzate|first3=Carlos|last4=Bar-Haim|first4=Roy|last5=Bogin|first5=Ben|last6=Bonin|first6=Francesca|last7=Choshen|first7=Leshem|last8=Cohen-Karlik|first8=Edo|last9=Dankin|first9=Lena|last10=Edelstein|first10=Lilach|last11=Ein-Dor|first11=Liat|date=March 2021|title=An autonomous debating system|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03215-w|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=591|issue=7850|pages=379–384|doi=10.1038/s41586-021-03215-w|pmid=33731946 |bibcode=2021Natur.591..379S |s2cid=232305184 |issn=1476-4687}}</ref> German research funder, [[German Research Foundation|DFG]]'s nationwide research programme on Robust Argumentation Machines, RATIO,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Priority Programme "Robust Argumentation Machines (RATIO)" (SPP 1999/2)|url=https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/ai-initiative/priority_programme_1999_2/index.html|access-date=2021-12-08|website=www.dfg.de|language=en}}</ref> begun in 2019; and UK nationwide deployment of ''The Evidence Toolkit'' by the [[BBC]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Jacky|last2=Lawrence|first2=John|last3=Reed|first3=Chris|date=2020-10-22|title=Reason-checking fake news|url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3397189|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=63|issue=11|pages=38–40|doi=10.1145/3397189|s2cid=225041563 |issn=0001-0782}}</ref> A 2021 video narrated by [[Stephen Fry]] provides a summary of the societal motivations for work in argument technology.<ref>{{Citation|title=AI Exposes A Group Behind Covid, Brexit & Climate, w Stephen Fry.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cN3rZ5h3LE|language=en|access-date=2021-12-08}}</ref>

{{see also|Proof assistant|Computer-assisted proof}}
An argument assistant is a software tool which support users when writing [[argument]]s. Argument assistants can help users compose content, review content from one other, including in dialogical contexts. In addition to Web services, such functionalities can be provided through the [[plug-in (computing)|plugin architectures]] of word processor software or those of Web browsers. [[Internet forum]]s, for instance, can be greatly enhanced by such software tools and services.

[[Argument maps]] are visual, [[diagram]]matic representations of [[arguments]]. Such visual [[diagrams]] facilitate [[diagrammatic reasoning]] and [[Neuroenhancement#Software and media|promote one's ability to grasp and to make sense of]] information rapidly and readily.
