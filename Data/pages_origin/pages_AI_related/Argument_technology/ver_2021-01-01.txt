'''Argument technology''' is a sub-field of [[artificial intelligence]] that focuses on applying computational techniques to the creation, identification, analysis, navigation, evaluation and visualisation of arguments and debates. [[Artificial intelligence]] In the 1980s and 1990s, philosophical theories of [[argument]]s were leveraged to handle key computational challenges, such as modeling [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] and [[defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] reasoning and designing robust coordination protocols for [[multi-agent systems]]. At the same time, mechanisms for computing ''semantics'' of [[Argumentation framework]]s were introduced as a way of providing a calculus of opposition<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Prakken |first1=Henry |title=The ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation: a tutorial |journal=Argument & Computation |date=2014 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=31–62 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19462166.2013.869766?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=tarc20}}</ref> for computing what it is reasonable to believe in the context of conflicting arguments.

With these foundations in place, the area was kick-started by a workshop held in the Scottish Highlands in 2000, the result of which was a book coauthored by philosophers of argument, rhetoricians, legal scholars and AI researchers.<ref name="sac">Reed, C. & Norman, T.J. (eds) Argumentation Machines. Kluwer, 2003.</ref> Since then, the area has been supported by various dedicated events such as the International Workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmna.info |title=Computational Models of Natural Argument |website=www.cmna.info}}</ref> which has run annually since 2001; the International Workshop on Argument in Multi Agent Systems (ArgMAS) annually since 2004; the Workshop on Argument Mining,<ref>For example: {{cite web |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/volumes/W19-45/ |title=Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Argument Mining – ACL Anthology |website=www.aclweb.org |publisher=[[Association for Computational Linguistics]] |date=August 2019 |access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref> annually since 2014, and the Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comma-conf.org |title=Computational Models of Argument conference series |website=www.comma-conf.org}}</ref> biennially since 2006. Since 2010, the field has also had its own journal, ''Argument & Computation'', which was published by Taylor & Francis until 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tarc |title=Journal of Argument & Computation |website=www.tandf.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221221912/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tarc |archive-date=2012-02-21 }}</ref> and since then by IOS Press.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iospress.nl/journal/argument-computation/ |title=Journal of Argument & Computation |website=www.iospress.nl}}</ref>

One of the challenges that argument technology faced was a lack of standardisation in the representation and underlying conception of argument in machine readable terms. Many different software tools for manual [[Argument map|argument analysis]], in particular, developed idiosyncratic and ad hoc ways of representing arguments which reflected differing underlying ways of conceiving of argumentative structure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scheuer |first1=O. |last2=Loll |first2=F. |last3=Pinkwart |first3=N. |last4=McLaren |first4=B.M. |title=Computer-supported argumentation: A review of the state of the art |journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=43–102 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220309167}}</ref> This lack of standardisation also meant that there was no interchange between tools or between research projects, and little re-use of data resources that were often expensive to create. To tackle this problem, the [[Argument Interchange Format]] set out to establish a common standard that captured the minimal common features of argumentation which could then be extended in different settings.

Argment technology has applications in a variety of domains, including [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[policy making]], and [[risk management]] and has a variety of sub-fields, methodologies and technologies.<ref name="bex">{{cite book |editor1-last=Bex |editor1-first=Floris J. |editor2-last=Grasso |editor2-first=Floriana |editor3-last=Green |editor3-first=Nancy L. |editor4-last=Paglieri |editor4-first=Fabio |editor5-last=Reed |editor5-first=Chris |date=2017 |title=Argument Technologies: Theory, Analysis, and Applications |series=Studies in logic and argumentation |volume=68 |location=London |publisher=College Publications |isbn=9781848902183 |oclc=1012498399}}</ref>
