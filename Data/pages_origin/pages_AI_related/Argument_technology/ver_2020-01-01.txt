'''Argument technology''' is a sub-field of [[artificial intelligence]]. A few decades ago, philosophical theories of [[argument|arguments]] were leveraged to handle key computational challenges, such as modeling [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning and designing robust coordination protocols for [[multi-agent systems]]. This soon led to several theoretical breakthroughs, which, in turn, fostered the development of argument-based applications in a variety of domains, e.g., [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[policy making]], and [[risk management]]. As a result, argument technology is a thriving interdisciplinary enterprise with its own variety of sub-fields and methodologies.<ref name="bex">Bex, Floris J., Floriana Grasso, Nancy Green, Fabio Paglieri, and Chris Reed.

=== Argument assistant ===
{{see also|Proof assistant|Computer-assisted proof}}
An argument assistant is a software which conveniences users when writing [[argument|arguments]]. Argument assistants can convenience users as they compose content and as they review content from one other, including in dialogical contexts. In addition to Web services, such functionalities can be provided through the [[plug-in (computing)|plugin architectures]] of word processor software or those of Web browsers. [[internet forum|Internet forums]], for instance, can be greatly enhanced by such software tools and services.

=== Argument blogging ===
{{see also|Argument Web}}
ArguBlogging is software which allows its users to select portions of hypertext on webpages in their [[Web browsers]] and to agree or disagree with the selected content, posting their [[arguments]] to their [[blog|blogs]] with [[linked data|linked argument data]].<ref name="bex2">Bex, Floris, Mark Snaith, John Lawrence, and Chris Reed. "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826814000079 Argublogging: An application for the argument web]." Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web 25 (2014): 9-15.</ref> It is implemented as a [[bookmarklet]], adding functionality to [[Web browsers]] and interoperating with blogging platforms such as [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Tumblr]].

=== Argument mapping ===
{{main|Argument map}}
[[Argument maps]] are visual, [[diagram|diagrammatic]] representations of [[arguments]]. Such visual [[diagrams]] facilitate [[diagrammatic reasoning]] and promote one's ability to grasp and to make sense of information rapidly and readily. [[Argument maps]] can provide structured, semi-formal frameworks for representing [[argument|arguments]] using interactive [[visual programming language|visual language]].

=== Argument mining ===
{{main|Argument mining}}
[[Argument mining]], or argumentation mining, is a research area within the [[natural language processing]] field. The goal of [[argument mining]] is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs.

=== Argument search ===
{{main|Search engine (computing)}}
An argument search engine is a search engine that is given a topic as a user query and returns a list of arguments for and against the topic.<ref name=aharoni2014demo>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C14-2002|title=Claims on demandâ€“an initial demonstration of a system for automatic detection and polarity identification of context dependent claims in massive corpora|journal=Proceedings of COLING 2014|date=2014|last=Aharoni|first=Ehud|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Such engines could be used to support informed [[decision-making]] or to help debaters prepare for [[debates]].

=== Artificial debater ===
{{see also|Project Debater}}
An artificial debater is an [[artificial intelligence]] system which can debate with human users.

=== Automated argumentative essay scoring ===
{{main|Automated essay scoring}}
The goal of automated argumentative essay scoring systems is to assist students in improving their writing skills by measuring the quality of their argumentative content.<ref name=stab2014>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1006|title=Identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays|journal=Proceedings of EMNLP 2014|date=2014|last=Stab|first=Christian|last2=Gurevych|first2=Iryna}}</ref><ref name="green">Green, Nancy L.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013.</ref>

=== Decision support system ===
{{main|Decision support system|Intelligent decision support system}}
Argument technology can enhance [[decision support systems]] and [[intelligent decision support systems]].

==== Ethical decision support system ====
{{see also|Moral reasoning}}
An ethical decision support system is a [[decision support system]] which supports users in [[moral reasoning]] and [[decision-making]].<ref name="mancherjee">Mancherjee, Kevin, and Angela C. Sodan. "Can computer tools support ethical decision making?." ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society 34, no. 2 (2004): 1.</ref><ref name="mathieson">Mathieson, Kieran. "Towards a design science of ethical decision support." Journal of Business Ethics 76, no. 3 (2007): 269-292.</ref>

==== Legal decision support system ====
{{main|Legal expert system|Applications of artificial intelligence to legal informatics}}
A legal decision support system is a [[decision support system]] which supports users in legal reasoning and [[decision-making]].

=== Explainable artificial intelligence ===
{{main|Explainable artificial intelligence|Argument#Explanations|Explanation}}
An explainable or transparent [[artificial intelligence]] system is an [[artificial intelligence]] system whose actions can be easily understood by humans.

=== Intelligent tutoring system ===
{{main|Intelligent tutoring system}}
An [[intelligent tutoring system]] is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners, usually without requiring intervention from a human teacher. The intersection of argument technology and intelligent tutoring systems includes computer systems which aim to provide instruction in: critical thinking, argumentation,<ref name="loll">Loll, Frank, Niels Pinkwart, Oliver Scheuer, and Bruce M. McLaren. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.329.6574&rep=rep1&type=pdf Towards a flexible intelligent tutoring system for argumentation]."

=== Legal expert system ===
{{main|Legal expert system}}
A [[legal expert system]] is a domain-specific [[expert system]] that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to emulate the [[decision-making]] abilities of a human expert in the field of [[law]].

=== Machine ethics ===
{{main|Machine ethics}}
{{see also|Moral reasoning}}
[[Machine ethics]] is a part of the ethics of [[artificial intelligence]] concerned with the moral behavior of artificially intelligent beings. As humans argue with respect to morality and moral behavior, argument can be envisioned as a component of machine ethics systems and [[moral reasoning]] components.

=== Proof assistant ===
{{main|Proof assistant|Computer-assisted proof}}
In [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]], a proof assistant or interactive theorem prover is a software tool to assist with the development of [[formal proof|formal proofs]] by human-machine collaboration. This involves some sort of interactive proof editor, or other [[User interface|interface]], with which a human can guide the search for [[formal proof|proofs]], the details of which are stored in, and some steps provided by, a [[computer]].
