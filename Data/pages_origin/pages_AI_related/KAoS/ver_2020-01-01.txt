'''KAoS''' is a [[policy]] and domain services framework created by the [[Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]]. It uses W3Câ€™s [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) standard for policy representation and reasoning, and a software guard technology for efficient enforcement of a compiled version of its policies. It has been used in a variety of government-sponsored projects for distributed host and [[network management]] and for the coordination of human-agent-robot teams,<ref>http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/p020678.pdf</ref> including [[DARPA]]'s [[CoABS Grid]], [[Cougaar]], and [[Common Object Request Broker Architecture]] (CORBA) models.
