== History ==

===Pre-1950s===
[[File:Maillardet's automaton at the Franklin Institute.webm|thumb|[[Maillardet's automaton]] is drawing a picture]]
Synthetic media as a process of automated art dates back to the [[Automaton|automata]] of [[Hellenistic civilization|ancient Greek civilization]], where inventors such as [[Daedalus]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]] designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music.<ref>{{citation |title=A programmable robot from 60 AD |author=Noel Sharkey|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/07/programmable-robot-from-60ad.html|date= July 4, 2007 |volume=2611}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | doi = 10.2307/2846790 | issn = 0038-7134 | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 477–487 | last = Brett | first = Gerard | title = The Automata in the Byzantine "Throne of Solomon" | journal = Speculum| date = July 1954 | postscript = . | jstor = 2846790 }}</ref> The tradition of automaton-based entertainment flourished throughout history, with mechanical beings' seemingly magical ability to mimic human creativity often drawing crowds throughout Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YEPhe2Gp0Y|title=A Marvellous Elephant - Waddesdon Manor|last=Waddesdon Manor|date=22 July 2015|via=YouTube}}</ref> China,<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop|first=Sonia|title=Chinese Swept Up in Mechanical Mania|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/fashion/26iht-ACAW-AUTOMATON26.html|access-date=November 25, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 2011|quote=Mechanical curiosities were all the rage in China during the 18th and 19th centuries, as the Qing emperors developed a passion for automaton clocks and pocket watches, and the "Sing Song Merchants", as European watchmakers were called, were more than happy to encourage that interest.}}</ref> India,<ref name=Koetsier>{{cite journal |last1=Koetsier |first1=Teun  |year=2001 |title=On the prehistory of programmable machines: musical automata, looms, calculators |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=589–603 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref>  and so on.

Despite the technical capabilities of these machines, however, none were capable of generating original content and were entirely dependent upon their mechanical designs.

===Rise of artificial intelligence===

The field of AI research was born at [[Dartmouth workshop|a workshop]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956,<ref name="Dartmouth conference">

Initial experiments in AI-generated art included the '''''[[Illiac Suite]]''''', a 1957 composition for [[string quartet]] which is generally agreed to be the first score composed by an [[electronic music|electronic]] [[computer music|computer]].<ref name="Baggi">Denis L. Baggi, "[http://www.lim.dico.unimi.it/events/ctama/baggi.htm The Role of Computer Technology in Music and Musicology]", ''lim.dico.unimi.it'' (December 9, 1998).</ref> [[Lejaren Hiller]], in collaboration with [[Leonard Issacson]], programmed the [[ILLIAC I]] computer at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (where both composers were professors) to generate compositional material for his String Quartet No. 4.

In 1960, Russian researcher R.Kh.Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the "[[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]]" computer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=R.Kh.|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}</ref>

In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html | title=About Ray Kurzweil}}</ref>

Before 1989, [[artificial neural network]]s have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters.  The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bharucha | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Todd | first2 = P.M. | year = 1989 | title = Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 44–53 | doi=10.2307/3679552| jstor = 3679552 }}</ref><ref>Todd, P.M., and Loy, D.G.

In 2014, [[Ian Goodfellow]] and his colleagues developed a new class of [[machine learning]] systems: '''[[generative adversarial networks]]''' ('''GAN''').<ref>{{cite conference|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |conference= Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2014) |pages= 2672–2680 |url= https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf |year=2014}}</ref> Two [[neural network]]s contest with each other in a game (in the sense of [[game theory]], often but not always in the form of a [[zero-sum game]]). Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.

===Music generation===
{{main|Computer music|Music and artificial intelligence|Pop music automation}}

The capacity to generate music through autonomous, non-programmable means has long been sought after since the days of Antiquity, and with developments in artificial intelligence, two particular domains have arisen:
# The robotic creation of music, whether through machines playing instruments or sorting of virtual instrument notes (such as through [[MIDI]] files)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/bkulis/projects/music/index.html|title=Combining Deep Symbolic and Raw Audio Music Models|website=people.bu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334415395|title=A White Paper on the Future of Artificial Intelligence|first1=Helmut|last1=Linde|first2=Immanuel|last2=Schweizer|date=July 5, 2019|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>
# Directly generating [[waveform | waveforms]] that perfectly recreate instrumentation and human voice without the need for instruments, MIDI, or organizing premade notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xQVn09FX|title=GANSynth: Adversarial Neural Audio Synthesis|first1=Jesse|last1=Engel|first2=Kumar Krishna|last2=Agrawal|first3=Shuo|last3=Chen|first4=Ishaan|last4=Gulrajani|first5=Chris|last5=Donahue|first6=Adam|last6=Roberts|date=September 27, 2018|via=openreview.net}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Google DeepMind]] unveiled WaveNet, a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms that could learn to understand which waveforms best resembled human speech as well as musical instrumentation.<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web | url=https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio |title = WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio}}</ref> Other networks capable of generating music through waveform manipulation include TacoTron (by Google) and DeepVoice (by Baidu).

===Speech synthesis===
{{main|Speech synthesis}}

Speech synthesis has been identified as a popular branch of synthetic media<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kambhampati |first1=Subbarao |title=Perception won't be reality, once AI can manipulate what we see |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/470826-perception-wont-be-reality-once-ai-can-manipulate-what-we-see |website=TheHill |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref> and is defined as the artificial production of human [[speech]]. A computer system used for this purpose is called a '''speech computer''' or '''speech synthesizer''', and can be implemented in [[software]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]] products. A '''text-to-speech''' ('''TTS''') system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render [[symbolic linguistic representation]]s like [[phonetic transcription]]s into speech.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Jonathan |last1=Allen |first2=M. Sharon |last2=Hunnicutt |first3=Dennis |last3=Klatt |title=From Text to Speech: The MITalk system |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-521-30641-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromtexttospeech00alle }}</ref>

Synthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a [[database]]. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] or [[diphone]]s provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the [[vocal tract]] and other human voice characteristics to create a completely "synthetic" voice output.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1121/1.386780 | last1 = Rubin | first1 = P. | last2 = Baer | first2 = T. | last3 = Mermelstein | first3 = P. | year = 1981 | title = An articulatory synthesizer for perceptual research | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 70 | issue = 2| pages = 321–328 | bibcode = 1981ASAJ...70..321R }}</ref>

===Natural-language generation===
{{Main|Computational creativity#Story generation|Computational creativity#Poetry}}

[[Natural-language generation]] ('''NLG''', sometimes synonymous with '''text synthesis''') is a software process that transforms structured data into natural language.  It can be used to produce long form content for organizations to automate custom reports, as well as produce custom content for a web or mobile application. It can also be used to generate short blurbs of text in interactive conversations (a [[chatbot]]) which might even be read out by a [[text-to-speech]] system. Interest in natural-language generation increased in 2019 after [[OpenAI]] unveiled GPT2, an AI system that generates text matching its input in subject and tone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Jack |last2=Brundage |first2=Miles |last3=Solaiman |first3=Irene |title=GPT-2: 6-Month Follow-Up |url=https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-6-month-follow-up/ |website=OpenAI |publisher=OpenAI |access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref> GPT2 is a [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]], a [[Deep learning|deep]] [[machine learning]] model introduced in 2017 used primarily in the field of [[natural language processing]] (NLP).<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Polosukhin|first1=Illia|last2=Kaiser|first2=Lukasz|last3=Gomez|first3=Aidan N.|last4=Jones|first4=Llion|last5=Uszkoreit|first5=Jakob|last6=Parmar|first6=Niki|last7=Shazeer|first7=Noam|last8=Vaswani|first8=Ashish|date=2017-06-12|title=Attention Is All You Need|eprint=1706.03762|class=cs.CL}}</ref>
