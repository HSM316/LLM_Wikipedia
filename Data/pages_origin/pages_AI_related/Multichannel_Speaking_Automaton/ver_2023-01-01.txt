'''MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton)''' was an early prototype of [[Speech Synthesis]] machine started in 1975.

== Description ==
It consisted of a stand-alone computer hardware and a specialized software that implemented a [[diphone]]-synthesis technology. It was one of the first real-time TTS systems. It was able to read Italian in intellegibile robotic voice and also to sing managing up to 8 synthesis channels in parallel thanks to [[Linear predictive coding]] technology.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nebbia |first1=Luciano |last2=Lucchini |first2=Paolo |title=Eight-channel digital speech synthesizer based on LPC techniques |journal=ICASSP '79.
