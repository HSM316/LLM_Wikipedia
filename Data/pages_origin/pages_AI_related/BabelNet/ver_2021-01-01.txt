'''BabelNet''' is a [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] lexicalized [[semantic network]] and [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed at the [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] group of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]].<ref name="NavigliPonzetto12">R. Navigli and S. P Ponzetto. 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2012.07.001 BabelNet: The Automatic Construction, Evaluation and Application of a Wide-Coverage Multilingual Semantic Network]. Artificial Intelligence, 193, Elsevier, pp. 217-250.</ref><ref>R. Navigli, S. P. Ponzetto. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1023.pdf BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network]. Proc. of the 48th Annual Meeting of the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL 2010), Uppsala, Sweden, July 11–16, 2010, pp. 216–225.</ref> BabelNet was automatically created by linking Wikipedia to the most popular computational [[Dictionary|lexicon]] of the [[English language]], [[WordNet]]. The integration is done using an automatic mapping and by filling in lexical gaps in resource-poor [[language]]s by using [[statistical machine translation]]. The result is an [[encyclopedic dictionary]] that provides [[concept]]s and [[Named entity|named entities]] [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] in many languages and connected with large amounts of [[Semantic relation#Relationships|semantic relations]]. Additional lexicalizations and definitions are added by linking to free-license wordnets, OmegaWiki, the English [[Wiktionary]], [[Wikidata]], [[FrameNet]], [[VerbNet]] and others. Similarly to WordNet, BabelNet groups [[word]]s in different languages into sets of [[synonyms]], called ''Babel [[synsets]]''. For each Babel synset, BabelNet provides short definitions (called [[Definition|glosses]]) in many languages harvested from both WordNet and Wikipedia.

==Statistics of BabelNet==

{{As of|2018|02}}, BabelNet (version 4.0) covers 284 [[language]]s, including all European languages, most [[Asian language]]s, and [[Latin]]. BabelNet 4.0 contains almost 16 million synsets and about 833 million [[word sense]]s (regardless of their language). Each Babel synset contains 2 synonyms per language, i.e., word senses, on average. The semantic network includes all the lexico-semantic relations from WordNet ([[Hyponymy|hypernymy and hyponymy]], [[meronymy]] and [[holonymy]], [[antonymy]] and [[synonymy]], etc., totaling around 364,000 relation edges) as well as an underspecified relatedness relation from Wikipedia (totaling around 1.3 bilion edges).<ref name="NavigliPonzetto12" /> Version 4.0 also associates about 53 million images with Babel synsets and provides a Lemon [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] encoding of the resource,<ref>M. Ehrmann, F. Cecconi, D. Vannella, J. McCrae, P. Cimiano, R. Navigli. [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/810_Paper.pdf Representing Multilingual Data as Linked Data: the Case of BabelNet 2.0]. Proc. of the 9th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2014), Reykjavik, Iceland, 26–31 May 2014.</ref> available via a [[SPARQL endpoint]]. 2.67 million synsets are assigned domain labels.

==Applications==

BabelNet has been shown to enable multilingual [[Natural Language Processing]] applications. The lexicalized [[knowledge]] available in BabelNet has been shown to obtain state-of-the-art results in:
