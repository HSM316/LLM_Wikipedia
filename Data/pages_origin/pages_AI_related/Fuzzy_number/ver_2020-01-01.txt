A '''fuzzy number''' is a generalization of a regular, real number in the sense that it does not refer to one single value but rather to a connected set of possible values, where each possible value has its own weight between 0 and 1<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dijkman|first=J.G|last2=Haeringen|first2=H van|last3=Lange|first3=S.J de|title=Fuzzy numbers|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=301â€“341|doi=10.1016/0022-247x(83)90253-6|year=1983}}</ref>. This weight is called the [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]. A fuzzy number is thus a special case of a convex, normalized [[fuzzy set]] of the real line.<ref>[http://www.itm.uni-stuttgart.de/staff/Hanss/ Michael Hanss], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}</ref> Just like [[Fuzzy logic]] is an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (which uses absolute truth and falsehood only, and nothing in between), fuzzy numbers are an extension of [[real numbers]]. Calculations with fuzzy numbers allow the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] on parameters, properties, geometry, initial conditions, etc.
