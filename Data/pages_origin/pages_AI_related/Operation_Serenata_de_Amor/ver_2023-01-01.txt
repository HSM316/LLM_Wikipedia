'''Operation Serenata de Amor''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] project designed to analyze public spending in Brazil. The project has been funded by a recurrent financing campaign since [[Independence Day (Brazil)|September 7]], 2016, and came in the wake of major scandals of misappropriation of public funds in Brazil, such as the [[Mensalão scandal]] and what was revealed in the [[Operation Car Wash]] investigations.

The analysis began with data from the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] then expanded to other types of budget and instances of government, such as the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]]. The project is built through collaboration on [[GitHub]] and using a public group with more than 600 participants on [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]].

The name "Serenata de Amor," which means "serenade of love," was taken from a popular cashew cream bonbon produced by [[Garoto|Chocolates Garoto]] in Brazil.

==Modules==
Throughout development of the project, new modules have been newly introduced in addition to the main repository:
* The [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor/ main repository, serenata-de-amor], serves as the starting point for investigative work.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie Rosie] is the robot programmed to identify public funds expenses with discrepancies, starting with CEAP (Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity); it analyzes each of the reimbursements requested by the deputies and senators, indicating the reasons that lead it to believe they are suspicious.
* From Rosie was born [https://github.com/okfn-brasil/whistleblower whistleblower], which tweets under the name of @RosieDaSerenata, distributing the results found on social media.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170630203147/https://jarbas.serenatadeamor.org/ Jarbas] ([https://github.com/okfn-brasil/jarbas Github repository]) is a data visualization tool which shows a complete list of reimbursements made available by the Chamber of Deputies and mined by Rosie.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-toolbox Toolbox] is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] installable package that supports the development of Serenata de Amor and Rosie.

==History==
Operation Serenata de Amor is an [[Artificial intelligence]] project for analysis of public expenditures. It was conceived in March 2016 by data scientist Irio Musskopf, sociologist Eduardo Cuducos and entrepreneur [[Felipe Cabral]]. The project was financed collectively in the Catarse platform, where it reached 131% of the collection goal <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catarse.me/serenata|title=Operação Serenata de Amor|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Catarse}}</ref> paying 3 months of project development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1852180-jovens-criam-robo-que-monitora-despesas-de-deputados-federais.shtml Jovens criam robô que monitora despesas de deputados federais]</ref><ref>[http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/sistema-que-fiscaliza-gastos-de-deputados-gera-680-denuncias-na-camara.ghtml Sistema que fiscaliza gastos de deputados gera 680 denúncias na Câmara]</ref><ref>[https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/113732-jovens-criaram-bot-capaz-monitorar-despesas-deputados-federais.htm Jovens criaram bot capaz de monitorar despesas de deputados federais]</ref><ref>[http://www.correiodobrasil.com.br/robo-com-nome-de-bombom-promete-recuperar-r-1-bilhao-por-mes-da-corrupcao/ Robô com nome de bombom promete recuperar R$ 1 bilhão por mês da corrupção]</ref> Ana Schwendler, also a data scientist, Pedro Vilanova "Tonny", data journalist, Bruno Pazzim, software engineer, Filipe Linhares, a frontend engineer, Leandro Devegili, an entrepreneur and André Pinho took the first steps towards constructing the platform, such as collecting and structuring the first datasets.

Jessica Temporal, data scientist and [[Yasodara Córdova]] "Yaso", researcher, Tatiana Balachova "Russa", UX designer, joined the project after the financing took place.

The members created a [https://apoia.se/serenata recurring financing campaign], expanding the analysis of public spending to the Federal Senate. Donors make monthly payments ranging from 5 BRL to 200 BRL to maintain group activities. The monthly amount collected is around 10,000 BRL.

==Results==
In January 2017, concluding the period financed by the initial campaign, the group carried out an investigation into the suspicious activities found by the data analysis system. 629 complaints were made to the Ombudsman's Office of the Chamber of Deputies, questioning expenses of 216 federal deputies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}</ref> In addition, the Facebook project page has more than 25,000 followers, and users frequently cite the operation as a benchmark in transparency in the Brazilian government. One of the examples of results obtained by the operation is the case of the Deputy who had to return about 700 BRL to the House <ref>{{Cite web|title=Após ser flagrado por app, deputado devolve à Câmara R$ 727 por 13 refeições no mesmo dia|url=https://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/apos-ser-flagrado-por-app-deputado-devolve-a-camara-r-727-por-13-refeicoes-no-mesmo-dia.ghtml}}</ref> after his expenses were analyzed by the platform.

The platform was able to analyze more than 3 million notes,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Programa analisa 3 milhões de notas fiscais de deputados em busca de gasto irregular|journal=G1|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/grupo-analisa-3-milhoes-de-notas-fiscais-de-deputados-em-busca-de-gastos-irregulares.ghtml}}</ref> raising about 8,000 suspected cases in public spending. The community that supports the work of the team benefits from open source repositories,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Grupo prepara 'robô' para analisar gastos de parlamentares|url=https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2016/09/09/Grupo-prepara-%E2%80%98rob%C3%B4%E2%80%99-para-analisar-gastos-de-parlamentares|journal=Nexo Jornal}}</ref> with licenses open for the collaboration. So much so that the two main data scientists <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civictechfest.org/agenda#day2-all-7|title=Agenda :: #CivicTechFest|accessdate=2017-11-03|work=civictechfest.org|language=zh-tw}}</ref> of the project presented it at the CivicTechFest in Taipei, obtaining several mentions even in the international press.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-23|title=從巴西到台灣，他們用開放資料監督政治人物如何花錢 – g0v.news|journal=G0v.news|url=https://g0v.news/%E5%BE%9E%E5%B7%B4%E8%A5%BF%E5%88%B0%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3-%E4%BB%96%E5%80%91%E7%94%A8%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E7%9B%A3%E7%9D%A3%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB%E4%BA%BA%E7%89%A9%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%8A%B1%E9%8C%A2-4675aa8c1cc1}}</ref> The technical leader presented the project in Poland during DevConf2017 in Kraków. It was also presented in the [[Google News Lab]] in 2017.

The operation has been a source of inspiration for other civic projects that aim to work with similar goals.
