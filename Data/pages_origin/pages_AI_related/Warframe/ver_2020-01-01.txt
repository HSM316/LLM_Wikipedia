'''''Warframe''''' is a [[free-to-play]] cooperative [[action role-playing game|action role playing]] and [[third-person shooter]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[online game]] developed and published by [[Digital Extremes]]. Originally released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PC, it was later ported to the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]]. In ''Warframe'', players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war in a planetary system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with powerful weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use [[procedural generation|procedurally-generated levels]], newer updates have included large [[open world]] areas similar to other [[massively multiplayer online game]]s as well as some story-specific missions that don't use procedural generation. The game includes elements of shooting and [[Melee (game)|melee games]], [[parkour]], and [[role-playing video games|role-playing]] to allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear.

The concepts for ''Warframe'' had been in place at Digital Extremes since 2000 under the name ''Dark Sector''. The company reintroduced ''Dark Sector'' in 2004 in preparation for release on the upcoming [[seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation consoles]] but could not find a publisher due to its theme. Ultimately Digital Extremes released a game called ''[[Dark Sector]]'' in 2008, far different from their original plan. By 2012, looking at the success of free-to-play games, the developers took their earlier ''Dark Sector'' ideas and art assets, to present it as ''Warframe''.

Initially, the growth of ''Warframe'' was slow, hindered by moderate critical reviews and low player counts. However, since its release, the game has experienced positive growth through development by Digital Extremes over the years. The game saw nearly 50 million players in 2019 and it is now one of Digital Extremes' most successful titles, with it receiving a large chunk of developer attention through the introduction of new game content and modes. The game is supported by [[microtransactions]], which lets players purchase in-game items for real money that would otherwise normally be obtained through [[Grinding (gaming)|grinding]].

==Setting==
Set in the future, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from a century-long cryosleep to find themselves at war with the Grineer, a matriarchal race of militarized and deteriorated human clones built upon metal, blood, and war; the Corpus, a [[mega-corporation]] with advanced robotics and laser technology built upon profit; the Infested, disfigured victims of the Technocyte virus; and the Sentients, a race of self-replicating machines made by the Orokin; returning from a stellar system known as the Tau system after being driven back centuries ago in an ancient war. The Lotus guides the Tenno through situations which may seem difficult, as well as gives hints which help the player defeat enemies. To fight back, the Tenno use bio-mechanical suits, the [[eponym]]ous Warframes, to channel their unique abilities. <ref name=story>{{cite web|url=https://www.warframe.com/game#keyart|title=Story|website=Warframe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027035408/http://www.warframe.com/game/story|archivedate=October 27, 2012|url-status=live|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>

All of the factions encountered in the game, including the Tenno, were created by or are splinter groups of the old Orokin Empire, an ancient fallen civilization and former reigning power in the Solar system that was led by an elite caste of [[Transhuman|trans-humans]] known as the Orokin. Although most of them are long dead by the time of the Tenno's awakening, their lingering presence can be still be felt throughout the Solar system.

==Gameplay==
''Warframe'' is an online action game that includes elements of [[shooter game|shooters]], [[Role-playing game|RPG]] and [[stealth game]]s. The player creates their Tenno character, which includes a basic armor unit called a "Warframe" which provides the player with special abilities, basic weapons such as a melee weapon, primary, sidearm(s), and a ship. Through the ship's console, the player can select any of the available missions to them. A main storyline set of missions requires players to complete certain missions across planets and moons in the solar system, to be able to access relays that they can progress to other planets or locations. Other missions rotate over time as part of the game's living universe; these can include missions with special rewards and community challenges to allow all players to reap benefits if they are successfully met. Aboard the ship, the player can also manage all other functions for their Tenno, including managing their arsenal of equipment, customizing their Warframe and weapons, crafting new equipment, and access the in-game store.

Missions can be played alone or with up to four players in a [[player versus environment]] cooperative manner. Each mission is given a ranking that indicates how difficult the mission is. Missions are generally played on randomly generated maps composed of "tiles" of map sections. Missions have various objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies, collecting data from terminals without activating alarms, rescuing prisoners, or defending points on the map for set periods of time. Newer updates have added space-bound combat using Archwings, space equipment which come with a new set of abilities and weapons, and a large open-field environment where numerous bounties can be completed. Players can use their weapons, special abilities, and a number of [[parkour]] style moves to navigate through and overpower forces within these missions. Downed players may choose to revive themselves up to a maximum of six times, or can be revived by other players an infinite number of times. Once complete, players are rewarded with in-game items, as well as in-game currency and items picked up while exploring the map; failure to complete a mission causes these rewards to be lost. In addition to cooperative missions, the game includes [[player versus player]] (PvP) content through the multiplayer "Conclave", which also rewards the player for placing high in such matches.

Players and their equipment also [[Experience point#Level-based progression|gain experience and level up]] from missions; equipment with higher levels can do more damage and support more "mods", special cards that can be slotted into the equipment to change its attributes or provide passive bonuses and abilities. Mods are dropped by enemies during missions and may be part of the rewards, and are generally given out following a rarity distribution, with more powerful mods being more elusive to acquire. Alongside mods, players have other means of improving their equipment, including conditional upgrades called Arcane Enhancements and Riven Mods, weapon-exclusive mods whose weapon, buffs and stats are determined upon unlocking. Another type of reward is equipment blueprints, which can be used to construct new Warframe parts or weapons; blueprints and their resulting equipment may also be purchased directly using in-game money called Platinum. Players need to have specific quantities of construction materials (found from missions and their rewards) to build these items.

''Warframe'' is designed to be free-to-play, and has avoided using any [[pay to win]] elements; all Warframes, weapons, and other equipment is possible to acquire in-game over time through grinding, though monetization can simplify the process.<ref name="noclip p1"/>  New weapons, Warframes, equipment, blueprints to construct such equipment and cosmetics like skins and capes (called Syandanas) can be purchased in the market, using either Credits, which are earned in-game, or Platinum, a premium currency that can be traded for with other players for rare items in-game or be purchased via [[microtransaction]]s. Platinum is also required to purchase additional enhancements, such as arsenal slots for Warframes and weapons, as well as items that enhance the mod capacity of gear.<ref name="polygon history"/>  Though, there are some cosmetic items that can only be obtained through in-game payments.

Late in 2019 an update named Emperyean was introduced to the game letting players pilot and manage a space ship called a Rail-jack. This was designed as a co-op experience with up to four people working together, doing different jobs to keep the ship operational while destroying enemy ships. In early 2020 a new Intrinsic is going to be released called commando which will make solo play more accessible.

==Development==
===''Dark Sector''===
The origins of ''Warframe'' came out of [[Canadians|Canadian]] studio [[Digital Extremes]]' original vision for their game, ''[[Dark Sector]]''. Prior to that point, Digital Extremes was known as a [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] studio, working alongside other studios to help complete development; this included working with [[Epic Games]] for ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' (1999) and its sequels ''[[Unreal Tournament 2003]]'' and ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]''.<ref name="noclip p1">{{cite web|author=[[Noclip]]|date=March 19, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOE6528pwFc|title=Warframe Documentary (Part One) - The Story of Digital Extremes|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Alphabet Inc.]]|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> Epic had looked to bring Digital Extremes into their studio, but found there would be issues with the Canadian government that interfered with the merger, and the studios agreed to go their separate ways.<ref name="noclip p1"/>

Wanting to establish themselves as a lead studio, Digital Extremes came up with the idea of ''Dark Sector'', which they first announced in February 2000, describing the game as combining "the intense action elements of ''Unreal Tournament'' with the scope and character evolution of a persistent online universe".<ref name="pcgamer history">{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Tom|date=July 15, 2016|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-story-of-warframe-how-a-game-no-publisher-wanted-found-26-million-players/|title=The story of Warframe: how a game no publisher wanted found 26 million players|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}</ref> In early interviews, Digital Extreme said that the gameplay for ''Dark Sector'' would have had players as bounty hunters and assassins in a dark science fiction setting, with each character having a bounty on their head, making them targets for other players.<ref name="GiantBomb"/>

The studio used their vision of ''Dark Sector'' to try to secure a publisher, but this only led to more offers for work-for-hire.<ref name="noclip p1"/> The company remained quiet on ''Dark Sector'' for about four years, re-announcing in early 2004 a revised ''Dark Sector'', now to be a stylish, science-fiction single player experience with stealth elements inspired by the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' series, and a story they considered a mix of ''Metal Gear Solid'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' set in space, within a larger setting like that of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' universe.<ref name="noclip p1"/> Much of the game's art style was informed by the French artist [[Jean Giraud]], aka Moebius.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> The player-character, belonging to a race called the Tenno, and enemies would wear high-tech suits that would give them unique abilities.<ref name="GiantBomb"/> This re-announcement included a scripted demo to show their vision of the game's gameplay and graphics.<ref name=ds_original_concept>{{cite web|author=[[Digital Extremes]]|date=May 11, 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpr1DCQNyg4|title=Original Dark Sector Content|website=YouTube|publisher=Alphabet Inc}}</ref> The game was announced just as both the first consoles of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation]], the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], had been teased, and Digital Extremes started to look for a publisher to release the games on these platforms.<ref name="GiantBomb"/> The game received a good deal of attention from its video, including coverage by [[CNN]] on the upcoming console generation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|date=April 8, 2004|url=https://money.cnn.com/2004/04/07/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm|title=Xbox 2 and PlayStation 3: A sneak peek|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[WarnerMedia]]|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}</ref>

Digital Extreme's creative director Steve Sinclair spent about a year on the road following the re-announcement of ''Dark Sector'' to find a publisher, but most rejected the idea; Sinclair said most publishers were not impressed with the science fiction setting, and instead encouraged them to change the setting to modern day, within [[World War II]] (which was popular at the time due to the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series), and even the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="GiantBomb"/><ref name="pcgamer history"/> When Sinclair returned to the studio, they tried to rework the setting, even trying a superhero genre, without luck. Matters were complicated as they were also attempting to develop their own engine, the Evolution engine, to support the game and the new consoles, switching away from the familiar [[Unreal Engine]].<ref name="GiantBomb"/> Ultimately, Digital Extremes dropped most of the science fiction elements, and moved the gameplay towards a more ''[[Resident Evil]]'' survivor-horror approach. Digital Extremes did keep one element of the original concept for the released game, that being the protagonist named "Tenno".<ref name="noclip p1"/> The ''Dark Sector'' released in 2008 was far different from their original vision. ''Dark Sector'' received average reviews, and was not a major financial windfall for the studio, leading them back to doing work for hire over the next four years, including ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[BioShock 2]]'', ''[[Homefront (video game)|Homefront]]'' and ''[[The Darkness 2]]''.<ref name="GiantBomb"/>

Around 2011, Digital Extremes were finding themselves struggling for work-for-hire contracts.<ref name="noclip p1"/> While the studio had been forced to issue some layoffs, they were still at about 250 people at this time.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> Looking again to develop their own IP and to try to take advantage of the growth in [[free-to-play]] games, Digital Extremes looked back to the original ''Dark Sector'' concept from 2004 and looked to develop it as a free-to-play game. This decision was made in early 2012 and required the team to create a prototype within one to two months, as Sinclair and Digital Extreme's CEO James Schmalz were going to shop the game around to publishers at that year's [[Game Developers Conference]] in March 2012.<ref name="pcgamer history"/><ref name="noclip p1"/> They took several assets from the abandoned 2004 concept, and developed this as ''Warframe''. At GDC, Sinclair and Schmalz found publishers still cold on the idea: Western publishers were not keen on the science fiction setting, while a large unnamed Korean publisher warned him that they would "fail" as Western developers did not know how to properly support free-to-play games with quality content.<ref name="GiantBomb">{{cite web|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=February 19, 2013|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/closing-digital-extreme-s-psychic-wound/1100-4555/|title=Closing Digital Extreme's Psychic Wound|website=[[Giant Bomb]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}</ref> Another concern raised by these publishers was that ''Warframe'' was based on player-versus-environmental gameplay, which differed significantly with other free-to-play titles at the time that were mostly player-versus-player.<ref name="mcv history"/> Disheartened, they returned to the studio and decided that they would publish ''Warframe'' on their own. They built out a playable version of the game, at the time known as ''Lotus'' in about nine months.<ref name="noclip p1"/> Alongside this, the studio developed the necessary server architecture to support the game and the microtransaction system they had envisioned for it.<ref name="noclip p1"/>

===Release as ''Warframe''===
''Warframe'' was publicly announced in June 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warframe.com/news/press-release-warframe-announced|title=Press Release: Warframe announced!|website=Warframe|publisher=Digital Extremes|date=June 25, 2012|accessdate=March 26, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061156/https://warframe.com/news/press-release-warframe-announced|archivedate=September 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> with its closed beta launched in October 2012.<ref name="GiantBomb"/> Player feedback helped to refine the game's structure. An early change in the beta in early 2013 was their monetization scheme to avoid [[pay to win]] scenarios. For example, initially, each Warframe had a [[skill tree]] that the player could unlock completely through missions and gaining experience. An extended version of the tree was available if the player augmented the Warframe with an in-game item, then only purchasable through microtransactions.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> When players complained about this feature, they stripped the pay to win elements and adopted the mantra of keeping the game as free to play, requiring that players did not have to spend any money to get an item within the game.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> To support the game, they borrowed the idea of offering for sale "Founder's Packs" that would grant in-game items and currency, an idea that had been successfully used on [[Kickstarter]] projects.<ref name="noclip pt2">{{cite web|author=[[Noclip]]|date=March 21, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5vT1LooXk|title=Warframe Documentary (Part Two) - The Story of Warframe|website=YouTube|publisher=Alphabet Inc.|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref>

Digital Extremes found it difficult to get attention from the press as around 2012-2013, free to play games were typically shunned by game journalists.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> Unfavorable comparisons had been made to ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', a highly anticipated title due out in 2014, that also tarnished ''Warframe''{{'}}s presence.<ref name="mcv history">{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Seth|date=July 13, 2018|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/no-one-backed-warframe-to-be-a-success-but-five-years-on-its-going-from-strength-to-strength|title=No one backed Warframe to be a success, but five years on it's going from strength-to-strength|website=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> Coupled with low player counts, Digital Extremes were not sure how long they could continue supporting the game. However, Digital Extremes found they had a small but dedicated group of players that latched onto the title, buying into the game through Founder's Packs, telling their friends about the game, and interacting with the developers to provide feedback which was integrated into the game's design.<ref name="polygon history"/> Further, they discovered that when popular [[Video game live streaming|streamers]] like [[TotalBiscuit]] covered the beta, they drew more players to the game.<ref name="noclip pt2"/>

The open beta for ''Warframe'' launched in March 2013 for the Windows platform, with the game available from their own server systems.  ''Warframe'' was released at the same time that the studio was also completing development for the April 2013 ''[[Star Trek (2013 video game)|Star Trek]]'' game to tie into the release of the film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]''. The ''Star Trek'' game was critically panned, leading to financial hardships at the studio and forcing them to layoff developers.<ref name="pcgamer history"/> ''Warframe'' itself was not a critical hit with gaming publications, receiving average reviews; as ''[[IGN]]'' reviewed in 2013, the game was "fun, but a little bland".<ref name="polygon history">{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=January 2, 2018|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/2/16830328/warframe-free-to-play-f2p-platinum|title=How Warframe built an ethical free-to-play economy|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name="ign pc review 2013"/> Digital Extremes was planning to release ''Warframe'' for the [[PlayStation 4]] as well, but that console was not available until November 2013, so to try to get more players, they decided to offer the game on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], which further grew the player base.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> Some days after the Steam launch, Digital Extremes had been able to start drawing in enough funding to maintain the viability of the studio.<ref name="noclip pt2"/><ref name="pcgamer history"/>

Once the game turned profitable, Digital Extremes found themselves in the position of needing to generate content for the game to maintain its audience. Because they retained their 250-person staff throughout this process, they were able to expand upon content quickly, and soon hired in another 250 developers for ''Warframe''.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> Community input was critical for Digital Extremes for new content and improvements. One major change after release was an update to the game's movement system, titled "Parkour 2.0" that was released in 2015. They had found before this, players discover ways to rapidly traverse levels by a trick known as "coptering" using specific weapons, Warframes, and upgrades. Though Digital Extremes had considered these movements to be game-breaking and considered removing the abilities altogether, they realized players liked to have exotic moves like this available to them, and thus created the Parkour 2.0 system that, while reining in how extensive these moves could be, fully supported the type of ninja-like movements that players wanted.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> Another example was a short-lived feature that allowed players to spend a small amount of the premium in-game currency Platinum to get a random color that they could use for customization. Players reacted negatively to this, as some found it would take a large amount of Platinum to get the color they wanted. Digital Extremes removed this random factor and instead added means to purchase such customization options directly. The company has also avoided the use of [[loot box]]es that other free-to-play games are often criticized for.<ref name="polygon history"/>

The studio had found it important to release new content regularly to keep a stream of income from the game.<ref name="noclip pt2"/> They were also faced with the problem that to understand all of ''Warframe''{{'}}s systems required some commitment by the player, and players that felt it was too much would wash out after a few hours.  This led to them investing more into the player community to keep them up to speed while helping players understand what the game's systems offered. This included starting a weekly developer video games "Devstream" on YouTube hosted by community manager [[Rebecca Ford]] (who also voices the in-game character Lotus),<ref name="noclip p1"/> starting a fan convention called TennoCon, and working with [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] as a partner to promote certain streamers and offer ''Warframe'' rewards within the game.<ref name="noclip pt2"/>

In 2016, Digital Extremes was acquired by the Chinese investment company [[Leyou]].<ref name="eurogamer1">{{cite web|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=July 11, 2016|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-11-splash-damage-acquired-by-chinese-chicken-meat-company-leyou|title=Splash Damage bought by Chinese chicken meat company Leyou|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Leyou since provides necessary funding for Digital Extremes to grow, but has little influence on the direction that the developers take ''Warframe''.<ref name="mcv history"/>

==="The Second Dream" expansion===
In December 2015, Digital Extremes released ''Warframe''{{'}}s first cinematic story quest, "The Second Dream". This quest features prominent characters from the game and introduces a new faction, the dreaded Sentients. Also, and most importantly, The Second Dream serves as an "Awakening" to the Tenno's true nature, as more than a mere Warframe, "more than human, but once a child, like any other". Completion of this quest grants access to a new game mechanic named Focus and allows the player to enter the battlefield as themselves, temporarily, through Transference. During Transference, the Warframe is temporarily deactivated (Provided the player isn't using Excalibur Umbra), and a spectral form of the Tenno themselves enters the battlefield, channeling one of five Focus Abilities, depending on which of the five Focus Schools the player chose during the quest's events.<ref>TSD Official Forum Page https://forums.warframe.com/topic/568455-update-18-the-second-dream/</ref>

==="The War Within" expansion===
In November 2016, ''Warframe''{{'}}s second cinematic quest was released, titled "The War Within". This quest sends the player on the chase for Teshin, the master and overseer of the Conclave, as he is seen suspiciously searching the pods of the newly awakened Tenno. Tracking Teshin across the solar system leads to the discovery of the Kuva Fortress, a massive asteroid under Grineer control where the (so far only known as a legend) Twin Grineer Queens reside. The Queens are shown to have their origins as far back as the Old Empire, and Teshin is revealed to be a Dax Soldier, meaning he was under their command due to them being of Orokin origin thus gaining the ability to wield the Kuva Scepter. The Queens cause an overload on the connection between Tenno and Warframe, forcing the Tenno to seek them out themselves, slowly discovering their Void powers. On the mission's climax, the Tenno unlocks Transference (which replaces Transcendence), an ability which allows them to roam independently of their Warframe at will, weakens the Elder Grineer Queen and has the option to kill her or "Let her rot", since all Grineer bodies decay over time due to excessive cloning. This quest also introduces an Alignment system to the game, with possible options being Sun, Neutral and Moon. This alignment has so far not had any consequence in gameplay, leaving its purpose unknown.<ref>TWW Official Forum Page https://forums.warframe.com/topic/715768-update-19-the-war-within/</ref>

==="Plains of Eidolon" expansion===
An update to the game in November 2017, titled "Plains of Eidolon", added an open-world area to the game. The Plains are a semi-open world, initially accessible through a "hub" named Cetus, a settlement on Earth where a people named the Ostrons reside, then directly through the player's ship. As the game describes them, the Ostrons are "A tight-knit band of hucksters and merchants." This expansion added ''Warframe''{{'}}s first open-world experience to the game, the ability for the player to gain reputation with the Ostrons, side-activities of fishing and mining, a Bounty system, consisting of five missions of ascending difficulty, where the player can choose to play any mission they would like regardless of whether the previous ones have been completed, a new quest named Saya's Vigil which rewarded the blueprint for the Warframe Gara, more customization options for the Tenno's combat pets, Kubrows (dogs) and Kavats (cats/ocelots), and the ability for the Tenno themselves to wield their own modular weapon, called an Amplifier, or for short, Amp. And another modular blade called a "Zaw". Finally, the "Plains of Eidolon" offer a new series of boss fights to the game, the titular Eidolons. These Sentient-origin titans require extreme gear and in most cases teamwork to take down for unique rewards.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wales|first=Matt|date=November 8, 2017|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-05-warframes-big-open-world-expansion-is-out-next-week-on-pc|title=Warframe's big open-world expansion is out next week on PC|website=Eurogamer|publisher=Gamer Network}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Matt|date=October 17, 2017|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/17/warframe-plains-of-eidolon-expansion/|title=Warframe: Plains of Eidolon doesn't fix the game's problems|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|publisher=Gamer Network}}</ref>

==="The Sacrifice" expansion===
An update to the game in June 2018, titled "The Sacrifice", added the third cinematic story to the game. Following on the events of ''Warframe''{{'}}s previous cinematic story quests, The Second Dream and The War Within, The Sacrifice sends the Tenno on a hunt across the solar system for a rogue Warframe known as Umbra. This quest provides insight on Umbra's past, the ability to gain Umbra into arsenal after the quest's climactic point, and information on the origins of the Warframes themselves, answering multiple questions, but creating even more. The Sacrifice also features the Alignment system introduced in "The War Within".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Ali|date=June 15, 2018|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/warframe-the-sacrifice|title=Warframe's The Sacrifice expansion launches today|website=[[PCGamesN]]|publisher=Network N}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Strom|first=Steven|date=June 14, 2018|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/what-to-expect-from-warframe-the-sacrifice/|title=What to expect from Warframe: The Sacrifice|website=PC Gamer|publisher=Future plc}}</ref>

=== "Fortuna" expansion ===
The expansion "Fortuna", was released on PC on November 8, 2018. The update focuses on the titular Fortuna Solaris Debt Internment Colony, which serves as a hub for the game's second open-world map, Orb Vallis. The people of Fortuna (known as the Solaris) were enslaved by a Corpus known as Nef Anyo which uses ancient Orokin devices that made gallons of coolant for the Workstation and trade center on Venus. The area expands upon concepts introduced in Plains of Eidolon, along with new activities, and the ability to obtain a [[hoverboard]]-styled vehicle known as a K-Drive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=July 8, 2018|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/8/17545846/warframe-tennocon-2018-fortuna-codename-railjack-videos|title=Warframe’s big plans include two expansions and surface-to-space combat|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Connor|date=July 7, 2018|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-warframe-fortuna-including-hoverboards-and-animal-scat/|title=5 things you need to know about Warframe Fortuna, including hoverboards and animal scat|website=[[GamesRadar+]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fillari|first=Alessandro|date=November 8, 2018|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-massive-fortuna-expansion-adds-in-hoverb/1100-6463124/|title=Warframe's Massive Fortuna Expansion Adds In Hoverboards And A New Open World|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=2018-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Messner|first=Steven|date=November 1, 2018|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-prepare-for-fortuna-warframes-stunning-open-world-update/|title=How to prepare for Fortuna, Warframe's stunning open-world update|website=PC Gamer|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}</ref> This update also adds more modular items such as a plasma pistol called a "Kitgun", and a robotic companion called a "MOA".

=== "Empyrean" expansion ===
The "Empyrean" update was revealed during Tennocon 2018 in July of that year, and released on December 12th of 2019<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/warframes-empyrean-expansion-is-live-on-pc-now/ | title = Warframe's Empyrean expansion is live on PC now | first  = Christopher | last = Livingston | date = December 12, 2019 || accessdate = December 24, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>. The update allowed players to construct a Railjack, an upgradeable spacecraft inspired by ''[[FTL: Faster Than Light]]''. Players will be able to gain non-playable characters to populate the ship, customize the ship, and add upgrades. The Railjack can then be used in larger space-based missions, including space battles with enemy forces. Additionally, the game will gain a system similar to the Nemesis system in ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', and feature boss characters that the player will fight multiple times, with the boss changing its armaments and tactics based on the past fights with the player.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/6/20684253/warframe-empyrean-expansion-tennocon-2019-demo-details-trailer | title = Inside Empyrean, Warframe’s most ambitious expansion yet | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = July 6, 2019 | accessdate = July 7, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Empyrean update will be released in [https://www.warframe.com/news/devstream-131 3 phases], with the first phase released on the PC on December 12, 2019.<Ref>[https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/2019/12/12/21010492/warframe-empyrean-expansion-launch-tga-2019]</ref>

''Warframe'' received "mixed or average reviews" on all platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=mc-pc/><ref name=mc-ps4/><ref name=mc-xone/> GameZone's Mike Splechta said of the PlayStation 4 version, "If you already enjoy games like ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' which require you to farm for items in order to craft better ones, ''Warframe'' follows that very same formula, except with much more satisfying and faster-paced combat."<ref name=gamezone/> However, as of 2018 ''[[PC Gamer]]'' said that "Warframe's growth doesn't resemble a well-tended plant—it's more like a mutant science experiment. Game systems are haphazardly stitched onto one other in ways that are sometimes incoherent, but oddly charming all the same."<ref name=PCGUK/>

The game is among one of the most-played games available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Joe|date=October 25, 2017|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/warframe-plains-of-eidolon-update-almost-doubles-concurrent-player-count|title=Warframe Plains of Eidolon update almost doubles concurrent player count|website=PC Gamer|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> Digital Extremes attributes the success of the title to the frequent updates they are developing for the game and the game's fanbase.
