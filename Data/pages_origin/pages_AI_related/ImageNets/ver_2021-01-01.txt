'''ImageNets''' is an [[open source]] framework for rapid prototyping of [[machine vision]] algorithms, developed by the Institute of Automation.

== Description ==
ImageNets is an [[open source]] and platform independent (Windows & Linux) framework for rapid prototyping of [[machine vision]] algorithms. With the [[GUI]] [[ImageNet Designer]], no programming knowledge is required to perform operations on images. A configured ImageNet can be loaded and executed from C++ code without the need for loading the ImageNet Designer GUI to achieve higher execution performance.<ref name=ImageNets_Leer2012 />

== History ==
ImageNets was developed by the Institute of Automation, [[University of Bremen]], Germany. The software was first publicly released in 2010. Originally, ImageNets was developed for the [[Care-Providing Robot FRIEND]]<ref name=ImageNets_Leer2012>{{cite book|author=Lange, U., Kampe, H.
