'''Artificial Intelligence System''' ('''AIS''') was a [[volunteer computing]] project undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with [[artificial consciousness]] and [[artificial general intelligence]]. They claimed to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02# |title=Artificial Intelligence System Video |publisher=OVGuide.com |access-date=2011-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807213642/http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02 |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> before moving into the developmental phase.

==History==
The project's initial goal was recreating the largest [[brain simulation]] to date, performed by neuroscientist Eugene M. Izhikevich of The Neurosciences Institute in [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of 27 3-gigahertz processors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |title=Computer Model of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |access-date=2011-02-20 |archive-date=2010-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918001635/http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |url-status=live }}</ref>  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|title=why did I do that?|publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu|access-date=2011-02-20|archive-date=2009-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231041028/http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

Artificial Intelligence System announced on On Sep 5, 2007 that they will use the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC)]] software to perform intensive calculations.

On July 12, 2008, the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark.<ref>{{cite web |date=2009-06-17 |title=The distributed brain |url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194758/http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |archive-date=20 July 2011 |access-date=2011-06-07 |publisher=Information-age.com}}</ref> The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of other related applications.

== Application description ==

# the application is a brain network test system that reenacts biophysical sensory cells characterized as numerical models and use the [[Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model]] to portray the properties of brain cells
# the rundown of models will keep developing and will ultimately arrive at many models
# the test system gets information from XML records that contain cell properties which portray behavior
# the test system will process the framework's way of behaving over the long haul
# calculation results will be saved in records<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-11-13 |title=Project News |url=http://www.intelligencerealm.com:80/aisystem/news.php |access-date=2022-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113103351/http://www.intelligencerealm.com:80/aisystem/news.php |archive-date=2007-11-13 }}</ref>

== Conclusion ==
Artificial Intelligence System had successfully simulated over 700 billion neurons by April 2009 and the project reported 7119 participants in January, 2010<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-01-27 |title=Neural Network System |url=http://www.intelligencerealm.com/aisystem/system.php |access-date=2022-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127125022/http://www.intelligencerealm.com/aisystem/system.php |archive-date=2010-01-27 }}</ref>

AIS was last seen working on the post data stage before the website was no longer available after November 2010.
