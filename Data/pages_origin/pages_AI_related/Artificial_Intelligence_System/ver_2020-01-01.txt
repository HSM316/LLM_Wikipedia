'''Artificial Intelligence System''' ('''AIS''') was a [[distributed computing]] project undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with [[artificial consciousness]] and [[artificial general intelligence]]. They claimed to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02# |title=Artificial Intelligence System Video |publisher=OVGuide.com |accessdate=2011-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807213642/http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02 |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> before moving into the developmental phase.

The project's initial goal was recreating the largest [[brain simulation]] to date, performed by neuroscientist [[Eugene M. Izhikevich]] of The Neurosciences Institute in [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of 27 3-gigahertz processors.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |title=Computer Model of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|title=why did I do that? |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

On July 12, 2008, AIS announced that the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |title=The distributed brain |publisher=Information-age.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2011-06-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194758/http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml| archivedate= 20 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of the other applications.

AIS simulated the brain via an [[artificial neural network]], and used [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The project utilized the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In version 1.08 of the software each work unit received by a volunteer simulated 500,000 [[neuron]]s for 100 milliseconds at 5 millisecond time steps (the estimated firing rate of a human neuron).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The application had four primary modules—for creating neurons, simulating neurons, visualizing neurons, and finally, knowledge acquisition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Intention was that the neuronal generator would eventually use [[genetic algorithms]] to generate neurons for simulation. The neuron simulator used mathematical models to simulate those neurons. Initially Hodgkin–Huxley models were used, but more models (perhaps hundreds) were intended to be utilized in the future. The visualization software was to allow the administrators to monitor and control the neuronal simulators. The knowledge acquisition module involved feeding information to the system and training it to build its knowledge base.

The AIS project had successfully simulated over 700 billion neurons by April 2009.<ref>"The distributed brain"</ref>

The project was closed in November 2010 as the BOINC program of the project did not work.
