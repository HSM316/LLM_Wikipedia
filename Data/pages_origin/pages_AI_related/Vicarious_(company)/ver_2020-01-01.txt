'''Vicarious''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] company based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[California]]. They are using the theorized computational principles of the brain to build software that [[artificial general intelligence|can think and learn like a human]].

== Founders ==
The company was founded in 2010 by [[D. Scott Phoenix]] and [[Dileep George|Dr. Dileep George]]. Before co-founding Vicarious, Phoenix was Entrepreneur in Residence at [[Founders Fund]] and CEO of Frogmetrics, a touchscreen analytics company he co-founded through the [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] incubator program. Previously, Dr. George was [[Chief technology officer|Chief Technology Officer]] at [[Numenta]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Ha|first=Anthony|title=Early Facebook Executives Back AI Startup Vicarious Systems|url=https://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2011/02/07/07venturebeat-early-facebook-executives-back-ai-startup-vi-46951.html?ref=technology|work=New York Times|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref> a company he co-founded with [[Jeff Hawkins]] and [[Donna Dubinsky]] ([[Palm Computing|PALM]], [[Handspring (company)|Handspring]]) while completing his [[PhD]] at [[Stanford University]].<ref name="venturebeat">{{cite web|last=Ha|first=Anthony|title=Early Facebook execs back artificial-intelligence startup Vicarious Systems|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/07/vicarious-systems-funding-facebook/|publisher=Venture Beat|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=2011-02-07}}</ref>

== Funding ==
The company launched in February 2011 with funding from Founders Fund, [[Dustin Moskovitz]], [[Adam D'Angelo|Adam Dâ€™Angelo]] (former [[Facebook]] [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] and co-founder of [[Quora]]), Felicis Ventures, and [[Palantir Technologies|Palantir]] co-founder [[Joe Lonsdale]]. In August 2012, in its [[Series A round]] of funding, it raised an additional $15 million.  The round was led by [[Good Ventures]]; [[Founders Fund]], Open Field Capital and Zarco Investment Group also participated.<ref name="venturebeat" />

The company received $40 million in its Series B round of funding. The round was led by such notables as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Peter Thiel]], [[Vinod Khosla]], and [[Ashton Kutcher]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mia|title=Vicarious Grabs A Huge, New $40M Growth Round To Advance Artificial Intelligence|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/vicarious-grabs-a-huge-new-40m-growth-round-to-advance-artificial-intelligence/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref> An additional undisclosed amount was later contributed by [[Amazon.com]] CEO [[Jeff Bezos]], [[Yahoo!]] co-founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]], [[Skype]] co-founder [[Janus Friis]] and [[Salesforce.com]] CEO [[Marc Benioff]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mai|title=Artificial Intelligence Startup Vicarious Grabs Funding From Bezos, Benioff And Jerry Yang|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/vicarious/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref>

== Recursive Cortical Network ==
Vicarious is developing [[machine learning]] software based on the computational principles of the human brain. One such software is a vision system known as the Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), it is a [[Generative model|generative]] [[Graphical model|graphical]] visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans.  The system is powered by a balanced approach that takes sensory data, mathematics, and biological plausibility into consideration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Captcha test 'cracked' by US firm Vicarious|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24710209|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Nick|title=Vicarious claims its AI software can crack up to 90% of CAPTCHAs offered by Google, Yahoo and PayPal|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/10/28/vicarious-claims-ai-software-can-now-crack-90-captchas-google-yahoo-paypal/|publisher=thenextweb.com|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>
On October 22, 2013, beating [[CAPTCHA]], Vicarious announced its model was reliably able to solve modern CAPTCHAs, with character recognition rates of 90% or better when trained on one style. However, [[Luis von Ahn]], a pioneer of early CAPTCHA and founder of reCAPTCHA, expressed skepticism, stating: "It's hard for me to be impressed since I see these every few months." He pointed out that 50 similar claims to that of Vicarious had been made since 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hof |first=Robert |title=AI Startup Vicarious Claims Milestone In Quest To Build A Brain: Cracking CAPTCHA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/10/28/ai-startup-vicarious-claims-milestone-in-quest-to-build-a-brain-craking-captcha/|work=Forbes}}</ref> Vicarious later published their findings in peer-reviewed journal Science<ref>{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Dileep|title=A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/10/26/science.aag2612|website=Science|publisher=Science Magazine|accessdate=2017-10-31}}</ref> showing they had definitively cracked the popular Turing test.

Vicarious has indicated that its AI was not specifically designed to complete CAPTCHAs and its success at the task is a product of its advanced vision system. Because Vicarious's algorithms are based on insights from the human brain, it is also able to recognize photographs, videos, and other visual data.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hof|first=Robert|title=AI Startup Vicarious Claims Milestone In Quest To Build A Brain: Cracking CAPTCHA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/10/28/ai-startup-vicarious-claims-milestone-in-quest-to-build-a-brain-craking-captcha/|work=Forbes|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>

The Recursive Cortical Network uses a Markov Random Field to segment images (similar to the visual cortex) and process it through a hierarchy consisting of lateral connections. Thanks to the architecture, the model has extreme data efficiency (almost 900,000x more data efficient than traditional [[Deep learning|deep neural networks]]). The RCN is part of a model that incorporates a causal model and concept induction system recently created by Vicarious.
