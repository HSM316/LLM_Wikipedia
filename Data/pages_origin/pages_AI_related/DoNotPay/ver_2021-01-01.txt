==Application==
DoNotPay had started off as an app for contesting [[parking ticket]]s, but has since expanded to include features that help users with many different types of legal issues, ranging from consumer protection to immigration rights and other social issues. The "[[robot lawyer]]" makes use of automation to provide free legal consultation for the public.<ref>{{cite news|work=Fox 5|url=https://www.fox5dc.com/news/robot-lawyer-app-allows-you-to-sue-anyone-with-press-of-a-button|title=Robot Lawyer: App allows you to sue anyone with press of a button|first=Jaclyn|last=Kelley|date=October 18, 2018|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> The application is supported by [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] computer.<ref name="MercuryNews">{{cite news|work=The Mercury News|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/28/joshua-browder-22-builds-robot-lawyers/|title=Stanford student's quest to clear parking tickets leads to "robot lawyers"|first=Lisa M.|last=Kreiger|date=March 28, 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

As of October 2018, the app only allows for appealing small claims with a maximum limit of $25,000, but Browder plans to expand into more legal areas and add many more features in the near future. Browder claims that one of his major goals for DoNotPay is to eventually allow all members of society to have access to the same levels of legal representation.<ref>{{cite news|work=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/09/15/chatbot-helps-users-fight-parking-tickets-sue-equifax-for-up-to-25k/#17be6d3a8125|title=Chatbot Can Help You Sue Equifax For Up To $25K, Fight Parking Tickets|first=Janet|last=Burns|date=Sep 15, 2017|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> The app also allows users to file small claims with utility providers and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/sue-att-small-claims/|title=Sue AT&T (small claims)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/suing-comcast-small-claims/|title=Suing Comcast (small claims)}}</ref>

==History==
In 2015, DoNotPay was founded by Browder when he was 17 years old. Originally, Browder had created an app that allowed users in the [[United Kingdom]] to protest their parking tickets.<ref name="LawSite"/> Coverage for DoNotPay was then subsequently expanded to the [[United States]], covering all 50 states.<ref name="LawSite">{{cite news|work=LawSites|url=https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2018/10/new-bots-donotpay-includes-one-lets-sue-small-claims-court-press-button.html|title=New Bots From DoNotPay Includes One That Lets You Sue In Any Small Claims Court At The Press Of A Button|first=Robert|last=Ambrogi|date=October 10, 2018|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

Immediately after its launch, Browder's DoNotPay application quickly became widely used by thousands of users and gained significant international media coverage. In 2016, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the chatbot had successfully contested more than 250,000 parking tickets in [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]] and won 160,000 of them, all free of charge, claiming a success rate of over 60 percent.<ref>{{cite news|work=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/chatbot-ai-lawyer-donotpay-parking-tickets-london-new-york|title=Chatbot lawyer overturns 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York|first=Samuel|last=Gibbs|date=28 Jun 2016|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

In 2017, Browder launched 1,000 more bots to help with filling out transaction legal forms in the US and UK.<ref name="TechCrunch">{{cite news|work=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-launches-1000-new-bots-to-help-you-with-your-legal-problems/|title=DoNotPay launches 1,000 new bots to help you with your legal problems|first=John|last=Mannes|date=Jul 12, 2017|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> DoNotPay has also expanded to include features that help users obtain refunds on flight tickets and hotel bookings,<ref>{{cite news|work=iNews.co.uk|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/free-trial-surfing-app-cancels-free-subscriptions-netflix-619055|title=New app promises to automatically cancel subscriptions at end of a free trial period so you won't get charged|first=Ruchira|last=Sharma|date=16 September 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> cancel free trials,<ref>{{cite news|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/story/free-trial-card/|title=This Clever New Service Auto-Cancels Your Free Trials|first=Emily|last=Dreyfuss|date=July 7, 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> sue people,<ref>{{cite news|work=Vice|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bj43y8/donotpay-app-lets-you-sue-anyone-by-pressing-a-button|title=New App Lets You 'Sue Anyone By Pressing a Button'|first=Caroline|last=Haskins|date=Oct 10, 2018|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The Hustle|url=https://thehustle.co/donotpay-josh-browder-tinder-lawsuits/|title=Josh Browder's DoNotPay lets users 'swipe right' on court settlements and sue for $25k|first=Lindsey|last=Quinn|date=October 17, 2018|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> and even offer legal services relating to social issues such as [[right of asylum|asylum]] applications and housing for the homeless.<ref>{{cite news|work=VentureBeat|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-expands-its-free-legal-services-across-u-s-and-u-k/|title=DoNotPay bot expands its free legal services across the U.S. and U.K.|first=Khari|last=Johnson|date=July 12, 2017|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

In 2018, DoNotPay acquired Visabot, a chatbot that helps provide automated services to users seeking to obtain U.S. visas and green cards. Around the same time, DoNotPay also launched a service that helped users seek claims from [[Equifax]] during the aftermath of its security breach, a feature that has since been integrated into the DoNotPay app.<ref name="LawSite"/><ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/suing-equifax/|title=Suing Equifax}}</ref>

As of 2019, DoNotPay provides specialized advice for appealing parking tickets<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/parking-tickets|title=Appealing parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> in locations such as [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/dispute-nyc-parking-tickets|title=New York parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/cambridge-parking-tickets|title=Cambridge parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> [[Chicago]],<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/chicago-parking-tickets|title=Chicago parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> [[Milwaukee]],<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/milwaukee-parking-tickets|title=Milwaukee parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> [[Sacramento]],<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/sacramento-parking-tickets|title=Sacramento parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> and [[UCSD]].<ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/ucsd-parking-tickets|title=UCSD parking tickets|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

In 2019, the DoNotPay application has even advised students at [[Stanford University]], Browder's alma mater, to waive their Student Activities Fees.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Stanford Daily|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/01/25/stanford-alums-company-advises-students-to-waive-student-activities-fee/|title=Stanford alum's company advises students to waive Student Activities Fee|first=Cooper|last=deNicola|date=January 25, 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> More recently, DoNotPay launched Free Trial Card, which gives users a virtual credit card number that can be used to sign up for free online trials such as [[Netflix]] and [[Spotify]].<ref>{{cite news|work=iNews.co.uk|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/free-trial-surfing-app-cancels-free-subscriptions-netflix-619055|title=New app promises to automatically cancel subscriptions at end of a free trial period so you won't get charged|first=Ruchira|last=Sharma|date=16 September 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> As soon as the free trial period ends, the card automatically declines any charges, thus ending free trials without having to give up the cardholder's personal payment information.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49688309|title=App that cancels subscriptions launches in UK|first=Emily|last=Dreyfuss|date=July 7, 2019|lang=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/virtual-credit-cards/|title=Virtual Credit Cards}}</ref>
