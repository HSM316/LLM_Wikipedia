'''DoNotPay''' is an online legal service and [[chatbot]].

==Services==
DoNotPay started off as an app for contesting [[parking ticket]]s. It sells services which generate documents on legal issues ranging from consumer protection to immigration rights; it states that these are generated via automation and AI.<ref>{{cite news|work=Fox 5|url=https://www.fox5dc.com/news/robot-lawyer-app-allows-you-to-sue-anyone-with-press-of-a-button|title=Robot Lawyer: App allows you to sue anyone with press of a button|first=Jaclyn|last=Kelley|date=October 18, 2018|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-date=2019-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016012118/https://www.fox5dc.com/news/robot-lawyer-app-allows-you-to-sue-anyone-with-press-of-a-button|url-status=live}}</ref> The company claims its application is supported by the [[IBM Watson]] AI.<ref name="MercuryNews">{{cite news|work=The Mercury News|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/28/joshua-browder-22-builds-robot-lawyers/|title=Stanford student's quest to clear parking tickets leads to "robot lawyers"|first=Lisa M.|last=Kreiger|date=March 28, 2019|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-date=2021-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211006034322/https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/28/joshua-browder-22-builds-robot-lawyers/|url-status=live}}</ref> It is currently available in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] (in all 50 states).<ref name="Johnson" />

== Reception ==
In 2016, Joshua Browder, the company's founder, told ''The Guardian'' that the chatbot had contested more than 250,000 parking tickets in [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]] and won 160,000 of them, although the newspaper did not appear to verify the claim.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=28 Jun 2016|title=Chatbot lawyer overturns 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York|language=en|work=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/chatbot-ai-lawyer-donotpay-parking-tickets-london-new-york|access-date=2019-10-16|archive-date=2020-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208195045/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/chatbot-ai-lawyer-donotpay-parking-tickets-london-new-york|url-status=live}}</ref>

Browder's technology has received mixed reviews. For example, a blog post from ''The Guardian'' noted that it "just drafted an impressive notice under the Data Protection Act 1998 not to use my personal information for direct marketing."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-07-16|title=Come friendly robots and take our dullest jobs {{!}} John Naughton|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation|access-date=2021-04-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-date=2021-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210504031444/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly, a writer with ''The American Lawyer'' noted that, "one of DoNotPay's chatbots helped me draft a strong, well-cited and appropriately toned letter requesting extended maternity leave."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/almID/1202793181282/|title=The DoNotPay Dilemma: Can Chatbots Provide Access to Justice Without a Lawyer?|website=ALM Law.com|date=2017-07-17|access-date=2023-02-02|archive-date=2023-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230106210142/https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/almID/1202793181282/|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, ''[[Legal Cheek]]'' tested the service in 2016 with "fairly basic legal questions" and noted that it failed to answer most of them.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-01-15|title=Computer science student, 19, says legal profession should be 'very scared' of his new 'robot lawyer' - Legal Cheek|language=en-US|work=Legal Cheek|url=https://www.legalcheek.com/2016/01/computer-science-student-19-says-legal-profession-should-be-very-scared-of-his-new-robot-lawyer/|access-date=2017-09-01|archive-date=2017-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831220857/https://www.legalcheek.com/2016/01/computer-science-student-19-says-legal-profession-should-be-very-scared-of-his-new-robot-lawyer/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Above the Law (website)|Above the Law]] noted that the service may "be too good to be true" due to errors in the legal advice provided, noting that when dealing with "things as important as securing immigration status, which is one of the services DoNotPay promotes, mistakes can ruin lives." Above the Law ultimately recommended the service for "clear-cut issues like parking tickets or non-critical matters," while cautioning against its use for legal issues with higher stakes.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Steph|title=DoNotPay Is the Latest Legal Tech Darling, But Some Are Saying Do Not Click|url=https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2018/10/12/donotpay-is-the-latest-legal-tech-darling-but-some-are-saying-do-not-click/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Above The Law's Legal Tech Non-Event|date=12 October 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=2023-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202225805/https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2018/10/12/donotpay-is-the-latest-legal-tech-darling-but-some-are-saying-do-not-click/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2023, Browder claimed that the organization would attempt to use DoNotPay live in court, but was forced to halt after being warned about the unlicensed practice of law. ''[[NPR]]'' wrote that "some observers" have had "mixed to shoddy results attempting to use its basic features", and noted that Browder, the company's founder, is known for attention-seeking stunts.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news |last=Allyn |first=Bobby |date=25 January 2023 |title=A robot was scheduled to argue in court, then came the jail threats |work=[[National Public Radio]] |url=https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151435033/a-robot-was-scheduled-to-argue-in-court-then-came-the-jail-threats |access-date=1 February 2023 |archive-date=30 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130102114/https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151435033/a-robot-was-scheduled-to-argue-in-court-then-came-the-jail-threats |url-status=live }}</ref>
