Browder's technology has received mixed reviews. For example, a writer at ''The Guardian'' noted that it "just drafted an impressive notice under the Data Protection Act 1998 not to use my personal information for direct marketing."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-07-16|title=Come friendly robots and take our dullest jobs {{!}} John Naughton|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation|access-date=2021-04-11|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Similarly, a writer with ''The American Lawyer'' noted that, "one of DoNotPay's chatbots helped me draft a strong, well-cited and appropriately toned letter requesting extended maternity leave."<ref>[http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793181282/The-DoNotPay-Dilemma-Can-Chatbots-Provide-Access-to-Justice-Without-a-Lawyer?mcode=1202617074729&curindex=0&curpage=ALL]</ref> However, ''[[Legal Cheek]]'' tested the service in 2016 with "fairly basic legal questions" and noted that it failed to answer most of them.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-01-15|title=Computer science student, 19, says legal profession should be 'very scared' of his new 'robot lawyer' - Legal Cheek|language=en-US|work=Legal Cheek|url=https://www.legalcheek.com/2016/01/computer-science-student-19-says-legal-profession-should-be-very-scared-of-his-new-robot-lawyer/|access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref> [[Above the Law (website)|Above the Law]] noted that the service may "be too good to be true" due to errors in the legal advice provided and "things as important as securing immigration status, which is one of the services DoNotPay promotes, mistakes can ruin lives." They recommended the service for "clear-cut issues like parking tickets or non-critical matters" but cautioned against it for legal issues with high stakes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Steph|title=DoNotPay Is the Latest Legal Tech Darling, But Some Are Saying Do Not Click|url=https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2018/10/12/donotpay-is-the-latest-legal-tech-darling-but-some-are-saying-do-not-click/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Above The Law's Legal Tech Non-Event|date=12 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>
