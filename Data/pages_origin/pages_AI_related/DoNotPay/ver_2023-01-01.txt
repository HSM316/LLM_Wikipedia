'''DoNotPay''' is a legal services [[chatbot]] founded by Joshua Browder, a British-American entrepreneur. The chatbot was originally built to contest [[traffic ticket|parking tickets]], but has expanded to include other services as well. As a "[[robot lawyer]]," DoNotPay is a downloadable mobile application that makes use of [[artificial intelligence]] to provide legal services, with a subscription cost of $36 every three months.<ref name="tc-potholes">{{Cite web |last=Kumparak |first=Greg |date=2021-09-09 |title=DoNotPay's 'robot lawyer' can now help report potholes or fallen trees to the city, file damage claims |url=https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/donotpays-robot-lawyer-can-now-help-report-potholes-or-fallen-trees-to-the-city-file-damage-claims/ |access-date=2021-09-09 |website=[[TechCrunch]]}}</ref> It is currently available in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] (in all 50 states).<ref name="Johnson">{{cite news|work=VentureBeat|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/12/donotpay-expands-its-free-legal-services-across-u-s-and-u-k/|title=DoNotPay bot expands its free legal services across the U.S. and U.K.|first=Khari|last=Johnson|date=July 12, 2017|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

== Founding and early years ==
At the age of 19, Joshua Browder began studying at Stanford University. After being hit with a barrage of parking tickets, Browder realized that the "formulaic nature" of the parking tickets called for a relatively straight forward appeals process of those tickets. After going through the process himself, Browder launched DoNotPay as a chat bot to assist drivers in the UK and New York in appealing their parking tickets. Browder came from a background of civic technology and human rights. At 16, he created the mobile application for Freedom House and also worked with Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, David J. Kramer, to make the Freedom of the World Report available in 155 countries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Joshua Browder - DoNotPay Robot Lawyer - Founder and Chief Executive Officer |url=https://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/Roundtable-on-Artificial-Intelligence/2017/participants/details/482/Joshua-Browder |access-date=2022-09-28 |website=csreports.aspeninstitute.org}}</ref>

==Services==
DoNotPay had started off as an app for contesting [[parking ticket]]s, but has since expanded to include features that help users with many different types of legal issues, ranging from consumer protection to immigration rights and other social issues.

DoNotPay offers a ''Free Trial Card'' feature which gives users a [[Controlled payment number|virtual credit card number]] that can be used to sign up for free online trials (such as [[Netflix]] and [[Spotify]]).<ref name="Sharma" /> As soon as the free trial period ends, the card automatically declines any charges.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dreyfuss|first=Emily|date=July 7, 2019|title=App that cancels subscriptions launches in UK|language=en|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49688309|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Virtual Credit Cards|work=DoNotPay|url=https://donotpay.com/learn/virtual-credit-cards/}}</ref>

In 2020, after the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, DoNotPay launched a product to help anyone request information from the government. Although the Freedom of Information Act made this possible, doing so included the tedious task of filling out forms and ensuring that the requested data was not too broad. DoNotPay guides users through how to file a request for information along with doing so in an affordable and expedited manner. Joshua Browder said that with the launch of the new feature, DoNotPay hopes that they can help consumers "beat bureaucracy".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Whittaker |first=Zack |date=2020-12-10 |title=Robot lawyer startup DoNotPay now lets you file FOIA requests |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/robot-lawyer-startup-donotpay-now-lets-you-file-foia-requests/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=TechCrunch |language=en-US}}</ref>

Browder's technology has received mixed reviews. For example, a blog post from ''The Guardian'' noted that it "just drafted an impressive notice under the Data Protection Act 1998 not to use my personal information for direct marketing."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-07-16|title=Come friendly robots and take our dullest jobs {{!}} John Naughton|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation|access-date=2021-04-11|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Similarly, a writer with ''The American Lawyer'' noted that, "one of DoNotPay's chatbots helped me draft a strong, well-cited and appropriately toned letter requesting extended maternity leave."<ref>http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793181282/The-DoNotPay-Dilemma-Can-Chatbots-Provide-Access-to-Justice-Without-a-Lawyer?mcode=1202617074729&curindex=0&curpage=ALL</ref> However, ''[[Legal Cheek]]'' tested the service in 2016 with "fairly basic legal questions" and noted that it failed to answer most of them.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-01-15|title=Computer science student, 19, says legal profession should be 'very scared' of his new 'robot lawyer' - Legal Cheek|language=en-US|work=Legal Cheek|url=https://www.legalcheek.com/2016/01/computer-science-student-19-says-legal-profession-should-be-very-scared-of-his-new-robot-lawyer/|access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref> [[Above the Law (website)|Above the Law]] noted that the service may "be too good to be true" due to errors in the legal advice provided and "things as important as securing immigration status, which is one of the services DoNotPay promotes, mistakes can ruin lives." They recommended the service for "clear-cut issues like parking tickets or non-critical matters" but cautioned against it for legal issues with high stakes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Steph|title=DoNotPay Is the Latest Legal Tech Darling, But Some Are Saying Do Not Click|url=https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2018/10/12/donotpay-is-the-latest-legal-tech-darling-but-some-are-saying-do-not-click/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Above The Law's Legal Tech Non-Event|date=12 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>
