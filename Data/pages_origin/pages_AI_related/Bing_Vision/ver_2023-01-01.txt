'''Bing Vision''' is an [[image recognition]] application created by [[Microsoft]] which is installed on Windows Phones running version [[Windows Phone 7.5|7.5]] and above, including [[Windows Phone 8]]. It is a part of the [[Bing Mobile]] suite of services, and on most devices can be accessed using the search button. On [[Windows Phone 8.1]] devices where [[Microsoft Cortana]] is available, it is only available through the lenses of the [[Lumia Camera|Camera]] app (as the search button now activates Cortana).<ref name=WMPoweruser>{{cite news|last=Suril|first=Surur|title=How to easily launch Bing Vision on WP 8.1|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/how-to-easily-launch-bing-vision-on-wp-8-1/|newspaper=WMPoweruser|date=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=WinBeta>{{cite news|last=Lonut|first=Arghire|title=Bing Vision in Windows Phone 8.1 No Longer Scanning Barcodes|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Bing-Vision-in-Windows-Phone-8-1-No-Longer-Scanning-Barcodes-453178.shtml|newspaper=[[Softpedia]]|date=1 August 2014}}</ref> Bing Vision can scan [[barcodes]], [[QR codes]], [[High Capacity Color Barcode#Microsoft Tags|Microsoft Tags]], books, CDs, and DVDs.<ref name="Engadget">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Mat|title=Windows Phone 8 introduces new Lens apps: Bing Vision, Photosynth and CNN iReport launching from the camera button|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/09/05/windows-phone-8-lens-apps-bing-vision-photosynth/|newspaper=[[Engadget]]|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Books, CDs, and DVDs are offered through [[Bing Shopping]].<ref name="All About Windows Phone">{{cite news|last=Blandford|first=Rafe|title=Bing Vision's Book, CD & DVD recognition expanded to UK|url=http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/news/item/14137_Bing_Visions_Book_CD_and_DVD_f.php|newspaper=All About Windows Phone|date=30 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="Neowin">{{cite news|last=Callaham|first=John|title=Bing features for Windows Phone 8 explained|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/bing-features-for-windows-phone-8-explained|newspaper=[[Neowin]]|date=20 October 2012}}</ref>
