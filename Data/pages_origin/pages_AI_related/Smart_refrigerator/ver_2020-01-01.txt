'''Smart refrigerator''', also known as '''internet refrigerator''', is a [[refrigerator]] which has been programmed to sense what kinds of products are being stored inside it and keep a track of the stock through [[barcode]] or [[RFID]] scanning.  This kind of refrigerator is often equipped to determine itself whenever a food item needs to be replenished.

==History==
By the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the idea of connecting home appliances to the internet ([[Internet of Things]]) had been popularized and was seen as the next big thing.  In June 2000, [[LG]] launched the world’s first internet refrigerator, the [[Internet Digital DIOS]].  This refrigerator was an unsuccessful product because the consumers had seen it as unnecessary and expensive (more than $20,000).

==Controversy==
===Security===
In 2000, Russian anti-virus company Kaspersky Lab warned that in a few years Internet-connected fridges and other household appliances may be targets of net viruses, such as ones that could be designed to make your fridge door swing open in the middle of the night.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/06/21/fridges_to_be_hit_by/|title=Fridges to be hit by Net viruses |first=Linda |last=Harrison

===Support===
In late 2014, several owners of internet-connected Samsung refrigerators complained that they could not log into their Google Calendars accounts, after Google had discontinued the calendar API earlier in the year and Samsung failed to push a software update for the refrigerator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a18485/tech-support-thread-for-refrigerator/ |title=Refrigerator Tech Support Shows the True Horror of Having All Your Appliances Are All Online |first=Eric |last=Limer |date=9 December 2015 |work=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/smart-fridge-only-capable-of-displaying-buggy-future-of-the-internet-of-things |title=Smart Fridge Only Capable of Displaying Buggy Future of the Internet of Things |first=Lorenzo |last=Franceschi-Bicchierai |date=11 December 2015 |work=Motherboard |accessdate=23 October 2016}}</ref>
