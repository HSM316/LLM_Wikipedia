A '''smart refrigerator''', also known as '''internet refrigerator''', is a [[refrigerator]] which is able to communicate with the internet.<ref>{{Cite web|title=You Still Probably Shouldn't Buy a Smart Fridge|url=https://www.reviewgeek.com/33643/2020s-smart-fridges-still-arent-worth-buying/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=Review Geek|date=27 January 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>  This kind of refrigerator is often equipped to determine itself whenever a food item needs to be replenished.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-17 |title=New technologies in refrigerators iPhone Apps |url=https://mapleleafappliance.ca/new-technologies-in-refrigerators-iphone-apps/ |access-date=2022-03-19 |website=Maple Leaf Appliance Repair Calgary |language=en-US}}</ref> This is still partly managed by human involvement but the next evolution of smart technology is the '''Intelligent Refrigerator''', which incorporates inventory tracking for all items inside, along with a seamless payment system. This involves connecting the refrigerator to an online retail store, ensuring a consistently stocked refrigerator at home for domestic use. For commercial use, additional features such as payment terminals and locks are integrated to manage tasks like unattended retail and queue busting.

==History==
By the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the idea of connecting home appliances to the [[internet]] ([[Internet of Things]]) had been popularized and was seen as the next big thing.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Foote |first=Keith D. |date=2021-12-17 |title=A Brief History of Cloud Computing |url=https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-cloud-computing/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025032/https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-cloud-computing/ |archive-date=2022-08-22 |access-date=2022-08-22 |website=DATAVERSITY |language=en-US}}</ref>  In June 2000, [[LG]] launched the world's first internet refrigerator, the [[Internet Digital DIOS]].  This refrigerator was an unsuccessful product because the consumers had seen it as  unnecessary and expensive (more than $20,000).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mahajan |first1=Mukesh P. |last2=Nikam |first2=Rohit R. |last3=Patil |first3=Vivek P. |last4=Dond |first4=Rahul D. |year=2017 |title=Smart Refrigerator Using IOT |url=http://ijlera.com/papers/v2-i3/part-II/31.201703127.pdf |journal=[[International Journal of Latest Engineering Research and Applications]] |language=en-US |location=[[Nashik, India]] |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=6 |issn=2455-7137 |access-date=2022-08-22 |via=Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering}}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Security===
In 2000, Russian anti-virus company [[Kaspersky Lab]] warned that in a few years Internet-connected refrigerator and other household appliances may be targets of net viruses, such as ones that could be designed to make the refrigerator door swing open in the middle of the night.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/06/21/fridges_to_be_hit_by/|title=Fridges to be hit by Net viruses |first=Linda |last=Harrison

===Support===
In late 2014, several owners of internet-connected Samsung refrigerators complained that they could not log into their Google Calendars accounts, after Google had discontinued the calendar API earlier in the year and Samsung failed to push a software update for the refrigerator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a18485/tech-support-thread-for-refrigerator/ |title=Hilarious Tech Support Thread Reveals the True Horror of a Smart Home |first=Eric |last=Limer |date=9 December 2015 |work=Popular Mechanics |access-date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/smart-fridge-only-capable-of-displaying-buggy-future-of-the-internet-of-things |title=Smart Fridge Only Capable of Displaying Buggy Future of the Internet of Things |first=Lorenzo |last=Franceschi-Bicchierai |date=11 December 2015 |work=Motherboard |access-date=23 October 2016}}</ref>
