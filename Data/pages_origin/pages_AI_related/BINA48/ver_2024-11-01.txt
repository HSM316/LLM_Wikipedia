BINA48 is owned by [[Martine Rothblatt]]'s [[Terasem Movement]].<ref>[http://www.terasemcentral.org terasemcentral.org] Retrieved April 22, 2011.</ref> It was developed by [[Hanson Robotics]] and released in 2010. Its physical appearance is modeled after Bina Aspen, Rothblatt's wife.

BINA48 connects to the Internet and has thirty-two facial motors under a skin of rubber. Though without a complete body, the head-and-shoulder robotics express sixty-four different facial gestures. It employs a mix off-the-shelf software and customized artificial intelligence algorithms, as well as a microphone, [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] software, dictation software, two video cameras, and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition software]] to remember frequent visitors.

==History==
In 2007, [[Martine Rothblatt]] commissioned [[Hanson Robotics]] to create a robot using her wife, Bina Aspen Rothblatt, as the template.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nymag.com/news/features/martine-rothblatt-transgender-ceo/index2.html | title=The Trans-Everything CEO }}</ref> [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]] created BINA48 in his [[Plano, Texas]], laboratory. The robot is currently housed in Vermont, at the offices of the [[Terasem Movement|Terasem Movement Foundation (TMF)]], and is maintained by TMF's executive director, Bruce Duncan.

Duncan has used BINA48 as a co-presenter at TEDxHarlem in July 2012;<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-u4xaY5PDE "Android Artificial Lifeforms: BINA48 & Bruce Duncan at TEDxHarlem"] (video).
