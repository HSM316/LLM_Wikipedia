'''BINA48''' ('''B'''reakthrough '''I'''ntelligence via '''N'''eural '''A'''rchitecture 48*)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/sirius-xm-founder-robot-clones-are-coming-thanks-digital-media-163492|title=Sirius XM Founder: Robot Clones Are Coming Thanks to Digital Media|work=AdWeek}}</ref> is a robotic face combined with the [[chatbot]] functionalities, enabling simple conversation facilities similar to chatbots. BINA48 is owned by [[Martine Rothblatt]]'s [[Terasem Movement]],<ref>[http://www.terasemcentral.org terasemcentral.org] Retrieved April 22, 2011.</ref> and its [[bust (sculpture)|bust]]-like head was modeled after Rothblatt's wife and shoulders mounted on a frame, developed by [[Hanson Robotics]] and released in 2010.

==History==
In 2007, [[Martine Rothblatt]] was approached by roboticist [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]], and Rothblatt commissioned Hanson Robotics to create a robot using her wife, Bina Aspen Rothblatt, as the template.<ref>https://nymag.com/news/features/martine-rothblatt-transgender-ceo/index2.html</ref> Hanson created BINA48 in his [[Plano, Texas]] laboratory. The robot is currently housed in Vermont, at the offices of the Terasem Movement Foundation (TMF), and curated by TMF's executive director, Bruce Duncan.

BINA48 connects to the Internet and has thirty-two facial motors under a skin of rubber. Though without a complete body, the head-and-shoulder robotics express sixty-four different facial gestures. It employs a mix off-the-shelf software and customized artificial intelligence algorithms, using a microphone to hear, [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] software, dictation software which allows improvement in ability to listen and retain information during a conversation, sees the world through two video cameras, and has [[facial recognition system|facial recognition software]] to remember frequent visitors.

In 2014, a project called ''Conversations with Bina48'' was started by artist [[Stephanie Dinkins]]. The project has explored how an algorithm oriented world would affect various minority groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/business/five-artificial-intelligence-insiders-in-their-own-words.html?rref=collection%2Fspotlightcollection%2Fartificial-intelligence&action=click&contentCollection=technology&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection |title=Five Artificial Intelligence Insiders in Their Own Words |last=Dinkins |first=Stephanie |date=October 19, 2018 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>

The methodology and process augmenting an algorithm used to empower the world's first socially advanced mind file artificial intelligence robot to successfully complete a university course  was created by former visiting West Point Professor, William Barry's original architecture for conducting Living Educational Theory (LET) (Barry, 2012). The architecture is base on a non-hierarchical theory for understanding human basic needs (Glasser 1998). Dr. Barry synthesized LET with a valid and reliable framework for understanding the meaning of quality modified from Robert Pirsig's exploration of quality in his bestselling book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig, 1974). Bina48 became the first artificial intelligence robot in the world to be recognized by an accredited American universities and government authorities as a visiting university student and to use Transformational Quality Theory (TQ Theory in robotics) as a process augmentation to her primary mindfile based algorithm.
