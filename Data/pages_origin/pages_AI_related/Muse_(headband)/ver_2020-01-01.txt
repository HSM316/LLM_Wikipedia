'''Muse''' is a wearable brain sensing [[headband]]. The device measures brain activity via 4 [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) sensors. An accompanying mobile app converts the EEG signal into audio feedback that is fed to the user via [[headphone]]s.<ref name="USA_Today_2014">{{cite web | url =https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2014/08/12/muse-headband-wearable-tech-to-calm-you-down/13950367/

The device operates by representing brain waves that correspond to a more relaxed state through the sound of tweeting birds, and higher amounts of brain activity is represented by storm sounds.<ref name="recorde">{{Cite web|title = Muse Headband Review: A Fitbit for Your Brain|url = http://recode.net/2014/11/06/muse-headband-review-a-fitbit-for-your-brain/|website = Re/code|accessdate = 2015-11-09|date = 2014-11-06}}</ref>

It was demonstrated that Muse can be used for [[Event-related potential|ERP]] research, with the advantage of it being low cost and quick to setup. Specifically, it can easily quantify [[N200 (neuroscience)|N200]], [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]], and [[Reward‐related Positivity|reward positivity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Krigolson |first=Olave E. |last2=Williams |first2=Chad C. |last3=Norton |first3=Angela |last4=Hassall |first4=Cameron D. |last5=Colino |first5=Francisco L. |date=2017-03-10 |title=Choosing MUSE: Validation of a Low-Cost, Portable EEG System for ERP Research |journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience |volume=11 |pages=109 |doi=10.3389/fnins.2017.00109 |issn=1662-453X |pmid=28344546 |pmc=5344886}}</ref>

It is claimed that using the headband helps in reaching a deep relaxed state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tuneintogold.com/technology/muse-brain-sensing-headband-review/|title=Muse The Brain Sensing Headband Review|website=Tune into Gold|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>

Muse is worn over the ears and connects to a companion mobile app via [[bluetooth]]. The use of Muse enables the use of [[biofeedback]], differing from a device like [[Thync]] that claims to actually alter brainwaves by wearing it.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Muse review: The brain sensing headband that knows you're stressed|url = http://www.wareable.com/wearable-tech/muse-brain-sensing-headband-review-938|website = Wareable|accessdate = 2015-11-09|date = 2015-04-21}}</ref>
