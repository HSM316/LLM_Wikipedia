{{Short description|Intersection of cloud computing and robotics}}
'''Cloud robotics''' is a field of [[robotics]] that attempts to invoke cloud technologies such as [[cloud computing]], [[cloud storage]], and other [[Internet technologies]] centered on the benefits of converged infrastructure and shared services for robotics. When connected to the cloud, robots can benefit from the powerful computation, storage, and communication resources of modern [[data center]] in the cloud, which can process and share information from various robots or agent (other machines, smart objects, humans, etc.). Humans can also delegate tasks to robots remotely through [[network (computing)|network]]s. Cloud computing technologies enable robot systems to be endowed with powerful capability whilst reducing costs through cloud technologies. Thus, it is possible to build lightweight, low-cost, smarter robots with an intelligent "brain" in the cloud. The "brain" consists of data center, [[knowledge base]], task planners, [[deep learning]], information processing, environment models, communication support, etc.<ref name=RASrobot>{{cite web|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation A special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase/special-issues/special-issue-on-cloud-robotics-and-automation|publisher=IEEE|access-date=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914181920/http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase/special-issues/special-issue-on-cloud-robotics-and-automation|archive-date=14 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RoboEarth|url=http://roboearth.org/cloud_robotics/|access-date=2014-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201164951/http://roboearth.org/cloud_robotics/|archive-date=2014-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=kengoldberg>{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Ken|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/cloud-robotics}}</ref><ref name="sites.google.com">{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=R|title=Cloud Robotics-Enable cloud computing for robots|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ruijiaoli/blogs/page|access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>

==Components==
A cloud for robots potentially has at least six significant components:<ref name=cloudsurvey>{{cite journal|last1=Kehoe|first1=Ben|last2=Patil|first2=Sachin|last3=Abbeel|first3=Pieter|last4=Goldberg|first4=Ken|title=A Survey of Research on Cloud Robotics and Automation|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering|date=13 September 2014|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/pubs/2015-T-ASE-Cloud-Robotics-Survey.pdf|author3-link=Pieter Abbeel}}</ref>
* Building a "cloud brain" for robots. It is the main object of cloud robotics.
* Offering a global library of images, maps, and object data, often with geometry and mechanical properties, [[expert system]], [[knowledge base]] (i.e. semantic web, data centres);
* Massively-parallel computation on demand for sample-based statistical modelling and [[motion planning]], task planning, multi-robot collaboration, scheduling and coordination of system;
* Robot sharing of outcomes, trajectories, and dynamic control policies and robot learning support;
* Human sharing of "open-source" code, data, and designs for programming, experimentation, and hardware construction;
* On-demand human guidance and assistance for evaluation, learning, and error recovery;
* Augmented [[human–robot interaction]] through various way (Semantics knowledge base, Apple SIRI like service etc.).

== Applications ==
;Autonomous [[mobile robot]]s: [[Google driverless car|Google's self-driving cars]] are cloud robots. The cars use the network to access Google's enormous database of maps and satellite and environment model (like Streetview) and combines it with streaming data from GPS, cameras, and 3D sensors to monitor its own position within centimetres, and with past and current traffic patterns to avoid collisions. Each car can learn something about environments, roads, or driving, or conditions, and it sends the information to the Google cloud, where it can be used to improve the performance of other cars.
;Cloud [[medical robot]]s: a medical cloud (also called a healthcare cluster) consists of various services such as a disease archive, electronic medical records, a patient health management system, practice services, analytics services, clinic solutions, expert systems, etc. A robot can connect to the cloud to provide clinical service to patients, as well as deliver assistance to doctors (e.g. a co-surgery robot). Moreover, it also provides a collaboration service by sharing information between doctors and care givers about clinical treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impact of Cloud Computing on Healthcare|date=11 July 2023 |url=http://www.cloudstandardscustomercouncil.org/cscchealthcare110512.pdf}}</ref>
;Assistive robots: A [[domestic robot]] can be employed for healthcare and life monitoring for elderly people. The system collects the health status of users and exchange information with cloud expert system or doctors to facilitate elderly peoples life, especially for those with chronic diseases. For example, the robots are able to provide support to prevent the elderly from falling down, emergency healthy support such as heart disease, blooding disease. Care givers of elderly people can also get notification when in emergency from the robot through network.<ref name=smc>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Ruijiao|last2=Hu|first2=Huosheng|title=2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics |chapter=Towards ROS Based Multi-robot Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living |date=16 October 2013|pages=3458–3463|doi=10.1109/SMC.2013.590|isbn=978-1-4799-0652-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.648.3228|s2cid=10169400 }}<!--|accessdate=7 December 2014--></ref>
;[[Industrial robot]]s: As highlighted by the German government's [[Industry 4.0]] Plan, "Industry is on the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution. Driven by the Internet, the real and virtual worlds are growing closer and closer together to form the Internet of Things. Industrial production of the future will be characterised by the strong individualisation of products under the conditions of highly flexible (large series) production, the extensive integration of customers and business partners in business and value-added processes, and the linking of production and high-quality services leading to so-called hybrid products."<ref name=ind4.0>{{cite web|title=Project of the Future: Industry 4.0|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/19955.php|access-date=9 December 2014|archive-date=2 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202232440/http://www.bmbf.de/en/19955.php|url-status=dead}}</ref> In manufacturing, such cloud based robot systems could learn to handle tasks such as threading wires or cables, or aligning gaskets from a professional knowledge base. A group of robots can share information for some collaborative tasks. Even more, a consumer is able to place customised product orders to manufacturing robots directly with online ordering systems.<ref name=rcrush>{{cite web|last1=LaSelle|first1=Rush|title=Automation in the Cloud|url=http://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-Industry-Insights/Automation-in-the-Cloud/content_id/2826|publisher=Robotic Industries Association|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref> Another potential paradigm is shopping-delivery robot systems. Once an order is placed, a warehouse robot dispatches the item to an [[autonomous car]] or autonomous drone to deliver it to its recipient.

== Learn a Cloud Brain for Robots ==
'''Approach: Lifelong Learning.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Boyi |last2=Wang |first2=Lujia |last3=Liu |first3=Ming |date=October 2019 |title=Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning: A Learning Architecture for Navigation in Cloud Robotic Systems |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8772088/;jsessionid=gjAbNDyCIdPyHjcyok37GJ5fDDdx2WhX9YLQrxWvS2aSHRW76ecT!-1309158472 |journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=4555–4562 |doi=10.1109/LRA.2019.2931179 |arxiv=1901.06455 |s2cid=58981458 |issn=2377-3766}}</ref>''' Leveraging lifelong learning to build a cloud brain for robots was proposed by CAS. The author was motivated by the problem of how to make robots fuse and transfer their experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge and quickly adapt to new environments. To address the problem, they present a learning architecture for navigation in cloud robotic systems: Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL). In the work, they propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRL are introduced. LFRL is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRL greatly improves the efficiency of [[reinforcement learning]] for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRL is capable of fusing prior knowledge.

'''Approach: Federated Learning.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Boyi |last2=Wang |first2=Lujia |last3=Liu |first3=Ming |last4=Xu |first4=Cheng-Zhong |date=April 2020 |title=Federated Imitation Learning: A Novel Framework for Cloud Robotic Systems With Heterogeneous Sensor Data |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9013081 |journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=3509–3516 |doi=10.1109/LRA.2020.2976321 |arxiv=1912.12204 |s2cid=209500667 |issn=2377-3766}}</ref>''' Leveraging lifelong learning to build a cloud brain for robots was proposed in 2020. Humans are capable of learning a new behavior by observing others to perform the skill. Similarly, robots can also implement this by imitation learning. Furthermore, if with external guidance, humans can master the new behavior more efficiently. So, how can robots achieve this? To address the issue, The authors present a novel framework named FIL. It provides a heterogeneous knowledge fusion mechanism for cloud robotic systems. Then, a knowledge fusion algorithm in FIL is proposed. It enables the cloud to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from local robots and generate guide models for robots with service requests. After that, we introduce a knowledge transfer scheme to facilitate local robots acquiring knowledge from the cloud. With FIL, a robot is capable of utilizing knowledge from other robots to increase its imitation learning in accuracy and efficiency. Compared with transfer learning and meta-learning, FIL is more suitable to be deployed in cloud robotic systems. They conduct experiments of a self-driving task for robots (cars). The experimental results demonstrate that the shared model generated by FIL increases imitation learning efficiency of local robots in cloud robotic systems.

'''Approach: Peer-assisted Learning.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Liu |first1=Boyi |last2=Wang |first2=Lujia |last3=Chen |first3=Xinquan |last4=Huang |first4=Lexiong |last5=Han |first5=Dong |last6=Xu |first6=Cheng-Zhong |title=2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) |chapter=Peer-Assisted Robotic Learning: A Data-Driven Collaborative Learning Approach for Cloud Robotic Systems |date=May 2021 |chapter-url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9562018 |pages=4062–4070 |doi=10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562018|arxiv=2010.08303 |isbn=978-1-7281-9077-8 |s2cid=223953372 }}</ref>''' Leveraging peer-assisted learning to build a cloud brain for robots was proposed by UM. A technological revolution is occurring in the field of robotics with the data-driven deep learning technology. However, building datasets for each local robot is laborious. Meanwhile, data islands between local robots make data unable to be utilized collaboratively. To address this issue, the work presents Peer-Assisted Robotic Learning (PARL) in robotics, which is inspired by the peer-assisted learning in cognitive psychology and pedagogy. PARL implements data collaboration with the framework of cloud robotic systems. Both data and models are shared by robots to the cloud after semantic computing and training locally. The cloud converges the data and performs augmentation, integration, and transferring. Finally, fine tune this larger shared dataset in the cloud to local robots. Furthermore, we propose the DAT Network (Data Augmentation and Transferring Network) to implement the data processing in PARL. DAT Network can realize the augmentation of data from multi-local robots. The authors conduct experiments on a simplified self-driving task for robots (cars). DAT Network has a significant improvement in the augmentation in self-driving scenarios. Along with this, the self-driving experimental results also demonstrate that PARL is capable of improving learning effects with data collaboration of local robots.

== Limitations of cloud robotics ==
Though robots can benefit from various advantages of cloud computing, cloud is not the solution to all of robotics.<ref name=roadmap>{{cite web|last1=Robotics-vo|title=A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics From Internet to Robotics 2013 Edition|url=https://robotics-vo.us/sites/default/files/2013%20Robotics%20Roadmap-rs.pdf|access-date=8 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905232650/https://robotics-vo.us/sites/default/files/2013%20Robotics%20Roadmap-rs.pdf|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Controlling a robot's motion which relies heavily on ([[real-time computing|real-time]]) sensors and feedback of controller may not benefit much from the cloud.
* Tasks that involve real-time execution require on-board processing.
* Cloud-based applications can get slow or unavailable due to high-latency responses or network hitch. If a robot relies too much on the cloud, a fault in the network could leave it "brainless."

== Challenges ==
The research and development of cloud robotics has following potential issues and challenges:<ref name="roadmap"/>
*[[scalability|Scalable]] [[parallelisation]]-[[grid-computing]], parallelisation schemes scale with the size of automation infrastructure.
*Effective [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]: Balancing operations between local and cloud computation.
*[[Knowledge base]]s and [[knowledge representation|representations]]
*[[Collective learning]] for automation in cloud
*Infrastructure/Platform or [[Software as a Service]]
*[[Internet of Things]] for robotics
*Integrated and collaborative [[fault-tolerant]] control
*[[Big Data]]: Data, collected and/or disseminated over large, accessible networks can enable decisions for classification problems or reveal patterns.
*[[Wireless communication]], Connectivity to the cloud
*System architectures of robot cloud
*[[Open-source]], [[open-access]] infrastructures
* [[Load balancing (computing)|Workload-sharing]]
* Standards and Protocols

== Risks ==
*'''Environmental security''' - The concentration of computing resources and users in a cloud computing environment also represents a concentration of security threats. Because of their size and significance,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://artificial-future.com/cloud-robotics/| title=Linking of cloud robotics to server| access-date=2018-06-18| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618160814/https://artificial-future.com/cloud-robotics/| archive-date=2018-06-18| url-status=dead}}</ref> cloud environments are often targeted by virtual machines and bot malware, brute force attacks, and other attacks.
*'''[[Information privacy|Data privacy]] and security''' - Hosting confidential data with cloud service providers involves the transfer of a considerable amount of an organisation's control over data security to the provider. For example, every cloud contains a huge information from the clients include personal data. If a household robot is hacked, users could have risk of their personal privacy and security, like house layout, life snapshot, home-view, etc. It may be accessed and leaked to the world around by criminals. Another problems is once a robot is hacked and controlled by someone else, which may put the user in danger.
*'''Ethical problems''' - Some ethics of robotics, especially for cloud based robotics must be considered. Since a robot is connected via networks, it has risk to be accessed by other people. If a robot is out of control and carries out illegal activities, who should be responsible for it.

== History ==
The term "Cloud Robotics" first appeared in the public lexicon as part of a talk given by [[James Kuffner]] in 2010 at the IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics entitled "Cloud-enabled Robots".
<ref name=Kuffner2010>{{cite web|last1=Kuffner|first1=James|title=Cloud-Enabled Robots|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47486324/Cloud-Enabled-Robots|publisher=IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics |date=2010}}</ref> Since then, "Cloud Robotics" has become a general term encompassing the concepts of information sharing, [[distributed artificial intelligence|distributed intelligence]], and fleet learning that is possible via networked robots and modern cloud computing. Kuffner was part of Google when he delivered his presentation and the technology company has teased its various cloud robotics initiatives until 2019 when it launched the Google Cloud Robotics Platform for developers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therobotreport.com/google-cloud-robotics-platform/|title=Google Cloud Robotics Platform coming to developers in 2019|last=Crowe|first=Steve|date=2018-10-24|website=The Robot Report|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>

From the early days of robot development, it was common to have computation done on a computer that was separated from the actual robot mechanism, but connected by wires for power and control. As wireless communication technology developed, new forms of experimental "remote brain" robots were developed controlled by small, onboard compute resources for robot control and safety, that were wirelessly connected to a more powerful remote computer for heavy processing.

The term "[[cloud computing]]" was popularized with the launch of [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Amazon EC2]] in 2006. It marked the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of [[hardware virtualization]] and [[service-oriented architecture]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14637206 |title= Cloud Computing: Clash of the clouds |date= 2009-10-15 | newspaper = The Economist |access-date= 2009-11-03}}</ref>
In a correspondence with Popular Science in July 2006, Kuffner wrote that after a robot was programmed or successfully learned to perform a task it could share its model and relevant data with all other cloud-connected robots:

|text="...the robot could then 'publish' its refined model to some website or universal repository of knowledge that all future robots could download and utilize. My vision is to have a 'robot knowledge database' that will over time improve the capabilities of all future robotic systems. It would serve as a warehouse of information and statistics about the physical world that robots can access and use to improve their reasoning about the consequences of possible actions and make better action plans in terms of accuracy, safety, and robustness. It could also serve as a kind of 'skill library'. For example, if I successfully programmed my butler robot how to cook a perfect omelette, I could 'upload' the software for omelette cooking to a server that all robots could then download whenever they were asked to cook an omelette. There could be a whole community of robot users uploading skill programs, much like the current 'shareware' and 'freeware' software models that are popular for PC users."
