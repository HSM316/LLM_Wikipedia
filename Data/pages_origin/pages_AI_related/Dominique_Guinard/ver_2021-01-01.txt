==Career==

Guinard studied Computer Science at [[Universit√© de Fribourg]] and graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a minor in business administration. During his studies he also worked at and co-founded several startups (Spoker, Dartfish, GMIPSoft), taught computer science and software developed at several private and public schools.

Guinard began working on the Internet of Things in 2005 with Sun Microsystems working on RFID applications. He continued studying the field with his a master's thesis at [[Lancaster University]] on Ubiquitous Computing. After graduating from university, he went on to get his PhD in Computer Science at [[ETH Zurich]]. During his time as a PhD he also worked as a Research Associate for [[SAP SE|SAP]] where he met [[Vlad Trifa]]. Both focused on the Internet of Things applications at SAP especially looking at the integration of real-world devices such as wireless sensor networks to business processes and enterprise software (e.g., ERPs).

The complexity of these integrations at the time lead them to look for simpler integration mechanisms. In 2007 they defined an application layer for the Internet of Things that uses Web standards called the Web of Things and founded the Webofthings.org community<ref name='wot-blog'>{{cite web
|url=http://webofthings.org/team/
  |title=Web of Things, Team}}</ref> to promote the use of Web standards in the IoT. Guinard wrote his Ph.D thesis on the Web of Things, particularly looking at the physical mashups of Things on the Web. His thesis<ref>*{{cite thesis

  |title=Oreilly Radar - Dominique Guinard}}</ref> Towards the end of his Ph.D worked applying the Web of Things concepts to Smart Supply chains and IoT applications in manufacturing environments at the [[MIT]] [[Auto-ID]] Lab with Professor [[Sanjay Sarma]].

In 2011, Guinard co-founded [[EVRYTHNG]] together with [[Vlad Trifa]], Niall Murphy and [[Andy Hobsbawm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://startupbeat.com/2012/12/14/backed-by-1m-in-seed-funding-from-atomico-evrythng-is-creating-the-smart-web-of-things-id3062/ |title=Backed by $1M in Seed funding from Atomico, EVRYTHNG is creating the smart 'Web of Things' |publisher=Startup Beat |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> The founding idea of EVRYTHNG was to create digital identities and Web APIs for all kinds of objects: from consumer goods to consumer electronics. As such, EVRYTHNG was the first commercial Web of Things platform. Dominique has been the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of EVRYTHNG since then, overseeing all the technical aspects of the platform.

In 2015, Guinard co-authored the Web Thing Model<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/wot-model/
  |title=Web Thing Model, W3C Member Submission}}</ref> which was accepted as an official [[W3C]] member submission. The Web Thing model is a first attempt at creating a simple Web based standard for the application layer of the [[Internet of Things]].<ref>{{cite web
