'''Google Neural Machine Translation''' (GNMT) is a [[neural machine translation]] (NMT) system developed by Google and introduced in November 2016, that uses an [[artificial neural network]] to increase fluency and accuracy in [[Google Translate]].<ref name="GT_Turovsky_2016">{{citation|title=Found in translation: More accurate, fluent sentences in Google Translate|author=Barak Turovsky|url=https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/|work=Google Blog|date=November 15, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name="googleblog_GNMT_2016">{{citation|work=Google Research Blog|title=Zero-Shot Translation with Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System|url=https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html|date=November 22, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2017|authors=Mike Schuster, Melvin Johnson, and Nikhil Thorat}}</ref><ref name="freecodecamp_Fewster">{{citation|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-mind-blowing-ai-announcement-from-google-that-you-probably-missed-2ffd31334805#.msj1mdvbh|title=The mind-blowing AI announcement from Google that you probably missed |author=Gil Fewster |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |work=freeCodeCamp}}</ref><ref name="GT_Wu_Paper">{{cite journal|title=Google's neural machine translation system: Bridging the gap between human and machine translation|first1=Yonghui|last1=Wu|first2=Mike|last2=Schuster|first3=Zhifeng|last3=Chen|first4=Quoc V.|last4=Le|first5=Mohammad|last5=Norouzi|arxiv=1609.08144|year=2016|bibcode=2016arXiv160908144W}}</ref>

== Evaluation ==
The GNMT system is said to represent an improvement over the former Google Translate in that it will be able handle "zero-shot translation", that is it directly translates one language into another (for example, Japanese to Korean).<ref name="googleblog_GNMT_2016" /> Google Translate previously first translated the [[source language (translation)|source language]] into English and then translated the English into the [[target language (translation)|target language]] rather than translating directly from one language to another.<ref name="Biotet">{{cite web|first1=Christian|last1=Boitet|first2=Hervé|last2=Blanchon|first3=Mark|last3=Seligman|first4=Valérie|last4=Bellynck|title=MT on and for the Web|url=http://www-clips.imag.fr/geta/herve.blanchon/Pdfs/NLP-KE-10.pdf|date=2010|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}</ref>

A July 2019 study in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' found that "Google Translate is a viable, accurate tool for translating non–English-language trials". Only one disagreement between reviewers reading machine-translated trials was due to a translation error. Since many medical studies are excluded from systematic reviews because the reviewers do not understand the language, GNMT has the potential to reduce bias and improve accuracy in such reviews.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Jeffrey L|last2=Kuriyama|first2=Akira|last3=Anton|first3=Andreea|last4=Choi|first4=April|last5=Fournier|first5=Jean-Pascal|last6=Geier|first6=Anne-Kathrin|last7=Jacquerioz|first7=Frederique|last8=Kogan|first8=Dmitry|last9=Scholcoff|first9=Cecilia|last10=Sun|first10=Rao|title=The Accuracy of Google Translate for Abstracting Data From Non–English-Language Trials for Systematic Reviews|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=30 July 2019|volume=171|issue=9|page=678|doi=10.7326/M19-0891|pmid=31357212|s2cid=198980789|issn=0570-183X}}</ref>

As at October 2020 the number of languages supported by [[Google Translate]] rose to 109 with Kyrgrz, Belarusian, Latin, Maltese, and Sudanese now included
