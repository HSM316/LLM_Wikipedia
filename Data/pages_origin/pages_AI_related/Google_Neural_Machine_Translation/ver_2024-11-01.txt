'''Google Neural Machine Translation''' (GNMT) was a [[neural machine translation]] (NMT) system developed by Google and introduced in November 2016 that used an [[artificial neural network]] to increase fluency and accuracy in [[Google Translate]].<ref name="GT_Turovsky_2016">{{citation|title=Found in translation: More accurate, fluent sentences in Google Translate|author=Barak Turovsky|url=https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/|work=Google Blog|date=November 15, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name="googleblog_GNMT_2016">{{citation|work=Google Research Blog|title=Zero-Shot Translation with Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System|url=https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html|date=November 22, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2017|author1=Mike Schuster |author2=Melvin Johnson |author3=Nikhil Thorat }}</ref><ref name="freecodecamp_Fewster">{{citation|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-mind-blowing-ai-announcement-from-google-that-you-probably-missed-2ffd31334805#.msj1mdvbh|title=The mind-blowing AI announcement from Google that you probably missed |author=Gil Fewster |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |work=freeCodeCamp}}</ref><ref name="GT_Wu_Paper">{{cite journal|title=Google's neural machine translation system: Bridging the gap between human and machine translation|first1=Yonghui|last1=Wu|first2=Mike|last2=Schuster|first3=Zhifeng|last3=Chen|first4=Quoc V.|last4=Le|first5=Mohammad|last5=Norouzi|arxiv=1609.08144|year=2016|bibcode=2016arXiv160908144W}}</ref> The neural network consisted of two main blocks, an encoder and a decoder, both of [[LSTM]] architecture with 8 1024-wide layers each and a simple 1-layer 1024-wide [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] [[Attention (machine learning)|attention mechanism]] connecting them.<ref name="GT_Wu_Paper" /><ref>{{cite web | url=https://smerity.com/articles/2016/google_nmt_arch.html | title=Peeking into the neural network architecture used for Google's Neural Machine Translation }}</ref> The total number of parameters has been variously described as over 160 million,<ref>{{cite arXiv | eprint=2112.10930 | last1=Qin | first1=Minghai | last2=Zhang | first2=Tianyun | last3=Sun | first3=Fei | last4=Chen | first4=Yen-Kuang | last5=Fardad | first5=Makan | last6=Wang | first6=Yanzhi | last7=Xie | first7=Yuan | title=Compact Multi-level Sparse Neural Networks with Input Independent Dynamic Rerouting | year=2021 | class=cs.NE }}</ref> <span lang="en-in" dir="ltr">approximately</span> 210 million,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://intellabs.github.io/nlp-architect/sparse_gnmt.html | title=Compression of Google Neural Machine Translation Model – NLP Architect by Intel® AI Lab 0.5.5 documentation }}</ref> 278 million<ref>{{cite arXiv | eprint=2104.02233 | last1=Langroudi | first1=Hamed F. | last2=Karia | first2=Vedant | last3=Pandit | first3=Tej | last4=Kudithipudi | first4=Dhireesha | title=TENT: Efficient Quantization of Neural Networks on the tiny Edge with Tapered FixEd PoiNT | year=2021 | class=cs.LG }}</ref> or 380 million.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nanonets.com/blog/data-augmentation-how-to-use-deep-learning-when-you-have-limited-data-part-2 | title=Data Augmentation &#124; How to use Deep Learning when you have Limited Data | date=May 19, 2021 }}</ref> It used WordPiece [[Lexical analysis|tokenizer]], and [[beam search]] decoding strategy.

In November 2016, Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) was introduced.

Training GNMT was a big effort at the time and took, by a 2021 OpenAI estimate, on the order of 100 PFLOP/s*day (up to 10{{sup|22}} FLOPs) of compute which was 1.5 orders of magnitude larger than [[Seq2seq]] model of 2014<ref>{{cite web | url=https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute | title=AI and compute }}</ref> (but about 2x smaller than [[GPT-J|GPT-J-6B]] in 2021<ref>{{cite web | url=https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax | title=Table of contents | website=[[GitHub]] }}</ref>).

By 2020, Google had changed methodology to use a different neural network system based on [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformers]], and had phased out NMT.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Recent Advances in Google Translate |url=http://research.google/blog/recent-advances-in-google-translate/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=research.google |language=en}}</ref>
== Evaluation ==
The GNMT system was said to represent an improvement over the former Google Translate in that it will be able to handle "zero-shot translation", that is it directly translates one language into another (for example, Japanese to Korean).<ref name="googleblog_GNMT_2016" /> Google Translate previously first translated the [[source language (translation)|source language]] into English and then translated the English into the [[target language (translation)|target language]] rather than translating directly from one language to another.<ref name="Biotet"/>

A July 2019 study in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' found that "Google Translate is a viable, accurate tool for translating non–English-language trials". Only one disagreement between reviewers reading machine-translated trials was due to a translation error. Since many medical studies are excluded from systematic reviews because the reviewers do not understand the language, GNMT has the potential to reduce bias and improve accuracy in such reviews.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Jeffrey L|last2=Kuriyama|first2=Akira|last3=Anton|first3=Andreea|last4=Choi|first4=April|last5=Fournier|first5=Jean-Pascal|last6=Geier|first6=Anne-Kathrin|last7=Jacquerioz|first7=Frederique|last8=Kogan|first8=Dmitry|last9=Scholcoff|first9=Cecilia|last10=Sun|first10=Rao|title=The Accuracy of Google Translate for Abstracting Data From Non–English-Language Trials for Systematic Reviews|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=July 30, 2019|volume=171|issue=9|page=678|doi=10.7326/M19-0891|pmid=31357212|s2cid=198980789|issn=0570-183X}}</ref>

== Languages supported by GNMT ==
As of December 2021, all of the languages of [[Google Translate]] support GNMT, with Latin being the most recent addition.
