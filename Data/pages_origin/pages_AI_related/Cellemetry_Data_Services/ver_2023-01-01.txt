For an outbound message, the Cellemetry server would receive a message from an application or service provider, and then send a 'ring' signal to the device as if it was ringing a normal cellular telephone.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The inbound channel (device to the network) channel was much more robust than the outbound channel (network to device). Outbound messages were generally restricted to trigger messages that caused a large number of devices to perform an action, report status, or other similar action. For example, an outbound messages might cause a set of vending machines to report their  inventory level, change pricing, etc. Later versions of Cellemetry used other signaling messages such as USSD messages<ref>{{cite web|url=https://django-ussd-airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_ussd_works.html|title=How ussd works — Ussd Airflow 0.0 documentation|website=django-ussd-airflow.readthedocs.io}}</ref> as the outbound messaging mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Cellemetry had a number of advantages that led to its widespread adoption worldwide.

* Since the Cellemetry messages were carried over the cell site signaling channel, they tended to have a higher coverage than cellular voice calls. This was mainly due to the architecture of the signaling channel where the messages are repeated several times (typically three) and included check bits. This allowed Cellemetry devices to be placed further into buildings or on the edge of the cellular coverage were normal voice calls may not have been possible<ref name="storage.googleapis.com">https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e5/b4/2e/203d20bddce458/US5526401.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>
* Cellemetry devices utilized many of the components of a traditional analog cellular telephone. This allowed the Cellemetry devices to take advantages of the cost efficiencies of the rapidly growing cellular telephone base.<ref name="Evans1997"/> Many early Cellemetry modems were analog cellular telephones without the human interface or the case.

As the analog cellular network was phased out, the analog Cellemetry devices were eventually discontinued or transitioned to the GSM network using an different technology.<ref name="engadget" />
