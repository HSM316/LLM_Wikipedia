== History ==
Neptune was started by [[Simon Tian]] in January 2013. Before even building a prototype or incorporating a company, Tian posted some conceptual drawings of a smartwatch, the [[Neptune Pine]], on a website he built using [[Weebly]], issued a press release announcing the product, and proceeded to receive more than 20,000 orders for the device in a few weeks. Tian then dropped out of school, and traveled to China to meet with contract manufacturers to have the device developed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== Neptune Pine ===
In November 2013, he launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Pine on [[Kickstarter]]. Within 27 hours, the campaign reached its funding goal of $100,000, and ultimately went on to raise more than $800,000 in 30 days.

The device started shipping to backers in August 2014, and eventually became widely available through [[Best Buy]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/neptune-neptune-pine-16gb-smartwatch-with-gps-large-black-p312bg16/10326320.aspx|title=Neptune Pine 16GB Smartwatch with GPS - Large - Black|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419103618/http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/neptune-neptune-pine-16gb-smartwatch-with-gps-large-black-p312bg16/10326320.aspx|archive-date=2016-04-19|last=Best Buy Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/NEPTUNE-Pine-16GB-Smartwatch-Packaging/dp/B00NQTO2Z6|title=NEPTUNE Pine 16GB Smartwatch - Retail Packaging - Black: Amazon.ca: Cell Phones & Accessories|website=www.amazon.ca}}</ref> The Pine was featured in ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', the [[CBS]] TV series [[Extant (TV series)|''Extant'']], and the music video for the [[Trey Songz]] song "[[Trey Songz|Smartphones]]".

The Pine has gotten mixed reviews from the press, generally praising its extensive set of features, while criticizing its large size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== Neptune Suite ===
In March 2015, Neptune announced the Neptune Suite through an [[Indiegogo]] campaign, raising $1.2 million in a month. [[Christopher Mims]] of the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] described the Suite as "a literal interpretation of the fact that a smartwatch, smartphone and tablet are all just different size windows on the same set of apps and services." Cliff Kuang of [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] called the Suite "a taste of what computing should be in 2025".

In late 2017, Neptune was acquired for an undisclosed amount.
