== History ==
Neptune was started by [[Simon Tian]] in January 2013. Before even building a prototype or incorporating a company, Tian posted some conceptual drawings of a smartwatch, the [[Neptune Pine]], on a website he built using [[Weebly]], issued a press release though [[PRWeb]] announcing the product, and proceeded to receive more than 20,000 orders for the device in a few weeks.

Tian then dropped out of school and traveled to China to meet with contract manufacturers to have the device developed. In November 2013, he launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Pine on [[Kickstarter]]. Within 27 hours, the campaign reached its funding goal of $100,000, and ultimately went on to raise more than $800,000 in 30 days.

The device started shipping by August 2014, and eventually became widely available through [[Best Buy]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], generating around $5 million in total retail sales for the company.<ref name=":2" /> It was prominently featured in the 2017 film [[The Fate of the Furious]], the [[CBS]] TV series [[Extant (TV series)|Extant]] produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] and starring [[Halle Berry]], and the music video for [[SmartPhones (song)|Smartphones]] by [[Trey Songz]]. The Pine has gotten mixed reviews from the press, generally praising its extensive set of features, while criticizing its large size.

In March 2015, Neptune announced the Neptune Suite through an [[Indiegogo]] campaign, raising $1.2 million in a month. [[Christopher Mims]] of the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] described the Suite as "a literal interpretation of the fact that a smartwatch, smartphone and tablet are all just different size windows on the same set of apps and services." Daniel Cooper of [[Engadget]] commented on the ambitious nature of the product vision, writing, "Technology is all about big ideas, and this one from Simon Tian will probably need its own aircraft hangar." Cliff Kuang of [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] called the Suite "a taste of what computing should be in 2025", and [[the Verge]] wrote, "the idea of putting all the brains and power of mobile computing into something attached to your body instead of in a pocket or bag is wildly attractive." 

In 2017, [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]], the inventor of the world's first general purpose [[wearable computer]] as well as [[high-dynamic-range imaging]] (HDR), joined the company as a Chief Scientist. He is commonly referred to as the "father of wearable computing" by the mainstream press.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/aug/02/onlinesupplement.gadgets|title=From man to borg - Is this the future?|last=Schofield|first=Jack|date=2001-08-02|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> As of 2018, Neptune is still actively developing the product and aim to release the suite in Q2 2019.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://angel.co/neptuneinc|title=Neptune|website=angel.co}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@projectneptune/updates-from-neptune-d7bc1c0f6148|title=Updates From Neptune|last=Neptune|date=2018-05-18|website=Neptune|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>
