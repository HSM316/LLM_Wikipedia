'''CORE''' ('''Connecting Repositories''') is a service provided by the {{ill|Knowledge Media Institute|WD=Q86003202}} based at [[The Open University]], [[United Kingdom]]. The goal of the project is to aggregate all [[open access]] content distributed across different systems, such as [[Institutional repository|repositories]] and [[open access journal]]s, enrich this content using [[text mining]] and [[data mining]], and provide free access to it through a set of services.<ref>{{cite web| title = OU's full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=24452| date = 24 October 2012| access-date = 19 December 2014 }}</ref> The CORE project also aims to promote open access to scholarly outputs. CORE works closely with [[Digital Library|digital libraries]] and [[Institutional repository|institutional repositories]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/Enhancing-the-visibility-of-Maltese-research.634863|title = Enhancing the visibility of Maltese research}}</ref>

==Service description==
There are existing commercial academic search systems, such as [[Google Scholar]], which provide search and access level services, but do not support programmable machine access to the content. This is seen with the use of an [[Application programming interface|API]] or data dumps, and limits the further reuse of the open access content (e.g., [[Text mining|text and data mining]]). There are three access levels to content:<ref>{{Citation| last = Knoth| first = Petr | title = CORE: Three Access Levels to Underpin Open Access | journal = D-Lib Magazine| url = http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html| volume = 1 | number = 11/12 | date = December 2012 }}</ref>
* access at the granularity of papers
* analytical access and granularity of collections
* programmable machine access to data
The programmable machine access is the main feature that distinguishes CORE from Google Scholar and [[Microsoft Academic Search]].

==History==
The first version of CORE was created in 2011 by [[Petr Knoth]] with the aim to make it easier to access and [[text mining|text mine]] very large amounts of research publications.<ref>{{cite web| title = OUs full text search system makes huge leaps in widening access to academic papers| url = http://news.kmi.open.ac.uk/rostra/news.php?r=11&t=2&id=18463=KMi| date = 24 October 2012| access-date = 19 December 2014}}</ref> The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a [[recommender system|content recommendation system]] for research papers, following the ideas of literature-based discovery introduced by [[Don R. Swanson]]. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including [[Jisc]] and the [[European Commission]]. CORE aggregates from across the world; in 2017, it was calculated that it reached documents from 102 countries in 52 languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archimag.com/bibliotheque-edition/2017/02/20/core-cap-5-millions-documents-texte-integral-libre-acces|title = CORE franchit le cap des 5 millions de documents en texte intégral indexés et en libre accès|language=fr}}</ref> It has the status of the UK's national aggregator of [[open access]] content, aggregating [[metadata]] and full-text outputs from both UK publishers' databases as well as institutional and subject repositories.<ref>{{cite web| title = CORE melds UK repositories| newspaper= Times of Higher Education | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/417751.article| date = 13 October 2011| access-date = 11 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = UK's first open access full-text search engine to aid research| publisher = The Research Centre| url = http://www.theresearchcentre.co.uk/feedstory/uk-s-open-access-full-text-search-engine-aid-research| date = 3 October 2011| access-date = 19 December 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109130034/http://www.theresearchcentre.co.uk/feedstory/uk-s-open-access-full-text-search-engine-aid-research| archive-date = 9 January 2015| url-status = dead}}</ref> 

CORE operates as a one step search tool for UK's [[open access]] research outputs, facilitating [[discoverability]], use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by [[Jisc]], which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Neil | last1 = Jacobs | first2 = Nicky| last2 = Ferguson | title = Bringing the UK's open access research together: Barriers on the Berlin road to open access| year = 2014| publisher= Jisc | url = http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5570/1/JISC_REPORT_open_mirror_090514_FINAL_WEB.pdf }}</ref>
CORE is now one of the Repository Shared Services projects, along with [[SHERPA (organisation)|Sherpa Services]],<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/| title= SHERPA Services | access-date = 20 January 2015}}</ref> IRUS-UK,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/| title= IRUS UK| access-date = 20 January 2015}}</ref> Jisc Publications Router<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://broker.edina.ac.uk/| title = Jisc Publications Router| access-date = 20 January 2015}}</ref> and [[OpenDOAR]].

In 2018, CORE said it was the world's largest aggregator of open access research papers.<ref>{{cite web |title=CORE becomes the world's largest aggregator |date=1 June 2018 |url=https://scholarlycommunications.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2018/06/01/core-becomes-the-worlds-largest-aggregator/ |work=[[Jisc]] scholarly communications blog |first1=Balviar |last1=Notay |first2=Petr |last2=Knoth |first3=Nancy |last3=Pontika}}</ref> Based on the open access fundamental principles, as they were described in the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]], its open access content not only must be openly available to download and read, but it must also allow its reuse, both by humans and machines. As a result, there was a need to exploit the content reuse, which could be made possible with the implementation of a technical infrastructure. The CORE project started with the goal of connecting [[metadata]] and full-text outputs offering, through content aggregation, value-added services, and by opening new opportunities in the research process.

CORE later changed the license of its datasets to "all rights reserved" and was overtaken by [[Internet Archive Scholar]], which in 2022 had over 25 million full-text articles vs. less than 10 million on CORE.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://core.ac.uk/documentation/dataset | title=CORE Dataset }}</ref>

==Programmable access to CORE data==
CORE data can be accessed through an [[API]] or downloaded as a pre-processed and semantically enriched data dump.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://core.ac.uk/services |title=CORE Services |website=core.ac.uk |access-date=2021-06-20}}</ref>

==Searching CORE==
CORE provides searchable access to a collection of over 125 million open access harvested research outputs. All outputs can be accessed and downloaded free of cost and have limited re-use restrictions. One can search the CORE content using a [[faceted search]]. CORE also provides a cross-repository content recommendation system based on full-texts. The collection of the harvested outputs is available either by looking at the latest additions<ref>{{cite web| url= http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse/latest| title= CORE Latest Additions| access-date= 20 January 2015| archive-date= 15 May 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130515181017/http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse/latest| url-status= dead}}</ref> or by browsing<ref>{{cite web| url = http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse| title = CORE Browsing| access-date = 20 January 2015| archive-date = 12 January 2015| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112125757/http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/browse| url-status = dead}}</ref> the collection at the date of harvesting.
The CORE search engine was selected by an author on Jisc in 2013 as one of the top 10 search engines<ref>{{cite web| title = Ten Search Engines for researchers that go beyond Google| series = Jisc Inform| url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/inform/inform37/SearchingBeyondGoogle.html| date = Summer 2013| access-date = 17 November 2014| url-status = dead| archive-date = 24 December 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141224190720/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/inform/inform37/SearchingBeyondGoogle.html}}</ref> for open access research, facilitating access to academic papers.<ref>{{cite web| title = OU widens access to academic papers| url = http://www.openuniversity.edu/news-blog/news/ou-widens-access-to-academic-papers| access-date = 17 November 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109134206/http://www.openuniversity.edu/news-blog/news/ou-widens-access-to-academic-papers| archive-date = 9 January 2015| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last = Else	| first = Holly | title = 'Dismal' start for Access to Research initiative | newspaper = Times Higher Education | date = 14 August 2014  | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/dismal-start-for-access-to-research-initiative/2015157.article| access-date = 15 November 2014}}</ref>

==Analytical use of CORE data==
The availability of data aggregated and enriched by CORE provides opportunities for the development of new analytical services for research literature. These can be used, for example, to monitor growth and trends in research, validate compliance with [[open access mandate]]s and to develop new automatic metrics for evaluating research excellence.

According to the [[Registry of Open Access Repositories]], the number of funders increased from 22 units in 2007 to 34 in 2010 and then to 67 in 2015, while the number of institutional full-text and open access mandates picked up from 137 units in 2007 to 430 in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = Nancy | last1= Pontika  | first2 = Petr | last2 = Knoth | first3 = Matteo | last3 = Cancellieri | first4 = Samuel | last4 = Pearce | title = Developing Infrastructure to Support Closer Collaboration of Aggregators with Open Repositories | journal = LIBER Quarterly | year = 2016 | volume = 25 | number = 4 | pages = 172–188 | oclc = 1005985574 | doi = 10.18352/lq.10138 | issn = 1435-5205 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
