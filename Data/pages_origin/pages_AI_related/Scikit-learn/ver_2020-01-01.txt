It features various [[statistical classification|classification]], [[regression analysis|regression]] and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] algorithms including [[support vector machine]]s, [[random forests]], [[gradient boosting]], [[k-means clustering|''k''-means]] and [[DBSCAN]], and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries [[NumPy]] and [[SciPy]].

==Overview==
The scikit-learn project started as scikits.learn, a [[Google Summer of Code]] project by [[David Cournapeau]]. Its name stems from the notion that it is a "SciKit" (SciPy Toolkit), a separately-developed and distributed third-party extension to SciPy.<ref>{{cite web

The original codebase was later rewritten by other developers. In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel, all from the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] in [[Rocquencourt]], [[France]], took leadership of the project and made the first public release on February the 1st 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html#history|title=About us — scikit-learn 0.20.1 documentation|website=scikit-learn.org}}</ref> Of the various scikits, scikit-learn as well as [[scikit-image]] were described as "well-maintained and popular" {{As of|2012|11|alt=in November 2012}}.<ref>{{cite book

==Implementation==
Scikit-learn is largely written in Python, and uses [[numpy]] extensively for high-performance linear algebra and array operations. Furthermore, some core algorithms are written in [[Cython]] to improve performance. Support vector machines are implemented by a Cython wrapper around [[LIBSVM]]; logistic regression and linear support vector machines by a similar wrapper around [[LIBLINEAR]]. In such cases, extending these methods with Python may not be possible.

Scikit-learn integrates well with many other Python libraries, such as [[matplotlib]] and [[plotly]] for plotting, [[NumPy|numpy]] for array vectorization, [[Pandas (software)|pandas]] dataframes, [[SciPy|scipy]], and many more.

== Version history ==
Scikit-learn was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google summer of code project in 2007. Later Matthieu Brucher joined the project and started to use it as a part of his thesis work. In 2010 [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation|INRIA]], the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]], got involved and the first public release (v0.1 beta) was published in late January 2010.
