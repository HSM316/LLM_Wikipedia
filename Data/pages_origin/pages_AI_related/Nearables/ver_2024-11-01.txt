'''Nearables''' (also '''nearable technology''') is a term for a type of [[smart objects|smart object]], invented by [[Estimote Inc.]]. The term is used to describe everyday items that have small, wireless computing devices attached to them. These devices can be equipped with a variety of sensors and work as transmitters to broadcast digital data through a variety of methods, but they usually use the [[Bluetooth Smart]] protocol. These objects provide mobile devices within their range with information about their location, state, and immediate surroundings. The word 'nearables' is a reference to [[wearable technology]] {{En dash}} electronic devices worn as part of clothing or jewelry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=Wearables has become a household name.

The term 'nearables' was first introduced by [[Estimote Inc.]] in 2014 as part of a marketing campaign associated with a product launch of the next generation of Bluetooth Smart beacons.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=Estimote Wants To Pioneer 'Nearables' With New Stickers Beacon Hardware|date=21 August 2014 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/estimote-wants-to-pioneer-nearables-with-new-stickers-beacon-hardware/ |publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>
Using the language of Estimote, 'nearables' were an implementation of the [[iBeacon]] standard that provided orientation, temperature, and motion information {{En dash}} enabling functionality for Internet of Things applications.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sykes |first1=Edward R. |last2=Pentland |first2=Stephen |last3=Nardi |first3=Saverio |date=2015-11-02 |title=Context-aware mobile apps using iBeacons: towards smarter interactions |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2886444.2886463 |journal=Proceedings of the 25th Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering |series=CASCON '15 |location=USA |publisher=IBM Corp. |pages=120–129 |quote=Estimote offers two distinct products that satisfy the iBeacon specification: Beacons and Nearables (also referred to as Stickers).

== History ==

Nearables are a further development of the [[Internet of Things]] (also referred to as Internet of Everything). It's a vision of a wide, global network of interconnected devices, using the existing Internet infrastructure to provide services beyond standard [[Machine to machine|machine-to-machine communications]]. Although the term Internet of Things was coined by [[Kevin Ashton]] in 1999,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashton|first1=Kevin|title=That 'Internet of Things' Thing|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415194522/http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |website=[[RFID Journal]]|access-date=29 August 2014}}</ref> the idea can be traced to the late 1980s, when [[Mark Weiser]] introduced the idea of [[ubiquitous computing]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Mark|title=The Computer for the 21st Century|journal=Scientific American|date=September 1991|volume=265|issue=September 1991|pages=94–104|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0991-94|bibcode=1991SciAm.265c..94W|url=http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/pca/_files/weiser-orig.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116133741/http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/pca/_files/weiser-orig.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-11-16|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

Location-based services emerged in the 1990s with widespread adoption of mobile phones and development of location- and proximity-based technologies, such as [[GPS]] and [[RFID]]. This, in turn, led to first attempts at wireless [[proximity marketing]] in 2000s with early versions of [[Bluetooth]], [[Near field communication|NFC]] and [[Wi-Fi]] standards as predominant technologies. However, it was not until 2013, when [[Apple Inc.]] announced the [[iBeacon]] protocol for Bluetooth Smart-enabled devices, that the idea of creating smart objects by attaching wireless beacons to them started gaining traction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gottipati|first1=Hari|title=With iBeacon, Apple is going to dump on NFC and embrace the internet of things|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/09/10/with-ibeacon-apple-is-going-to-dump-on-nfc-and-embrace-the-internet-of-things/ <!-- |website=http://gigaom.com/ -->|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014 Estimote Inc. launched Estimote Stickers, a new generation of small Bluetooth Smart-based beacons. The term ‘nearables’ was inspired by the wearable computers gaining increasing popularity in 2013 and 2014. Two such computers were the [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] smartwatch and [[Google Glass]]. Originally, nearables were described as ''smart, connected objects that broadcast data about their location, motion and temperature''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nearables are here: introducing Estimote Stickers|url=http://blog.estimote.com/post/95382199590/nearables-are-here-introducing-estimote-stickers|website=blog.estimote.com|publisher=Estimote|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

In its first interpretation, Nearables are not devices themselves. Any object (or a live being, like a human or animal) can become a nearable after a wireless, electronic sensor is attached to it and starts broadcasting data to nearby mobile devices. Due to the continued miniaturization of sensor technology, a single transmitter could be equipped with a whole set of these, for example: [[accelerometer]], [[thermometer]], [[ambient light sensor]], [[humidity]] sensor or [[magnetometer]]. In the second interpretation the actual nearable devices can be part of an infinite array of smart interconnected objects, programmed to improve an individual's vicinity in every way, usually to be used in a smart home environment. Making today's homes smart by having nearable technologies creating these devices to act intuitively depending on the needs of individuals through self learning software.

First examples of nearables were objects tagged with Bluetooth Smart beacons supporting accelerometer and temperature sensor and broadcasting their signal in the range of approximately 50 meters. They can communicate with mobile applications installed on devices with [[Bluetooth 4.0]], compatible with Bluetooth Smart protocol on the software side. At the moment of their launch, it included mainly [[iOS 7]] and high-end [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile devices.

== Use cases ==

To create a nearable, one must attach an electronic device, working as both a sensor and a transmitter, to an object. Since the only limitation is the size of the device, both items and living beings can act as nearables. The most often cited examples, however, include retail and [[home automation]] environments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Ainsley|title=What Are "Nearables," And Why Is Ideo So Excited About Them?|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034830/ideo-thinks-estimotes-bluetooth-nearables-could-be-a-game-changer <!-- |website=http://www.fastcodesign.com/ --><!-- Note I commented out the |website= because they are throwing an alert on the article for External link in |website= (help) on each citation and I believe this was just cited improperly but I don't want to remove an editor's work if I am wrong --> |publisher=Fast Company}}</ref>
