'''Nearables''' (also '''nearable technology''') are [[smart objects]] – everyday items with small, wireless computing devices attached to them. Those devices can be equipped with a variety of sensors and work as transmitters to broadcast digital data, usually using [[Bluetooth Smart]] protocol. Thanks to that, those objects are able to provide mobile devices in range with information about their location, state and immediate surroundings. The word ‘nearables’ is a reference to [[wearable technology]] - electronic devices worn as part of clothing or jewellery.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt|title=Wearables has become a household name.

== History ==

Nearables are a further development of the [[Internet of Things]] (also referred to as Internet of Everything). It’s a vision of a wide, global network of interconnected devices, using the existing Internet infrastructure to provide advanced services beyond standard [[Machine to machine|machine-to-machine communications]]. Although the term Internet of Things was coined by [[Kevin Ashton]] in 1999,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashton|first1=Kevin|title=That 'Internet of Things' Thing|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986 <!-- |website=http://www.rfidjournal.com/ --><!-- Note I commented out the |website= because they are throwing an alert on the article for External link in |website= (help) on each citation and I believe this was just cited improperly but I don't want to remove an editor's work if I am wrong --><!-- Note I commented out the |website= because they are throwing an alert on the article for External link in |website= (help) on each citation and I believe this was just cited improperly but I don't want to remove an editor's work if I am wrong --><!-- Note I commented out the |website= because they are throwing an alert on the article for External link in |website= (help) on each citation and I believe this was just cited improperly but I don't want to remove an editor's work if I am wrong -->|publisher=RFID Journal|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref> the idea can be traced to late 1980s, when [[Mark Weiser]] introduced the idea of [[ubiquitous computing]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Mark|title=The Computer for the 21st Century|journal=Scientific American|date=September 1991|issue=September 1991|pages=94–104|url=http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/pca/_files/weiser-orig.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116133741/http://wiki.daimi.au.dk/pca/_files/weiser-orig.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-11-16|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

In 1990s location-based services started emerging, thanks to wide adoption of mobile phones and development of location and proximity-based technologies, such as [[GPS]] and [[RFID]]. This, in turn, led to first attempts at wireless [[proximity marketing]] in 2000s with early version of [[Bluetooth]], [[Near field communication|NFC]] and [[Wi-Fi]] standards as predominant technologies. However, it was not until 2013, when [[Apple Inc.]] announced the [[iBeacon]] protocol for Bluetooth Smart-enabled devices, that the idea of creating smart objects by attaching wireless beacons to them really started gaining traction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gottipati|first1=Hari|title=With iBeacon, Apple is going to dump on NFC and embrace the internet of things|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/09/10/with-ibeacon-apple-is-going-to-dump-on-nfc-and-embrace-the-internet-of-things/ <!-- |website=http://gigaom.com/ -->|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014 Estimote Inc. launched Estimote Stickers: a new generation of small Bluetooth Smart-based beacons. The term ‘nearables’ was inspired by wearable computers which were gaining increasing popularity throughout 2013 and 2014 thanks to products like [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] smartwatch and [[Google Glass]]. Originally, the nearables were described as ''smart, connected objects that broadcast data about their location, motion and temperature''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nearables are here: introducing Estimote Stickers|url=http://blog.estimote.com/post/95382199590/nearables-are-here-introducing-estimote-stickers|website=blog.estimote.com|publisher=Estimote|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

== Technology ==

In its first interpretation Nearables are not devices themselves. Any object (or a live being, like a human or animal) can become a nearable after a wireless, electronic sensor is attached to it and starts broadcasting data to nearby mobile devices. Due to continued miniaturization of sensor technology, a single transmitter could be equipped with a whole set of these, for example: [[accelerometer]], [[thermometer]], [[ambient light sensor]], [[humidity]] sensor or [[magnetometer]]. In the second interpretation the actual nearable devices can be part of an infinite array of smart interconnected objects, programmed to improve an individual's vicinity in every way, usually to be used in a smart home environment. Making today's homes smart by having nearable technologies creating these devices to act intuitively depending on the needs of individuals through self learning software.

First examples of nearables were objects tagged with Bluetooth Smart beacons supporting accelerometer and temperature sensor and broadcasting their signal in range of approximately 50 meters. They can communicate with mobile applications installed on devices with [[Bluetooth 4.0]], compatible with Bluetooth Smart protocol on the software side. At the moment of their launch, it included mainly [[iOS 7]] and high-end [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile devices.

== Use cases ==

To create a nearable, one must attach an electronic device, working as both sensor and a transmitter, to an object. Since the only limitation is the size of the device, both items and living beings can act as nearables. The most often cited examples, however, include retail and [[home automation]] environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Ainsley|title=What Are "Nearables," And Why Is Ideo So Excited About Them?|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034830/ideo-thinks-estimotes-bluetooth-nearables-could-be-a-game-changer <!-- |website=http://www.fastcodesign.com/ --><!-- Note I commented out the |website= because they are throwing an alert on the article for External link in |website= (help) on each citation and I believe this was just cited improperly but I don't want to remove an editor's work if I am wrong --> |publisher=Fast Company}}</ref>
