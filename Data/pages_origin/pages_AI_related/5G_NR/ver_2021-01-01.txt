{{short description|radio access technology}}
'''5G NR''' ('''New Radio''') is a new [[radio access technology]] (RAT) developed by [[3GPP]] for the [[5G]] (fifth generation) mobile network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|title=What is 5G New Radio (5G NR)|website=5g.co.uk}}</ref> It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|title=Making 5G New Radio (NR) a Reality – The Global 5G Standard - IEEE Communications Society|website=comsoc.org}}</ref>

The 3GPP specification 38 series<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/38-series.htm|title=3GPP specification series: 38series|website=www.3gpp.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> provides the technical details behind NR, the RAT beyond [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]].

Study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015, and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017. While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing, industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard, with the expectation that the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR would occur in 2019.

== Frequency bands ==
{{main|5G NR frequency bands}}
5G NR uses two frequency ranges:<ref>[http://www.sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_FR_Bandwidth.html 5G/NR - FR/Operating Bandwidth]</ref>
# Frequency Range 1 (FR1), including sub-6&nbsp;GHz frequency bands
# Frequency Range 2 (FR2), including frequency bands in the [[mmWave]] range (24–100GHz)

== Network deployments ==
{{main|List of 5G NR networks}}
[[Ooredoo]] was the first carrier to launch a commercial 5G NR network, in May 2018 in [[Qatar]].  Other carriers around the world have been following suit.

== Development ==
In 2018, [[3GPP]] published [[3GPP#Standards|Release 15]], which includes what is described as "Phase 1" standardization for 5G NR. The timeline for Release 16, which will be "5G phase 2", follows a freeze date of March 2020 and a completion date of June 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/release-16|title=Release 16|website=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> Release 17 is scheduled for delivery in September 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/release-17|title=Release 17|website=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

==Deployment modes==
Initial 5G NR launches will depend on existing 4G LTE infrastructure in non-standalone (NSA) mode, before maturation of the standalone (SA) mode with the 5G core network.  Additionally, the spectrum can be dynamically shared between 4G LTE and 5G NR.

===Non-standalone mode===
The non-standalone (NSA) mode of 5G NR refers to an option of 5G NR deployment that depends on the control plane of an existing 4G LTE network for control functions, while 5G NR is exclusively focused on the user plane.<ref name=SANSA>{{cite web|url=http://rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-NR-deployment-scenarios-or-modes.html|title=5G NR Deployment Scenarios or modes-NSA,SA,Homogeneous,Heterogeneous|website=rfwireless-world.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Junko Yoshida |url=https://eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1331434 |title=What's Behind 'Non-Standalone' 5G? |publisher=Eetimes.com |access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> This is reported to speed up 5G adoption, however some operators and vendors have criticized prioritizing the introduction of 5G NR NSA on the grounds that it could hinder the implementation of the standalone mode of the network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://res-www.zte.com.cn/mediares/zte/Files/PDF/white_book/5g-best-choice-architecture.pdf|title=5G best choice architecture|last=Teral|first=Stephane|date=2019-01-30|website=ZTE|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lightreading.com/mobile/5g/3gpp-approves-plans-to-fast-track-5g-nr/d/d-id/731018|title=3GPP Approves Plans to Fast Track 5G NR - Light Reading}}</ref>

=== Dynamic spectrum sharing ===
In order to make better use of existing assets, carriers may opt to dynamically share it between 4G LTE and 5G NR.  The spectrum is multiplexed over time between both generations of mobile networks, while still using the 4G LTE network for control functions, depending on user demand.  Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) may be deployed on existing 4G LTE equipment as long as it is compatible with 5G NR.  Only the 5G NR terminal needs to be compatible with DSS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/networks/offerings/5g/sharing-spectrum-with-ericsson-spectrum-sharing|title=Spectrum sharing for fast & smooth 5G deployment|website=Ericsson|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>

===Standalone mode===
The standalone (SA) mode of 5G NR refers to using 5G cells for both signalling and information transfer.<ref name=SANSA /> It includes the new [[5G Packet Core]] architecture instead of relying on the 4G [[Evolved Packet Core]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lightreading.com/mobile/5g/standalone-or-non-standalone-5g-trials-will-help-orange-decide/d/d-id/744057|title=Standalone or Non-Standalone? 5G Trials Will Help Orange Decide - Light Reading}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/asr_5000/21-5_N5-8/5G-NSA/21-5-5G-NSA-Solution-Guide/21-5-5G-NSA-Solutions-Guide_chapter_01.pdf|title=5G Non Standalone Solution Overview}}</ref> to allow the deployment of 5G without the LTE network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lightreading.com/mobile/5g/defining-ng-core-for-5g-networks/a/d-id/730633|title=Defining NG Core for 5G Networks - Light Reading}}</ref> It is expected to have lower cost, better efficiency, and to assist development of new use cases.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediatek.com/blog/5g-what-is-standalone-sa-vs-non-standalone-nsa|title=5G: What is Standalone (SA) vs Non-Standalone (NSA) Networks?|date=12 November 2018|website=MediaTek}}</ref>

== Numerology (sub-carrier spacing) for New Radio ==
NR supports five sub-carrier spacings:

{| class="wikitable"
! Sub-Carrier Spacing
! Slot duration
! Comment
! Frequency Bands
|-
| 15&nbsp;kHz
| 1 millisecond
| Same as LTE

| Available in FR1
|-
| 30&nbsp;kHz
| 0.5 millisecond
| 
| Available in FR1
|-
| 60&nbsp;kHz
| 0.25 millisecond
| Both normal Cyclic Prefix (CP) and extended CP may be used with 60&nbsp;kHz sub-carrier spacing
| Available in both FR1 and FR2
|-
| 120&nbsp;kHz
| 0.125 millisecond
| This is the highest sub-carrier spacing for the path of data
| Available in FR2
|-
| 240&nbsp;kHz
| 0.0625 millisecond
| This is only possible for search and measurement purposes, using the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB)
| Available in FR2
|}

The length of CP is inversely proportional to the sub-carrier spacing. It is 4.7 micro-second with 15&nbsp;kHz, and 4.7 / 16 = 0.29 micro-second for 240&nbsp;kHz sub-carrier spacing.
