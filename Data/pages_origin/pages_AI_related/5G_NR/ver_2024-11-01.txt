{{Short description|Radio access technology for 5G networks}}

'''5G NR''' ('''New Radio''')<ref name=":1" /> is a [[radio access technology]] (RAT) developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project ([[3GPP]]) for the [[5G]] (fifth generation) mobile network.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|title=What is 5G New Radio (5G ,)|website=5g.co.uk}}</ref> It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|title=Making 5G New Radio (NR) a Reality – The Global 5G Standard - IEEE Communications Society|website=comsoc.org}}</ref> It is based on [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), as is the [[4G]] (fourth generation) long-term evolution ([[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) standard.

The 3GPP specification 38 series<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/38-series.htm|title=3GPP specification series: 38series|website=www.3gpp.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> provides the technical details behind 5G NR, the successor of LTE.

The study of NR within 3GPP started in 2015, and the first specification was made available by the end of 2017.  While the 3GPP standardization process was ongoing, the industry had already begun efforts to implement infrastructure compliant with the draft standard, with the first large-scale commercial launch of 5G NR having occurred in the end of 2018.  Since 2019, many operators have deployed 5G NR networks and handset manufacturers have developed 5G NR enabled handsets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Mixed Picture for 5G in Europe |url=https://www.gsma.com/get-involved/gsma-membership/gsma_resources/the-mixed-picture-for-5g-in-europe/ |access-date=2023-12-07 |website=Membership |language=en-US}}</ref>

{{main|5G NR frequency bands}}

5G NR uses frequency bands in two broad frequency ranges:
# Frequency Range 1 (FR1), for bands within {{formatnum:410}}&nbsp;MHz – {{formatnum:7125}}&nbsp;MHz
# Frequency Range 2 (FR2), for bands within {{formatnum:24250}}&nbsp;MHz – {{formatnum:71000}}&nbsp;MHz

== Network deployments ==
{{main|List of 5G NR networks}}
[[Ooredoo]] was the first carrier to launch a commercial 5G NR network, in May 2018 in [[Qatar]].  Other carriers around the world have been following suit.

== Development ==
In 2018, [[3GPP]] published [[3GPP#Standards|Release 15]], which includes what is described as "Phase 1" Pavilash standardization for 5G NR. The timeline for Release 16, which will be "5G phase 2", follows a freeze date of March 2020 and a completion date of June 2020,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Release 16|url=https://www.3gpp.org/release-16|access-date=2020-01-06|website=3GPP}}</ref> Release 17 was originally scheduled for delivery in September 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Release 17|url=https://www.3gpp.org/release-17|access-date=2020-01-06|website=3GPP}}</ref> but, because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was rescheduled for June 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=Release 17 timeline agreed |url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/2145-rel-17_newtimeline |website=3GPP}}</ref>

Release 18 work has started in 3GPP. Rel.18 is referred to as "NR Advanced" signifying another milestone in wireless communication systems. NR Advanced will include features such as eXtended Reality (XR), AI/ML studies, and Mobility enhancements. Mobility is in the core of 3GPP technology and has so far been handled on Layer 3 (RRC), now, in Rel-18 the work on mobility is to introduce lower layer triggered mobility.

==Deployment modes==
Initial 5G NR launches will depend on existing 4G LTE infrastructure in non-standalone (NSA) mode, before maturation of the standalone (SA) mode with the 5G core network.  Additionally, the spectrum can be dynamically shared between 4G LTE and 5G NR.

=== Dynamic spectrum sharing ===
To make better use of existing assets, carriers may opt to dynamically share it between 4G LTE and 5G NR.  The spectrum is multiplexed over time between both generations of mobile networks, while still using the 4G LTE network for control functions, depending on user demand.  Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) may be deployed on existing 4G LTE equipment as long as it is compatible with 5G NR.  Only the 5G NR terminal needs to be compatible with DSS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/networks/offerings/5g/sharing-spectrum-with-ericsson-spectrum-sharing|title=Spectrum sharing for fast & smooth 5G deployment|website=Ericsson|date=18 March 2019 |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>

===Non-standalone mode===
The non-standalone (NSA) mode of 5G NR refers to an option of 5G NR deployment that depends on the control plane of an existing 4G LTE network for control functions, while 5G NR is exclusively focused on the user plane.<ref name=SANSA>{{cite web|url=http://rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-NR-deployment-scenarios-or-modes.html|title=5G NR Deployment Scenarios or modes-NSA, SA, Homogeneous, Heterogeneous|website=rfwireless-world.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Junko Yoshida |url=https://eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1331434 |title=What's Behind 'Non-Standalone' 5G? | date=3 March 2017 |publisher=Eetimes.com |access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref> This is reported to speed up 5G adoption, however some operators and vendors have criticized prioritizing the introduction of 5G NR NSA on the grounds that it could hinder the implementation of the standalone mode of the network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://res-www.zte.com.cn/mediares/zte/Files/PDF/white_book/5g-best-choice-architecture.pdf|title=5G best choice architecture|last=Teral|first=Stephane|date=2019-01-30|website=ZTE|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lightreading.com/mobile/5g/3gpp-approves-plans-to-fast-track-5g-nr/d/d-id/731018|title=3GPP Approves Plans to Fast Track 5G NR - Light Reading}}</ref> It uses the same core network as a 4G network, but with upgraded radio equipment.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2021-09-07 |title=Standalone 5G vs. Non-Standalone 5G |url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20210907/5g/standalone-5g-vs-non-standalone-5g |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=RCR Wireless News |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2023-04-04 |title=5G Standalone vs. 5G Non-standalone: What's in it for operators? |url=https://www.rcrwireless.com/20230404/5g/5g-standalone-vs-5g-non-standalone-whats-in-it-for-operators |access-date=2024-04-04 |website=RCR Wireless News |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Numerology (sub-carrier spacing) ==
{{update section|date=June 2024}}
5G NR supports seven subcarrier spacings:

{| class="sortable wikitable"
! data-sort-type="number" | Sub-Carrier Spacing <small>(kHz)</small>
! data-sort-type="number" | <abbr title="The duration of a timeslice allocated to a certain endpoint">Slot duration <small>(ms)</small></abbr>
! class="unsortable" | Frequency Bands
! class="unsortable" | Notes
|-
| 15
| 1
| FR1
| Same as LTE
|-
| 30
| 0.5
| FR1
| 
|-
| 60
| 0.25
| FR1 and FR2
| Both normal [[cyclic prefix]] (CP) and extended CP may be used with 60&nbsp;kHz subcarrier spacing
|-
| 120
| 0.125
| FR2
| 
|-
| 240
| 0.0625
| FR2
| This is only possible for search and measurement purposes, using the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB)
|-
| 480
| 0.03125
| FR2
|
|-
| 960
| 0.01565
| FR2
|
|}

The length of the [[cyclic prefix]] is inversely proportional to the [[subcarrier spacing]]. It is 4.7&nbsp;μs with 15&nbsp;kHz, and 4.7 / 16 = 0.29&nbsp;μs for 240&nbsp;kHz subcarrier spacing. Additionally, higher subcarrier spacings allow for reduced latency and increased support for high-frequency bands, essential for the ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) applications in 5G.
