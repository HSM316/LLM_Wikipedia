An '''issue tree''', also called '''logic tree''', is a graphical breakdown of a question that dissects it into its different components vertically and that progresses into details as it reads to the right.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=2016 |title=Strategic thinking in complex problem solving |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780190463908 |oclc=940455195 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190463908.001.0001 }}</ref>{{rp|47}}

Issue trees are useful in [[problem solving]] to identify the root causes of a problem as well as to identify its potential solutions. They also provide a reference point to see how each piece fits into the whole picture of a problem.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 2004 |title=Strategy survival guide: Issue trees |url=http://interactive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/survivalguide/skills/s_issue.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217163843/http://interactive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/strategy/survivalguide/skills/s_issue.htm |website=interactive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk |location=London |publisher=Prime Minister's Strategy Unit |archive-date=2012-02-17 |access-date=2018-10-06 }} Also available in [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060213205515/http://strategy.gov.uk/downloads/survivalguide/downloads/ssg_v2.1.pdf PDF format].</ref>

==Types==
According to professor of strategy Arnaud Chevallier, elaborating an approach used at [[McKinsey & Company]],<ref>Chevallier's writings (such as {{harvnb|Chevallier|2010a}} and {{harvnb|Chevallier|2016|pp=243, 265}}) cite an earlier McKinsey publication that discusses issue maps among other problem-solving techniques: {{cite tech report |last1=Davis |first1=Ian |last2=Keeling |first2=David |last3=Schreier |first3=Paul |last4=Williams |first4=Ashley |date=August 2007 |title=The McKinsey approach to problem solving |type=McKinsey Staff Paper 66 |location=New York |institution=[[McKinsey & Company]] |pages=9–13 }} Other earlier McKinsey-related publications discuss issue trees too, such as: {{cite book |last1=Rasiel |first1=Ethan M. |last2=Friga |first2=Paul N. |date=2002 |title=The McKinsey mind: understanding and implementing the problem-solving tools and management techniques of the world's top strategic consulting firm |series=McKinsey trilogy |volume=2 |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0071374299 |oclc=47092065 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mckinseymindunde00rasi_0/page/11 11–29] |url=https://archive.org/details/mckinseymindunde00rasi_0/page/11 }}</ref> there are two types of issue trees: diagnostic ones and solution ones.<ref name="Chevallier 2010"/> Diagnostic trees break down a "why" key question, identifying all the possible root causes for the problem. Solution trees break down a "how" key question, identifying all the possible alternatives to fix the problem.<ref>See also the how–why diagrams in: {{cite book |last1=Culmsee |first1=Paul |last2=Awati |first2=Kailash |date=2013 |orig-year=2011 |chapter=Visualising complexity |title=The Heretic's Guide to Best Practices: the reality of managing complex problems in organisations |location=Bloomington |publisher=iUniverse, Inc. |isbn=9781462058549 |oclc=767703320 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CUgasLvgvdEC&pg=PA159 159–167] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUgasLvgvdEC&pg=PA159 }}</ref>

==Rules==
Four basic rules can help ensure that issue trees are optimal, according to Chevallier:<ref name="Chevallier 2010">{{cite web |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=2 July 2010a |title=Build issue trees: diagnosis trees and solution trees |url=https://powerful-problem-solving.com/build-issue-trees/ |website=powerful-problem-solving.com |access-date=2018-10-06 }} See also: {{cite web |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=14 December 2010 |title=Be insightful |url=https://powerful-problem-solving.com/be-insightful/ |website=powerful-problem-solving.com |access-date=2018-10-06 }}</ref>
# Consistently answer a "why" or a "how" question
# Progress from the key question to the analysis as it moves to the right
# Have branches that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive ([[MECE]])
# Use an insightful breakdown

The requirement for issue trees to be collectively exhaustive implies that [[divergent thinking]] is a critical skill.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=6 July 2010b |title=Diverge effectively in your thinking |url=https://powerful-problem-solving.com/diverge-effectively-in-your-thinking/ |website=powerful-problem-solving.com |access-date=2018-10-06 }}</ref>

==Applications==

===In management interviews===
Issue trees are used to answer questions in case interviews for management consulting positions.<ref name="Cheng">{{cite book |last=Cheng |first=Victor |date=2012 |chapter=The issue tree |title=Case interview secrets: a former McKinsey interviewer reveals how to get multiple job offers in consulting |location=Seattle, WA |publisher=Innovation Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/caseinterviewsec0000chen/page/73 73–102] |isbn=9780984183524 |oclc=803397971|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/caseinterviewsec0000chen/page/73|chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref> A quantitative type of question, the [[Market analysis#Market size|market sizing]] question, requires the interviewee to estimate the size of a data group such as a specific segment of a population, an amount of objects, a company's revenues, or similar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Market sizing |url=https://www.gradinterviewprep.com/market-sizing |website=gradinterviewprep.com |access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> The candidates are expected to use a structured and logical method of arriving at their answer, and using an issue tree provides a diagram to aid the candidate's logical reasoning. Issue trees are used for other types of case interview questions as well.<ref name="Cheng"/>
