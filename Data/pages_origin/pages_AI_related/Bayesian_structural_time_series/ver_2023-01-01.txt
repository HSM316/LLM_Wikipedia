'''Bayesian structural time series''' ('''BSTS''') model is a [[statistical]] technique used for [[feature selection]], time series forecasting, [[Nowcasting (economics)|nowcasting]], inferring causal impact and other applications. The model is designed to work with [[time series]] data.

The model has also promising application in the field of analytical [[marketing]]. In particular, it can be used in order to assess how much different marketing campaigns have contributed to the change in web search volumes, product sales, brand popularity and other relevant indicators. [[Difference in differences|Difference-in-differences]] models<ref name=":0" /> and [[interrupted time series]] designs<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insightsassociation.org/issues-policies/glossary/interrupted-time-series-design |website=Interrupted Time-Series Design |title= Interrupted Time-Series Design|publisher=Insights Association |accessdate=21 March 2019}}</ref> are alternatives to this approach. "In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates, i.e., synthetic controls."<ref name=":0" />

== General model description ==
The model consists of three main components:
# '''[[Kalman filter]]'''. The technique for time series decomposition. In this step, a researcher can add different state variables: trend, seasonality, regression, and others.
# '''[[Spike-and-slab variable selection|Spike-and-slab]] method.''' In this step, the most important regression predictors are selected.
# '''[[Ensemble learning|Bayesian model averaging]].''' Combining the results and prediction calculation.
The model could be used to discover the causations with its counterfactual prediction and the observed data.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41854.html|title=Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models|website=research.google.com|access-date=2016-04-17}}</ref>

A possible drawback of the model can be its relatively complicated mathematical underpinning and difficult implementation as a computer program. However, the programming language [[R (programming language)|R]] has ready-to-use packages for calculating the BSTS model,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf|title=bsts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html|title=CausalImpact|website=google.github.io|access-date=2016-04-17}}</ref> which do not require strong mathematical background from a researcher.
