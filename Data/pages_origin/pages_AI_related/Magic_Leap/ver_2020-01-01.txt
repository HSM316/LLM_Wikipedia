According to past versions of its website, the startup evolved from a company named "Magic Leap Studios" which around 2010 was working on a graphic novel and a feature film series, and in 2011 became a corporation, releasing an augmented reality app at Comic-Con that year.<ref name=":0" />

A November 2014 analysis by [[Gizmodo]], based on job listings, trademark registrations and patent applications from Magic Leap, concluded that the company appears to aim at building "a [[Google Glass]] on steroids that can seamlessly blend computer-generated graphics with the real world".<ref name=":0" /> It has also been compared to [[Microsoft HoloLens]].<ref name=":1" />

Before Magic Leap, a head-mounted display using light field had been demonstrated by [[Nvidia]] in 2013, and the [[MIT Media Lab]] has also constructed a 3D display using "compressed light fields"; however, Magic Leap asserts that it achieves better resolution with a new proprietary technique that projects an image directly onto the user's retina.<ref name=":2" /> According to a researcher who studied the company's patents, Magic Leap is likely to use stacked silicon [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguides]].<ref name=":3" />

On March 19, 2015 Magic Leap released a demo video titled "Just another day in the office at Magic Leap". The video includes augmented reality gaming and productivity applications but it was unclear if the video was actual footage using their technology or a simulated experience.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Magic Leap’s Video Of Seamless Augmented Reality Office Game Play|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/19/watch-magic-leaps-video-of-seamless-augmented-reality-office-game-play/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-10-21|first = Darrell|last = Etherington}}</ref>

On October 20, 2015 Magic Leap released actual footage of their product. While still not showing any hardware, the footage claims that it was filmed through a Magic Leap device without the use of special effects or compositing. The video suggests that virtual 3D objects can be occluded by real objects, which may be predefined geometry in the scene, but led to speculation about 3D spatial mapping being used. It also shows virtual lights reflecting from a real table, which seem to be incorrectly placed in space, and therefore may suggest that the reflections are part of the virtual scene without interacting with the real world (similarly to "fake" shadows in early video games). The video showcases only quite bright objects superimposed over dark areas of the real world. This suggests that the hardware can only add new light without blocking incoming light from the real world. This would allow it to render only fully transparent objects which emit or reflect light, and may not allow virtual objects to occlude real objects. This would work well for bright virtual objects in front of dark real backgrounds as in the video, but not for dark virtual objects in front of brighter real backgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stunning Magic Leap demo is as real as augmented reality gets - CNET|url = http://www.cnet.com/news/magic-leap-shows-demo-video/|website = CNET|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}</ref>

On December 9, 2015, ''Forbes'' reported on documents filed in the state of Delaware, indicating a [[Series C round|Series C]] funding round of $827m.
