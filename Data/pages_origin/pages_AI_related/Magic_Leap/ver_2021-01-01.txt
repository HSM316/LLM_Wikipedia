==History==
[[File:Magic Leap No - 2.jpg|thumb|Magic Leap One headset]]

=== 2010–2014: Founding and secrecy ===
Magic Leap was founded by [[Rony Abovitz]] in 2010.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/science/taking-real-life-sickness-out-of-virtual-reality.html|title = Real-Life Illness in a Virtual World|last = Markoff|first = John|date = July 14, 2014|work = New York Times}}</ref> According to past versions of its website, the startup evolved from a company named "Magic Leap Studios" which around 2010 was working on a graphic novel and a feature film series, and in 2011 became a corporation, releasing an augmented reality app at Comic-Con that year.<ref name=":0" /> In October 2014, when the company was still operating in [[stealth mode]] (but already reported to be working on projects relating to [[augmented reality]] and [[computer vision]]), it raised more than $540 million of venture funding from [[Google]],<ref>The company, not its investment arm [[Google Ventures]]</ref> [[Qualcomm]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]] and [[Kleiner Perkins]], among other investors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3037345/fast-feed/so-bad-ass-you-cant-believe-it-magic-leap-raises-542-million-to-launch-the-future-|publisher=Fast Company|title=So Badass You Can't Believe It|author=David Lidsky|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Times|title=Google Invests Heavily in Magic Leap's Effort to Blend Illusion and Reality|author=David Gelles and Michael J. de la Merced|date=October 21, 2014|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/google-invests-in-magic-leap-an-augmented-reality-firm/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0}}</ref>

A November 2014 analysis by [[Gizmodo]], based on job listings, trademark registrations and patent applications from Magic Leap, concluded that the company appeared to be building a competitor to the [[Google Glass]] and [[Oculus Rift]] that would "blend computer-generated graphics with the real world".<ref name=":0" /> It had also been compared to [[Microsoft HoloLens]].<ref name=":1" />

Before Magic Leap, a head-mounted display using light field had been demonstrated by [[Nvidia]] in 2013, and the [[MIT Media Lab]] has also constructed a 3D display using "compressed light fields"; however, Magic Leap asserts that it achieves better resolution with a new proprietary technique that projects an image directly onto the user's retina.<ref name=":2" /> According to a researcher who studied the company's patents, Magic Leap is likely to use stacked silicon [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguides]].<ref name=":3" />

[[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] of special effects company [[Weta Workshop]] is involved in Magic Leap alongside Abovitz.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url = https://gizmodo.com/how-magic-leap-is-secretly-creating-a-new-alternate-rea-1660441103|title = How Magic Leap Is Secretly Creating a New Alternate Reality|last = Hollister|first = Sean|date = November 19, 2014|work = [[Gizmodo]]}}</ref> Science fiction author [[Neal Stephenson]] joined the company in December 2014.<ref name=":1" /> [[Graeme Devine]] is their Chief Creative Officer & Senior VP Games, Apps and Creative Experiences.<ref>{{cite web|last1=EmTech Digital|first1=MIT Technology Review|title=10 Breakthrough Technologies 2015 - Magic Leap|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/emtech/digital/15/video/watch/magic-leap-virtual-reality/|publisher=MIT Technology Review|access-date=June 9, 2015}}</ref>

=== 2015–2018: Product teases and reveal ===
On March 19, 2015, Magic Leap released a demo video titled "Just another day in the office at Magic Leap". The video includes augmented reality gaming and productivity applications but it was unclear if the video was actual footage using their technology or a simulated experience.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Magic Leap's Video Of Seamless Augmented Reality Office Game Play|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/19/watch-magic-leaps-video-of-seamless-augmented-reality-office-game-play/|website = TechCrunch|access-date = October 21, 2015|first = Darrell|last = Etherington}}</ref>

On October 20, 2015, Magic Leap released actual footage of their product. While still not showing any hardware, the footage claims that it was filmed through a Magic Leap device without the use of special effects or compositing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stunning Magic Leap demo is as real as augmented reality gets - CNET|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/magic-leap-shows-demo-video/|website=CNET|access-date=October 21, 2015}}</ref> The video suggests that virtual 3D objects can be occluded by real objects, which may be predefined geometry in the scene but led to speculation about 3D spatial mapping being used.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} It also shows virtual lights reflecting from a real table, which seem to be incorrectly placed in space, and therefore may suggest that the reflections are part of the virtual scene without interacting with the real world (similarly to "fake" shadows in early video games).{{According to whom|date=May 2020}} The video showcases only quite bright objects superimposed over dark areas of the real world. This suggests that the hardware can only add new light without blocking incoming light from the real world. This would allow it to render only fully transparent objects which emit or reflect light, and may not allow virtual objects to occlude real objects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

On December 9, 2015, ''Forbes'' reported on documents filed in the state of Delaware, indicating a [[Series C round|Series C]] funding round of $827m.

On June 16, 2016, Magic Leap announced a partnership with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] and its ILMxLAB R&D unit. The two companies would form a joint research lab at Lucasfilm's San Francisco campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/star-wars-lucasfilm-augmented-reality-magic-leap-1201796871/|title=Lucasfilm Developing 'Star Wars' Augmented-Reality Content Under Pact With Magic Leap (VIDEO)|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=June 16, 2016|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref>

In December 2017, UK technology news site ''[[The Register]]'' described Magic Leap as a [[vaporware]] company that "has received nearly $2bn in funding over four years, values itself at $6bn, and has yet to produce anything but fake technology".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/20/magic_leap/|title=Magic Leap blows our mind with its incredible technology... that still doesn't f**king exist|first=Kieren McCarthy in San Francisco December 20, 2017|last=at 21:35|website=www.theregister.co.uk}}</ref>

In June 2018, the company's first headset, called the Magic Leap One, was showcased for the first time online, only showcasing the device visually but performing no demonstration of its functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/magic-leap-is-ready-to-talk-more-about-its-ar-headset/|title=What we just learned about the Magic Leap One's hardware|first=Scott|last=Stein|website=CNET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=At last: Magic Leap reveals its revolutionary techno-goggles – but wait, there's a catch|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/06/magic_leap_revealed/|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=June 6, 2018|website=www.theregister.co.uk}}</ref>

On July 1, 2018, the device was finally demoed, confirming its use of NVIDIA TX2 hardware.
