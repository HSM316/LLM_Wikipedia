'''''Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment''''' is a 2013 book written by Amnon H. Eden, [[James H. Moor]], Johnny H. Soraker, and Eric Steinhart. It focuses on conjectures about the [[intelligence explosion]], [[transhumanism]], and [[whole brain emulation]].

The book features essays and commentary on the [[technological singularity]]. One version of the hypothesis explored in the book states that humans will one day make an intelligent agent that will enter runaway self-improvement cycles, with each new version appearing more rapidly, causing an intelligence explosion and resulting in an intelligence that will far surpass us.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Singularity hypotheses.
