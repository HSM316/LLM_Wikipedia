The '''Australian Centre for Robotic Vision''', formerly '''Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision''' or '''ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision''', is an unincorporated collaborative venture with funding of {{AUD|25.6m}} over seven years to pursue a research agenda tackling the critical and complex challenge of applying [[robotics]] in the real world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roboticvision.org/what-we-do/about-us/|title=Robotic Vision {{!}} About Us|website=roboticvision.org|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

The centre won the 2017 [[Amazon Robotics]] Challenge with their robot Cartman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40774385|title=Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017 won by Australian|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2017|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>

==History==
The centre was funded in 2014 by the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC), to conduct research in [[robotic vision]] and to increase research capacity, train researchers and to engage with the wider community to help people learn about robotics, vision and [[computer programming|coding]].<ref name=about>{{cite web | title=Our Centre | website=Australian Centre for Robotic Vision | date=8 April 2020 | url=https://www.roboticvision.org/about/our-centre/ | access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>

A former collaborator was [[Data61]]<ref>[http://www.data61.csiro.au Data61]</ref> (previously known as [[NICTA]] or National ICT Australia Ltd).

== Research organisations ==
The centre is made up of an interdisciplinary team from four Australian universities:<ref name=about/>
* [[Queensland University of Technology]] (QUT),
* The [[University of Adelaide]] (UoA),
* The [[Australian National University]] (ANU),
* [[Monash University]], and
And international universities:<ref name=about/>
* [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation|INRIA]] Rennes Bretagne,
* [[Georgia Institute of Technology]],
* [[Imperial College London]],
* The [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]], 
* The [[University of Oxford]], and
*[[University of Toronto]]

== Goals ==
The centre aims to achieve breakthrough science and technology in robotic vision by addressing four key research objectives: robust vision, vision and action, semantic vision, and algorithms and architecture. Together the four research objectives form the centre's research themes, which serve as organisational groupings of the centre's research projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roboticvision.org/what-we-do/research/|title=Robotic Vision {{!}} Research|website=roboticvision.org|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

=== Robust vision ===

Will develop new sensing technologies and robust [[algorithm]]s that allow robots to use visual perception in all viewing conditions: night and day, rain or shine, summer or winter, fast moving or static.

=== Vision and action ===

Will create new theory and methods for using image data for control of robotic systems that navigate through space, grasp objects, interact with humans and use motion to assist in seeing.

=== Semantic vision ===

Will produce novel learning algorithms that can both detect and recognise a large, and potentially ever increasing, number of object classes from robotically acquired images, with increasing reliability over time.

=== Algorithms and architectures ===

Will create novel technologies and techniques to ensure that the algorithms developed across the themes can be run in real-time on robotic systems deployed in large-scale real-world applications.
