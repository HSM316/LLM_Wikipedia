The '''Australian Centre for Robotic Vision''' is an unincorporated collaborative venture with funding of $25.6m over seven years to pursue a research agenda tackling the critical and complex challenge of applying [[robotics]] in the real world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roboticvision.org/what-we-do/about-us/|title=Robotic Vision {{!}}   About Us|website=roboticvision.org|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

The Centre won the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge with their robot Cartman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40774385|title=Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017 won by Australian|website=bbc.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>

== Research organisations ==
The Center is made up of an interdisciplinary team from four Australian universities:
* [[Queensland University of Technology]] (QUT),
* The [[University of Adelaide]] (UoA),
* The [[Australian National University]] (ANU),
* [[Monash University]], and
research organisations and international universities
* [http://www.data61.csiro.au Data61] (previously known as [[NICTA]] or National ICT Australia Ltd),
* [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation|INRIA]] Rennes Bretagne,
* [[Georgia Institute of Technology]],
* [[Imperial College London]],
* The [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]], and 
* The [[University of Oxford]].

== Goals ==
The Centre aims to achieve breakthrough science and technology in robotic vision by addressing four key research objectives: robust vision, vision and action, semantic vision, and algorithms and architecture. Together the four research objectives form the Centre’s research themes, which serve as organisational groupings of the Centre’s research projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roboticvision.org/what-we-do/research/|title=Robotic Vision {{!}}   Research|website=roboticvision.org|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

=== Robust vision ===

Will develop new sensing technologies and robust [[algorithm|algorithms]] that allow robots to use visual perception in all viewing conditions: night and day, rain or shine, summer or winter, fast moving or static.

=== Vision and action ===

Will create new theory and methods for using image data for control of robotic systems that navigate through space, grasp objects, interact with humans and use motion to assist in seeing.

=== Semantic vision ===

Will produce novel learning algorithms that can both detect and recognise a large, and potentially ever increasing, number of object classes from robotically acquired images, with increasing reliability over time.

=== Algorithms and architectures ===

Will create novel technologies and techniques to ensure that the algorithms developed across the themes can be run in real-time on robotic systems deployed in large-scale real-world applications.
