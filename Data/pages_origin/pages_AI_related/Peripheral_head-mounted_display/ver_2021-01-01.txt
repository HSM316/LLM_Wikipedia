A '''Peripheral Head-Mounted Display (PHMD)''' describes a visual display ([[monocular]] or [[binocular vision|binocular]]) mounted to the user's head that is in the peripheral of the user's [[Field-of-View]] (FOV) / [[Peripheral Vision]]. Whereby the actual position of the mounting (as the [[display device|display technology]]) is considered to be irrelevant as long as it does not cover the entire FOV. While a PHMD provide an additional, always-available visual output channel, it does not limit the user performing real world tasks.<ref>Matthies, D.J.C., Haescher, M., Alm, R., & Urban, B. (2015). Properties of a peripheral head-mounted display (phmd). In International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (pp. 208-213). Springer.</ref>

The term PHMD includes devices such as [[Google Glass]], which are often misclassified as a [[Head-up display]] (HUD)<ref name="ref13">Starner, T. (2013). Project glass: An extension of the self. In Pervasive Computing, IEEE, 12(2), 14-16.</ref> if following the original definition by [[NASA]].<ref name="ref11">Prinzel, L., & Risser, M. Head-up displays and attention capture. In ''NASA TechnicalMemorandum'', 213000. 2004.</ref> While NASA defined this term over centuries of space flight research,<ref name="ref11"/> it actually describes a display that addresses the eyes-free problem, by absolving the user from the need to angle down their head. Furthermore, it provides augmented information in the user's forward [[Field-of-View]] (FOV), which is commonly projected on a windshield. In contrast, the Head-Down Display (HDD) is located at the instrument control panel.<ref name="ref11"/> Also, a HUD is mainly used to [[Augmented reality|augment additional information into reality]], which is technically not feasible yet for products such as [[Google Glass]] (lens focus on the display causes a blurred environment – see figure below).

This taxonomy for [[head-mounted display]]s is based on the property of its functionality and the ability of the [[human eye]] to perceive [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|peripheral information]], instead of being technology-dependent. In this article Human Factors for visual [[perception]] are being summarized, which are important to be taken into consideration when designing [[Graphical user interface|visual interfaces]] for PHMDs.

==Characteristics==

[[File:Detailed and peripheral information.png|250px|thumb|The two pictures illustrate the difference between detailed and peripheral information.]]

The most important uniqueness is that the user's [[Field-of-View|FOV]] is not being fully covered, allowing the user to perform real world tasks without limitations, while not having the pretension to raise or create [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], such as [[Head-mounted display|HMD]]s often aim for. For current display technologies, while projecting image onto the eye, the screen needs to be focused by the pupil to enable a clear reading of the screen, thus the environment becomes blurred and out-of-focus. So a PHMD such as [[Google Glass]] is capable of displaying detailed information, when the [[pupil]] is focusing the display itself, as it also allows for [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|peripheral information]] when the eye focuses on the real world. Still, simple [[information]] such as notifications are perceivable when focusing on the real world instead of the display.

==Human Factors: Visual Perception==
Research shows that designing an optimal visual output for [[Head-mounted display|Head-Mounted Displays]] is a complex issue, since there are several human factors that significantly impact users’ [[Visual perception|perception]].<ref name="ref9">Laramee, R. S., & Ware, C. (2002). Rivalry and interference with a head-mounted display. In ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 9(3), 238-251</ref> The following effects are known in research:

===Depth of Focus / Field===

Switches permanently by refocusing on objects, which is different in distances to the user. A display mounted somehow to user's eye has fixed focal distance. Focusing information such as presented on a screen leads to a change in the [[Focal length|depth of focus]]. This causes blurring of information presented at other layers, which especially degrades the perception of high spatial frequency information such as text.

===Eye-Movements===

Are actually done at a specific angle of 10°. To focus an object out of this angle, head movements are used automatically for support. However, when wearing an [[Head-mounted display|HMD]] with eye-movements that exceed this angle, since head movements do not have any effect on the interface, a drop in comfort might occur due to tired [[Extraocular muscles|eye muscle]].

===Field-Of-View===

Describes the [[viewing angle of the user|FOV]]. The User's eye has a viewing angle of 94° from the center and 62° on the nose side.<ref name="ref7">Ishiguro, Y., & Rekimoto, J. (2011). Peripheral vision annotation: noninterference information presentation method for mobile augmented reality. In Proceedings of the 2nd Augmented Human International Conference. ACM, 8-11.</ref> The vertical angle is about 60° upwards and 75° downwards. [[Head-mounted display|HMD]]s often do not cover the whole [[Field-of-View|FOV]], which is also a reason for increased cybersickness.

===Binocular Rivalry===

Describes the phenomenon, which occurs when dissimilar images are presented to the human eye.<ref name="ref1">Alais, D., & Blake, R. (1999). Grouping visual features during binocular rivalry. In Vision research, 39(26), 4341-4353.</ref><ref name="ref2">Collins, J. F., & Blackwell, L. K. (1974). Effects of eye dominance and retinal distance on binocular rivalry. In Perceptual and Motor Skills, 39(2), 747-754.</ref> As the two images captured by each eye is incompatible for stereo processing, they fight for [[Colavita visual dominance effect|visual dominance]] over the other eye's side view, resulting in alternating views from the two eyes, where the non-dominant view is almost unseen. This effect often occurs when wearing a monocular HMD. In this setup, researchers <ref name="ref10">Peli, E. (1999). Optometric and perceptual issues with head-mounted displays. In Visual instrumentation: Optical design and engineering principles, 205-276.</ref> also observed objects that completely vanish for several seconds from user's [[attention]].

===Visual Interference===

Describes the phenomenon when both eyes perceive different images that are overlapping, but the [[brain]] is not able to distinguish between those. This phenomenon is also known as the inability for visual separation.

===Phoria===

Describes a muscle state of the eye, when the eyes are not focusing on a specific point. There are three different states, which can be distinguished: [[Esophoria]], [[Exophoria]], [[Orthophoria]]. While one eye is closed or being obstructed by a display, phoria can occur, which has the potential to cause [[Vertigo]] and [[Nausea]] as well.<ref name="ref14">Z-Health Performance Solutions (2011). http://www.zhealth.net/articles/the-eyes-have-it</ref>

===Eye-Dominance===

Although the user has two eyes, one eye is [[Ocular dominance|predominantly]] used. The other eye is used to make corrections and provide additional spatial information. It is recommended to wear a [[monocular]] [[Head-Mounted Display|HMD]] over the dominant eye.<ref name="ref9" />

==Peripheral Perception==
[[File:Visual Perception Human FOV.png|250px|thumb|The picture is describing the visual perception in the human's field of view. It shows the differentiable Areas and Angels for Perception of Motion, Color, Shape & Text.]]

While most of these factors mentioned above become problematic when both eyes are covered with displays, a single display resting in the [[peripheral FOV|Peripheral Vision]] can be considered to be unproblematic, since it does not permanently influence the perceived picture of the real world.

As mentioned earlier, there are two types of information being perceivable with a peripheral head mounted display: (1) detailed information: when consciously focusing on the display and (2) peripheral information: through the human's visual perception, when focusing at the 'real world'. (see also picture above)

Most obvious changes are “[[Motion (physics)|motion]]”, which can be perceived over the whole spectrum of the [[Field-of-View|FOV]]. In a smaller angle, change in color is also quite well perceivable (see figure). In contrast, perceiving shapes and reading text requires very dedicated attention of the [[pupil]]. However, when being very focused on a dedicated task, rough changes in shapes are still perceivable in a peripheral way.<ref name="ref6">Hau Chua, S., Perrault, S., Matthies, D., Zhao, S. (2015). Positioning Glass: Investigating Display Positions of monocular Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display.</ref> Even in the field of [[Human-Computer Interaction]], there have been investigations on this visual “peripheral channel”, such as peripheral color perception with eyeglasses.<ref name="ref3" /> Furthermore, researchers proposed to additionally utilize an eye tracker for a peripheral head-mounted display, in order to improve user experience.<ref name="ref7" /> There has also been investigations on which display positions are most suitable.<ref name="ref10" /> It has been found out that notifications presented at the middle and bottom areas of our [[Visual perception|human vision]] is more noticeable. However, top and middle positions are less distracting and more comfortable and preferred by the users. Among all the positions, the middle right position was found to strike the best balance between noticeability, comfort, and distraction.

While most [[Head-Mounted Display|HMD]]s suffer badly of the effects of [[Binocular Rivalry]], [[Depth of Field]] and [[Heterophoria|Phoria]] it is different for the PHMD. Since the PHMD is not totally covering the [[Field-of-View|FOV]] and also not augmenting information on real objects, it is not affected by known problems monocular HMDs usually suffer from, such as the effect of attention switching between reality and projection. Such problems have been figured out over centuries of airspace research and usually occur when trying to [[augment reality]].<ref name="ref12">Rash, C. E., Verona, R. W., & Crowley, J. S. (1990). Human factors and safety considerations of night-vision systems flight using thermal imaging systems. In International Society for Optics and Photonics, Orlando, 16-20, 142-164.</ref> These potential dangers, when operating in critical situations, such as taking part in traffic, are less pronounced for PHMDs.

==Peripheral Interaction==
Since the PHMD is resting in the peripheral of the user's [[Field-of-View|FOV]], it has a high availability and can be quickly demanded by focusing it. Furthermore, significant changes - depending on the stimuli - of the screen content is still perceivable without focusing the [[display device|display]].<ref name="ref3">Costanza, E., Inverso, S. A., Pavlov, E., Allen, R., & Maes, P. (2006). eye-q: Eyeglass peripheral display for subtle intimate notifications. In Proceedings of the 8th conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services. ACM, 211-218.</ref> This effect can be used to design peripheral information (e.g. such as visual notifications for incoming emails, approaching appointments, warnings). An efficient response to such perceived [[information]] could be accomplished in quick peripheral [[Input device|input]], such as a quick hand movement. This way, the user is not being greatly interrupted while completing real world tasks. In [[Human-Computer Interaction]] research this is also denoted as Peripheral Interaction <ref name="ref5">Hausen, D. (2013). Peripheral Interaction - Exploring the Design Space, PhD Thesis, Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, University of Munich.</ref>

Notwithstanding, suitable input modalities for PHMDs that are not socially awkward remain to be discovered. Negative or positive social effects by wearing a PHMD and devoting attention on the screen while taking part in a conversation might be present, but are not proven yet. In addition, taking part in traffic while focusing on a visual input modality can lead to a considerable decrease of attention to the road (see also [[Semantic memoriy]] & [[Multimodal Interaction]]). However, compared to [[smartphone]] [[Human-Computer interaction|interaction]], a quick switch to real world tasks is attainable, because there is no need for getting the device out of a pocket or bag. Furthermore, a PHMD does not need to be held by the user's hands, which offers a fully hands-free interaction. Since it is always available, it can provide peripheral visual information at any time, whereas peripheral information on [[smartphone]] in a pocket is not at all or barely perceivable (e.g. in a club/discothèque, while walking).
