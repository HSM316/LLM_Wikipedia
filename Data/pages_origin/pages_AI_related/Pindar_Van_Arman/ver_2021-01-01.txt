'''Pindar Van Arman''' is an American artist and [[roboticist]] based in Washington DC. His art focuses on designing painting robots that explore the differences between human and computational creativity.  Since his first system in 2005, he has built multiple artificially creative robots, including CrowdPainter,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/33959/20150219/how-a-cyber-attack-became-art.htm|title=This Is How A Cyber Attack Became Art|last=Times|first=Tech|date=February 19, 2015|work=Tech Times|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> bitPaintr,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/12/06/458347976/you-can-give-a-robot-a-paintbrush-but-does-it-create-art|title=You Can Give A Robot A Paintbrush, But Does It Create Art?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en}}</ref> and CloudPainter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://video.vice.com/en_us/embed/5983770a579816cf014bbddf|title=VICE Player|website=video.vice.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> His robotic systems typically paint with a brush on stretched canvas and have recently begun to concentrate on creative portraiture.

His work with CloudPainter was awarded First Place in Robot Art 2018, an annual AI and robotics art competition. Judges of the contest noted that "CloudPainter was able to paint evocative portraits with varying degrees of abstraction." <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robotart.org/|title=Robotart {{!}} The Robotic Art Competition|website=robotart.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> A notable aspect of his entries have been their ability to paint with complete creative autonomy, a process Van Arman outlined in his TEDx Talk "Teaching Creativity to Robots."<ref>{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Teaching Creativity to Robots {{!}} Pindar Van Arman {{!}} TEDxFoggyBottom|date=July 6, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYu0PdJSZcA|accessdate=2017-10-25}}</ref>

Van Arman graduated from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1996 and went on to get his Masters from The Corcoran College of Art and Design at George Washington University in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gwhatchet.com/2015/11/02/for-corcoran-alumnus-a-picture-is-worth-1000-gears/|title=For Corcoran alumnus, a picture is worth 1,000 gears|date=November 2, 2015|work=The GW Hatchet|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref>
