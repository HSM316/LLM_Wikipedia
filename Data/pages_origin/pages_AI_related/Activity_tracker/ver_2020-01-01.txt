An '''activity tracker''', also known as a '''fitness tracker''', is a device or application for monitoring and tracking [[Physical fitness|fitness]]-related metrics such as distance walked or run, [[calorie]] consumption, and in some cases heartbeat. It is a type of [[wearable computer]]. The term is now primarily used for [[smartwatch]]es that are [[File synchronization|synced]], in many cases wirelessly, to a computer or [[smartphone]] for long-term data tracking. There are also independent [[Mobile app|mobile]] and [[Facebook Platform|Facebook apps]].<ref>Menaspà P.

==History==
The term "activity trackers" now primarily refers to wearable devices that monitor and record a person's fitness activity. The concept grew out of written logs that led to spreadsheet-style computer logs in which entries were made manually, such as that provided in the US by the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] as part of [[The President's Challenge]].<ref>[http://www.stamfordplus.com/stm/information/nws1/publish/News_1/Governor_Rell_s_Committee_on_Physical_Fitness_calls_on_residents_to_join_President_s_Challenge_to_get_more_active2096.shtml "Governor Rell’s Committee on Physical Fitness calls on residents to join President’s Challenge to get more active"], Press release, ''Stamford Plus'', April 2, 2008.</ref> Improvements in technology in the late 20th and early 21st century allow automating the monitoring and recording of fitness activities and integrating them into more easily worn equipment.  Early examples include wristwatch-sized [[bicycle computer]]s that monitored speed, duration, distance, etc., available at least by the early 1990s.  Wearable [[heart rate monitor]]<nowiki/>s for athletes were available in 1981.<ref name="Polar-RS800Olympic2006">[http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 "Olympic Medical Institute Validates Polar RS800 Running Computer And Training System"], Polar, November 7, 2006, retrieved February 25, 2014, [//web.archive.org/web/20140225052618/http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 archived] February 25, 2014.</ref>  Wearable fitness tracking devices, including wireless heart rate monitoring that integrated with commercial-grade fitness equipment found in gyms, were available in consumer-grade electronics by at least the early 2000s.

Electronic activity trackers are fundamentally upgraded versions of [[pedometer]]s; in addition to counting steps, they use [[accelerometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s to calculate mileage, graph overall physical activity, calculate calorie expenditure, and in some cases also monitor and graph heart rate and quality of sleep.<ref name=Wired>Jeff Beckham, [https://www.wired.com/playbook/2012/04/fitness-tracker-psychology/ "Fitness Trackers Use Psychology to Motivate Couch Potatoes"], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', April 19, 2012.</ref><ref name=PCMag>Jill Duffy, [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404445,00.asp "The Best Activity Trackers for Fitness"], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', May 22, 2013.</ref><ref name=CNET>Caroline McCarthy, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20011151-36.html "Work out, get on scale...tell your friends?"], CNET, July 21, 2010.</ref> Some also include a silent alarm.<ref name=PCMag/><ref name=News>Rheana Murray, [http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/activity-tracker-best-article-1.1428747 "Smartphones become fitness coaches with new wearable activity trackers"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', August 16, 2013.</ref> Some newer models approach the US definition of a [[Medical device#Class II: General controls with special controls|Class II medical monitor]], and some manufacturers hope to eventually make them capable of alerting to a medical problem, although [[US Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval would be required.<ref name=Metro>Dan Holden, "Worn Out: The Dark Side of Wearable Technology", ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', September 24, 2014, pp.&nbsp;16&ndash;18.</ref> Early versions such as the original [[Fitbit]] (2009), were worn clipped to the waist;<ref name=Wired/> formats have since diversified to include wristbands and armbands ('''smart bands''') and smaller devices that can be clipped wherever preferred.<ref name=News/><ref>Danny Sullivan, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-33620_3-57576697-278/the-test-begins-my-life-with-four-activity-trackers-fitness-bands/ "The test begins: My life with four activity trackers, fitness bands"], CNET, March 28, 2013.</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] together developed the [[Nike+iPod]], a sensor-equipped shoe that worked with an [[iPod Nano]].

The  [[Apple Watch]] and some other [[smart watch]]es offer fitness tracker functions.<ref name=Metro/> In the US, [[BodyMedia]] has developed a disposable activity tracker to be worn for a week, which is aimed at medical and insurance providers and employers seeking to measure employees' fitness,<ref>[http://stream.marketwatch.com/story/2013-consumer-electronics-show/SS-4-17824/SS-4-19044/ "CES: Track your activity level, get cheaper health insurance?"], Stream, [[Consumer Electronics Show]], MarketWatch, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 10, 2013.</ref> and [[Jawbone (company)|Jawbone]]'s UP for Groups aggregates and anonymizes data from the company's wearable activity trackers and apps for employers.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30554496 "Tracker shares your habits with work"], Technology, BBC News, January 7, 2015 (video).</ref> Other activity trackers are intended to monitor vital signs in the elderly, epileptics, and people with sleep disorders and alert a caregiver to a problem.<ref name=Metro/>

Earbuds and [[headphones]] are a better location for measuring some data, including core body temperature; [[Valencell]] has developed sensor technology for new activity trackers that take their readings at the ear rather than the wrist, arm, or waist.<ref>David Z.

Much of the appeal of activity trackers that makes them effective tools in increasing personal fitness comes from their making it into a game, and from the social dimension of sharing via [[social media]] and resulting rivalry.<ref name=Wired/><ref name=CNET/><ref>G.

The standard activity-tracking smartphone or web apps present data in statistical form meant to be viewed after the activity has ended. However, research suggests that if we want a richer understanding of the data, we need intelligent computing to be included in the systems that run the apps.<ref>Fredrik Ohlin and Carl Magnus Olsson, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2678025.2701378 "Intelligent Computing in Personal Informatics: Key Design Considerations"], In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI ’15).

== Wearable sensors ==
Wearable sensors have been widely used in medical sciences, sports and security.  Wearable sensors can detect abnormal and unforeseen situations, and monitor physiological parameters and symptoms through these trackers.  This technology has transformed healthcare by allowing continuous monitoring of patients without hospitalization.  [[Medical monitoring]] of patients’ body temperature, heart rate, brain activity, muscle motion and other critical data can be delivered through these trackers.  Moreover, in [[sports training]] there is an increasing demand for wearable sensors.  For example, measurement of sweat rate was possible only in laboratory based systems a few years ago, but is now possible using wearable sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Detection of Daily Activities and Sports With Wearable Sensors in Controlled and Uncontrolled Conditions|last = Ermes|first = Miikka|date = January 2008|journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine|volume = 12|issue = 1|pages = 20–26|doi = 10.1109/TITB.2007.899496|pmid = 18270033}}</ref>

== Performance ==
Activity trackers are available both with and without display.

Certain movements of the user, such as working in the household, cycling, swimming, dancing or rowing can distort the results obtained from activity trackers. In a test conducted by [[Stiftung Warentest]], for example, no product determined the distance of a bike ride, even approximately.<ref name = "test.de">[https://www.test.de/Fitnessarmbaender-Nur-zwei-von-zwoelf-sind-gut-4957497-0 Fitnessarmbaender - Nur zwei von zwoelf sind gut], test.de, December 27, 2015. Retrieved on January 6, 2016</ref> Furthermore, the determined values for the human [[energy transformation]] were erroneous.<ref name = "test.de" /> With the heart rate large deviations have been observed at wristlet trackers, and it is recommended for this purpose to use appropriate chest straps.<ref name = "test.de" />

Wristbands can be uncomfortable to wear and inadvertently be lost. For some products [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic substances]] were detected.<ref name = "test.de" />

The connection of activity trackers with [[social network]]s can lead to violation of [[privacy]], such as involuntary publication of sexual activity.<ref name=Loftus/> The apps of some activity trackers not only transmit personal data, but also private address lists to servers on the Internet without notifying or asking the user.<ref name="test.de" />  Even when anonymized, the mere presence of geolocation data may be a national security risk.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sly|first1=Liz|title=U.S. soldiers are revealing sensitive and dangerous information by jogging|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-map-showing-the-users-of-fitness-devices-lets-the-world-see-where-us-soldiers-are-and-what-they-are-doing/2018/01/28/86915662-0441-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=29 January 2018}}</ref> However, the results of a study among semi-professional (half-) [[marathon]] participants suggests that these users are open towards sharing tracked activity data on a voluntary basis with: friends (51.7%), family members (43.4%), or a physician (32.3%).<ref>Wiesner M; Zowalla R; Suleder J; Westers M; Pobiruchin M (14 December 2018).

==Medical uses==
In those who are [[overweight]] or [[obese]] some evidence has found that the use of these type of devices results in less weight loss rather than more after 18 months of use.<ref name=Jak2016/> However, it has been noted that the activity tracker used in this study is a now-discontinued model that is worn on the upper arm, which might be uncomfortable, and wear times of the tracker were low.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plante|first1=Timothy B.|last2=Martin|first2=Seth S.|title=Wearable Technology and Long-term Weight Loss|journal=JAMA|date=17 January 2017|volume=317|issue=3|pages=318–319|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.19265|pmid=28114543}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klasnja|first1=Predrag|last2=Hekler|first2=Eric B.|title=Wearable Technology and Long-term Weight Loss|journal=JAMA|date=17 January 2017|volume=317|issue=3|pages=317–318|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.19268|pmid=28114544}}</ref> One review of six studies found that there was little evidence that activity trackers improve health outcomes.<ref name=Jo2019>{{cite journal |last1=Jo |first1=A |last2=Coronel |first2=BD |last3=Coakes |first3=CE |last4=Mainous AG |first4=3rd |title=Is There a Benefit to Patients Using Wearable Devices Such as Fitbit or Health Apps on Mobiles?
