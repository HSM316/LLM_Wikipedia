==History==
The term "activity trackers" now primarily refers to wearable devices that monitor and record a person's fitness activity. Improvements in technology in the late 20th and early 21st century allow automating the monitoring and recording of fitness activities and integrating them into more easily worn equipment. Early examples include wristwatch-sized [[bicycle computer]]s that monitored speed, duration, distance, etc., available at least by the early 1990s. Wearable [[heart rate monitor]]s for athletes were available in 1981.<ref name="Polar-RS800Olympic2006">[http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 "Olympic Medical Institute Validates Polar RS800 Running Computer And Training System"], Polar, November 7, 2006, retrieved February 25, 2014, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140225052618/http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 archived] February 25, 2014.</ref> The [[RS-Computer]] shoe was released in 1986. Wearable fitness tracking devices, including wireless heart rate monitoring that integrated with commercial-grade fitness equipment found in gyms, were available in consumer-grade electronics by at least the early 2000s. Athletes are usually tracked with the levels of internal and external loads, where external loads will consist of the performance outcomes usually witnessed by coaches, and internal loads consist of factors such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood lactate levels.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Passos |first1=João |last2=Lopes |first2=Sérgio Ivan |last3=Clemente |first3=Filipe Manuel |last4=Moreira |first4=Pedro Miguel |last5=Rico-González |first5=Markel |last6=Bezerra |first6=Pedro |last7=Rodrigues |first7=Luís Paulo |date=January 2021 |title=Wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) Technologies for Fitness Assessment: A Systematic Review |journal=Sensors |language=en |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=5418 |bibcode=2021Senso..21.5418P |doi=10.3390/s21165418 |issn=1424-8220 |pmc=8400146 |pmid=34450860 |doi-access=free}}</ref> When taking into account the well-being of the subject, subjective scales are involved which measure fatigue, sleep quality, emotions, and soreness.<ref name=":1" /> Physical movement tracking can be used as a predictive analysis tool to determine the risk of Parkinson's Disease in individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schalkamp |first1=Ann-Kathrin |last2=Peall |first2=Kathryn J. |last3=Harrison |first3=Neil A. |last4=Sandor |first4=Cynthia |date=August 2023 |title=Wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson's disease years before clinical diagnosis |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02440-2 |journal=Nature Medicine |language=en |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=2048–2056 |doi=10.1038/s41591-023-02440-2 |pmid=37400639 |s2cid=259323971 |issn=1546-170X}}</ref>

Electronic activity trackers are fundamentally upgraded versions of [[pedometer]]s; in addition to counting steps, they use [[accelerometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s to calculate mileage, graph overall physical activity, calculate calorie expenditure, and in some cases also monitor and graph heart rate and quality of sleep.<ref name="PCMag2">Jill Duffy, [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404445,00.asp "The Best Activity Trackers for Fitness"], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', May 22, 2013.</ref> Some also include a silent alarm.<ref name="PCMag2" /><ref name="News2">Rheana Murray, [http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/activity-tracker-best-article-1.1428747 "Smartphones become fitness coaches with new wearable activity trackers"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', August 16, 2013.</ref> Some newer models approach the US definition of a [[Medical device#Class II: General controls with special controls|Class II medical monitor]], and some manufacturers hope to eventually make them capable of alerting to a medical problem, although [[US Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval would be required.<ref name="Metro2">Dan Holden, "Worn Out: The Dark Side of Wearable Technology", ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', September 24, 2014, pp.&nbsp;16–18.</ref>

'''Smart Watches and Wristbands'''
[[File:Fitbit Versa Lite No - 10：アプリ.jpg|thumb|A fitbit watch showing conditions for a workout]]
Wristbands have since diversified to include wristbands and armbands ('''smart bands''') and smaller devices that can be clipped wherever preferred.<ref name="News2" /><ref>Danny Sullivan, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-33620_3-57576697-278/the-test-begins-my-life-with-four-activity-trackers-fitness-bands/ "The test begins: My life with four activity trackers, fitness bands"], CNET, March 28, 2013.</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] together developed the [[Nike+iPod]], a sensor-equipped shoe that worked with an [[iPod Nano]].

The [[Apple Watch]] and some other [[smart watch|smartwatch]]es offer fitness tracker functions.<ref name="Metro2" /> In the US, [[BodyMedia]] has developed a disposable activity tracker to be worn for a week, which is aimed at medical and insurance providers and employers seeking to measure employees' fitness,<ref>[http://stream.marketwatch.com/story/2013-consumer-electronics-show/SS-4-17824/SS-4-19044/ "CES: Track your activity level, get cheaper health insurance?"], Stream, [[Consumer Electronics Show]], MarketWatch, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 10, 2013.</ref> and Jawbone's UP for Groups aggregates and anonymizes data from the company's wearable activity trackers and apps for employers.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30554496 "Tracker shares your habits with work"], Technology, BBC News, January 7, 2015 (video).</ref> Other activity trackers are intended to monitor vital signs in the elderly, epileptics, and people with sleep disorders and alert a caregiver to a problem.<ref name="Metro2" />

Earbuds and [[headphones]] are a better location for measuring some data, including core body temperature; [[Valencell]] has developed sensor technology for new activity trackers that take their readings at the ear rather than the wrist, arm, or waist.<ref>David Z. Morris, [http://fortune.com/2014/06/24/apple-beats-headphones-wearable-tech-biometrics/ "Forget the iWatch.

'''Activity Tracking Apps'''

In addition, logging apps exist for [[smartphone]]s and Facebook;<ref name="CNET2">Caroline McCarthy, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20011151-36.html "Work out, get on scale...tell your friends?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214203/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20011151-36.html|date=2013-12-10}}, CNET, July 21, 2010.</ref> the Nike+ system now works without the shoe sensor, through the [[GPS]] unit in the phone. Much of the appeal of activity trackers that makes them effective tools in increasing personal fitness comes from their making it into a game and from the social dimension of sharing via [[social media]] and resulting rivalry.<ref>G.

The standard activity-tracking smartphone or web apps present data in statistical form meant to be viewed after the activity has ended. However, research suggests that if we want a richer understanding of the data, we need intelligent computing to be included in the systems that run the apps.<ref>Fredrik Ohlin and Carl Magnus Olsson, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2678025.2701378 "Intelligent Computing in Personal Informatics: Key Design Considerations"], In ''Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces'' (IUI '15).

== Wearable sensors ==
[[Wearable computer|Wearable]] sensors have been widely used in medical sciences, sports, and security. Wearable sensors can detect abnormal and unforeseen situations, and monitor [[Physiology|physiological]] parameters and symptoms through these trackers.  This technology has transformed healthcare by allowing continuous monitoring of patients without hospitalization.

==Medical uses==
'''Heart Problems'''

Activity tracking has been utilized to keep track of heart problems, one of them being atrial fibrillation (AF) which causes an irregular and chaotic heartbeat and is accountable for a majority of strokes in the United States.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Raja |first1=Joel M. |last2=Elsakr |first2=Carol |last3=Roman |first3=Sherif |last4=Cave |first4=Brandon |last5=Pour-Ghaz |first5=Issa |last6=Nanda |first6=Amit |last7=Maturana |first7=Miguel |last8=Khouzam |first8=Rami N. |date=September 2019 |title=Apple Watch, Wearables, and Heart Rhythm: where do we stand? |journal=Annals of Translational Medicine |volume=7 |issue=17 |pages=417 |doi=10.21037/atm.2019.06.79 |pmc=6787392 |pmid=31660316 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Professionals would rely on the ambulatory electrocardiogram (EKG) to record AF but soon found wearable wristbands to be useful for regular usage.<ref name=":2" /> These wearables must be accurate to prevent misdiagnosis, morbidity, and mortality.<ref name=":2" /> The Apple Watch was used for this study where it was able to have irregular pulse detection and send a notification once found.<ref name=":2" /> Though there is a risk of false positives, it was found that it may be a useful tool in the initial diagnosis process as a gateway to additional procedures rather than being the only tool used.<ref name=":2" />

'''Menstrual Tracking/ Reproductive Health'''

Individuals with a uterus can use menstrual tracking apps to keep track of their cycles and refer back to the timeline to spot any changes that they would like to bring up to their doctors or specialists.<ref name=":7" /> There are several apps for this purpose but the privacy and security of the data are unknown given that there is no one "head" that oversees the system, leaving a lot of the data open to the market, leaving many questions as to how secure the data is when entered.<ref name=":7" /> When users sign up for these apps, they are usually led with an "at your own risk" warning in case any data gets leaked, which can contribute to more targeted ads and inaccurate predictions in their cycles.<ref name=":7" />
