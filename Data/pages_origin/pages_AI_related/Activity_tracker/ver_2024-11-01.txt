An '''activity tracker''' is an electronic device or app that measures and collects data about an individual's movements and physical responses, towards the goal of monitoring and improving their health, fitness, or psychological wellness over time.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=González Ramírez |first1=Maria Luisa |last2=García Vázquez |first2=Juan Pablo |last3=Rodríguez |first3=Marcela D. |last4=Padilla-López |first4=Luis Alfredo |last5=Galindo-Aldana |first5=Gilberto Manuel |last6=Cuevas-González |first6=Daniel |date=2023-08-22 |orig-date=2023-08-22 |title=Wearables for Stress Management: A Scoping Review |journal=Healthcare |language=en |volume=11 |issue=17 |pages=2369 |doi=10.3390/healthcare11172369 |issn=2227-9032 |pmc=10486660 |pmid=37685403 |doi-access=free }}</ref> 

Activity trackers are a more sophisticated version of the [[pedometer]]; in addition to counting steps, they contain additional sensors such as [[accelerometer]]s and [[altimeter]]s to collect or estimate measures including the speed and distance travelled, [[heart rate]], calorie expenditure, or the duration and [[sleep quality|quality of sleep]].<ref name="PCMag2">Jill Duffy, [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404445,00.asp "The Best Activity Trackers for Fitness"], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', May 22, 2013.</ref> 

Improvements in computing technology since the 1980s, recently driven by the rapid advancement of [[smartphones]], paved the way for the spread of wearable tracker devices with integrated sensors. Large amount of sensitive sensor and user-input data is synced with mobile apps such as fitness, mood, sleep, water intake, medicine usage, sexual activity, menstruation, and potential illnesses. This has led to privacy concerns around how consumer information is stored and analyzed by the companies involved.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Grundy |first=Quinn |date=2022-04-05 |title=A Review of the Quality and Impact of Mobile Health Apps |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |language=en |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=117–134 |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-052020-103738 |pmid=34910582 |s2cid=245243717 |issn=0163-7525|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==History==
Wearable [[heart rate monitor]]s for athletes were available in 1981.<ref name="Polar-RS800Olympic2006">[http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 "Olympic Medical Institute Validates Polar RS800 Running Computer And Training System"], Polar, November 7, 2006, retrieved February 25, 2014, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140225052618/http://www.polar.com/us-en/about_polar/news/polar_RS800 archived] February 25, 2014.</ref> Improvements in technology in the late 20th and early 21st century made it possible to automate the recording of fitness activities, as well as to integrate monitors into more easily worn equipment. The [[RS-Computer]] shoe was released in 1986. Early examples include wristwatch-sized [[bicycle computer]]s that monitored speed, duration, distance, etc., available at least by the early 1990s. By at least the early 2000s, wearable fitness tracking devices were available as consumer-grade electronics, including wireless heart rate monitors that could be connected to commercial-grade exercise machines in gyms. {{Non sequitur|Athletes are usually tracked with the levels of internal and external loads, where external loads will consist of the performance outcomes usually witnessed by coaches, and internal loads consist of factors such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood lactate levels.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Passos |first1=João |last2=Lopes |first2=Sérgio Ivan |last3=Clemente |first3=Filipe Manuel |last4=Moreira |first4=Pedro Miguel |last5=Rico-González |first5=Markel |last6=Bezerra |first6=Pedro |last7=Rodrigues |first7=Luís Paulo |date=January 2021 |title=Wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) Technologies for Fitness Assessment: A Systematic Review |journal=Sensors |language=en |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=5418 |bibcode=2021Senso..21.5418P |doi=10.3390/s21165418 |issn=1424-8220 |pmc=8400146 |pmid=34450860 |doi-access=free}}</ref> When taking into account the well-being of the subject, subjective scales are involved which measure fatigue, sleep quality, emotions, and soreness.<ref name=":1" /> |date=June 2024}} 

Activity trackers later diversified to include wristbands and armbands (so-called smart bands) and smaller devices that could be clipped wherever preferred.<ref name="News2">Rheana Murray, [http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/activity-tracker-best-article-1.1428747 "Smartphones become fitness coaches with new wearable activity trackers"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', August 16, 2013.</ref><ref>Danny Sullivan, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-33620_3-57576697-278/the-test-begins-my-life-with-four-activity-trackers-fitness-bands/ "The test begins: My life with four activity trackers, fitness bands"], CNET, March 28, 2013.</ref> In 2006 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] released the [[Nike+iPod]], a sensor-equipped shoe that worked with an [[iPod Nano]].

By 2010, logging apps had been introduced, many of which integrated the direct sharing of data to Facebook ot Twitter.<ref name="CNET2">Caroline McCarthy, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20011151-36.html "Work out, get on scale...tell your friends?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214203/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20011151-36.html|date=2013-12-10}}, CNET, July 21, 2010.</ref> Activity trackers became appealing to consumers because of the combination of [[gamification]], the social dimension of sharing via [[social media]], and increased motivation due to the resulting rivalry and competition between friends.<ref>G.

In 2016, there were several advances made regarding fitness tracking geared toward kids with a variety of options from organizations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[Garmin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Kids' Fitness Trackers of 2017 |url=https://unicefkidpower.org/best-kids-fitness-trackers-2017/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222115821/https://unicefkidpower.org/best-kids-fitness-trackers-2017/ |archive-date=22 February 2017 |access-date=22 February 2017 |website=UNICEF Kid Power}}</ref>

==Tracker formats==
Most consumer activity trackers are worn on a wristband similar to a [[wristwatch]]. This type of tracker usually includes a digital display for data.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Song |first1=Victoria |title=The best fitness trackers to buy right now |url=https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker |website=The Verge |access-date=15 June 2024 |language=en |date=22 March 2022}}</ref> Wrist-based trackers may be prone to error during exercise involving rapid arm motion.<ref name="pmid30899350">{{cite journal| author1=Bunn J.|author2=Wells E.|author3=Manor J.|author4=Webster M.| title=Evaluation of Earbud and Wristwatch Heart Rate Monitors during Aerobic and Resistance Training. | journal=Int J Exerc Sci | year= 2019 | volume= 12 | issue= 4 | pages= 374-384 | pmid=30899350 | doi= | pmc=6413847 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=30899350  }} </ref>

Some activity trackers take the form of a ring. Ring-based trackers have no display of their own and rely on a connection with a smartphone to display tracked data.<ref>Nathan Ingraham, [https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/03/motiv-crammed-a-full-fitness-tracker-into-a-ring/ "Motiv Crammed a Full Fitness Tracker into a Ring"], "[[Engadget]]", Jan 3, 2017</ref>

Another low-profile format for activity trackers places sensors inside of [[earphones]]. These trackers rely on a smartphone to display data, similar to ring-based trackers. Earphone-based activity trackers use sensors to take readings directly from the [[capillaries]] located within the ear. Due to their placement, these trackers can give more accurate results for blood pressure, [[electrocardiogram]], and body temperature.<ref>David Z. Morris, [http://fortune.com/2014/06/24/apple-beats-headphones-wearable-tech-biometrics/ "Forget the iWatch. Headphones are the original wearable tech"], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', June 24, 2014.</ref> Activity trackers placed in the ear are also well suited to the assessment of heart rate.<ref name="pmid30899350"/>

===Activity tracking on smartwatches===

Many devices primarily intended as [[smartwatches]] also function as activity trackers. 
An early example was the [[Apple Watch]], which has offered has offered fitness tracker functions since 2014.<ref name="Metro2" /> 

==Tracker apps==
The standard activity-tracking smartphone or web apps present data in statistical form meant to be viewed after the activity has ended. However, research suggests that if we want a richer understanding of the data, we need intelligent computing to be included in the systems that run the apps.<ref>Fredrik Ohlin and Carl Magnus Olsson, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2678025.2701378 "Intelligent Computing in Personal Informatics: Key Design Considerations"], In ''Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces'' (IUI '15). ACM, New York, 263–274, accessed June 23, 2015.</ref>

==Performance problems==
Certain movements of the user can distort the results obtained from activity trackers as seen in a test conducted by [[Stiftung Warentest]] where the products were unable to accurately track a bike ride.<ref name="test.de2">[https://www.test.de/Fitnessarmbaender-Nur-zwei-von-zwoelf-sind-gut-4957497-0 Fitnessarmbaender - Nur zwei von zwoelf sind gut], test.de, November 23, 2023.</ref> Furthermore, the determined values for the human [[energy transformation]] were erroneous.<ref name="test.de2" /> With the heart rate large deviations have been observed at wristlet trackers, and it is recommended for this purpose to use appropriate chest straps.<ref name="test.de2" /> Wristbands can be uncomfortable to wear and inadvertently be lost. For some products, [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic substances]] were detected.<ref name="test.de2" />

==Privacy concerns==
There have been some privacy issues regarding the data collection of activity-tracking apps, a user's health can be tracked into a "digital health footprint".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Grande |first1=David |last2=Luna Marti |first2=Xochitl |last3=Feuerstein-Simon |first3=Rachel |last4=Merchant |first4=Raina M. |last5=Asch |first5=David A. |last6=Lewson |first6=Ashley |last7=Cannuscio |first7=Carolyn C. |date=2020-07-09 |title=Health Policy and Privacy Challenges Associated With Digital Technology |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768091 |journal=JAMA Network Open |language=en |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e208285 |doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8285 |issn=2574-3805 |pmc=7348687 |pmid=32644138}}</ref> There have been many concerns about privacy issues with menstruation and reproductive health-tracking apps.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last1=Fowler |first1=Leah R. |last2=Gillard |first2=Charlotte |last3=Morain |first3=Stephanie R. |date=September 2020 |title=Readability and Accessibility of Terms of Service and Privacy Policies for Menstruation-Tracking Smartphone Applications |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1524839919899924 |journal=Health Promotion Practice |language=en |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=679–683 |doi=10.1177/1524839919899924 |pmid=32037887 |s2cid=211072307 |issn=1524-8399}}</ref> Many women who use these apps for menstrual and contraceptive tracking are under the impression that their data is private when there is no single body regulating the apps, making the availability and protection of the data unknown.<ref name=":7" /> 

The apps of some activity trackers not only transmit personal data but also private address lists to servers on the Internet without notifying or asking the user.<ref name="test.de2" /> Even when anonymized, the mere presence of geolocation data may be a national security risk.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sly |first1=Liz |date=29 January 2018 |title=U.S. soldiers are revealing sensitive and dangerous information by jogging |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-map-showing-the-users-of-fitness-devices-lets-the-world-see-where-us-soldiers-are-and-what-they-are-doing/2018/01/28/86915662-0441-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html |access-date=29 January 2018}}</ref> However, the results of a study among semi-professional (half-) [[marathon]] participants suggest that certain users are open to sharing tracked activity data voluntarily.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wiesner |first1=Martin |last2=Zowalla |first2=Richard |last3=Suleder |first3=Julian |last4=Westers |first4=Maximilian |last5=Pobiruchin |first5=Monika |year=2018 |title=Technology Adoption, Motivational Aspects, and Privacy Concerns of Wearables in the German Running Community: Field Study |journal=JMIR mHealth and uHealth |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e201 |doi=10.2196/mhealth.9623 |pmc=6315235 |pmid=30552085 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

In the US in 2013, [[BodyMedia]] developed a disposable activity tracker to be worn for a week, which is aimed at medical and insurance providers and employers seeking to measure employees' fitness.<ref>[http://stream.marketwatch.com/story/2013-consumer-electronics-show/SS-4-17824/SS-4-19044/ "CES: Track your activity level, get cheaper health insurance?"], Stream, [[Consumer Electronics Show]], MarketWatch, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 10, 2013.</ref> In 2014, Jawbone developed a system called UP for Groups which could provide employers with aggregated data from employees' wearable activity trackers and apps.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30554496 "Tracker shares your habits with work"], Technology, BBC News, January 7, 2015 (video).</ref>

==Psychological impacts==
Research has been carried out on the gamification of health apps, where users earn incentives and rewards based on their health goals.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal |last1=Arora |first1=Chirag |last2=Razavian |first2=Maryam |date=2021-10-21 |title=Ethics of Gamification in Health and Fitness-Tracking |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |language=en |volume=18 |issue=21 |pages=11052 |doi=10.3390/ijerph182111052 |issn=1660-4601 |pmc=8583052 |pmid=34769570 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Though this can make the app engaging, there was concern it could trivialize health apps and deter the users from their genuine health goals.<ref name=":8" /> There is also research problematizing tracking devices about how we inhabit, experience, and imagine our bodies and lives.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Fors |first1=Vaike |title=Imagining Personal Data |last2=Pink |first2=Sarah |last3=Berg |first3=Martin |last4=O'Dell |first4=Tom |date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-350-05138-6 |language=en |doi=10.5040/9781350051416 |author-link2=Sarah Pink |s2cid=218918443}}</ref>

== Wearable sensors ==
[[Wearable computer|Wearable]] sensors have been widely used in medical sciences, sports, and security. Wearable sensors can detect abnormal and unforeseen situations, and monitor [[Physiology|physiological]] parameters and symptoms through these trackers.  This technology has transformed healthcare by allowing continuous monitoring of patients without hospitalization. [[Medical monitoring]] of a patient's body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Nikhil|last2=Moneghetti|first2=Kegan James|last3=Christle|first3=Jeffrey Wilcox|last4=Hadley|first4=David|last5=Plews|first5=Daniel|last6=Froelicher|first6=Victor|date=August 2018|title=Heart Rate Variability: An Old Metric with New Meaning in the Era of using mHealth Technologies for Health and Exercise Training Guidance.

Moreover, in [[sports training]], there is an increasing demand for wearable sensors.  For example, measurement of sweat rate was possible only in laboratory-based systems a few years ago but is now possible using wearable sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Detection of Daily Activities and Sports With Wearable Sensors in Controlled and Uncontrolled Conditions|last = Ermes|first = Miikka|date = January 2008|journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine|volume = 12|issue = 1|pages = 20–26|doi = 10.1109/TITB.2007.899496|pmid = 18270033|s2cid = 18080013}}</ref> Heart rate variability (HRV) has the potential to determine the quality of an exercise regimen. Additionally, HRV is recommended among the athletic community as a warning sign for over-training. In these ways, HRV can be used to optimize performance.<ref name=":0" /> Wearable sensors play a pivotal role in monitoring physiological parameters and enhancing fitness regimens through AI-driven feedback and the development of intelligent equipment. This is evident in collaborative efforts between leading sports brands and technology companies.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tang |first1=Yuxin |last2=Zan |first2=Shengfeng |last3=Zhang |first3=Xiaowen |date=2022-05-10 |title=Research on System Construction and Strategy of Intelligent Sports in the Implementation of National Fitness |journal=Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience |language=en |volume=2022 |pages=e3190801 |doi=10.1155/2022/3190801 |issn=1687-5265 |pmc=9113877 |pmid=35592719 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Activity trackers are not medical devices. However, newer models approach the US definition of a [[Medical device#Class II: General controls with special controls|Class II medical monitor]], and some manufacturers hope to eventually make them capable of alerting to a medical problem, although [[US Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval would be required.<ref name="Metro2">Dan Holden, "Worn Out: The Dark Side of Wearable Technology", ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', September 24, 2014, pp.&nbsp;16–18.</ref> 

=== Detection of atrial fibrillation ===
Activity tracking has been utilized to keep track of [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF), an irregular and chaotic heartbeat, which is accountable for a majority of strokes in the United States.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Raja |first1=Joel M. |last2=Elsakr |first2=Carol |last3=Roman |first3=Sherif |last4=Cave |first4=Brandon |last5=Pour-Ghaz |first5=Issa |last6=Nanda |first6=Amit |last7=Maturana |first7=Miguel |last8=Khouzam |first8=Rami N. |date=September 2019 |title=Apple Watch, Wearables, and Heart Rhythm: where do we stand? |journal=Annals of Translational Medicine |volume=7 |issue=17 |pages=417 |doi=10.21037/atm.2019.06.79 |pmc=6787392 |pmid=31660316 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Professionals rely on the ambulatory electrocardiogram (EKG) to record AF but soon found wearable wristbands{{clarify|date=June 2024}} to be useful for regular usage.{{clarify|date=June 2024}}<ref name=":2" /> These wearables must be accurate to prevent misdiagnosis, morbidity, and mortality.<ref name=":2" /> The Apple Watch was found in a study to be able to detect and notify the wearer of an irregular pulse.<ref name=":2" /> Though there is a risk of false positives, the study found that it may be a useful tool in the initial diagnosis process as a gateway to additional procedures rather than being the only tool used.<ref name=":2" />

=== Weight loss and obesity ===
Activity trackers have also been used for tracking and finding solutions to combat obesity by promoting physical activity.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Bowen-Jallow |first1=Kanika |last2=Nunez-Lopez |first2=Omar |last3=Wright |first3=Alex |last4=Fuchs |first4=Erika |last5=Ahn |first5=Mollie |last6=Lyons |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Jupiter |first7=Daniel |last8=Berry |first8=Lindsey |last9=Suman |first9=Oscar |last10=Radhakrishnan |first10=Ravi S. |last11=Glaser |first11=Andrea M. |last12=Thompson |first12=Deborah I. |date=2021-01-08 |title=Wearable Activity Tracking Device Use in an Adolescent Weight Management Clinic: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial |journal=Journal of Obesity |language=en |volume=2021 |pages=e7625034 |doi=10.1155/2021/7625034 |issn=2090-0708 |pmc=7811568 |pmid=33505717 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A device called the Fitbit Alta was used as the wristband for adolescents who are considered obese where their steps, distance, calories burned, activity time, and sleep rates were kept track of and downloaded by the researchers to analyze.<ref name=":3" /> The overall study found that societal and cultural factors were what affected adolescent obesity given that low-income minorities were at a higher risk given that they had limited access to weight management programs and resources.<ref name=":3" /> The tracking of steps and amount of physical activity allowed for one to be aware of their habits and lifestyle, but the access to weight loss programs varied for many, which is why the researchers utilized this information and used the technology to correlate behavioral aspects with the data to search for more solutions.<ref name=":3" />

One review of six studies found that there was little evidence that activity trackers improve health outcomes.<ref name=":4" /> Of five studies that looked at weight loss, one found benefit, one found harm, and three found no effect.<ref name=":4" /> Another systematic review covering 35 studies and 7454 participants, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that activity trackers increased people's physical activity by an average of 1850 steps/day.<ref name=":5" />

Wearable sensors{{which?|date=June 2024}} have also been in use when keeping track of infant development, motor skills, and physical growth are the main aspects that were focused on.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Airaksinen |first1=Manu |last2=Taylor |first2=Elisa |last3=Gallen |first3=Anastasia |last4=Ilén |first4=Elina |last5=Saari |first5=Antti |last6=Sankilampi |first6=Ulla |last7=Räsänen |first7=Okko |last8=Haataja |first8=Leena M. |last9=Vanhatalo |first9=Sampsa |date=June 2023 |title=Charting infants' motor development at home using a wearable system: validation and comparison to physical growth charts |url=|journal=eBioMedicine |volume=92 |pages=104591 |doi=10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104591 |issn=2352-3964 |pmc=10176156 |pmid=37137181}}</ref>

=== Parkinson's disease prediction ===
Physical movement tracking can be used as a predictive analysis tool to determine the risk of Parkinson's Disease in individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schalkamp |first1=Ann-Kathrin |last2=Peall |first2=Kathryn J. |last3=Harrison |first3=Neil A. |last4=Sandor |first4=Cynthia |date=August 2023 |title=Wearable movement-tracking data identify Parkinson's disease years before clinical diagnosis |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02440-2 |journal=Nature Medicine |language=en |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=2048–2056 |doi=10.1038/s41591-023-02440-2 |pmid=37400639 |s2cid=259323971 |issn=1546-170X}}</ref>

=== Alerting for caregivers ===
Other activity trackers are intended to monitor vital signs in the elderly, epileptics, and people with sleep disorders and alert a caregiver to a problem.<ref name="Metro2" />

=== Menstrual tracking and reproductive health ===
Individuals with a uterus can use menstrual tracking apps to keep track of their cycles and refer back to the timeline to spot any changes that they would like to bring up to their doctors or specialists.<ref name=":7" /> There are several apps for this purpose but the privacy and security of the data are unknown given that there is no one "head" that oversees the system, leaving a lot of the data open to the market, leaving many questions as to how secure the data is when entered.<ref name=":7" /> When users sign up for these apps, they are usually led with an "at your own risk" warning in case any data gets leaked, which can contribute to more targeted ads and inaccurate predictions in their cycles.<ref name=":7" />

=== Animal health ===
Activity trackers have been designed for animals, for example collar-mounted activity trackers for dogs.<ref>[http://www.dezeen.com/2014/05/14/whistle-wearable-technology-dogs-new-deal-design/ "Whistle wearable technology for dogs lets owners monitor pet activity"], ''De Zeen'', May 14, 2014.</ref><ref>Jill Duffy, [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2458359,00.asp "Whistle Dog Activity Tracker Adds GPS Location Finder"], ''[[PC Magazine]]'', May 21, 2014.</ref><ref>Heather Zimmerman, "Digital Dog", ''Metro Silicon Valley'', September 24, 2014, p. 17.</ref>
