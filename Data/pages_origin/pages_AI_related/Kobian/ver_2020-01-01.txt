'''Kobian''' is a [[robot]] created by scientists at [[Waseda University]] in [[Japan]]. It is capable of displaying expressions of [[emotion]] and was developed to realize culture-specific greetings.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Social Robotics: 7th International Conference, ICSR 2015, Paris, France, October 26-30, 2015, Proceedings|last=Tapus|first=Adriana|last2=André|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Martin|first3=Jean-Claude|last4=Ferland|first4=François|last5=Ammi|first5=Mehdi|date=2015-10-27|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319255538|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=667}}</ref> It can also simulate human speech including the movement of the lips and the oscillations of the head.<ref name=":1" />  

Kobian is based on the WABIAN-2R robot and the emotion expression humanoid robot called WE-4RII and is 1,470 mm tall and weighs 62 kilograms.<ref name=":0" /> The robot's two eyeballs are outfitted with [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS camera]]<nowiki/>s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Motion and Operation Planning of Robotic Systems: Background and Practical Approaches|last=Carbone|first=Giuseppe|last2=Gomez-Bravo|first2=Fernando|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319147048|location=Cham|pages=418}}</ref> It is a bi-pedal standalone robot with control units such as motor drivers placed in the robotic head, making this particular part larger than the human head.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Romansy 19 - Robot Design, Dynamics and Control: Proceedings of the 19th CISM-IFtomm Symposium|last=Padois|first=Vincent|last2=Bidaud|first2=Philippe|last3=Khatib|first3=Oussama|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9783709113783|location=Wien|pages=152}}</ref> The robotic head for the Kobian-R, the newer and more downsized version of the robot<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Social Robotics: 4th International Conference, ICSR 2012, Chengdu, China, October 29-31, 2012, Proceedings|last=Ge|first=Shuzhi Sam|last2=Khatib|first2=Oussama|last3=Cabibihan|first3=John-John|last4=Simmons|first4=Reid|last5=Williams|first5=Mary Anne|date=2012|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783642341021|location=Heidelberg|pages=36}}</ref>, has 24 degrees of freedom (DoFs) and a blue facial color due to an electro luminescence sheet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Advances on Theory and Practice of Robots and Manipulators: Proceedings of Romansy 2014 XX CISM-IFToMM Symposium on Theory and Practice of Robots and Manipulators|last=Ceccarelli|first=Marco|last2=Glazunov|first2=Victor A.|date=2014-06-02|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319070575|location=Cham|pages=246}}</ref> The original Kobian robot has a DoF of 48.<ref name=":0" /> Two versions of the Kobian-Rs have been built - a Western and a Japanese variant - to develop the system that produces the robot's facial cues.<ref name=":2" />
