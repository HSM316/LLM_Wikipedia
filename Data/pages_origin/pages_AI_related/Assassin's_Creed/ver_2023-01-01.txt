'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[open-world]], [[action-adventure]], and [[stealth game]] franchise published by [[Ubisoft]] and developed mainly by its studio [[Ubisoft Montreal]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]] and its more advanced derivatives. Created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]], and [[Corey May]], the ''Assassin's Creed'' [[video game]] series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the [[Order of Assassins]], who fight for peace and free will, and the [[Knights Templar]], who desire peace through order and control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]], and [[fictional characters]] intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures]]. In most games, players control a historical Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin–Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series, ''Assassin's Creed'' took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]], based on the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of the medieval Middle East.

The first ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the most recent being ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'' in 2020. Main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' series are set in an open world and played from the [[third-person view]]. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of [[parkour]] to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer game modes.

A new story and occasionally new time periods are introduced in each entry, with the gameplay elements also evolving. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow [[Desmond Miles]], a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors' memories and find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden while also attempting to prevent a catastrophic event, referencing the [[2012 phenomenon]], said to wipe out humanity by the end of 2012. From ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' to ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The most recent games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', and ''Valhalla'', follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.

The main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs, as well as the prioritising of role-playing mechanics in later titles. The series has received multiple awards and nominations, including multiple Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 200 million copies {{as of|2022|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the highest selling [[video game franchises]] of all time. While main titles are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games have been released for consoles, mobiles, and handheld platforms. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and novels have been also been published. A live-action film adaptation of the series, titled ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'', was released in 2016.

==Development history==
While the games in the series have had several narrative arcs, Ubisoft views the series as currently having three periods of development and design philosophy. Phase one, covering up to ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', featured games structured around single-player content, and while centering on open world spaces and several role-playing elements, were more action-adventure and stealth-oriented. Period two, covering from ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' to ''[[Assassin's Creed Mirage]]'', brought in more role-playing elements and live-service features to increase player engagement. Period three will launch with ''Assassin's Creed: Red'', using lessons from the second period of development to make engrossing single-player games similar to the original titles but with features to allow players to share achievements and content with others, all to be backed by the ''Infinity'' hub system.<ref name="GI Future">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/infinity-and-beyond-the-future-of-assassins-creed |title = Infinity and beyond: The future of Assassin's Creed | first= James | last= Batchelor | date = September 13, 2022 | accessdate= September 13, 2022 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>

===Phase One===
The first ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' game originated out of ideas for a sequel for Ubisoft's video game ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]]. The [[Ubisoft Montreal]] team decided to take the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open-world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the [[Prince (Prince of Persia)|Prince]] being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins]], based upon the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of [[Ismaili]], who were followers of [[Shia Islam]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|access-date=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=IGN|title=Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot Discusses Company's Past, Present, & Next-Gen Future – IGN Unfiltered #41|date=April 9, 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ewXj4RO5A&t=2109|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/a9ewXj4RO5A|access-date=April 10, 2019|archive-date=December 21, 2021|url-status=live|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Ubisoft developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin escorting a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|website=Edge|date=August 27, 2012|access-date=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref> or ''Prince of Persia: Assassins''.<ref name="polygon oral">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title= Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | access-date = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Ubisoft was apprehensive to a ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince, and basing it around the Assassins and the [[Knights Templar]] in the [[Holy Land]] during the 12th century. Additionally, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout history, they came onto the idea of [[Genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the Animus device and modern storyline elements. This further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting for when the player character is killed, similar to ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name="polygon oral" />

After ''Assassin's Creed'' was released in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal said they looked to "rework the global structure" in developing the sequel, ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''. They felt that parkour was underutilized in the first game and designed the world in the sequel to feature freerun highways to make it easier to enter into parkour moves, for example using rooftops to escape pursuits.<ref name="ign history">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/the-evolution-of-assassins-creed | title = The Evolution of Assassin's Creed: From the Holy Land to Valhalla | first = Matt | last = Purslow | date = July 9, 2020 | access-date =July 13, 2020 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> The change in setting meant that the game would feature a new cast of characters, including a new protagonist, [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]]. ''Assassin's Creed II'' also brought in more use of crowds to hide in plain sight that the developers had seen used in ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', adding more to the concept of social stealth as a gameplay option.<ref name="ign history" /> Finally, Ubisoft Montreal completely reworked the repetitive mission structure from the first game through numerous side activities, collectibles, and secrets. These additions became a central part of the series going forward as well as other Ubisoft games like ''[[Watch Dogs]]'', ''[[Far Cry]]'', and ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]''.<ref name="ign history" /> ''Assassin's Creed II'' was followed by two sequels, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'', which also featured Ezio as the main protagonist and introduced the ability for players to recruit [[NPCs]] as Assassins and manage them in missions.<ref name="ign history" />

''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' originated from both Ubisoft Montreal, who wanted to progress the series' narrative forward in time, and to an unattached project that had been developed at [[Ubisoft Singapore]] and featured naval ship combat. As the main team had settled into the [[American Revolution]] period for the game, they found the ship-to-ship combat system fitted with the story and redesigned the setting to incorporate it further. Another major change in ''Assassin's Creed III'' was transitioning the parkour and freerun systems to work in the natural woodlands of 18th-century [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. This further allowed the adding of trees and other vegetation within the city areas themselves, not just as part of the parkour systems, but to add more varied environments, which would continue as part of the series' ongoing design.<ref name="ign history" />

For ''Assassin's Creed III''{{'}}s sequel, ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', the Ubisoft team built upon the foundation of its predecessor, particularly with regards to the naval gameplay, merging it seamlessly with the land-based gameplay.<ref name="ign history" /> The team also used the game as a chance to address aspects of the series' storyline. Choosing to focus on an outsider's perspective to the Assassin–Templar conflict, they set the game around the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], with the protagonist, [[Edward Kenway]], initially starting out as a pirate who initially becomes involved in the conflict with the prospect of wealth. Similarly, after the conclusion of [[Desmond Miles]]' story arc in ''Assassin's Creed III'', the modern-day segments put players in the role of a nameless individual. The team chose this approach because they believed it allowed players to more easily identify themselves in their character.<ref name="ign history" /> This trend would continue in the series until ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]''.<ref name="ign history" />

Development of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' began shortly after the completion of ''Brotherhood'' in 2010,<ref name="GITenThings">{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Matt |date=June 11, 2014 |title=Ten Things You Need To Know About Assassin's Creed Unity |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_unity/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/11/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-assassin-s-creed-unity.aspx |url-status=dead |magazine=Game Informer |publisher=GameStop |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614141507/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_unity/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/11/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-assassin-s-creed-unity.aspx |archive-date=June 14, 2017 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}</ref> with the core development team splitting off during the early stages of development on ''Assassin's Creed III''.<ref name="GITechMatter">{{cite magazine |last=Cork |first=Jeff |date=August 22, 2014 |title=Assassin's Creed's Tech Master Leads Us Through The Series' History |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/08/22/assassin-s-creed-s-tech-master-leads-us-through-the-series-history.aspx?PostPageIndex=2 |magazine=Game Informer |publisher=GameStop |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> As the first game in the series to be released exclusively for the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]], ''Unity'' featured a graphical and gameplay overhaul.

===Phase Two===
After ''Syndicate'', Ubisoft recognized that the series needed a major reinvention across both gameplay and narrative. It was decided to make the next game, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'', closer to a [[role-playing video game]] than a [[stealth-action game]], which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles. Some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic. This changed how missions were presented — rather than being linearly directed through the Animus, the player character could meet various quest givers in the game's world to receive missions.<ref name="ign history" /> From the narrative side, Ubisoft placed the game before the formation of the Assassin Brotherhood in [[Ancient Egypt]] to make the player character, [[Bayek of Siwa]], a [[medjay]] that people would respect and seek the help of.<ref name="ign history" /> The modern-day storyline also shifted back to a single character, [[Layla Hassan]]. The developers limited the number of playable sequences for her character compared to previous games but gave them more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla's laptop with background information on the game's universe.<ref name="ign history" />

''Origins'' was followed in 2018 by ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', which shifted the setting to [[Classical Greece]] and followed a similar approach to its predecessor but with more emphasis on the role-playing elements.<ref name="ign history" /> 2020's ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', set in Medieval England and Norway during the [[Viking Age]], continued the same style as ''Origins'' and ''Odyssey''. The developers recognized feedback from the previous two games and brought back the social stealth elements, as well as the concept of a customizable home base that was first introduced in ''Assassin's Creed II''.<ref name="ign history" />

===Future===
In 2022, Ubisoft announced several additional games for the series. ''Assassin's Creed Infinity'' has been described by its executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, as a "new design philosophy" for the series,<ref name="GI Future" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Batchelor |first=James |date=September 13, 2022 |title=Infinity and beyond: The future of Assassin's Creed |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/infinity-and-beyond-the-future-of-assassins-creed |access-date=December 5, 2022 |work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref> as well as a hub that will provide the releases of future games.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/assassins-creed-infinity-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-assassins-creed-platform |title=Assassin's Creed Infinity: everything we know so far |first=Gerald |last=Lynch |date=August 22, 2022 |access-date=September 3, 2022 |work=[[Tech Radar]]}}</ref> The first two games to be included in ''Infinity'' will be ''Assassin's Creed: Red'', set in [[Feudal Japan]],<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Ed |date=September 10, 2022 |title=Assassin's Creed new game Codename: Red finally delivers fans' dreams |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-codename-red/assassins-creed-new-game-japan |accessdate=September 10, 2022 |work=[[PCGamesN]]}}</ref> and ''Assassin's Creed: Hexe'', rumoured to be set in Central Europe in the 16th century.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |last=West |first=Josh |date=September 10, 2022 |title=Assassin's Creed Hexe – Everything we know about the new flagship AC game |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-guide/ |accessdate=September 10, 2022 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Ubisoft also announced ''[[Assassin's Creed Mirage]]'', which is set before the events of ''Valhalla'' and is intended to bring the series back to its [[stealth game]]-oriented roots.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Assassins Creed 3 Gameplay segment.gif|thumb|An ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' demo showing the parkour gameplay]]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins. Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a [[diegetic]] interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission's target. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.<ref name="Alvarado 2012">{{cite web |last=Alvarado |first=Sebastian |date=April 11, 2012 |title=The Science Fact Animating Assassin's Creed's Animus |url=https://kotaku.com/the-science-fact-animating-assassins-creeds-animus-5901160 |access-date=December 27, 2022 |website=Kotaku }}</ref><ref name="Lizardi 2022">{{cite book|last=Lizardi|first=Ryan|year=2022|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Existential_Science_Fiction/bbVQEAAAQBAJ|title=Existential Science Fiction|edition=hardcover|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=xii, 111, 115–127|isbn=978-1-7936-4735-1}}</ref>

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[third-person view]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on stealth and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a leap of faith into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who, by nature of the Animus use, has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe, and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walton |first=Jarred |date=June 2, 2008|title=Assassin's Creed PC |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/2536 |access-date=December 27, 2022 |website=AnandTech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=November 14, 2018 |title=Eagle Vision |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/eagle-vision/3015-6193/ |access-date=December 27, 2022 |website=Giant Bomb }}</ref>

The games use the concept of active versus passive moves, with active moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, which can be used to perform surreptitious assassinations.<ref>{{cite web |last= Llewellyn |first=Michael |date=January 4, 2021|title=10 Assassin's Creed Game's Combat Systems Ranked |url=https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-games-combat-systems-ranked/ |access-date=December 27, 2022 |website=The Gamer}}</ref>

==Storyline==
[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|The logo of the fictional Abstergo Industries, whose slogan is "We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways."]]

=== Premise ===
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies: the [[Order of Assassins]], who represents freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represents order. Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of Pieces of Eden, artifacts that can override [[free will]] to control people.<ref name="gamespot story">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-odyssey-story-recap-everything-tha/2900-1422/ | title = Assassin's Creed Odyssey Story Recap: Everything That's Happened So Far And What To Know | first = Matt | last = Espineli | date = October 9, 2018 | website = GameSpot | access-date = June 2, 2020 }}</ref>

These artifacts are remnants of an [[ancient species pre-dating humanity]] called the Isu, or Precursors, which created humanity to live in peace alongside them. The Isu ensured humans could not rise against them by creating the Pieces of Eden to control them. When the first hybrid Isu-human beings emerged, named Adam and Eve, they were immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden. They stole the Pieces of Eden, which led to a great war that ended when a massive [[solar flare]] devastated the surface of the Earth. The Isu began to die out while humanity thrived. Three Isu—Minerva, Juno, and Jupiter—attempted to prepare humanity for a solar flare they knew would come centuries later. Minerva and Jupiter prepared vaults from which humanity could activate a protective shield around Earth with the Pieces of Eden and the Eye, a means to communicate how to find and use these vaults; however, Juno saw humanity as a threat and attempted to sabotage Minerva and Jupiter's plan. Minerva and Jupiter were forced to destroy Juno, unaware she had hidden her consciousness to wake upon activation of the Eye. All that remained of the Isu were the traces of their memories in the world's mythologies, and religions, while the Pieces of Eden were lost to time.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

The series takes place in the modern era, in which the Templars have established the [[mega-corporation]] Abstergo Industries. Abstergo has developed a device, the Animus, whose user can relive the memories of their ancestors through their genetic material. Abstergo has kidnapped people who are descendants of past Assassins to locate the missing Pieces of Eden via the Animus.<ref name="gamespot story"/> A user of the Animus can move about in simulated memories as their ancestor, but performing actions outside the bounds of what their ancestor did can lead to desynchronization of the memory.<ref name="Alvarado 2012"/><ref name="Lizardi 2022"/> Extended use of the Animus creates a bleeding effect that gives users some of the skills and capabilities they experienced with their ancestor.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Zachariah |date=June 19, 2019 |title=The Video Game Skills You Can Use In Real Life |url=https://junkee.com/bleeding-effect-video-game/210347 |access-date=December 27, 2022 |website=Junkee}}</ref>

The first five main games in the series focus on [[Desmond Miles]], a bartender who learns he is a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] from the Middle East during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] from the [[Italian Renaissance]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]] (better known as Connor), a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]]. Desmond is used by Abstergo to find Pieces of Eden but is freed by Lucy Stillman, an undercover agent for the Assassins. Lucy takes Desmond to meet Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, two other members of the modern-day Assassins. The group is joined later by William Miles, Desmond's father. They continue to explore Desmond's memories and eventually discover the Eye and Minerva's warning of another possible solar flare. They also inadvertently free Juno, who then kills Lucy, revealed to be a [[double agent]] for the Templars. The group continues to find the vaults across the globe via Desmond's memories, and Desmond ultimately activates them in time to block the solar flare, at the cost of his own life.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

Starting with ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', William goes into exile, while Shaun and Rebecca continue to monitor Abstergo by posing as employees of one of their spin-off companies, Abstergo Entertainment. Abstergo has refined the Animus technology to allow anyone to experience genetic memories from the DNA material of another person, allowing Abstergo to continue their search for the Pieces of Eden under the guise of creating entertainment products. In ''Black Flag'', the player assumes the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with scanning the memories of [[Edward Kenway]], a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] and Connor's grandfather. During their investigation, the player is blackmailed into helping a fellow employee, John Standish, recover sensitive information and deliver it to the Assassins. John is later revealed to be a Sage, a human reincarnation of Juno's husband [[Aita]], who is trying to resurrect her, though he is killed by Abstergo before his plan can come to fruition.<ref name="gamespot story"/> In ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]'', the player controls another Abstergo employee who is recruited by the Templars to clean their servers after the Assassins breach them and recover data on the life of [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], an Assassin-turned-Templar from the 18th century. The Assassins are ultimately forced to go underground once more, and the player character is invited to join the Templars.<ref name="gamespot story" />

By the time of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'', Abstergo distributes its Animus product via a video game console named Helix, tapping into an extensive, unaware player base to help them locate more Pieces of Eden and determine the fates of various Sages as part of the Phoenix Project, an attempt to recreate the genetic structure of the Isu. The Assassins locate select players and bring them in as Initiates to help their cause. In ''Unity'', the player character is contacted by an Assassin named Bishop and asked to experience the memories of [[Arno Dorian]], an Assassin active during the [[French Revolution]], so that the modern-day Assassins can locate the body of a Sage and hide it from Abstergo.<ref name="gamespot story"/> Despite the Assassins' efforts, Abstergo collects enough samples of other Sages by the start of ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'' to move forward with the Phoenix Project. Again, Bishop contacts the Initiate and asks them to explore the memories of [[Jacob and Evie Frye]], twin Assassins from [[Victorian era|Victorian England]], to locate a Piece of Eden known as the Shroud, which Abstergo needs to complete the process of recreating the Isu genetic structure. Although the Initiate manages to locate the Shroud, the Templars beat the Assassins to it.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

A new storyline is introduced in ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' focusing on Abstergo researcher Layla Hassan. Initially tasked with locating historical artifacts in Egypt, Layla stumbles upon the mummified corpses of the medjay [[Bayek]] and his wife Aya, co-founders of the Hidden Ones, the precursor organization to the Assassin Brotherhood. Against Abstergo's orders, Layla uses the Animus to relive Bayek's and Aya's memories, making her a target for the Templars, before being met by William Miles, who recruits her to the Assassins.<ref name="gamespot story"/> In ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', Layla recovers the Spear of [[Leonidas]], extracting the DNA of Leonidas' grandchildren, [[Alexios and Kassandra]]. Through their memories, Layla locates the Staff of [[Hermes Trismegistus]], another Piece of Eden, which is guarded by one of the siblings ([[Canon (fiction)|canonically]] Kassandra), still alive due to being sustained by the Staff. Kassandra relinquishes the Staff to Layla, who is prophesied to one day restore balance to the world, and who proves herself to be worthy of wielding the Staff.<ref name="gamespot story" /> In ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', Earth is facing yet another disaster, as its magnetic field has been continually strengthening since Desmond activated the Eye in 2012. Layla exhumes the remains of Eivor Varinsdottir, a 9th-century [[Viking]] raider, and from her memories, she learns of an Isu temple in [[Norway]]. Layla travels to the temple, using the Staff to protect herself from the radiation inside, and enters the Grey, a virtual world created by the Isu, where she meets both the Reader (implied to be Desmond's preserved consciousness) and Basim Ibn Ishaq, a Hidden One and Sage (the reincarnation of the Isu [[Loki]]) who was trapped in the Grey by Eivor. Basim helps Layla stop the disaster before escaping back to reality, where he uses the Staff to rejuvenate himself and meets the other modern-day Assassins.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gibson |first=Alex |date=November 19, 2020 |title=Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Story Summary |url=https://twinfinite.net/2020/11/assassins-creed-valhalla-story-summary-ending-explained/ |access-date=December 27, 2022|website=Twinfinite}}</ref>

===Main series===
====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
The first game in the series was released in November 2007 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and in April 2008 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It features a historical recreation of the [[Holy Land]] (primarily the cities of [[Masyaf]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and [[Damascus]]) in the late 12th century. Its narrative includes real historical figures and events from that time period. The storyline consists of two portions: one set during the modern-day, which follows [[Desmond Miles]]; and one set in 1191, which follows Desmond's ancestor, [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]], a member of the [[Assassin Order]] during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond's story begins with his abduction by pharmaceutical company Abstergo Industries, whose lead scientist, Dr. Warren Vidic, forces him to explore Altaïr's memories through a machine called the Animus that allows him to connect with his ancestors' DNA. In doing so, Abstergo hopes to find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden, which the Assassins and their rivals, the [[Knights Templar]], have fought over for centuries. Altaïr's story begins with his demotion to the rank of Novice Assassin after he botches an attempt by the Assassins to recover a Piece of Eden, the Apple of Eden, from the Templars. To redeem himself, Altaïr is tasked with assassinating nine Templar targets across the Holy Land.

''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained in the rest of the series. Players can freely explore the game's [[open world]], making use of Altaïr's [[parkour]] and climbing skills to navigate the environment. The game also features refined [[hack-and-slash]] combat, with players able to block and counter-attacks, and [[Stealth game|stealth]] mechanics, such as hiding in crowds of people, which allow players to avoid detection by enemies or lose pursuing foes. Although players can choose the order in which they kill their main targets, the mission design was seen as linear and repetitive because players had to complete several side quests before each assassination. The side quest prerequisite was one of the most criticized aspects of the game, so it was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
''Assassin's Creed II'' is a direct sequel to the first game and was released in November 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2010 for Windows, and in October 2010 for [[OS X]]. The modern-day narrative again follows Desmond, who escapes from Abstergo (revealed at the end of the previous game as a front for the modern-day Templars) with the aid of Assassin mole [[Lucy Stillman]] and is taken to her team's hideout. Hoping to train Desmond as an Assassin, they put him in the Animus 2.0, where he begins to suffer from the bleeding effect; this allows Desmond to gain his ancestors' skills, but it also damages his mind, as he begins to involuntarily experience flashes of his ancestors' memories outside of the Animus. Meanwhile, the main narrative takes place at the height of the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the late 15th century and follows Desmond's Italian ancestor [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], a young nobleman from [[Florence]] who is forced to become an Assassin after his father and brothers are killed by the Templars. During his journey to avenge their deaths, Ezio makes allies such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Caterina Sforza]] and combats enemies such as the [[Pazzi]] and [[Barbarigo family|Barbarigo]] families and [[Rodrigo Borgia]]. Ezio also comes into contact with technology left behind by the First Civilization, a race that created humanity and the Pieces of Eden and who were wiped out by a catastrophic event.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' incorporates historical events into its narrative and features recreations of several cities from the time period it is set in (in this case, Florence, [[Venice]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and [[Monteriggioni]]). Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions that can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The [[Villa Auditore]] in Monteriggioni, which acts as the Assassins' headquarters for most of the game, provides several functions that can be expanded on by paying for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
''Assassin's Creed Brotherhood'' is the sequel to ''Assassin's Creed II'', and was released in November 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2011 for Windows, and in May 2011 for OS X. The game begins immediately after the events of its predecessor, at the end of which Desmond was warned by Minerva, a member of the First Civilization, about a [[solar flare]] that will hit the Earth and kill humans in a few months. Desmond and his team travel to Monteriggioni, where they set up a new base and use the Animus to find the Temple of Juno, another First Civilization member, which houses Ezio's own Apple of Eden and the key to stopping the solar flare. The main narrative continues the story of Ezio, who travels to [[Rome]], the center of Templar power in Italy, to re-establish the Assassin Brotherhood there and defeat the [[Borgias]], who have attacked Monteriggioni and stolen the Apple of Eden.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in one city: Rome. Like the Villa Auditore, the player can spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city to increase the revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so. The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can recruit these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features [[online multiplayer]], in which players assume the role of Abstergo employees who, through the use of the Animus, relive the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archive-date=August 29, 2014 }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archive-date=December 1, 2017 }}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

''Assassin's Creed: Revelations'' is the final installment of the Ezio Trilogy and was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. Following the events of ''Brotherhood'', where he was possessed by Juno and forced to kill Lucy (who, unbeknownst to him, was a Templar [[double agent]]), Desmond has fallen into a [[coma]] and was put back into the Animus to save his mind. Within the computerized core of the Animus, Desmond meets the preserved consciousness of Abstergo's previous Animus test subject, [[Clay Kaczmarek]], who explains that Demond's mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or else he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond continues exploring the memories of Ezio, who, a few years after the events of ''Brotherhood'', travels to [[Constantinople]] to find five keys needed to open a vault built by Altaïr, which is said to contain the power to end the Assassin–Templar conflict. In Constantinople, Ezio becomes caught in a feud between the Ottomans and Byzantines and discovers that the Templars are also searching for the keys. The game also continues Altaïr's story after the first game, as the keys allow Ezio to witness Altaïr's memories to learn more about his life.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf to explore Altaïr's legacy and uncover the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood.<ref name="gamefaqs.gamespot.com">{{cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/997782-assassins-creed-lost-legacy|title = Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy for 3DS - GameFAQs}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/14/assassin-39-s-creed-lost-legacy-for-3ds-ended-up-being-ac-revelations.aspx | title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy for 3DS Ended up Being AC: Revelations| magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> ''Lost Legacy'' was later announced as cancelled on July 15, 2011, after Ubisoft decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original premise remained and evolved into the plot seen in the final game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archive-date=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting and an expanded Assassin recruitment system. The multiplayer mode returns in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps; players once again assume the role of Templars in training and as they level up and rise in the ranks, they are told more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}''Assassin's Creed III'' was released in October 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and in November 2012 for [[Wii U]] and Windows. A remastered version of the game with enhanced visuals was released for Windows, [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in March 2019 and for [[Nintendo Switch]] in May 2019. This is the final game in the series to follow Desmond, who travels to the First Civilization's Central Temple in [[New York (state)|New York]] with his friends and father to use the technology inside to prevent the solar flare set to hit the Earth in less than a month. To access this technology, Desmond must undertake several missions across the globe to retrieve 'batteries' to power the Temple, as well as an ancient key to the Temple's inner chambers. To find the latter, Desmond uses the Animus to relive the memories of two of his ancestors who were in possession of the key at various points in time: [[Haytham Kenway]], a [[British people|British]] Templar from the 18th century who travels to the [[American colonies]] to establish a strong Templar presence on the continent and find the Central Temple; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]] (later known as Connor), Haytham's half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] son, who becomes an Assassin to exact revenge on the Templars, whom he blames for the destruction of his village and the death of his mother in his youth. To this end, Connor later becomes involved in the [[American Revolution]], helping the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in exchange for their help in hunting down Haytham's faction of Templars, who hope to use the Revolution to further their own goals.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place in an open-world map based on Colonial [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]]. The game offers a large wilderness area in the form of the Frontier and the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles also debut in the series, wherein the player must steer a warship named the ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. The multiplayer mode from the previous two games returns in ''Assassin's Creed III'' with new game modes, characters, and maps inspired by Colonial America, but this time no major narrative elements are included.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' was released in October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U and in November 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Following the events of ''Assassin's Creed III'', at the end of which Desmond sacrificed himself to save the Earth, Abstergo retrieved samples from his body to continue exploring the memories of his ancestors. The player character is an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with analyzing the memories of [[Edward Kenway]], a famous 18th-century pirate and Connor's grandfather, ostensibly to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive feature film; in reality, Abstergo are searching for the Observatory, a First Civilization structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject to find them anywhere on the planet. As Edward, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] empires into locating the Sage — later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] — who is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory.

''Black Flag'' retains many gameplay mechanics from ''Assassin's Creed III'', including the ship-based exploration and combat. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of the game; players can captain Edward's ship, the ''Jackdaw'', and battle rival ships or hunt [[sea animals]]. The game includes a large open world spanning the [[West Indies]], with players able to explore the cities of [[Havana]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], and [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], as well as numerous islands, forts, and sunken ships. A multiplayer mode is once again included, although it is entirely land-based.

====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}
''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is the final game in the series to be developed for the [[seventh generation of consoles]], being released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014,<ref name="PolygonRogue" /> and for Windows in March 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rogue/b/xbox360/archive/2014/10/13/assassin-s-creed-rogue-coming-to-pc-in-2015.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue Coming To PC In 2015|last=Futter|first=Mike|publisher=GameStop|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=October 13, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014033536/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rogue/b/xbox360/archive/2014/10/13/assassin-s-creed-rogue-coming-to-pc-in-2015.aspx|archive-date=October 14, 2014}}</ref> A remastered version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018. In the present day, players again take on the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee, tasked with researching the memories of [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], an Assassin from the 18th century who, for reasons unknown to Abstergo, defected to the Templar cause. During their investigation, the player accidentally trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers. They must complete Shay's memories to clean the servers while Abstergo is put in lockdown. The main narrative takes place during the [[Seven Years' War]],<ref name="PolygonRogue">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft – here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|access-date=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archive-date=August 6, 2014}}</ref> and follows Shay, who starts out as a talented, but insubordinate Assassin trainee. After witnessing the Assassins' hypocrisy and willingness to sacrifice civilians in their blind pursuit of the Pieces of Eden, Shay betrays them and joins the Templar Order, helping his newfound allies hunt down members of his former Brotherhood to prevent them from endangering more innocent lives. Shay's story is set between the events of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' and ''Assassin's Creed III'', and is meant to fill the gaps between their respective narratives, while also having "a crucial link to the Kenway saga" according to Ubisoft, as well as to ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed – Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|magazine=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|access-date=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archive-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref> Several major characters from ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' make appearances in the game, such as [[Haytham Kenway]], Achilles Davenport, and [[Adéwalé]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|access-date=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archive-date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed Origins''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Origins}}

''Assassin's Creed Origins'' is a soft [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise, and was released in October 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Stadia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Ubisoft confirms Far Cry 5 and The Crew 2|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-16-ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-5-and-the-crew-2|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|access-date=May 22, 2017|date=May 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521024857/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-16-ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-5-and-the-crew-2|archive-date=May 21, 2017}}</ref> The game introduces a new protagonist in the modern-day, Layla Hassan, and explores the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood and their conflict with the Templar Order. The story is set in [[Ancient Egypt]], near the end of the [[Ptolemaic period]] (49–43 BC), and follows a [[medjay]] named [[Bayek]] and his wife Aya, whose fight to protect their people from the Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—leads them to create the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood. Unlike previous games in the series, which were more [[action-adventure game]]-oriented, ''Origins'' heavily features mechanics found in [[action role-playing game]]s, including an overhauled hitbox-based combat system.

In February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step "back and [re-examine] the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise ... [and take the] year to evolve the game mechanics and to make sure we're delivering on the promise of ''Assassin's Creed'' offering unique and memorable gameplay experiences."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/a-message-from-the-assassins-creed-team/|title=A Message From the Assassin's Creed Team|publisher=Ubisoft|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=February 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170815070514/http://blog.ubi.com/a-message-from-the-assassins-creed-team/|archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref> On the decision, Guillemot said that "Ubisoft started to question the annualized franchise with the release of ''Assassin's Creed Unity'', and the fact that ''Assassin's Creed Syndicate'' had "a slower launch than expected". Guillemot added that "by moving away from the annual iterations of the franchise, it will give the ''Assassin's Creed'' teams more time to take advantage of new engines and technology."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/ubisoft-confirms-no-assassins-creed-this-year|title=Ubisoft Confirms No Assassin's Creed This Year|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|website=IGN|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=February 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170815020753/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/ubisoft-confirms-no-assassins-creed-this-year|archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''{{'}}s director Ashraf Ismail, commented on an interview that he and the team would be interested in doing an ''Assassin's Creed'' game in an Ancient Egyptian setting, along with reiterating an earlier statement that a female leading character was not an impossibility for the series.<ref name="ACfuture">{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/assassins-creed-4-director-on-egypt-setting-future-of-franchise|title=Assassin's Creed 4 Director on Egypt Setting, Future of Franchise|last=Dyer|first=Mitch|website=IGN|date=October 10, 2013|access-date=October 10, 2013}}</ref> In May 2017, Ubisoft confirmed the development of ''Assassin's Creed Origins''; one month later, the setting was confirmed to be Ptolemaic Egypt.

The modern-day narrative continues from the events of ''Origins'', as Layla, after being recruited to the Assassins, searches for [[Atlantis]], which is rumored to house a powerful artifact: the Staff of Hermes. The main story is set during the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Ancient Athenian Empire|Athens]] and [[Sparta]], at the height of [[Classical Greece]]. Players choose between two playable protagonists, [[Alexios and Kassandra]], and embark on a quest to discover mysteries surrounding their family, as well as to undermine a proto-Templar organization: the Cult of Kosmos.

''Odyssey'' was leaked in May 2018 by a picture posted by the French website Jeuxvideo; it was officially announced at E3 2018, with a release date of October 2018. Similarly to ''Origins'', the game places more emphasis on role-playing elements than previous entries in the series and introduces dialogue options and branching quests, which can result in different endings.

{{main|Assassin's Creed Valhalla}}
''Assassin's Creed Valhalla'' was released in November 2020 for the PlayStation 4, [[PlayStation 5]], Xbox One, [[Xbox Series X/S]], Windows, Stadia, and [[Amazon Luna]]. The game concludes the modern-day story arc focusing on Layla, who must find a First Civilization temple in [[Norway]] to restore the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to its proper strength since Desmond's sacrifice in ''Assassin's Creed III'' only delayed the apocalypse. The main narrative takes place in the late 9th century, during the [[Viking expansions into the British Isles]]. Players control a customizable Viking raider, Eivor Varinsdottir, who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients while attempting to establish a new Viking clan in England.

''Valhalla'' was officially announced in April 2020.

''Assassin's Creed III: Liberation'' is a spin-off to ''Assassin's Creed III'', originally released for the [[PlayStation Vita]] in October 2012. The story takes place before and during the events of ''Assassin's Creed III'', and follows [[Aveline de Grandpré]], a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] woman from [[New Orleans]], the daughter of a French merchant father and an African mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/118/1188146p1.html |title=Gamescom: Assassin's Creed, Rayman on Vita – PSP News at IGN |date=August 16, 2011 |publisher=Psp.ign.com |access-date=August 15, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305213903/http://psp.ign.com/articles/118/1188146p1.html |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Aveline is recruited into the Assassin Brotherhood by a former slave and fights against slavery as well as the Templars, who plot to take over [[Louisiana]] after the end of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Aveline uses a variety of new weapons in combat, including a machete and a blowpipe for ranged attacks, and can disguise herself to deceive enemies, although certain disguises limit her movement and abilities. The entire game is presented as a product developed by the in-universe company Abstergo Entertainment, who have done a heavy amount of censoring in regards to the Assassin–Templar conflict. At various points during their playthrough, the player is contacted by the hacking collective Erudito, who helps them uncensor the game to learn the true nature of the events depicted.

An original ''Assassin's Creed'' title for the PlayStation Vita was announced to be in development during Gamescom 2011 and would feature a new story with new characters; on June 4, 2012, at E3, ''Liberation'' was officially announced.<ref name="Liberation announcement">{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/04/sony-announces-white-ps-vita-bundle-with-assassins-creed-iii-l/ |title=Sony announces white PS Vita bundle with Assassin's Creed III: Liberation |publisher=Engadget |access-date=August 15, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815232237/http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/04/sony-announces-white-ps-vita-bundle-with-assassins-creed-iii-l |archive-date=August 15, 2012 }}</ref> On September 10, 2013, it was announced that the game would be re-released as ''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD'' for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows via the [[PlayStation Network]], [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[Steam (service)|Steam]], respectively.<ref name="HD release">{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/assassins-creed-liberation-hd-release-date-pre-order-bonus/|title=ASSASSIN'S CREED LIBERATION HD – RELEASE DATE AND PRE-ORDER BONUSES|last=Lewis|first=Anne|work=UbiBlog|publisher=Ubisoft|date=October 24, 2013|access-date=October 24, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027202113/http://blog.ubi.com/assassins-creed-liberation-hd-release-date-pre-order-bonus/|archive-date=October 27, 2013}}</ref> In March 2019, it was announced that a remastered version of ''Liberation'' would be bundled with ''Assassin's Creed III Remastered'' for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and, later, for the Nintendo Switch.

''Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry'' was originally released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) for most versions of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' in December 2013.

During the events of ''Freedom Cry'', Adéwalé finds himself shipwrecked in the [[French colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), where he encounters some of the most brutal slavery practices in the [[West Indies]]. Being a former slave, Adéwalé temporarily abandons his fight against the Templars and joins a [[Maroons|Maroon]] rebellion to help them rescue oppressed slaves.

Being originally released as DLC for ''Black Flag'', ''Freedom Cry's'' gameplay is virtually identical, though it does feature several new additions. Most notably, Adéwalé has the option to rescue slaves by raiding plantations, attacking slave ships, or simply killing their masters, with each freed slave serving as a resource for the player to accumulate to unlock upgrades for Adéwalé. Furthermore, some freed slaves join the Maroon rebellion and can become crew members aboard Adéwalé's ship, the ''Experto Crede'', or help the player fight enemies.

In November 2011, a Ubisoft survey was sent out, asking participants which locations and time periods they would like to see in the "next ''Assassin's Creed'' games".

==== ''Assassin's Creed Mirage'' ====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Mirage}}

''Assassin's Creed Mirage'' is an upcoming game for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Luna, expected to release in 2023. Set in [[Baghdad]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], it will follow the character Basim Ibn Ishaq, introduced in ''Assassin's Creed Valhalla'', and his transition from street thief to Hidden One, a few decades before the events of ''Valhalla''. The game also intends to return to the series' roots by focusing on stealth, parkour, and assassinations over the role-playing elements featured heavily in recent installments.

In early 2022, it was reported that a new ''Assassin's Creed'' game, titled or code-named ''Rift'', was in development and expected to launch in late 2022 or early 2023. According to various leaks and reports, the game started out as an expansion for ''Valhalla'' starring Basim and was intended to be more akin to older games in the series, featuring a smaller setting and a bigger focus on stealth gameplay.<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 9, 2022 |title=Ubisoft Plans New Assassin's Creed Game to Help Fill Its Schedule  |work=Bloomberg News|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-09/ubisoft-plans-new-assassin-s-creed-game-to-help-fill-schedule |access-date=May 8, 2022}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=February 9, 2022 |title=Ubisoft reportedly has a smaller, stealth-focused Assassin's Creed game in the works |work=[[Eurogamer]] |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-has-a-smaller-stealth-focused-assassins-creed-game-in-the-works |access-date=May 8, 2022}}</ref> The game was officially confirmed by Ubisoft as ''Assassin's Creed Mirage'' on September 1, 2022,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.polygon.com/23332863/assassins-creed-mirage-confirmed-release-date-ubisoft |title=Ubisoft confirms Assassin's Creed Mirage after multiple leaks | work=Eurogamer.net | first = Owen S. | last = Good | date=September 1, 2022 | access-date=September 1, 2022}}</ref> followed by a full announcement during the Ubisoft Forward online event on September 10.<ref name=":3">{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-revealed-at-ubisoft-forward | title = Assassin's Creed Mirage Revealed at Ubisoft Forward | first = Matt | last = Purslow | work = [[IGN]] | date = September 11, 2022 | accessdate = September 11, 2022}}</ref>

''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' (2013) introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment, who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional universe. During the events of the game, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's 2014 video game ''[[Watch Dogs (video game)|Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees the playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped; it is implied this was done by the Assassin Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|title=Assassin's Creed 4 character crosses over to Watch Dogs|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer|date=June 2, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828061707/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|archive-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' (2017) mentions the news about Garneau's incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|title=More Evidence That Assassin's Creed And Watch Dogs Are Set in the Same Universe|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|website=Kotaku|date=October 28, 2017 |access-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142716/https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|archive-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

In August 2021, Ubisoft released a free update for their 2020 game ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'' that featured a non-canonical crossover with the ''Assassin's Creed'' series. The update introduced optional story content, which sees DedSec crossing paths with and subsequently helping Darcy Clarkson, a member of the modern-day Assassin Brotherhood and a descendant of [[Jacob and Evie Frye]].
