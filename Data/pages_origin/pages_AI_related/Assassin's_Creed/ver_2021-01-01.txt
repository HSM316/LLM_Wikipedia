'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[Open world|open-world]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Stealth game|stealth]] video game franchise published by [[Ubisoft]] and developed mainly by its studio [[Ubisoft Montreal]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]] and its more advanced derivatives. Created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]], and [[Corey May]], the ''Assassin's Creed'' series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through order and control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters]] intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while also playing as [[Desmond Miles]] or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets. The series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]], based on the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of the medieval Middle East,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|access-date=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|access-date=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref>

The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured eleven main games in total, the most recent being 2020's ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla|Valhalla]]''. Main games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. A new story and occasional new time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three-story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors. In games up until and including ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest three games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan.

The main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 155 million copies {{as of|2020|10|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games are released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted into a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]], which received negative reviews. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] have been published.

==History==
[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vidéotron, Québec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the 2018 title ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a 3D adaption of the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' games, which was made for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and other platforms. It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], based upon the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of [[Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name="polygon oral">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | access-date = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name="polygon oral"/>

Following release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name="polygon oral"/> Moving into ''[[Assassin's Creed 2]]'' the Ubisoft Montreal team recognized that parkour was underutilized in the first game, and designed the world in the sequel to feature "freerun highways" to make it easier to enter into parkour moves, using rooftops to escape pursuits or as part of an assassin ploy. The new parkour features helped to informed the game's Renaissance Italy setting and its playable character [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] as a rogue-ish figure.<ref name="ign history">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/the-evolution-of-assassins-creed | title = The Evolution of Assassin's Creed: From the Holy Land to Valhalla | first = Matt | last = Purslow | date = July 9, 2020 | access-date  =July 13, 2020 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed 2'' also brought in more use of crowds as part of a means to hide in plain sight that the developers had seen used in ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', adding more to the concept of social stealth as a gameplay option.<ref name="ign history"/> Finally, ''Assassin's Creed 2'' completely reworked the repetitive mission structure from the first game through numerous side activities, collectibles and other secrets. These additions became a central part of the series going forward as well as into other Ubisoft games like ''Watch Dogs'', ''Far Cry'' and ''Ghost Recon''.<ref name="ign history"/> The game was followed by two direct sequels based on Ezio's character.<ref name="ign history"/>

The origins for ''Assassin's Creed III'' had come both out of Ubisoft Montreal, which had planned to continue to progress the main narrative forward in time, and from an unattached project that had been developed out of [[Ubisoft Singapore]] that features naval ship combat. As the main team had settled into the [[American Revolution]] period for the game, they found this ship-to-ship combat system fit perfectly into the system, and worked setting to incorporate it further. Another major change in ''Assassin's Creed III'' was transitioning the parkour and freerun systems to work in the natural woodlands of 18th century New England, which further allowed for adding trees and other vegetation within the city areas themselves not only as part of the parkour systems but also to add to more realistic appearances, which would also continue as part of the series' ongoing design.<ref name="ign history"/>

After its release, the marketing team from Ubisoft commented that the ship combat of ''Assassin's Creed III'' was segmented off from the land-based game and felt that there could be more integration, which led to the idea of the next game ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' based on the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], reusing all of their past lessons on the series to date.<ref name="ign history"/> The team also used the game as a chance to address the narrative aspects of the story which had started to become stale in their eyes. They introduced [[Edward Kenway]], initially an outsider to the Assassins/Templars conflict that becomes involved only with the prospect of wealth at the end, giving the narrative team a means to present the conflict from an outside view.<ref name="ign history"/> Further, the present-day story had moved away from a single person (Desmond Miles) to allow any observer to use the Animus to experience the generic memories from another. The narrative team set this up to have the player feel more immersed and central to the events, eventually setting up for the concept of the Initiate that would come in ''Assassin's Creed Unity'' and ''Assassin's Creed Syndicate''.<ref name="ign history"/>

After ''Syndicate'' Ubisoft recognized that the series needed a major re-invention across both gameplay and narrative. By this point in time, available computers and consoles had enough processing power that they were able to create much larger maps, which required different mechanics from the original games. It was decided to make the next game, ''Assassin's Creed Origins'', closer to a [[role-playing video game]] than a stealth-action game, which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles, and some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic. This changes how missions were presented - rather than directed through the Animus, the player would need to take their character in the game's world to various quest givers to get these missions, which gave a reason for the player to explore the map.<ref name="ign history"/> From the narrative side, they placed the game prior to the formation of the Assassin's Order in Egypt as to avoid the need to have assassins drive the storyline, and made the playable character Bayek a [[medjay]] people would normally respect and seek the help of.<ref name="ign history"/> The contemporary storyline also shifted back to a single character, Layla Hassan, an Abstergo researcher. They limited the number of times the game's perspective shifts to her character compared to previous games but gave these segments more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla's laptop with background information on the state of Assassins to that point.<ref name="ign history"/> ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'' followed in a similar approach.<ref name="ign history"/>

''Assassin's Creed Valhalla'' continues the same style as ''Origins'' and ''Odyssey'' but recognizes feedback from the prior games, adding back in the social stealth elements, as well as the concept of a customizable home base that was first introduced in ''Syndicate''.<ref name="ign history"/>

==Gameplay==
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins, whose memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through the use of a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a [[Diegesis|diegetic interface]] to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as "desynchronization" of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a "leap of faith" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.

The games use the concept of "active" versus "passive" moves, with "active" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- "We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways."'' -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies – the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represents freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represents order. Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of "Pieces of Eden", artifacts that are capable of overriding [[free will]] to control people.<ref name="gamespot story">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-odyssey-story-recap-everything-tha/2900-1422/ | title = Assassin's Creed Odyssey Story Recap: Everything That's Happened So Far And What To Know | first = Matt | last =  Espineli | date = October 9, 2018 | access-date = June 2, 2020 }}</ref>

These artifacts are remnants of an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]] called the Isu, or Precursors, which created humanity to live in peace alongside them. The Isu ensured humans could not rise against them by creating the Pieces of Eden to control them. When the first hybrid Isu-human beings emerged, named Adam and Eve, they were immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden. They stole the Pieces of Eden, which led to a great war that ended when a massive [[solar flare]] devastated the surface of the Earth. The Isu began to die out while humanity thrived. Three Isu attempted to prepare humanity for a future solar flare they knew would come centuries in the future: Minerva, Juno, and Jupiter. Minerva and Jupiter prepared vaults, from which humanity could activate a protective shield around Earth with the Pieces of Eden, and the Eye, a means to communicate how to find and use these vaults to the future. Juno, however, saw humanity as a threat and attempted to sabotage Minerva and Jupiter's plan. Minerva and Jupiter were forced to destroy Juno, unaware she had hidden her consciousness to wake upon activation of the Eye. All that remained of the Isu were the traces of their memories in the world's mythologies and religions, the Pieces of Eden lost to time.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

The series itself takes place in the modern era, in which the Templars have established the [[mega-corporation]] Abstergo Industries. Abstergo has developed a device called the Animus that allows its user to relive the memories of their ancestors through their genetic material. Abstergo has kidnapped people who are descendants of past Assassins to locate the missing Pieces of Eden via the Animus. A user of the Animus is able to move about in simulated memories as their ancestor, but performing actions outside the bounds of what their ancestor did can lead to "desynchronization" of the memory. Further, extended use of the Animus creates a "bleeding effect" that gives the user some of the skills and capabilities they experienced with their ancestor.

Across the first three games of the series and their spin-offs, the series focuses on player-character [[Desmond Miles]], a bartender who learns he is a descendant of several Assassins including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] from the Middle East during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] from the [[Italian Renaissance]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]]. Desmond is used by Abstergo to find Pieces of Eden but is freed by Lucy Stillman, an undercover agent for the Assassins. Lucy takes Desmond to meet Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, two other members of the modern-day Assassins. The group is joined later by William Miles, Desmond's father. They continue to explore Desmond's memories and eventually discover the Eye and Minerva's warning of another possible solar flare. They also inadvertently free Juno, who then kills Lucy. The group continues to find the vaults across the globe via Desmond's memories, and Desmond is able to activate them in time to block the solar flare but at the cost of his own life.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

Starting with ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', William goes into exile, while Shaun and Rebecca continue to monitor Abstergo by posing as employees of one of their spin-off companies, Abstergo Entertainment. Abstergo Entertainment has refined the Animus technology to allow anyone to experience genetic memories from the DNA material of another person, allowing Abstergo to continue their search for the Pieces of Eden under the guise of creating a film. The unnamed player-character, a new employee of Abstergo Entertainment, is tasked with scanning the memories of Edward Kenway, a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] and the grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton, from Desmond's DNA. During this, the employee is instructed by an informant, John Standish, to hack into various Abstergo terminals and provide the information to Shaun and Rebecca. This is revealed to actually be in service to a plan by John to prepare the employee's body for possession by Juno, and that John is one of her Sages; human beings with part of Aita's unique genetic code.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

Abstergo distributes its Animus product via a video game console named "Helix" by the time of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'', tapping into an extensive, unaware player base to help them locate more Pieces of Eden and determine the fates of other Sages as part of the Phoenix Project, an attempt to recreate the genetic structure of the Isu. The Assassins begin locating select players and bringing them in as Initiates to help their cause. In ''Unity'', the player-character is contacted through Helix by an Assassin named Bishop and asked to experience the memories of the Assassin [[Arno Victor Dorian]] who lived during the [[French Revolution]], so the Assassins can locate the body of a Sage in the past to prevent Abstergo from obtaining it in the present.<ref name="gamespot story"/> Despite the Assassins' efforts, Abstergo collects enough samples of other Sages by the start of ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'' to move forward with the Phoenix Project. Again, the Assassin Bishop contacts the Initiate and asks them to use the memories of twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye from [[Victorian England]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]] to help locate a Piece of Eden known as the Shroud, which Abstergo needs to complete the process of recreating the Isu genetic structure. When the Initiate does locate the Shroud, Shaun and Rebecca race to recover it but are stopped by Abstergo and Master Templar Juhani Otso Berg, who escape with the Shroud.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

A new storyline is introduced in ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' focusing on Abstergo researcher Layla Hassan. Initially, Layla is tasked with locating historical objects in Egypt. Upon discovering the mummified corpses of the [[Medjay]] [[Bayek]] and his wife Aya from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], and against Abstergo's orders, Layla opts to use a portable Animus device to explore Bayek's and Aya's memories and discovers the origins of the Assassin Order. Layla's disobedience leads her to become a fugitive from Abstergo's forces, and she is met by William Miles who extends an offer for her to join the Assassins.<ref name="gamespot story"/> In ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', Layla recovers the Spear of [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] and extracts the DNA of Leonidas' grandchildren,  [[Alexios and Kassandra]]. Through their memories, Layla locates the Staff of Hermes, another Piece of Eden. Layla is surprised to find one of the siblings, renowned during the [[Peloponnesian War]] as the Eagle Bearer, is still alive due to being sustained by the Staff. The Eagle Bearer informs Layla that there must always be a balance between order (represented by organizations such as the Templars) and chaos (represented by organizations such as the Assassins), lest the prevailing of one side lead to the destruction of the world, and that she is prophesied to be the one to keep that balance. Layla proves herself worthy to take the Staff, and wards off Abstergo forces that had come to take the staff for themselves.

===Main series (desktop/console games)===

====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
Desmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Altaïr is demoted to a Novice of the Assassin Brotherhood by [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, and tasked with assassinating the nine Knights Templar, including [[Robert IV of Sablé]], to regain his former status. Altaïr discovers that Al Mualim is also a Templar and holds a Piece of Eden. When Altaïr defeats Al Mualim and recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe.

''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
Having escaped Abstergo with the aid of Assassin mole [[Lucy Stillman]], Desmond explores the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]]. Ezio trains as an Assassin to avenge his father and brothers, who were killed by order of a corrupt Templar official. He is aided by allies such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Caterina Sforza]], and combats enemies such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]]. When Ezio uses Borgia's Pieces of Eden, he discovers a hologram of a figure calling herself Minerva, who warns Desmond, through Ezio, of a disaster that destroyed her society and may soon destroy humanity.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
Desmond continues reliving Ezio's memories to try to identify the location of the Apple of Eden. After Monteriggioni is invaded and the Apple is stolen by [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son, Ezio works, alongside figures such as [[Niccolo Machiavelli]], to liberate Rome from Borgia influence and train other Assassins. Ezio eventually kills Cesare and recovers the Apple, taking it to hide under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond locates the Apple. As he picks it up, another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, appears, and forces Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so. The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archive-date=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archive-date=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. In Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio seeks in Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]] the five keys needed to open Altaïr's library. Ezio finds the city in a feud between brothers [[Selim I]] and the Templar-allied [[Şehzade Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. As Ezio finds the keys, he is able to use them to witness Altaïr's memories. When Ezio and his love interest Sofia go to the library in Masyaf, they find Altaïr's corpse and a Piece of Eden, and Ezio, understanding that he is a messenger to Desmond, speaks to him directly. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond through Ezio that the key to stopping the 2012 [[solar flare]], similar to the one that wiped out his society, lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Desmond wakes up, and heads to New York to save humanity.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf.<ref name="gamefaqs.gamespot.com">https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/997782-assassins-creed-lost-legacy</ref> Sections of the game's plot and premise later became the foundation for ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/14/assassin-39-s-creed-lost-legacy-for-3ds-ended-up-being-ac-revelations.aspx | title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy for 3DS Ended up Being AC: Revelations}}</ref> The story would find Ezio Auditore da Firenze traveling east to the Assassins' former stronghold in Masyaf, where he would have discovered the origins of the Assassin Order; with possible connections to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad's story from the first ''Assassin's Creed''.<ref name="gamefaqs.gamespot.com"/> At some point, Ezio would have traveled to Constantinople, although earlier than he ultimately does in ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

However, on July 15, 2011, ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'' was announced as cancelled. The reason behind the cancellation was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archive-date=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}

Desmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.

In the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent with allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], and of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]] (later nicknamed Connor), whose heritage is half Mohawk. Ratonhnhaké:ton witnesses Lee and his troops destroy his village; years later, Juno speaks to him through a Piece of Eden and instructs him to receive training from Achilles Davenport, a retired Assassin. Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo. Connor faces his father and kills Lee, ending the Templar threat and hides Haytham's stolen medallion which leads to the Temple. Desmond and his allies find the medallion in the present; in the Temple they find a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno and Minerva both appear, the latter warning Desmond not to use the sphere, since it will release Juno, who could threaten mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
Samples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage – later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] – who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.

In the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.

====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====

By March 2014, a game titled or code-named ''Comet'' was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name="KotakuUnity" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to ''Black Flag'', and would be the first to feature a Templar as the main protagonist, named Shay.  In May 2014, Guillemot stated that ''Assassin's Creed'' games would continue releasing on the last generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 "for the foreseeable future", despite the franchise moving to the current generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|title=Assassin's Creed Games Coming To PS3, Xbox 360 For 'Foreseeable Future'|last=Watts|first=Steve|website=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516215024/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|archive-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> On August 5, Ubisoft announced the game as ''Assassin's Creed Rogue''.

In December 2014, images and information leaked for a new ''Assassin's Creed'' game, titled or code-named ''Victory'', which was later confirmed by Ubisoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/next-years-big-assassins-creed-is-set-in-victorian-lond-1665343788|title=Next Year's Big Assassin's Creed Is Set in Victorian London [UPDATE]|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|date=December 1, 2014|access-date=December 4, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203051530/http://kotaku.com/next-years-big-assassins-creed-is-set-in-victorian-lond-1665343788|archive-date=December 3, 2014}}</ref> In May 2015, Kotaku leaked that ''Victory'' had been renamed ''Syndicate''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Next Assassin's Creed To Be Announced Next Week; Now Called Syndicate|url = http://kotaku.com/this-years-victorian-assassins-creed-will-be-announced-1702873301|access-date = May 7, 2015|first = Jason|last = Schreier|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150508204840/http://kotaku.com/this-years-victorian-assassins-creed-will-be-announced-1702873301|archive-date = May 8, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> On May 12, 2015, the game was officially announced by Ubisoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/12/8592867/assassins-creed-syndicate|title=Assassin's Creed Syndicate announced, set in Victorian London|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 12, 2015|access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> The [[PlayStation 4]] and the [[Xbox One]] version of the game was released on October 23, 2015, while the [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released on November 19, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-assassins-creed-syndicate-revealed-live-at-5pm-uk|title=Assassin's Creed: Syndicate launches 23rd October on PS4, Xbox One|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=May 12, 2015|access-date=May 13, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514231901/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-assassins-creed-syndicate-revealed-live-at-5pm-uk|archive-date=May 14, 2015}}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed Origins''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Origins}}

The story is set in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and follows a [[Medjay]] named Bayek, whose fight to protect his people, leads him to create the Secret Order the Assassins, with the game exploring the origin of their conflict with the Knights of Templar, serving as a prequel to the entire series.

In February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step "back and [re-examine] the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise...

====''Assassin's Creed: Embers''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Embers}}
The short film follows an elderly Ezio, living a peaceful life in the Tuscan countryside with his wife Sofia and his children Flavia and Marcello and writing his memoirs. One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio recounts his story of how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin (the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|Assassin's Creed II]]''), and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if "you lose your way". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.

''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance'' is a novel based on the ''Assassin's Creed'' series written by [[Oliver Bowden]] and published by [[Penguin Books]].

===''Assassin's Creed: Encyclopedia''===
[[UbiWorkshop]] released an encyclopedia of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series in 2011. Initially intended as an art book, the project gathered so much material that the company decided to expand it into an encyclopedia. It features works of artists, such as Craig Mullins, Tavis Coburn, 123Klan, Gabz and James NG. Artists were given creative freedom, as they were able to create a unique Assassin from the period of their choosing. The art book contains a "carte blanche" section, which is going to contain fan-submitted artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|title=Artists for hire|publisher=Ubiworkshop.com|access-date=October 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160318/http://www.ubiworkshop.com/artbook.html|archive-date=August 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|title=Your face-stabbing art could be featured in Assassin's Creed art book|publisher=GamesRadar|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117034023/http://www.gamesradar.com/your-face-stabbing-art-could-be-featured-in-assassins-creed-art-book/|archive-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

==Cultural impact==
Elements of ''Assassin's Creed'' have been introduced as content into other Ubisoft games and those from third parties.

''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, as the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment (who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional plot). During the game's plot, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's game ''[[Watch Dogs (video game)|Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter video game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped, it is implied that by the Assassin's Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|title=Assassin's Creed 4 character crosses over to Watch Dogs|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer|date=June 2, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828061707/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|archive-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed Origins'' mentions the news about Garneau's incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|title=More Evidence That Assassin's Creed And Watch Dogs Are Set in the Same Universe|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|website=kotaku.com|access-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142716/https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|archive-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>
