'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[Open world|open-world]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Stealth game|stealth]] video game franchise published by [[Ubisoft]] and developed mainly by its studio [[Ubisoft Montreal]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]] and its more advanced derivatives. Created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]], and [[Corey May]], the ''Assassin's Creed'' series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace and free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through order and control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters]] intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. In the majority of the games, players control a historical Assassin, while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin-Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. The series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]], based on the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of the medieval Middle East,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|access-date=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|access-date=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref>

The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the most recent being 2020's ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla|Valhalla]]''. Main games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]]. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration; unique to the series, the protagonists can use 'social stealth' to blend in with crowds of people, and use realistic [[parkour]] moves to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles (beginning with 2010's ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood|Brotherhood]]'') also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer game modes.

A new story and occasional new time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow [[Desmond Miles]], a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors' memories and find powerful artifacts called "Pieces of Eden", while also attempting to prevent [[2012 phenomenon|a catastrophic event said to wipe out humanity by the end of 2012]]. From ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'' and until ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo (a company used as a cover by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest three games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.

The main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. Recent titles have also been criticized for prioritising role-playing mechanics and [[Microtransaction|microtransactions]]. The ''Assassin's Creed'' series has received multiple awards and nominations, including several Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 155 million copies {{as of|2020|10|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. While main titles are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games have been released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] have been also been published. In 2016, a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|live-action film adaptation of ''Assassin's Creed'']] was released, receiving generally negative reviews from fans and critics.

==History==
[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vidéotron, Québec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the 2018 title ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'']]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a 3D adaption of the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' games, which was made for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and other platforms. It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], based upon the historical [[Hashashin]] sect of [[Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name="polygon oral">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title= Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | access-date = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and the [[Knights Templar]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name="polygon oral"/>

Following release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios used the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name="polygon oral"/> Moving into ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', the Ubisoft Montreal team recognized that parkour was underutilized in the first game, and designed the world in the sequel to feature "freerun highways" to make it easier to enter into parkour moves, using rooftops to escape pursuits or as part of an assassin ploy. The setting was changed from the dark and gritty 12th-century [[Holy Land]] to the more lively 15th-century [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]]. Although the title featured a new cast of characters, including a new protagonist, [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], who was more rogue-ish than the first game's [[Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad|Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]], it connected to its predecessor in multiple ways, including a continuation of the established modern-day plot and several references to Altaïr and other past Assassins.<ref name="ign history">{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/the-evolution-of-assassins-creed | title = The Evolution of Assassin's Creed: From the Holy Land to Valhalla | first = Matt | last = Purslow | date = July 9, 2020 | access-date =July 13, 2020 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed II'' also brought in more use of crowds as part of a means to hide in plain sight that the developers had seen used in ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', adding more to the concept of social stealth as a gameplay option.<ref name="ign history"/> Finally, ''Assassin's Creed II'' completely reworked the repetitive mission structure from the first game through numerous side activities, collectibles and other secrets. These additions became a central part of the series going forward as well as into other Ubisoft games like ''[[Watch Dogs]]'', ''[[Far Cry]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon|Ghost Recon]]''.<ref name="ign history"/>

After its release in 2009, ''Assassin's Creed II'' was met with critical acclaim and was seen as an improvement over the first game in both gameplay and writing. Due to the popularity of both Ezio's character and the Renaissance setting, Ubisoft Montreal decided to follow the game with a direct sequel, ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'', which was developed in under a year, releasing in 2010. The game built upon ''Assassin's Creed II''<nowiki/>'s gameplay and storyline, and saw the introduction of a multiplayer mode to the series, as well as the titular Brotherhood system, which allowed players to recruit and train [[Non-player character|NPCs]] as Assassins. The open world format was also changed; rather than featuring several smaller cities like the past two games, ''Brotherhood'' is primarily set in the city of [[Rome]], which was the largest and most detailed setting in the series at the time.<ref name="ign history" /> ''Brotherhood'' was followed in 2011 by ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'', which served as a conclusion to the stories of both Ezio, who was again the main protagonist, and Altaïr. The game was developed by Ubisoft Montreal with help from a few other Ubisoft studios in the time span of several months, and borrowed many ideas and concepts from ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', a [[Nintendo 3DS]] spin-off that had been announced at [[E3 2010]] and later quietly cancelled.<ref name="ign history" />

Work on ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' began shortly after ''II''<nowiki/>'s release. The game's origins can be traced back to both Ubisoft Montreal, who wanted to progress the series' narrative forward in time, and to an unattached project that had been developed at [[Ubisoft Singapore]] and featured naval ship combat. As the main team had settled into the [[American Revolution]] period for the game, they found this ship-to-ship combat system fit perfectly into the system, and worked setting to incorporate it further. Another major change in ''Assassin's Creed III'' was transitioning the parkour and freerun systems to work in the natural woodlands of 18th-century New England, which further allowed for adding trees and other vegetation within the city areas themselves not only as part of the parkour systems but also to add to more realistic appearances, which would also continue as part of the series' ongoing design.<ref name="ign history" />

After the game's release in 2012, the marketing team from Ubisoft commented that the ship combat of ''Assassin's Creed III'' was segmented off from the land-based game and felt that there could be more integration, which led to the idea of the next game, ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', based on the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], reusing all of their past lessons on the series to date.<ref name="ign history" /> The team also used the game as a chance to address the narrative aspects of the story which had started to become stale in their eyes. The new protagonist, [[Edward Kenway]], starts out as a [[Piracy|pirate]] and an outsider to the Assassin-Templar conflict, becoming involved only with the prospect of wealth at the end, which gave the narrative team a means to present the conflict from an outside view. To connect the game to the storyline of the rest of the series, Edward was conceived as the grandfather of ''Assassin's Creed III''<nowiki/>'s main protagonist, [[Ratonhnhaké:ton|Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor]], and father of its antagonist, [[Haytham Kenway]].<ref name="ign history" /> After [[Kill off|killing off]] the series' protagonist, [[Desmond Miles]], at the end of ''Assassin's Creed III'', the narrative team decided that, rather than introducing a new character to take his place, the modern-day part of the story would be played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] and would feature no dialogue for its protagonist, to allow players to identify themselves in their character.<ref name="ign history" /> This trend would continue for the next three games in the series: ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue|Rogue]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity|Unity]]'', and ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate|Syndicate]]''.<ref name="ign history" />

After ''Syndicate'', Ubisoft recognized that the series needed a major re-invention across both gameplay and narrative. By this point in time, available computers and consoles had enough processing power that they were able to create much larger maps, which required different mechanics from the original games. It was decided to make the next game, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'', closer to a [[role-playing video game]] than a stealth-action game, which would also bring a game with many more hours of play than previous titles, and some long-standing features of the series were eliminated for this purpose, such as the social stealth mechanic. This changes how missions were presented - rather than directed through the Animus, the player would need to take their character in the game's world to various quest givers to get these missions, which gave a reason for the player to explore the map.<ref name="ign history" /> From the narrative side, they placed the game prior to the formation of the Assassin's Order in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] in the 1st century BC as to avoid the need to have assassins drive the storyline, and made the playable character, [[Bayek of Siwa|Bayek]], a [[medjay]] people would normally respect and seek the help of.<ref name="ign history" /> The contemporary storyline also shifted back to a single character, Layla Hassan, an Abstergo researcher. They limited the number of times the game's perspective shifts to her character compared to previous games but gave these segments more meaning, such as allowing the player to explore Layla's laptop with background information on the state of Assassins to that point.<ref name="ign history" />

''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', set in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 5th century BC, followed in a similar approach, but put even more emphasis on its role-playing elements, removing ''Origins''<nowiki/>' stealth elements almost entirely, and introducing choices that can alter the narrative in major ways.<ref name="ign history" /> ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', set in Medieval England and Norway during the [[Viking Age]] in the 9th century AD, continued the same style as ''Origins'' and ''Odyssey'', but the developers recognized feedback from the prior games and added back in the social stealth elements, as well as the concept of a customizable home base that was first introduced in ''Assassin's Creed II''.<ref name="ign history" />

Following another round of sexual misconduct allegations and internal investigation across Ubisoft in 2020 and 2021, which saw the departure of many top-level executives as well as attrition from its studios, Ubisoft opted to merge operations of the Montreal and Quebec studios under one administrative body in April 2021, with Quebec taking the lead on the ''Assassin's Creed'' series. This led towards collaboration to develop the live-service, codenamed ''Assassin's Creed Infinite'', which is expected to offer continual ongoing content similar to ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]''.<ref name="bloomberg acinf"/>

==Gameplay==
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins, whose memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through the use of a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a [[Diegesis|diegetic interface]] to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as "desynchronization" of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest.

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a "leap of faith" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.

The games use the concept of "active" versus "passive" moves, with "active" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.

The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies – the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represents freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represents order. Versions of these societies have existed for centuries, with the Assassins seeking to stop the Templars from gaining control of "Pieces of Eden", artifacts that are capable of overriding [[free will]] to control people.<ref name="gamespot story">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-odyssey-story-recap-everything-tha/2900-1422/ | title = Assassin's Creed Odyssey Story Recap: Everything That's Happened So Far And What To Know | first = Matt | last = Espineli | date = October 9, 2018 | access-date = June 2, 2020 }}</ref>

These artifacts are remnants of an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]] called the Isu, or Precursors, which created humanity to live in peace alongside them. The Isu ensured humans could not rise against them by creating the Pieces of Eden to control them. When the first hybrid Isu-human beings emerged, named Adam and Eve, they were immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden. They stole the Pieces of Eden, which led to a great war that ended when a massive [[solar flare]] devastated the surface of the Earth. The Isu began to die out while humanity thrived. Three Isu attempted to prepare humanity for a future solar flare they knew would come centuries in the future: Minerva, Juno, and Jupiter. Minerva and Jupiter prepared vaults, from which humanity could activate a protective shield around Earth with the Pieces of Eden, and the Eye, a means to communicate how to find and use these vaults to the future. Juno, however, saw humanity as a threat and attempted to sabotage Minerva and Jupiter's plan. Minerva and Jupiter were forced to destroy Juno, unaware she had hidden her consciousness to wake upon activation of the Eye. All that remained of the Isu were the traces of their memories in the world's mythologies and religions, the Pieces of Eden lost to time.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

The series itself takes place in the modern era, in which the Templars have established the [[mega-corporation]] Abstergo Industries. Abstergo has developed a device called the Animus that allows its user to relive the memories of their ancestors through their genetic material. Abstergo has kidnapped people who are descendants of past Assassins to locate the missing Pieces of Eden via the Animus. A user of the Animus is able to move about in simulated memories as their ancestor, but performing actions outside the bounds of what their ancestor did can lead to "desynchronization" of the memory. Further, extended use of the Animus creates a "bleeding effect" that gives the user some of the skills and capabilities they experienced with their ancestor.

Across the first three games of the series and their spin-offs, the series focuses on player-character [[Desmond Miles]], a bartender who learns he is a descendant of several Assassins including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] from the Middle East during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] from the [[Italian Renaissance]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]]. Desmond is used by Abstergo to find Pieces of Eden but is freed by Lucy Stillman, an undercover agent for the Assassins. Lucy takes Desmond to meet Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, two other members of the modern-day Assassins. The group is joined later by William Miles, Desmond's father. They continue to explore Desmond's memories and eventually discover the Eye and Minerva's warning of another possible solar flare. They also inadvertently free Juno, who then kills Lucy. The group continues to find the vaults across the globe via Desmond's memories, and Desmond is able to activate them in time to block the solar flare but at the cost of his own life.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

Starting with ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]'', William goes into exile, while Shaun and Rebecca continue to monitor Abstergo by posing as employees of one of their spin-off companies, Abstergo Entertainment. Abstergo Entertainment has refined the Animus technology to allow anyone to experience genetic memories from the DNA material of another person, allowing Abstergo to continue their search for the Pieces of Eden under the guise of creating a film. The unnamed player-character, a new employee of Abstergo Entertainment, is tasked with scanning the memories of Edward Kenway, a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] and the grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton, from Desmond's DNA. During this, the employee is instructed by an informant, John Standish, to hack into various Abstergo terminals and provide the information to Shaun and Rebecca. This is revealed to actually be in service to a plan by John to prepare the employee's body for possession by Juno, and that John is one of her Sages; human beings with part of Aita's unique genetic code.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

Abstergo distributes its Animus product via a video game console named "Helix" by the time of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'', tapping into an extensive, unaware player base to help them locate more Pieces of Eden and determine the fates of other Sages as part of the Phoenix Project, an attempt to recreate the genetic structure of the Isu. The Assassins begin locating select players and bringing them in as Initiates to help their cause. In ''Unity'', the player-character is contacted through Helix by an Assassin named Bishop and asked to experience the memories of the Assassin [[Arno Victor Dorian]] who lived during the [[French Revolution]], so the Assassins can locate the body of a Sage in the past to prevent Abstergo from obtaining it in the present.<ref name="gamespot story"/> Despite the Assassins' efforts, Abstergo collects enough samples of other Sages by the start of ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'' to move forward with the Phoenix Project. Again, the Assassin Bishop contacts the Initiate and asks them to use the memories of twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye from [[Victorian England]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]] to help locate a Piece of Eden known as the Shroud, which Abstergo needs to complete the process of recreating the Isu genetic structure. When the Initiate does locate the Shroud, Shaun and Rebecca race to recover it but are stopped by Abstergo and Master Templar Juhani Otso Berg, who escape with the Shroud.<ref name="gamespot story"/>

A new storyline is introduced in ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' focusing on Abstergo researcher Layla Hassan. Initially, Layla is tasked with locating historical objects in Egypt. Upon discovering the mummified corpses of the [[Medjay]] [[Bayek]] and his wife Aya from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], and against Abstergo's orders, Layla opts to use a portable Animus device to explore Bayek's and Aya's memories and discovers the origins of the Assassin Order. Layla's disobedience leads her to become a fugitive from Abstergo's forces, and she is met by William Miles who extends an offer for her to join the Assassins.<ref name="gamespot story"/> In ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', Layla recovers the Spear of [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]] and extracts the DNA of Leonidas' grandchildren, [[Alexios and Kassandra]]. Through their memories, Layla locates the Staff of Hermes, another Piece of Eden, which is guarded by one of the siblings, still alive due to being sustained by the Staff. They inform Layla that there must always be a balance between order (represented by organizations such as the Templars) and chaos (represented by organizations such as the Assassins), lest the prevailing of one side lead to the destruction of the world, and that she is prophesied to be the one to keep that balance. Layla proves herself worthy to take the Staff, and wards off Abstergo forces that had come to take the staff for themselves. In ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'', Earth is facing yet another possible disaster as its [[Magnetic field of earth|magnetic field]] has been continually strengthening since Desmond stopped the solar flare in 2012. Through the memories of 9th century [[Vikings|Viking]] raider Eivor Varinsdottir, Layla discovers the location of an Isu supercomputer in [[Norway]], which she uses to stop the disaster, with help from a being called the Reader (implied to be Desmond's preserved consciousness). However, in the process Layla releases the rogue Assassin Basim Ibn Ishaq (the reincarnation of the Isu [[Loki]]), who was trapped within a simulation-like dimension by Eivor, and she herself is transported into the simulation.

===Main series===

====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
The first game in the series was released in November 2007 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and in April 2008 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It features a historical recreation of the [[Holy Land]] (primarily the cities of [[Masyaf]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and [[Damascus]]) in the late 12th century, and its narrative includes real historical figures and events from that time period. The storyline consists of two portions: one set during the modern-day, which follows [[Desmond Miles]]; and one set in 1191, which follows Desmond's ancestor, [[Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad]], a member of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassin Brotherhood]] during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond's story begins with his abduction by pharmaceutical company Abstergo Industries, whose lead scientist, Dr. Warren Vidic, forces him to explore Altaïr's memories through a machine called the Animus that allows him to connect with his ancestors' DNA. In doing so, Abstergo hopes to find powerful artifacts called Pieces of Eden, which the Assassins and their rivals, the [[Knights Templar]], have fought over for centuries. Altaïr's story begins with his demotion to the rank of Novice Assassin after he botches an attempt by the Assassins to recover a Piece of Eden, the Apple of Eden, from the Templars. To redeem himself, Altaïr is tasked with assassinating nine Templar targets across the Holy Land.

''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained in the rest of the series. Players can freely explore the game's [[open world]], making use of Altaïr's [[parkour]] and climbing skills to navigate the environment. The game also features a refined [[hack and slash]] combat, with players able to block and counter attacks, and [[Stealth game|stealth]] mechanics, such as hiding in crowds of people, which allow players to avoid detection by enemies or lose pursuing foes. Although players can choose the order in which they kill their main targets, the mission design was seen as linear and repetitive, due to players having to complete a number of side quests before each assassination. The side quest prerequisite was one of the most criticized aspects of the game, and so it was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
''Assassin's Creed II'' is a direct sequel to the first game, and was released in November 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2010 for Windows, and in October 2010 for [[OS X]]. The modern-day narrative again follows Desmond, who escapes from Abstergo (revealed at the end of the previous game as a front for the modern-day Templars) with the aid of Assassin mole [[Lucy Stillman]] and is taken to her team's hideout. Hoping to train Desmond as an Assassin, they put him in the Animus 2.0, where he begins to suffer from the "bleeding effect"; this allows Desmond to gain his ancestors' skills, but it also damages his mind, as he begins to involuntarily experience flashes of his ancestors' memories outside of the Animus. Meanwhile, the main narrative takes place at the height of the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the late 15th century, and follows Desmond's Italian ancestor [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], a young nobleman from [[Florence]] who is forced to become an Assassin after his father and brothers are killed by the Templars. During his journey to avenge their deaths, Ezio makes allies such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Caterina Sforza]], and combats enemies such as the [[Pazzi]] and [[Barbarigo family|Barbarigo]] families and [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]]. Ezio also comes into contact with technology left behind by the First Civilization, a race that created humanity and the Pieces of Eden, and who were wiped out by a catastrophic event.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' incorporates historical events into its narrative, and features recreations of several cities from the time period it is set in (in this case, Florence, [[Venice]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and [[Monteriggioni]]). Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The [[Villa di Maiano|Villa Auditore]] in Monteriggioni, which acts as the Assassins' headquarters for most of the game, provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
''Assassin's Creed Brotherhood'' is the sequel to ''Assassin's Creed II'', and was released in November 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2011 for Windows, and in May 2011 for OS X. The game begins immediately after the events of its predecessor, at the end of which Desmond was warned by Minerva, a member of the First Civilization, about a [[solar flare]] that will hit the Earth and kill humanity in a few months. Desmond and his team travel to Monteriggioni, where they set up a new a base and use the Animus to find the temple of Juno, another First Civilization member, which houses Ezio's own Apple of Eden and the key to stopping the solar flare. The main narrative continues the story of Ezio, who travels to [[Rome]], the center of Templar power in Italy, to re-establish the Assassin Brotherhood there and defeat the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]], who have attacked Monteriggioni and stolen the Apple of Eden.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in one city: Rome. Similar to the Villa Auditore, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so. The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archive-date=August 29, 2014 }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archive-date=December 1, 2017 }}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

''Assassin's Creed: Revelations'' is the final installment of the "Ezio Trilogy", and was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. Following the events of ''Brotherhood'', where he was possessed by Juno and forced to kill Lucy (who, unbeknownst to him, was a Templar [[double agent]]), Desmond has fallen into a [[coma]] and was put back into the Animus to save his mind. Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Desmond meets the preserved consciousness of Abstergo's previous Animus test subject, [[Clay Kaczmarek]], who explains that Demond's mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or else he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond continues exploring the memories of Ezio, who, a few years after the events of ''Brotherhood'', travels to [[Constantinople]] to find five keys needed to open a vault built by Altaïr, which is said to contain the power to end the Assassin-Templar conflict. In Constantinople, Ezio becomes caught in a feud between the Ottomans and Byzantines, and discovers that the Templars are also searching for the keys. The game also continues Altaïr's story after the first game, as the keys allow Ezio to witness Altaïr's memories to learn more about his life.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf to explore Altaïr's legacy and uncover the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood.<ref name="gamefaqs.gamespot.com">{{cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/997782-assassins-creed-lost-legacy|title = Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy for 3DS - GameFAQs}}</ref> Sections of the game's plot and premise later became the foundation for ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/14/assassin-39-s-creed-lost-legacy-for-3ds-ended-up-being-ac-revelations.aspx | title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy for 3DS Ended up Being AC: Revelations| magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> However, on July 15, 2011, ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'' was announced as cancelled. The reason behind the cancellation was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archive-date=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}''Assassin's Creed III'' was released in October 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in November 2012 for [[Wii U]] and Windows. A remastered version of the game with enhanced visuals was released for Windows, [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in March 2019, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] in May 2019. This is the final game in the series to follow Desmond, who travels to the First Civilization's central temple in [[New York (state)|New York]] with his friends and father to stop the solar flare that will hit the Earth in less than a month. Inside, they discover advanced technology that could help them achieve this, but they need to acquire power sources to power the temple, including one in the possession of Abstergo, leading to a final confrontation between Desmond and his former captors. During this time, Desmond enters the Animus several times to deal with his [[Fugue state|dissociative fugue]], and experiences the memories of his ancestor, [[Haytham Kenway]], a [[British people|British]] Templar from the 18th century who is sent to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] to establish a strong Templar presence on the continent and find the First Civilization's central temple. Later, the perspective changes to Haytham's half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] son [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]] (later nicknamed "Connor"), who becomes an Assassin after his village destroyed, seemingly on the orders of the Templar [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. After training under the retired Assassin Mentor Achilles Davenport, Connor seeks revenge against Lee, and becomes involved in the [[American Revolution]], which leads him to ally with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Revolutionaries]] led by [[George Washington]] and battle the Templar Order, now led by his father.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place in an open-world map based on Colonial [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]]. The game offers a large wilderness area in the form of the Frontier and the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and feature actual missions that the player must undertake to progress through the story.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' was released in October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U, and in November 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Following the events of ''Assassin's Creed III'', at the end of which Desmond sacrificed himself to save the Earth, Abstergo has retrieved samples from his body to continue exploring the memories of his ancestors. The player character is an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with analyzing the memories of [[Edward Kenway]], a famous 18th century pirate and Connor's grandfather, ostensibly to gather material for an Animus-powered video game; in reality, however, Abstergo are searching for the Observatory, a First Civilization structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject to find them anywhere on the planet. As Edward, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the "Sage" – later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] – who is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory.

''Black Flag'' retains many gameplay mechanics from ''Assassin's Creed III'', including the ship-based exploration and combat. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of the game; players can captain Edward's ship, the ''Jackdraw'', and battle rival ships or hunt [[Aquatic animal|sea animals]]. The game includes a large open world spanning the [[West Indies]], with players able to explore the cities of [[Havana]], [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], and [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], as well as numerous islands, forts, and sunken ships.

====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}
''Assassin's Creed Rogue'' is the final game in the series to be developed for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]], being released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014,<ref name="PolygonRogue" /> and for Windows in March 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rogue/b/xbox360/archive/2014/10/13/assassin-s-creed-rogue-coming-to-pc-in-2015.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue Coming To PC In 2015|last=Futter|first=Mike|publisher=GameStop|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|date=October 13, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014033536/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rogue/b/xbox360/archive/2014/10/13/assassin-s-creed-rogue-coming-to-pc-in-2015.aspx|archive-date=October 14, 2014}}</ref> A remastered version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018. In the present-day, players again take on the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee, who is tasked researching the memories of [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], an Assassin from the 18th century who defected to the Templars. During their investigation, the player accidentally trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers, and must complete Shay's memories to clean the servers while Abstergo is put in lockdown. The main narrative takes place during the [[Seven Years' War]],<ref name="PolygonRogue">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft – here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|access-date=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archive-date=August 6, 2014}}</ref> and follows Shay, who, after becoming disillusioned with the Assassins' tactics, joins the Templars and helps them hunt down former members of his Brotherhood during their search for the Pieces of Eden. The story is set between the events of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' and ''Assassin's Creed III'', and is meant to "fill the gaps" between their respective narratives, while also having "a crucial link to the Kenway saga", as well as to ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed – Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|magazine=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|access-date=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archive-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref> Several major characters from ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' make appearances in the game, such as [[Haytham Kenway]], Achilles Davenport, and [[Adéwalé]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|access-date=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archive-date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

In March 2014, a new ''Assassin's Creed'' game code-named ''Comet'' was revealed to be in development for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, set to release later that year alongside ''Unity''.<ref name="KotakuUnity" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 [[New York City]], and would feature sailing on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The game would be a direct sequel to ''Black Flag'', and would be the first to feature a Templar as the main protagonist, named Shay. In May 2014, Guillemot stated that ''Assassin's Creed'' games would continue releasing on the last generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 "for the foreseeable future", despite the franchise moving to the current generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with ''Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|title=Assassin's Creed Games Coming To PS3, Xbox 360 For 'Foreseeable Future'|last=Watts|first=Steve|website=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|access-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516215024/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/assassins-creed-games-coming-to-ps3-xbox-360-for-foreseeable-future|archive-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> On August 5, Ubisoft announced the game as ''Assassin's Creed Rogue''. In addition to being a sequel to ''Black Flag'', the game also retains most of its gameplay mechanics, including the ship-based exploration and combat. Although a few new features were added, ''Rogue'' was ultimately criticized for having too many similarities to ''Black Flag'' and failing to innovate the series' formula.

====''Assassin's Creed Unity''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed Unity}}
''Assassin's Creed Unity'' was released in November 2014 (concurrently with ''Rogue'') for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]].<ref name="UnityNewRelease">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/28/assassins-creed-unity-release-date-delayed-to-november|title=Assassin's Creed Unity Release Date Delayed To November|last=Karmali|first=Luke|website=IGN|date=August 28, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830032832/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/28/assassins-creed-unity-release-date-delayed-to-november|archive-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> In the present-day, the player character is a player of Helix, an Animus-powered gaming device produced by Abstergo, who hope to use their unware playerbase to locate more Pieces of Eden.

''Assassin's Creed Origins'' is a soft [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise, and was released in October 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Stadia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Ubisoft confirms Far Cry 5 and The Crew 2|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-16-ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-5-and-the-crew-2|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|access-date=May 22, 2017|date=May 16, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521024857/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-16-ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-5-and-the-crew-2|archive-date=May 21, 2017}}</ref> The game introduces a new protagonist in the modern-day, Layla Hassan, and explores the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood and their conflict with the Templar Order. The story is set in [[Ancient Egypt]], near the end of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]] (49–43 BC), and follows a [[Medjay]] named [[Bayek of Siwa|Bayek]] and his wife Aya, whose fight to protect their people from the Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—leads them to create the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood. The game features a large open world, and puts more emphasis on the series' [[role-playing]] elements, introducing an overhauled "hitbox-based" combat system.

In February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step "back and [re-examine] the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise...

Guillemot added that "by moving away from the annual iterations of the franchise, it will give the ''Assassin's Creed'' teams more time to take advantage of new engines and technology".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/ubisoft-confirms-no-assassins-creed-this-year|title=UBISOFT CONFIRMS NO ASSASSIN'S CREED THIS YEAR|last=Macy|first=Seth G.|website=IGN|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=February 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170815020753/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/11/ubisoft-confirms-no-assassins-creed-this-year|archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''{{'}}s director Ashraf Ismail, commented on an interview that he and the team would be interested in doing an ''Assassin's Creed'' game in an Ancient Egyptian setting, along with reiterating an earlier statement that a female leading character was not an impossibility for the series.<ref name="ACfuture">{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/assassins-creed-4-director-on-egypt-setting-future-of-franchise|title=Assassin's Creed 4 Director on Egypt Setting, Future of Franchise|last=Dyer|first=Mitch|website=IGN|date=October 10, 2013|access-date=October 10, 2013}}</ref> In May 2017, Ubisoft confirmed the development of ''Assassin's Creed Origins''; one month later, the setting was confirmed to be Ptolemaic Egypt.

==Cultural impact==
Elements of ''Assassin's Creed'' have been introduced as content into other Ubisoft games and those from third parties.

''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, as the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment (who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional plot). During the game's plot, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's game ''[[Watch Dogs (video game)|Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter video game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped, it is implied that by the Assassin's Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|title=Assassin's Creed 4 character crosses over to Watch Dogs|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer|date=June 2, 2014|access-date=August 26, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828061707/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|archive-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed Origins'' mentions the news about Garneau's incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|title=More Evidence That Assassin's Creed And Watch Dogs Are Set in the Same Universe|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|website=kotaku.com|access-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142716/https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|archive-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>
