'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] stealth [[video game]] franchise created by [[Patrice Désilets]], [[Jade Raymond]] and [[Corey May]], developed and published by [[Ubisoft]] using the game engine [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]] and its more advanced derivatives. It depicts a centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players would control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.

The video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured eleven main games in total, the most recent being 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''.

A new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games till [[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]], Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin Order.

Main games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games were also released in accompany for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.

It is also commercially successful, selling over 140 million copies {{as of|2019|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted by its [[Assassin's Creed (film)|self-titled film]], which received negative reviews. A book series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] is also published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.

==History==
[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vidéotron, Québec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a full 3D adaption of the original [[Prince of Persia]] games, which was made for the [[sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]] and included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince simply being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name="polygon oral">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, "nothing is true; everything is permitted". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a wholly new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the "Animus" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name="polygon oral"/>

Following release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name="polygon oral"/>

==Premise==
[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- "We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways." -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]
The ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry between two ancient secret societies — the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] and the [[Knights Templar]] — and their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as "those who came before", whose society, along with much of Earth's biosphere, was destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' real-world chronological setting begins in the year 2012, but most of the gameplay is in historical settings.

Within the franchise, Abstergo Industries is a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches, secretly run by modern Knights Templar. The company is the present-day main antagonist of the franchise. Abstergo secretly created the "Animus", a device that allows its users to "re-live" and experience the memories of their genetic ancestors within their bloodline through a virtual simulation. Overexposure to the animus causes the "bleeding effect", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]]. Abstergo is seeking to discover the location of several historical artifacts, known as the "Pieces of Eden". Such artifacts hold great power, and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. Abstergo seeks to use them to remove free will and bring humanity into one single unified group, while the Assassins oppose them. In order to find the Pieces of Eden, Abstergo is abducting people whose ancestors are suspected to have had historically confirmed or suspected interactions with such devices, forcing the kidnapped person into the Animus and searching for clues on their ancestors' memories within the Animus.

===Protagonists===
{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}
[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.

Desmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.

Within the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].

Throughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.

After Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,<ref name="GI preview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=Vore|first=Bryan|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus. The new subject relives the memories of Edward Kenway (grandfather of Ratohnhaké:ton, otherwise known as Connor Kenway), a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|title=The Dawn of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=George|first=Richard|website=IGN|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930175256/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|archivedate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
While the games are often presented through protagonist Desmond Miles, the bulk of the game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.

While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a "leap of faith" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.

The games use the concept of "active" versus "passive" moves, with "active" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.

===Main series===

====''Assassin's Creed''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}
Desmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Altaïr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sablé|Robert de Sablé]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Altaïr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sablé, to regain his former status. Altaïr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sablé in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sablé's plot to kill him. Altaïr defeats de Sablé, but with his last words, de Sablé reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Altaïr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Altaïr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.

The first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.

====''Assassin's Creed II''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}
Lucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.

Similar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forlì]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by "Subject 16", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}
Desmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.

''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood – Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice Désilets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice Désilets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}

Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Altaïr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars also seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud  between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[Şehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Altaïr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Altaïr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Altaïr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccolò Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Altaïr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond (through Ezio) how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.

Originally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such "cancellation" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend "dens" (Assassin HQs) and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called "Mediterranean Defense" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.

====''Assassin's Creed III''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}

Desmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.

In the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion and recruit Templar allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. He gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust to find the Temple the medallion leads to. To his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts to the memories of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhaké:ton]], whose heritage is half [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to receive training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him "Connor" (in memory of his son, who was killed in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo.

Connor eventually faces his father and kills Lee; ending the Templar threat, before hiding the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion; the key to the inner Temple door. Behind it is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also become a threat to mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.

''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which then subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In Assassin's Creed III there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were also significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.

====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====
{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}
Samples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage – later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] – who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.

In the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.

===Cancelled and defunct games===
====''Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy''====
''Assassin's Creed: Project Legacy'' was a single-player [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] Facebook application, designed as a promotion, and tie-in for ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''. The game is mostly [[Online text-based role-playing game|text-based]], but includes graphics and sound as well as some video.

Players are test subjects for Abstergo Industries who relive the lives of other test subjects' Assassin ancestors; instead of using the Animus, players use the Data Dump Scanner (DDS).

The first mission pack is titled "Italian Wars", and is divided into four chapters. Chapter one focuses on [[Bartolomeo d'Alviano]] during the [[Battle of Agnadello]]. The second chapter focuses on [[Francesco Vecellio]] on a mission to kill [[Niccolò di Pitigliano]] (cousin of Bartolomeo d'Alviano). The third focuses on Mario Auditore and the protection of [[Monteriggioni]]. The fourth and final chapter focuses on [[Lucrezia Borgia#Affair with Perotto|Perotto Calderon]], an undercover assassin who watches over [[Lucrezia Borgia]], with whom he falls in love.

The second mission pack, entitled "Rome", was released November 16, 2010. The first chapter takes place between 1497 and 1503, and deals with the ex-courtesan, Fiora Cavazza. It deals with Fiora's involvement in recruiting an army for the Borgia, and her subsequent betrayal. The second takes place in 1503, and involves [[Giovanni Borgia (Infans Romanus)|Giovanni Borgia]], fleeing his family and eventually joining the assassins. Chapter three involves Francesco Vecellio, and his training to be an assassin under Ezio Auditore. Chapter four again focuses on Giovanni Borgia, now an Assassin and joining [[Hernán Cortés]] on his journey to [[Tenochtitlan]] to acquire a "Piece of Eden", one of the [[Crystal Skull]]s. Giovanni brought it to [[Paracelsus|Bombastus]] for study, resulting in the discovery of the formula for the [[Philosopher's stone]].

The third mission pack, entitled "Holidays", and its first Chapter called Ghosts of Christmas Past were released on December 21, 2010 with further missions to be released in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}} The first chapter takes place at various times and places in history: during the [[World War I]] [[Christmas Truce]], the ''[[Beagle 2]]'' truth, the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to [[Kingdom of England|England]], and the time of the [[Shroud of Turin]].

A fourth story pack, "The Divine Science Story Pack" was announced, but never released. Additionally, an updated user interface (referred to as the 'DDS 2.0') was announced, but not released.  The DDS 2.0 would have offered an easier method of selecting mission packs and equipment.

The game was later shut down and put on an indefinite hold.

In November 2011, a Ubisoft survey was sent out, asking participants which locations and time periods they would like to see in the "next ''Assassin's Creed'' games".

In June 2013, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated on the development cycle of the games, saying, "We are making sure the teams who are creating the different iterations have enough time—two years, three years, so that they can take risk and they can change the concept enough so that it can be appealing and fresh."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|title=Ubisoft Has Three Assassin's Creeds in Development, Vows Innovation|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 14, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617052003/http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223|archivedate=June 17, 2013}}</ref> The following August, ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''{{'}}s director Ashraf Ismail said that the ending of the franchise had been written, saying "We have an idea of where the end is, what the end is.

==In other media==
Ubisoft expanded the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise to other media, including [[#Films|films]], [[#Comics|comic books]] and [[#Novels|novels]].

===Other video games===
Elements of ''Assassin's Creed'' have been introduced as content into other Ubisoft games and those from third parties.

''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag'' introduces the character of Olivier Garneau, as the CEO of video game company Abstergo Entertainment (who helps Ubisoft to develop the ''Assassin's Creed'' video games within the franchise's fictional plot). During the game's plot, Garneau goes to [[Chicago]], the setting of Ubisoft's game ''[[Watch Dogs]]''. In the latter video game, Garneau is the subject of a side mission that sees playable protagonist Aiden Pearce saving him from being kidnapped, it is implied that by the Assassin's Brotherhood. Additionally, two characters in the game are seen playing ''Assassin's Creed II''. Ubisoft has described those appearances as small Easter eggs, and has neither confirmed nor denied a shared continuity between both franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|title=Assassin's Creed 4 character crosses over to Watch Dogs|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828061707/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-02-assassins-creed-4-character-crosses-over-to-watch-dogs|archivedate=August 28, 2016}}</ref> ''Assassin's Creed Origins'' mentions the news about Garneau's incident in Chicago, along with a picture of Aiden Pearce killing Garneau.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|title=More Evidence That Assassin's Creed And Watch Dogs Are Set In The Same Universe|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|date=|website=kotaku.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142716/https://kotaku.com/more-evidence-that-assassin-s-creed-and-watch-dogs-are-1819936896|archivedate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> Ubisoft still has not confirmed a shared continuity, between both video game franchises, but this is the only crossover that seems to imply a shared plot.

=====''Assassin's Creed: Embers''=====
{{main|Assassin's Creed: Embers}}
The short film follows an elderly Ezio, living a peaceful life in the Tuscan countryside with his wife Sofia and his children Flavia and Marcello and writing his memoirs. One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio then recounts his story of [[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin]], and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if "you lose your way". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.

====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====
In the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles. The story serves as a prelude to the first ''Assassin's Creed'' game and is narrated simultaneously by both characters. In it, the novel covers Desmond's escape from Abstergo in the year 2012 and also one of Altaïr's assassination missions in the year 1191. The start of the novel involves the introduction of the two characters with Altaïr calling himself a hunter, while Desmond is a prisoner. Although initially they describe themselves otherwise, by the end of the novel they both re-introduce themselves as assassins.

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 1: Desmond''====
''Assassin's Creed Volume 1: Desmond'' is a French-language graphic novel written by Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli Defaux. It has been released in France, Canada, Belgium, Poland and Italy.

It also features Subject 16 (referred to as Michael) and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] assassin named Aquilus. However, events in the comic book are different from what happens in the game. It is said that Subject 16 is alive but trapped in the animus, a virtual reality simulator used to relive memories of ancient relatives, but there's no mention of Shaun or Rebecca.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |title=Assassin's Creed : Desmond – Trailer de la bande dessinée |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222012930/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ju7K9De8ck |archivedate=February 22, 2013  }}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 2: Aquilus''====
''Assassin's Creed Volume 2: Aquilus'' is a French-language graphic novel written by Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli Defaux.

In the meantime, Desmond relives memories of Aquilus through the animus after his apparent death in the first volume. The Roman assassin is rescued by his cousin, Accipiter, and is tasked with a quest to save [[Lugdunum]]. He meets with his father and discovers an artifact of the first civilization: an [[ankh]] which can temporarily revive the dead. The mysterious object is then stolen by a Templar senator, Vultur, who kills Aquilus' father.

The modern day story continues as Assassins fight Abstergo agents when they're ambushed on the road. Later, it is revealed that there's a traitor among in the Assassins' truck, and Desmond deals with the situation. The group finally arrives in Monteriggioni and at the end, it's hinted that the ankh artifact might be hidden within the town's walls.

====''Assassin's Creed, Volume 3: Accipiter''====
Jonathan Hawk was sent by a suited executive and a lab technician to relive Accipiter's memories. He was sent to 259 CE, when Accipiter's Alamans were crossing the Rodanus into Genava and Aube to face the Roman forces at Oppidum. The battle raged bloodily and long, but Accipiter's forces were eventually victorious.

{{main|Assassin's Creed (book series)}}

====''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance''====
''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance'' is a novel based on the ''Assassin's Creed'' series written by [[Oliver Bowden]] and published by [[Penguin Books]]. It is a novelised version of the game ''Assassin's Creed II''; however, rather than spanning a vast period of time, it is set only in the 15th century with no mention of the series' present-day events.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/nov/06/assassins-creed-renaissance |title=Assassin's Creed Renaissance |date=6 November 2009 |access-date=12 April 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News & Media Limited]]}}</ref>

====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====
''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' is a continuation of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series written by Oliver Bowden and published by Penguin Books. It is a novelized version of the game ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'' just like its previous book. It does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond, only a reference to a "phantom" by Ezio. Unlike the events of the game which start in 1499, this version of the story starts in 1503.

====''Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade''====
''Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade'' is the third ''Assassin's Creed'' book by Oliver Bowden and published by Penguin Books.

Like the previous novels of ''Renaissance'' and ''Brotherhood'', it is a novelised version of the game ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''. Additionally like the prior novels, it does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond. Like the game, Ezio Auditore must leave his life behind in search of answers, in search of the truth. In Assassin's Creed: Revelations, master assassin Ezio Auditore walks in the footsteps of the legendary mentor Altair, on a journey of discovery and revelation. It is a perilous path—one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilise the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141966724,00.html?strSrchSql=assassins+creed/Assassin's_Creed:_Revelations_Oliver_Bowden |title=Assassin's Creed: Revelations – Oliver Bowden – Penguin Books |publisher=Penguin.co.uk |date=November 24, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521210447/http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141966724,00.html?strSrchSql=assassins+creed%2FAssassin%27s_Creed%3A_Revelations_Oliver_Bowden |archivedate=May 21, 2014  }}</ref>

===''Assassin's Creed: Encyclopedia''===
[[UbiWorkshop]] released an encyclopedia of the ''Assassin's Creed'' series in 2011.

It features works of artists, such as Craig Mullins, Tavis Coburn, 123Klan, Gabz and James NG. Artists were given creative freedom, as they were able to create a unique Assassin from the period of their choosing.
