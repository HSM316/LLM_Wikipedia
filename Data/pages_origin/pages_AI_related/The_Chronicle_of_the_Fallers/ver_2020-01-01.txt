==Synopsis==
The novel returns to Hamilton's far-future [[Commonwealth Saga|Commonwealth universe]] in the 34th century, in the time following the events of the Void Trilogy. It features Nigel Sheldon, the [[posthuman]] co-inventor of [[wormhole]] technology, who enters the hostile alien [[pocket universe]] known as the Void to find a way of destroying it. In the process, he lands on the planet Bienvenido, which is home to a stranded human civilisation under constant attack by adaptive aliens known as Fallers. A second storyline follows Slvasta, a young soldier, as he progresses from fighting on the front-line against the Fallers to becoming more involved in Bienvenido's politics and government.

==Setting==
The Void, created at the centre of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] by an ancient alien race, has a different quantum structure from that of a normal space. The Void reacts to conscious thought, but prevents the use of most [[electric]] and [[electronics|electronic]] devices, although most newly arrived equipment functions initially and only degrades over a period of time. Technology on Bienvenido is generally limited to a 19th-century or early 20th-century level, including steam engines, municipal water supplies and an extensive railway transportation network, but no long-distance communication such as radio or telegraphy. On the other hand, all humans and other sapient beings in the Void possess [[telekinesis]] and [[mental telepathy]] capabilities, and retain their knowledge of more advanced technology. [[Biotechnology]] also largely resists the Void's effects, allowing Nigel Sheldon to bring a team of powerful [[android (robot)|androids]] into the Void with him.

== Reception ==
On [[Goodreads]], it holds a 4.2 out of 5, based on 9000 votes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Abyss Beyond Dreams|url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20697413-the-abyss-beyond-dreams|website = Goodreads|accessdate = 2018-12-14}}</ref>
