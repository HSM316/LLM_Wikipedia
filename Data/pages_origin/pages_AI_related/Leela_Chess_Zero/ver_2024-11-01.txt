'''Leela Chess Zero''' (abbreviated as '''LCZero''', '''lc0''') is a [[Free and open-source software|free, open-source]], and [[deep neural network]]–based [[chess engine]] and [[volunteer computing]] project. Development has been spearheaded by programmer [[Gary Linscott]], who is also a developer for the [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish chess engine]]. Leela Chess Zero was adapted from the [[Leela Zero]] [[Go (game)|Go]] engine,<ref name="SilverApril2018">{{cite web|url=https://lczero.org/?full_elo=1|title=Leela Chess Zero: Full Elo Graph|date=7 March 2019|website=Lczero.org|accessdate=7 March 2019|archive-date=15 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315004544/https://lczero.org/?full_elo=1|url-status=live}}</ref> which in turn was based on [[Google]]'s [[AlphaGo Zero]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero|title=leela-zero|publisher=[[GitHub]]|date=|accessdate=27 April 2018|archive-date=16 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016081931/https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the purposes of Leela Chess Zero was to verify the methods in the [[AlphaZero]] paper as applied to the game of chess.

==History==
The Leela Chess Zero project was first announced on TalkChess.com on January 9, 2018.<ref name="SilverApril2018"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Announcing lczero |url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280 |website=TalkChess.com |accessdate=11 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140624/http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280 |url-status=live }}</ref> This revealed Leela Chess Zero as the open-source, self-learning chess engine it would come to be known as, with a goal of creating a strong chess engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280|title=Announcing lczero - TalkChess.com|website=www.talkchess.com|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140624/http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280|url-status=live}}</ref> Within the first few months of training, Leela Chess Zero had already reached the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] level, surpassing the strength of early releases of [[Rybka]], Stockfish, and [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], despite evaluating orders of magnitude fewer positions due to its [[deep neural network]] in its [[evaluation function]] and its use of [[Monte Carlo tree search]].

In December 2018, the [[AlphaZero]] team published a new paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine revealing previously undisclosed details of the architecture and training parameters used for AlphaZero.<ref name="alphazero20181206">{{cite journal |last1=Silver |first1=David |last2=Hubert |first2=Thomas |last3=Schrittwieser |first3=Julian |last4=Antonoglou |first4=Ioannis |last5=Lai |first5=Matthew |last6=Guez |first6=Arthur |last7=Lanctot |first7=Marc |last8=Sifre |first8=Laurent |last9=Kumaran |first9=Dharshan |last10=Graepel |first10=Thore |last11=Lillicrap |first11=Timothy |last12=Simonyan |first12=Karen |last13=Hassabis |first13=Demis |title=A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play |journal=Science |date=6 December 2018 |volume=362 |issue=6419 |pages=1140–1144 |doi=10.1126/science.aar6404 |pmid=30523106 |bibcode=2018Sci...362.1140S |s2cid=54457125 |display-authors=3 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10069050/1/alphazero_preprint.pdf |doi-access=free |access-date=1 September 2019 |archive-date=1 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901220135/http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10069050/1/alphazero_preprint.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> These changes were soon incorporated into Leela Chess Zero and increased both its strength and training efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.lczero.org/2018/12/alphazero-paper-and-lc0-v0191.html|title=AlphaZero paper, and Lc0 v0.19.1|last=|first=|date=7 December 2018|website=|accessdate=14 February 2019|archive-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214233533/http://blog.lczero.org/2018/12/alphazero-paper-and-lc0-v0191.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The work on Leela Chess Zero has informed the similar AobaZero project for [[shogi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kobayashi|first=Yuki|title=GitHub – kobanium/aobazero: Aoba Zero.|website=[[GitHub]] |date=2019-09-15|url=https://github.com/kobanium/aobazero|access-date=2019-09-25|archive-date=2020-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627111627/https://github.com/kobanium/aobazero|url-status=live}}</ref>

The engine has been rewritten and carefully iterated upon since its inception, and since 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lczero.org/blog/2019/04/backend-configuration/ |title=Backend configuration |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2019-04-17 |website=lczero.org |access-date=2024-07-20}}</ref> runs on multiple [[Back end (computing)|backends]], allowing it to effectively utilize different types of hardware, both CPU and GPU.<ref name="Lc0Github">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0|title=leela-chess-zero|publisher=[[GitHub]]|date=|accessdate=11 May 2020|archive-date=18 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418150729/https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0|url-status=live}}</ref>

The engine can be configured to use different [[Neural network (machine learning)|weights]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lczero.org/dev/wiki/getting-started/ |title=Getting Started |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=lczero.org |access-date=2024-07-20}}</ref> including even different [[Types of artificial neural networks|architectures]]. This same mechanism of substitutable weights can also be used for alternative chess rules, such as for the [[Fischer Random Chess]] variant, which was done in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/issues/1009 |title=Selfplay outputs chess960 "capture rook" moves |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2019-11-18 |website=github.com |access-date=2024-07-20}}</ref>

Since 2022, it uses post-LN encoder-only [[Transformer (deep learning architecture)|transformers]], similar to [[BERT (language model)|BERT]].

== Program and use ==
The method used by its designers to make Leela Chess Zero self-learn and play chess at above human level is [[reinforcement learning]]. This is a machine-learning algorithm, mirrored from [[AlphaZero]] used by the Leela Chess Zero training [[executable]]/[[binary code]] (called "binary") to maximize reward through [[Self-play (reinforcement learning technique)|self-play]].<ref name="SilverApril2018" /><ref name="alphazero20181206" /> As an open-source distributed computing project, volunteer users run Leela Chess Zero to play hundreds of millions of games which are fed to the reinforcement algorithm.<ref name=":0" /> In order to contribute to the advancement of the Leela Chess Zero engine, the latest non-release candidate (non-rc) version of the Engine as well as the Client must be downloaded. The Client is needed to connect to the current server of Leela Chess Zero, where all of the information from the self-play chess games are stored, to obtain the latest network, generate self-play games, and upload the training data back to the server.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=The rewritten engine, originally for tensorflow. Now all other backends have been ported here.: LeelaChessZero/lc0|date=2019-03-20|url=https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0|publisher=LCZero|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

In order to play against the Leela Chess Zero engine on a machine, two components are needed: the engine binary and a network. (The engine binary is distinct from the client, in that the client is used as a training platform for the engine). The network contains Leela Chess Zero's evaluation function that is needed to evaluate positions.<ref name=":1" /> Older networks can also be downloaded and used by placing those networks in the folder with the Lc0 binary.

==Self-play Elo==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
Self-play [[Elo rating system|Elo]] is used to gauge relative network strength to look for anomalies and general changes in network strength, and can be used as a diagnostic tool when Lc0 undergoes significant changes. Through test match games that are played with minimal temperature-based variation,<ref>Temperature is a technical concept that makes Lc0's play more random. High temperature effectively means Lc0 more often makes moves other than what it thinks are the best moves. This is a setting that is only meant to be used during training, to help encounter unfamiliar positions and therefore learn them.</ref> Lc0 engine clients test the most recent version against other recent versions of the same network's run, which is then sent to the training server to create an overall Elo assessment.

Standard Elo formulae are used to calculate relative Elo strength between the two players. More recent Self-play Elo calculations use match game results against multiple network versions to calculate a more accurate Elo value.

The Self-play approach has several consequences on gauging Lc0 Elo rating:

*Initial Cumulative Elo inflation in training runs differ drastically due to a-periodic gains in self-improvement and adversarial play.
*Measuring Elo relative to previous networks fails to measure general strength since networks are trained to anticipate and beat the predictions made by prior Lc0 networks rather than opponents outside the training domain. This is a type of [[overfitting]] measured most drastically when testing smaller networks.
*There is no direct one-to-one correlation between self-play Elo and the strength against Alpha-Beta engines, and no known correlation to strength against humans.
*Input training data has a significant effect on how a network will perform elo-wise against the next iteration.
*Cumulative Self-Play Elo does not have a universal conversion to conventional Human Elo due to inflation issues presented by adversarial play, and the reliance of the measure on time control. This holds true even when the engine runs on a standard set of initial conditions.

Cumulative Self-Play Elo inflation can be compared with other runs to gauge the lack of generality in gauging strength with pure cumulative self-play Elo. The [[Fischer Random Chess]] run Test 71.4 (named 714xxx nets), ranks at nearly 4000 cumulative self-play Elo 76 nets into its run (714076). The T60 (6xxxx) run 63000 net has a cumulative self-play Elo of around 2900. Pitting 714076 against net 63000 reveals 63000 clearly beats 714076 in head-to-head matches at most, if not all "fair" time controls. However, net 63000's Elo is significantly lower than its opponent. This supports the claim that Cumulative Self-Play Elo is not an objective measure of strength, nor is it a measure which allows one to linearly compare Lc0 network strength to human strength.

Setting up the engine to play a single node with <code>--minibatch-size=1</code> and <code>go nodes 1</code> for each played move creates deterministic play, and Self-Play Elo on such settings will always yield the same result between 2 of the same networks on the same start position—always win, always loss, or always draw. Self-play Elo is not reliable for determining strength in these deterministic circumstances.

==Spinoffs==
In season 15 of the [[Top Chess Engine Championship]], the engine AllieStein competed alongside Leela. AllieStein is a combination of two different spinoffs from Leela: Allie, which uses the same evaluation network as Leela, but has a unique search algorithm for exploring different lines of play, and Stein, an evaluation network which has been trained using [[supervised learning]] based on existing game data featuring other engines (as opposed to the [[unsupervised learning]] which Leela uses). While neither of these projects would be admitted to TCEC separately due to their similarity to Leela, the combination of Allie's search algorithm with the Stein network, called AllieStein, is unique enough to warrant it competing alongside mainstream Lc0. (The TCEC rules require that a neural network-based engine has at least two unique components out of three essential features: The code that evaluates a network, the network itself, and the search algorithm. While AllieStein uses the same code to evaluate its network as Lc0, since the other two components are fresh, AllieStein is considered a distinct engine.)<ref>{{cite web |title=Allie+Stein, the new neural network based engine entering TCEC S15 |date=2 March 2019 |url=http://www.chessdom.com/alliestein-the-new-neural-network-entering-tcec-s15/ |access-date=17 April 2020 |archive-date=27 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227181911/http://www.chessdom.com/alliestein-the-new-neural-network-entering-tcec-s15/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In early 2021, the LcZero blog announced [https://github.com/dje-dev/Ceres Ceres,] a new chess engine that uses LcZero networks. It implements [[Monte Carlo tree search]] as well as many novel algorithmic improvement ideas. Initial Elo testing showed that Ceres is stronger than Lc0 with the same network.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcing Ceres |url=https://lczero.org/blog/2021/01/announcing-ceres/ |website=LcZero Blog |date= |accessdate=26 July 2021 |archive-date=15 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240615072546/https://lczero.org/blog/2021/01/announcing-ceres/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 2018, Leela participated in [[TCEC Season 14|season 14 of the Top Chess Engine Championship]]. Leela dominated divisions 3, 2, and 1, easily finishing first in all of them. In the premier division, Stockfish dominated while [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], Komodo and Leela competed for second place. It came down to a final-round game where Leela needed to hold Stockfish to a draw with black to finish second ahead of Komodo. Leela managed this and therefore met Stockfish in the superfinal. In a back and forth match, first Stockfish and then Leela took three game leads before Stockfish won by the narrowest margin of 50.5–49.5.<ref name=":4" />

[[TCEC Season 16|Season 16 of TCEC]] saw Leela finish in third place in premier division, missing qualification for the superfinal to Stockfish and new deep neural network engine AllieStein. Leela did not suffer any losses in the Premier division, the only engine to do so, and defeated Stockfish in one of the six games they played. However, Leela only managed to score nine wins, while AllieStein and Stockfish both scored 14 wins. This inability to defeat weaker engines led to Leela finishing third, half a point behind AllieStein and a point behind Stockfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=16&div=p&game=1|title=Season 16, Div P archive|accessdate=30 September 2019|archive-date=27 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627111638/https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=16&div=p&game=1|url-status=live}}</ref> In the fourth TCEC cup, Leela was seeded first as the defending champion, which placed it on the opposite half of the brackets as AllieStein and Stockfish.

[[TCEC Season 19|Season 19 of TCEC]] saw Leela qualify for the superfinal again. This time it played against a new Stockfish version with support for [[NNUE]], a shallow neural network–based [[evaluation function]] used primarily for the leaf nodes of the search tree.
