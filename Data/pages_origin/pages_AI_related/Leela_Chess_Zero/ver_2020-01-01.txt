'''Leela Chess Zero''' (abbreviated as '''LCZero''', '''lc0''') is a [[Free and open-source software|free, open-source]], and [[neural network]]-based [[chess engine]] and [[distributed computing]] project. Development has been spearheaded by programmer Gary Linscott, who is also a developer for the [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish chess engine]]. Leela Chess Zero was adapted from the [[Leela Zero]] [[Go (game)|Go]] engine,<ref name="SilverApril2018">{{cite web|url=https://lczero.org/?full_elo=1|title=Leela Chess Zero: Full Elo Graph|date=7 March 2019|website=Lczero.org|url-status=live|accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> which in turn was based on [[Google]]'s [[AlphaGo Zero]] project,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero|title=leela-zero|publisher=[[GitHub]]|date=|accessdate=27 April 2018}}</ref> also to verify the methods in the [[AlphaZero]] paper as applied to the game of chess.

Like Leela Zero and AlphaGo Zero, Leela Chess Zero starts with no intrinsic chess-specific knowledge other than the basic rules of the game.<ref name="SilverApril2018"/> Leela Chess Zero then learns how to play chess by [[reinforcement learning]] from repeated self-play, using a distributed computing network coordinated at the Leela Chess Zero website.

{{As of|2019|08}}, Leela Chess Zero had played over 232 million games against itself,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://lczero.org|title=LCZero|last=|first=|date=|website=lczero.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> and is capable of play at a level that is comparable with [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]], the leading conventional chess program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/news/view/lc0-wins-computer-chess-championship-makes-history|title=Lc0 Wins Computer Chess Championship, Makes History|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/news/view/computer-chess-championship-9-stockfish-lc0|title=Stockfish Strikes Back, Tops Lc0 In Computer Chess Championship|last=Pete (pete)|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>

==History==
The Leela Chess Zero project was first announced on TalkChess.com on January 9, 2018.<ref name="SilverApril2018"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Announcing lczero |url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280 |website=TalkChess.com |accessdate=11 June 2018 }}</ref> This revealed Leela Chess Zero as the open-source, self-learning chess engine it would come to be known as, with a goal of creating a strong chess engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=66280|title=Announcing lczero - TalkChess.com|website=www.talkchess.com|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Within the first few months of training, Leela Chess Zero had already reached the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] level, surpassing the strength of early releases of [[Rybka]], Stockfish, and [[Komodo (chess)|Komodo]], despite evaluating orders of magnitude fewer positions while using [[Monte Carlo tree search|MCTS]].

In December 2018, the [[AlphaZero]] team published a new paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine revealing previously undisclosed details of the architecture and training parameters used for AlphaZero.<ref name="alphazero20181206">{{cite journal |last1=Silver |first1=David |last2=Hubert |first2=Thomas |last3=Schrittwieser |first3=Julian |last4=Antonoglou |first4=Ioannis |last5=Lai |first5=Matthew |last6=Guez |first6=Arthur |last7=Lanctot |first7=Marc |last8=Sifre |first8=Laurent |last9=Kumaran |first9=Dharshan |last10=Graepel |first10=Thore |last11=Lillicrap |first11=Timothy |last12=Simonyan |first12=Karen |last13=Hassabis |first13=Demis |title=A general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess, shogi, and Go through self-play |journal=Science |date=6 December 2018 |volume=362 |issue=6419 |pages=1140–1144 |doi=10.1126/science.aar6404 |display-authors=3|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10069050/1/alphazero_preprint.pdf }}</ref> These changes were soon incorporated into Leela Chess Zero and increased both its strength and training efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.lczero.org/2018/12/alphazero-paper-and-lc0-v0191.html|title=AlphaZero paper, and Lc0 v0.19.1|last=|first=|date=7 December 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=14 February 2019}}</ref>

The work on Leela Chess Zero has informed the similar AobaZero project for [[shogi]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Kobayashi|first=Yuki|title=GitHub - kobanium/aobazero: Aoba Zero.|date=2019-09-15|url=https://github.com/kobanium/aobazero|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>

== Program and use ==
The method used by its designers to make Leela Chess Zero self-learn and play chess at above human level is [[reinforcement learning]]. This is a machine-learning algorithm, mirrored from [[AlphaZero]] to be used by Leela Chess Zero, to maximize reward to make the engine a better chess player through self-play.<ref name="SilverApril2018" /><ref name="alphazero20181206" /> From open-source, Leela Chess Zero has played hundreds of millions of games, run by volunteer users, in order to learn with the reinforcement algorithm.<ref name=":0" /> In order to contribute to the advancement of the Leela Chess Zero engine, the latest version of the Engine as well as the Client must be downloaded. The Client is needed to connect to the current server of Leela Chess Zero, which all of the information from the self-play chess games are stored, to obtain the latest network, generate self-play games, and upload the training data back to the server.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|title=The rewritten engine, originally for tensorflow. Now all other backends have been ported here.: LeelaChessZero/lc0|date=2019-03-20|url=https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0|publisher=LCZero|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

If, however, someone would like themselves to play against Leela Chess Zero engine, the network must be downloaded. The network contains Leela Chess Zero's evaluation function that is needed for the opponent to play against the engine.<ref name=":1" /> Playing against a past form of the Leela Chess Zero engine is also possible, although the self-play rating calculated for the engine is different from the conventional Elo chess rating. In order to find the self-play rating of Leela Chess Zero from Elo rating is to use the formula:

X = (y + 511.7)/0.6

where y is the players Elo chess rating, and X is Leela Chess Zero's self-play rating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhagwad.com/blog/2018/personal/how-to-run-leela-chess-engine-lczero-in-arena-at-a-specific-elo.html/|title=How to Run Leela Chess Engine (LCZero) in Arena at a Specific ELO|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

==Competition results==
In April 2018, Leela Chess Zero became the first neural network engine to enter the [[Top Chess Engine Championship]] (TCEC), during season 12 in the lowest division, division 4.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chessdom.com/breaking-leela-chess-zero-enters-tcec-season-12/|title=Breaking: Leela Chess Zero enters TCEC Season 12|publisher=Chessdom|date=18 April 2018}}</ref> Leela did not perform well: in 28 games, it won one, drew two, and lost the remainder; its sole victory came from a position in which its opponent, Scorpio 2.82, crashed in three moves.<ref>See the season 12 archives at [http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php]</ref> However, it improved quickly. In July 2018, Leela placed seventh out of eight competitors at the 2018 [[World Computer Chess Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icga.org/pairing/wccc2018/|title=World Computer Chess Championship 2018|publisher=ICGA|accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref> In August 2018, it won division 4 of TCEC season 13 with a record of 14 wins, 12 draws, and 2 losses.<ref name="season13">See the season 13 archives at [http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessdom.com/leela-chess-zero-wins-the-gold-medal-in-tcec-div-4/|title=Leela Chess Zero wins the gold medal in TCEC Div 4 {{!}} Chessdom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> In Division 3, Leela scored 16/28 points, finishing third behind Ethereal, who scored 22.5/28 points, and Arasan on tiebreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chessdom.com/ethereal-chess-engine-wins-the-gold-at-tcec-div-3/|title=Ethereal chess engine wins the gold at TCEC Div 3 {{!}} Chessdom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref name="season13"/> 

By September 2018, Leela had become competitive with the strongest engines in the world. In the 2018 Chess.com Computer Chess Championship (CCCC),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/computer-chess-championship|title=Chess.com Computer Chess Championship}}</ref> Leela placed fifth out of 24 entrants.

Leela defeated higher-division engines Laser, Ethereal and Fire before finally being eliminated by Stockfish in the semi-finals.<ref>See the TCEC Cup 1 archives at [http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php]</ref>

In October and November 2018, Leela participated in the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship Blitz Battle.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cilento |first1=Pete |title=Computer Chess Championship Returns For Blitz Battle |url=https://www.chess.com/news/view/computer-chess-championship-returns-for-blitz-battle |website=Chess.com |accessdate=22 November 2018 |date=11 October 2018}}</ref> Leela finished third behind Stockfish and Komodo.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cilento |first1=Pete |title=Stockfish Wins Computer Chess Championship Blitz |url=https://www.chess.com/news/view/stockfish-wins-computer-chess-championship-blitz |website=Chess.com |accessdate=22 November 2018 |date=19 November 2018}}</ref>

In December 2018, Leela participated in [[TCEC Season 14|season 14 of the Top Chess Engine Championship]]. Leela dominated divisions 3, 2, and 1, easily finishing first in all of them. In the premier division, Stockfish dominated while [[Houdini (chess)|Houdini]], Komodo and Leela competed for second place. It came down to a final-round game where Leela needed to hold Stockfish to a draw with black to finish second ahead of Komodo. It successfully managed this and therefore contested the superfinal against Stockfish. It narrowly lost the superfinal against Stockfish with a 49.5-50.5 final score.<ref name="season14">See the season 14 archives at [http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php]</ref>

In February 2019, Leela scored its first major tournament win when it defeated Houdini in the final of the second TCEC cup. Leela did not lose a game the entire tournament.<ref>See the TCEC Cup 2 archives at http://legacy-tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Leela won the TCEC CUP! |url=http://blog.lczero.org/2019/02/leela-won-tcec-cup.html |website=LCZero Blog |date=4 February 2019 |accessdate=12 February 2019 }}</ref> In April 2019, Leela won the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship 7: Blitz Bonanza, becoming the first neural-network project to take the title.<ref name="CCC7"/>

In May 2019, Leela defended its TCEC cup title, this time defeating Stockfish in the final 5.5-4.5 (+2 =7 -1) after Stockfish blundered a 7-man [[tablebase]] draw.<ref>See the game score at https://cd.tcecbeta.club/archive.html?season=cup3&round=fl&game=9</ref> Leela also won the Superfinal of [[TCEC Season 15|season 15 of the Top Chess Engine Championship]] 53.5-46.5 (+14 -7 =79) versus Stockfish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lc0 won TCEC 15 |url=https://blog.lczero.org/2019/05/lc0-won-tcec-15.html |website=LCZero Blog |date=28 May 2019 |accessdate=28 May 2019 }}</ref><ref name="Hogy2019">{{cite web |last1=Högy |first1=Kevin |title=A new age in computer chess?

Season 16 of TCEC saw Leela finish in 3rd place in premier division, missing qualification for the superfinal to Stockfish and new neural network engine AllieStein. Leela did not suffer any losses in the Premier division, the only engine to do so, and defeated Stockfish in one of the six games they played. However, Leela only managed to score 9 wins, while AllieStein and Stockfish both scored 14 wins. This inability to defeat weaker engines led to Leela finishing 3rd, half a point behind AllieStein and a point behind Stockfish.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=16&div=p&game=1|title=Season 16, Div P archive|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref> In the fourth TCEC cup, Leela was seeded first as the defending champion, which placed it on the opposite half of the brackets as AllieStein and Stockfish. Leela was able to qualify for the finals, where it faced Stockfish. After seven draws, Stockfish won the eighth game to win the match.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.tcec-chess.com/archive.html?season=cup4&round=fl&game=1|title=TCEC Cup 4 archive|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>
