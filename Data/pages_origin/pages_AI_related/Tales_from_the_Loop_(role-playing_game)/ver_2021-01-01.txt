'''''Tales from the Loop''''' ({{lang-sv|'''Ur Varselklotet'''}}) is an [[alternate history]] [[science fiction]] [[tabletop role-playing game]] designed by Nils Hintze, based on the art of [[Simon Stålenhag]]. It was published in 2017 by Free League Publishing, the international arm of [[Sweden|Swedish]] game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB, and [[Modiphius Entertainment]]. The game is built upon the Year Zero Engine created by Tomas Härenstam, who also served as the editor and project manager.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Tales from the Loop|last=|first=|publisher=Fria Ligan AB|year=2017|isbn=978-1-910132-75-3|location=|pages=}}</ref>

The role-playing game was originally a stretch goal on a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for publication of the art book,<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabinetentertainment/simon-stalenhags-tales-from-the-loop|title=Simon Stalenhag's Tales from the Loop|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US}}</ref> but was then further funded by a [[Kickstarter]] campaign by Fria Ligan AB, who surpassed their [[crowdfunding]] goal and raised a total of 3,745,896 [[Swedish krona|kr]] from 5,600 backers.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/tales-from-the-loop-roleplaying-in-the-80s-that-ne|title=Tales from the Loop - Roleplaying in the '80s That Never Was|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>

The stand-alone expansion ''Things from the Flood'' ({{lang-sv|Flodskörden|links=no}}), based on Stålenhag's art book of the same name, was also funded by a Kickstarter campaign, raising a total of 4,249,903 kr from 5,824 backers.<ref>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/things-from-the-flood-sequel-to-tales-from-the-loo</ref>

== Play overview ==
=== Background ===
''Tales from the Loop'' has two settings available from the rulebook. The first setting is an alternate version of the [[Mälaren#Geography|Mälaren Islands]], west of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] capital of [[Stockholm]]. The second included setting, which was created from reaching a stretch goal on the [[Kickstarter]],<ref name=":1" /> is in a city based on [[Boulder City]], [[Nevada]].<ref name=":0" /> There is a step-by-step guide for players to put their own hometowns into the game, which was included due to a stretch goal on Kickstarter being met. The chapter, called "Hometown Hack", appears in a supplementary book, ''Tales from the Loop: Our Friends The Machines & Other Mysteries''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tales From the Loop: Our Friends the Machines & Other Mysteries|last=|first=|publisher=Fria Ligan AB|year=2017|isbn=978-91-87222-93-1|location=|pages=|url=https://www.modiphius.net/products/tales-from-the-loop-our-friends-the-machines-other-mysteries}}</ref>

In ''Tales from the Loop'', a story that the players play through is called a Mystery. The players play as the Kids, a group of friends, aged 10-15, living in the late 1980s. In the Mysteries, the Kids encounter machines and creatures that have come to exist because of the Loop, a huge underground [[particle accelerator]] built in the late 1960s.

=== Game mechanics ===
''Tales from the Loop'' runs on 6 main principles that are meant to help the Gamemaster and players create the intended feeling and plot of the Mystery:<ref name=":0" />
{{colbegin}}
# Your Hometown is Full of Strange and Fantastic Things
# Everyday Life is Dull and Unforgiving
# Adults are Out of Reach and Out of Touch
# The Land of the Loop is Dangerous but The Kids Will Not Die
# The Game is Played Scene by Scene
# The World is Described Collaboratively
{{colend}}

The Kids are characters created by the players. The game offers many options for the player to choose from, but the main categorization for a Kid is based on their Type, similar to how Classes work in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. The types introduced in the game are:<ref name=":0" />
{{colbegin}}
* Bookworm
* Computer Geek
* Hick
* Jock
* Popular Kid
* Rocker
* Troublemaker
* Weirdo
{{colend}}

''Things from the Flood'' is a stand-alone game that can be used with new characters as well as characters brought over from earlier ''Tales from the Loop'' play. The mechanics remain much the same, except for two major differences: the player characters are slightly older, and death is a possible outcome.

== Reception ==
Shut Up & Sit Down praised ''Tales from the Loop'' for its comfortable, contemporary setting, simple rules that make the game easy to run, and the alternation between sci-fi and the kids' lives, while criticizing its Type system for characters, noting the usage of "hick" sounding derogatory and "suggested “Pride” for the Weirdo involved being homosexual–– the only mention of queerness in the entire game".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/rpg-review-tales-from-the-loop/|title=RPG Review: Tales from the Loop|last=|first=|date=2017-08-02|website=Shut Up & Sit Down|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> [[Geek & Sundry]] named ''Tales from the Loop'' as 2017's best RPG release and praised Stålenhag's art, the collaborative nature between the [[Gamemaster|GM]] and players, and the simplicity of running the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geekandsundry.com/the-best-in-tabletop-2017-tales-from-the-loop/|title=The Best in Tabletop 2017 - Tales from the Loop|last=Wieland|first=Rob|date=2017-12-21|website=Geek & Sundry|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>
