'''''Tales from the Loop''''' is an [[alternate history]] [[science fiction]] [[tabletop role-playing game]] designed by Nils Hintze and is based on the art of [[Simon Stålenhag]]. It was published in 2017 by [[Free League Publishing]], the international arm of [[Sweden|Swedish]] game and book publisher [[Fria Ligan AB]], and [[Modiphius Entertainment]]. The game is built upon the Year Zero Engine created by Tomas Härenstam, who also served as the editor and project manager.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Tales from the Loop|last=|first=|publisher=Fria Ligan AB|year=2017|isbn=978-1-910132-75-3|location=|pages=}}</ref>

==Play overview==

=== Background ===
''Tales from the Loop'' has two settings available from the rulebook. The first setting is an alternate version of the [[Mälaren#Geography|Mälaren Islands]], west of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] capital of [[Stockholm]]. The second included setting, which was created from reaching a stretch goal on the [[Kickstarter]]<ref name=":1" />, is in a city based on [[Boulder City]], [[Nevada]].<ref name=":0" /> There is a step-by-step guide for players to put their own hometowns into the game, which was included due to a stretch goal on Kickstarter being met. The chapter, called "Hometown Hack", appears in a supplementary book, ''Tales from the Loop: Our Friends The Machines & Other Mysteries''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tales From the Loop: Our Friends the Machines & Other Mysteries|last=|first=|publisher=Fria Ligan AB|year=2017|isbn=978-91-87222-93-1|location=|pages=|url=https://www.modiphius.net/products/tales-from-the-loop-our-friends-the-machines-other-mysteries}}</ref>

In ''Tales from the Loop'', a story that the players play through is called a Mystery. The players play as the Kids, a group of friends, aged 10-15, living in the late 1980s. In the Mysteries, the Kids encounter machines and creatures that have come to exist because of the Loop, a huge underground [[particle accelerator]] built in the late 1960s.

=== Game mechanics ===
''Tales from the Loop'' runs on 6 main principles that are meant to help the Gamemaster and players create the intended feeling and plot of the Mystery:<ref name=":0" />

# Your Hometown is Full of Strange and Fantastic Things
# Everyday Life is Dull and Unforgiving
# Adults are Out of Reach and Out of Touch
# The Land of the Loop is Dangerous but The Kids Will Not Die
# The Game is Played Scene by Scene
# The World is Described Collaboratively
