{{about|differences between 1980s symbolic AI, as described by the term GOFAI, compared to a wider view, progress since then, and the current state of the art|a more detailed and complete overview of symbolic AI| symbolic artificial intelligence}}

GOFAI is an acronym for "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" invented by the philosopher [[John Haugeland]] in his 1985 book, ''Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea''.{{sfn|Haugeland|1985}} Technically, GOFAI refers only to a restricted kind of [[symbolic AI]], namely rule-based or logical agents.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=982}} This approach was popular in the 1980s, especially as an approach to implementing expert systems, but [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] has since been extended in many ways to better handle [[Probabilistic logic|uncertain reasoning]] and more open-ended systems. Some of these extensions include [[Bayesian inference|probabilistic reasoning]],{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=982}} [[Non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic reasoning]], [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent systems]], and [[Neuro-symbolic AI|neuro-symbolic systems]]. Significant contributions of symbolic AI, not encompassed by the GOFAI view, include [[search algorithms]]; [[automated planning and scheduling]]; [[Constraint satisfaction problem|constraint-based reasoning]]; the [[Semantic Web|semantic web]]; [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]; [[Knowledge graph|knowledge graphs]]; [[non-monotonic logic]]; [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]; [[automated theorem proving]]; and [[symbolic mathematics]].

== Symbolic AI after GOFAI and confusions caused by viewing symbolic AI as only GOFAI == 

Although the term GOFAI encompasses only a small part of [[symbolic AI]],  prominent in the 1980s, contemporary critics of [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] sometimes use GOFAI as a synonym for it. This conflation of terms can lead to conclusions that symbolic AI research ended in the 1980s and avoided machine learning. Since both conclusions are false and important to correct, we address them below.

=== The 1980s GOFAI version of symbolic AI characterized by production rules and expert systems === 

During the Second AI Summer, i.e., the expert systems boom of the 1980s, production-rule systems requiring [[knowledge engineering]] were used to implement [[Expert system|expert systems]].{{sfn|Kautz|2022|pp=109-110}} Knowledge engineering required working with subject matter experts to model task knowledge as rules. At the time, rules were hand-authored by knowledge engineers or the subject matter experts. GOFAI correctly describes this approach. [[John Haugeland|Haugeland]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] also correctly pointed out various limitations, discussed in later sections.

The [[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence#The_second_AI_winter,_1988–1993|Second AI Winter]] occurred after the [[Expert system|expert systems]] and [[Lisp machine|Lisp Machines]] markets collapsed.{{sfn|Kautz|2022|p=110}} Expert systems did not handle uncertainty well, required more resources to build and maintain than expected, and proved brittle outside their intended domains due to a lack of [[Commonsense reasoning|common-sense reasoning]] capabilities. Language-specific Lisp machines could become easily replaced by newer workstations with similar performance, obviating their need. 

=== Symbolic AI after GOFAI === 

Symbolic AI continued, albeit with reduced funding. It redirected focus to address limitations in handling uncertainty, using statistical AI; and to speed knowledge acquisition, with symbolic approaches to machine learning.{{sfn|Kautz|2022|pp=110-111}} Work in [[Semantic network|semantic networks]] and [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representations]] led to formalizing [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] with languages such as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], leading to large ontologies such as [[YAGO (database)|YAGO]]. However, the research and applications of symbolic AI since the [[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence#The_second_AI_winter,_1988–1993|Second AI Winter]] and outside of the production-rule approach to expert systems are less well known and now eclipsed by the media focus on deep learning since 2012.  

For example, research in symbolic AI machine learning includes [[decision tree learning]], [[Tom M. Mitchell|Mitchell]]'s [[Version space learning|version space]] learning, [[Leslie Valiant|Valiant]]'s contributions to [[Probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]], [[statistical relational learning]], [[inductive logic programming]], and various interactive learning approaches to incorporate user advice, examples, and explanations as an integral part of the learning process.<ref>{{harvc|in1=Michalski|in2=Carbonell|in3=Mitchell|year=1983|c=Chapter 12: Machine Transformation of Advice into a Heuristic Search Procedure |first=David Jack |last=Mostow}}</ref><ref>{{harvc |in1=Michalski |in2=Carbonell |in3=Mitchell |year=1986 |pp=112-139|c=Chapter 4: Protos: An Exemplar-Based Learning Apprentice |first=Ray |last=Bareiss|first2=Bruce|last2=Porter|first3=Craig|last3=Wier}}</ref><ref>{{harvc|in1=Kodratoff|in2=Michalski|year=1990|pp=271-289|c=Chapter 10: LEAP: A Learning Apprentice for VLSI Design |first=Tom |last=Mitchell|first2=Sridbar |last2=Mabadevan|first3=Louis|last3=Steinberg}}</ref>

=== Problems when current symbolic AI is viewed as GOFAI  === 

Using GOFAI as a synonym for current symbolic AI leads to erroneous conclusions and confusion. Garcez and Lamb provide an example:<blockquote>Turing award winner [[Judea Pearl]] offers a critique of machine learning which, unfortunately, conflates the terms [[machine learning]] and [[deep learning]]. Similarly, when [[Geoffrey Hinton]] refers to [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]], the connotation of the term tends to be that of [[Expert system|expert systems]] dispossessed of any ability to learn. The use of the terminology is in need of clarification. [[Machine learning]] is not confined to [[Association rule learning|association rule mining]], c.f. the body of work on symbolic ML [machine learning] and [[Inductive programming|relational learning]] (the differences to deep learning being the choice of representation, localist logical rather than distributed, and the non-use of gradient-based learning algorithms). Equally, [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] is not just about [[Production system (computer science)|production rules]] written by hand. A proper definition of AI concerns [[knowledge representation and reasoning]], autonomous [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent systems]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[Argumentation framework|argumentation]], as well as learning.{{sfn|Garcez|Lamb|2020|page=8}}</blockquote>

The key points above are that symbolic AI research has long since moved beyond GOFAI, research continues, and GOFAI no longer describes it. Further, there are symbolic learning approaches to machine learning, such as [[inductive logic programming]] and [[statistical relational learning]], i.e., it is not just the domain of [[deep learning]]. Below, we return to the philosophical critiques leveled against GOFAI, the symbolic AI approach of the 1980s.
== The GOFAI critique of rule-based agents ==

GOFAI, the rule-based approach of 1980s [[symbolic AI]], was attacked by philosophers such as [[Hubert Dreyfus]], his brother [[Stuart Dreyfus]], and philosopher [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]]. The essence of what they criticized was described earlier by computer scientist [[Alan Turing]], in his 1950 paper [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]], when he said that "human behavior is far too complex to be captured by any formal set of rules—humans must be using some informal guidelines that … could never be captured in a formal set of rules and thus could never be codified in a computer program."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=981}} Turing called this "The Argument from Informality of Behaviour."{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=452}}

[[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], describe the GOFAI critique in ''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'':<blockquote>
The position they criticize came to be called "Good Old-Fashioned Al," or GOFAI, a term coined by [[John Haugeland|Haugeland]] (1985). GOFAI is supposed to claim that all intelligent behavior can be captured by a system that reasons logically from a set of facts and rules describing the domain. It therefore corresponds to the simplest logical agent described in Chapter 7. [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] is correct in saying that logical agents are vulnerable to the [[qualification problem]]. As we saw in Chapter 13, [[Bayesian inference|probabilistic reasoning]] systems are more appropriate for open-ended domains. The [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]] critique therefore is not addressed against computers per se, but rather against one particular way of programming them. It is reasonable to suppose, however, that a book called ''What First-Order Logical Rule-Based Systems Without Learning Can't Do'' might have had less impact.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=951}}</blockquote>In other words, GOFAI restricts its view of agents to those controlled by logical rules. In contrast to this view, [[symbolic AI]] also includes [[non-monotonic logic]], [[modal logic]], [[Probabilistic logic|probabilistic logics]], [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent systems]], symbolic machine learning, and hybrid [[Neuro-symbolic AI|neuro-symbolic architectures]].  Symbolic machine learning, i.e., non-connectionist [[machine learning]] specific to [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]], includes [[inductive logic programming]], [[statistical relational learning]], [[Case-based reasoning|case-based learning]], knowledge compilation ([[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]]),<ref>{{Cite book| edition = 1st | publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-8058-2233-5| last = Anderson| first = John R.| title = The Architecture of Cognition| location = Mahwah, NJ| date = 1995-11-01}}</ref> macro-operator learning,<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Pitman Publishing| isbn = 0-273-08690-1| last = Korf| first = Richard E.| title = Learning to Solve Problems by Searching for Macro-Operators| series = Research Notes in Artificial Intelligence| date = 1985}}</ref> learning from analogy,{{sfnp|Michalski|Carbonell|Mitchell|1986|pp=349-422 |loc=Part Four: Learning by Analogy}} and interactive learning from human [[Advice taker|advice]],{{sfnp|Michalski|Carbonell|Mitchell|1983|loc=Chapter 12: Machine Transformation of Advice into a Heuristic Search Procedure, by David Jack Mostow}} explanations,{{sfnp|Kodratoff|Michalski|1990|pp=269-396|loc=Part Three: Analytic Learning Methods}} and exemplars.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0020-7373(88)80012-9| issn = 0020-7373| volume = 29| issue = 5| pages = 549–561| last1 = Bareiss| first1 = E.

== The GOFAI critique of disembodied agents ==

[[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] do not reject all of [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]’s arguments, they accept his strongest argument, one that applies to all disembodied AIs, whatever their approach:<blockquote>
One of [[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]'s strongest arguments is for [[Situated|situated agents]] rather than disembodied logical [[Inference engine|inference engines]]. An agent whose understanding of "dog" comes only from a limited set of logical sentences such as "Dog(x) ⇒ Mammal(x)" is at a disadvantage compared to an agent that has watched dogs run, has played fetch with them, and has been licked by one. As philosopher [[Andy Clark]] (1998) says, "Biological brains are first and foremost the control systems for biological bodies. Biological bodies move and act in rich real-world surroundings: According to [[Andy Clark|Clark]], we are "good at frisbee, bad at logic."

The [[embodied cognition]] approach claims that it makes no sense to consider the brain separately: cognition takes place within a body, which is embedded in an environment. We need to study the system as a whole; the brain's functioning exploits regularities in its environment, including the rest of its body. Under the [[embodied cognition]] approach, robotics, vision, and other sensors become central, not peripheral.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=982}}</blockquote>
