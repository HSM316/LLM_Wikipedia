'''Proaftn''' is a [[fuzzy classification]] method that belongs to the class of [[supervised learning]] [[algorithms]]. The [[acronym]] Proaftn stands for: (PROcédure d'Affectation Floue pour la problématique du Tri Nominal), which means in English: [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy]] Assignment Procedure for Nominal [[Sorting]].
 
The method enables to determine the fuzzy indifference relations by generalizing the indices (concordance and discordance) used in the [[ELECTRE]] III method.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roy|first=B.|title= Multicriteria Methodology for Decision Aiding | publisher = Kluwer Academic|location = Dordrecht|year = 1996}}</ref> To determine the fuzzy indifference relations, PROAFTN uses the general scheme of the [[Discretization of continuous features|discretization]] technique described in,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ching |first = J.Y.| title = Class-dependent discretization for inductive learning from continuous and mixed-mode data|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|volume=17|issue = 7|pages=641–651|doi=10.1109/34.391407|year = 1995}}</ref> that establishes a set of pre-classified cases called a training set.

To resolve the classification problems, Proaftn proceeds by the following stages:<ref>{{cite journal|title= Multicriteria assignment method PROAFTN: Methodology and medical application|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|year=2000|first=N.|last=Belacel |volume=125|issue=3|pages=175–83|doi=10.1016/s0377-2217(99)00192-7}}</ref>

Stage 1. Modeling of classes: In this stage, the prototypes of the classes are conceived using the two following steps:

*Step 1. Structuring: The prototypes and their parameters (thresholds, weights, etc.) are established using the available knowledge given by the expert.
*Step 2. Validation: We use one of the two following techniques in order to validate or adjust the parameters obtained in the first step through the assignment  examples known as a training set.
 
Direct technique: It consists in adjusting the parameters through the training set and with the expert intervention.

Indirect technique: It consists in fitting the parameters without the expert intervention as used in [[machine learning]] approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doumpos|first=M.|author2=Zopounidis, C.|title=Preference disaggregation and statistical learning for multicriteria decision support: A review|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|year=2011|volume=209|issue=3|pages=203–214|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.05.029}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Learning multicriteria fuzzy classification method PROAFTN from data |journal=Computers & Operations Research|year=2007|first=N.|last=Belacel |author2= Rava, H.

In [[multicriteria classification]] problem, the indirect technique is known as ''preference disaggregation analysis''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jacquet-Lagrèze|first=E.|author2=Siskos, J.|title=Preference disaggregation: Twenty years of MCDA experience|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|year=2001|volume=130|issue=2|pages=233–245|doi=10.1016/s0377-2217(00)00035-7}}</ref> This technique requires less cognitive effort than the former technique; it uses an automatic method to determine the optimal parameters, which minimize the classification errors.
  
Furthermore, several [[heuristics]] and [[metaheuristics]] were used to learn the multicriteria classification method Proaftn.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An evolutionary framework using particle swarm optimization for classification method PROAFTN|journal= Applied Soft Computing|year=2011|first=F.|last=Al-Obeidat|volume=11|issue=8|pages=4971–4980|id= |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2011.06.003|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Differential Evolution for learning the classification method PROAFTN|journal= Knowledge Based System|year=2010|first=f.|last=Al-Obeidat|volume=23|issue=5|pages= 418–426 |id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2010.02.003|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Stage 2. Assignment: After conceiving the prototypes, Proaftn proceeds to assign the new objects to specific classes.
