==Modern technologies==

[[File:Fitbit Charge HR.jpg|thumb|right|The Fitbit, a modern wearable device]]
On April 16, 2013, [[Google]] invited "Glass Explorers" who had pre-ordered its wearable glasses at the 2012 Google I/O conference to pick up their devices. This day marked the official launch of Google Glass, a device intended to deliver rich text and notifications via a heads-up display worn as eyeglasses. The device also had a 5 MP camera and recorded video at 720p.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tech specs|url=https://support.google.com/glass/answer/3064128?hl=en&ref_topic=3063354|access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref> Its various functions were activated via voice command, such as "OK Glass". The company also launched the Google Glass companion app, MyGlass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Finally Reveals Glass Specifications, MyGlass App Now Live|url=http://selfscreens.com/archives/1794/google-finally-reveals-glass-specifications-myglass-app-now-live/|access-date=11 August 2013|website = Self Screens}}</ref> The first third-party Google Glass App came from the ''[[New York Times]]'', which was able to read out articles and news summaries.

However, in early 2015, Google stopped selling the beta "explorer edition" of Glass to the public, after criticism of its design and the $1,500 price tag.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google has admitted that releasing Google Glass early may have been a mistake|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/tony-fadell-releasing-google-glass-explorer-beta-to-public-mistake-2015-7/|website=Business Insider|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref>

While optical head-mounted display technology remains a niche, two popular types of wearable devices have taken off: smartwatches and activity trackers. In 2012, [[ABI Research]] forecast that sales of smartwatches would hit $1.2 million in 2013, helped by the high penetration of smartphones in many world markets, the wide availability and low cost of MEMS sensors, energy efficient connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth 4.0, and a flourishing app ecosystem.<ref>[http://www.abiresearch.com/press/more-than-one-million-smart-watches-will-be-shippe More Than One Million Smart Watches will be Shipped in 2013], ABI Research</ref>

[[Crowdfunding]]-backed start-up [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] reinvented the smartwatch in 2013, with a campaign running on [[Kickstarter]] that raised more than $10m in funding. At the end of 2014, Pebble announced it had sold a million devices. In early 2015, Pebble went back to its crowdfunding roots to raise a further $20m for its next-generation smartwatch, Pebble Time, which started shipping in May 2015.

[[Crowdfunding]]-backed start-up [[McLear]] invented the smart ring in 2013, with a campaign running on [[Kickstarter]] that raised more than $300k in funding. McLear was the first mover in wearables technology in introducing payments, bitcoin payments, advanced secure access control, [[quantified self]] data collection, biometric data tracking, and monitoring systems for the elderly. 

In March 2014, [[Motorola]] unveiled the [[Moto 360]] smartwatch powered by [[Android Wear]], a modified version of the mobile operating system Android designed specifically for smartwatches and other wearables.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moto 360: It's Time|url=http://motorola-blog.blogspot.in/2014/03/moto-360-its-time.html|access-date=18 March 2014|website = The Official Motorola Blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sharing what's up our sleeve: Android coming to wearables|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2014/03/sharing-whats-up-our-sleeve-android.html|access-date=18 March 2014|website = Official Google Blog|date=18 March 2014}}</ref> Finally, following more than a year of speculation, Apple announced its own smartwatch, the [[Apple Watch]], in September 2014.

Wearable technology was a popular topic at the trade show [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2014, with the event dubbed "The Wearables, Appliances, Cars and Bendable TVs Show" by industry commentators.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wearable tech at CES 2014: Many, many small steps |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/wearable-tech-at-ces-2014-many-many-small-steps/ |access-date=17 March 2016 |website=CNET}}</ref> Among numerous wearable products showcased were smartwatches, activity trackers, smart jewelry, head-mounted optical displays and earbuds. Nevertheless, wearable technologies are still suffering from limited battery capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Energy-Efficient Integration of Continuous Context Sensing and Prediction into Smartwatches|journal = Sensors|volume=15|issue=9|pages=22616–22645|doi=10.3390/s150922616|pmid=26370997|pmc = 4610428|year=2015|last1=Rawassizadeh|first1=Reza|last2=Tomitsch|first2=Martin|last3=Nourizadeh|first3=Manouchehr|last4=Momeni|first4=Elaheh|last5=Peery|first5=Aaron|last6=Ulanova|first6=Liudmila|last7=Pazzani|first7=Michael|bibcode = 2015Senso..1522616R|doi-access = free}}</ref>

Another field of application of wearable technology is monitoring systems for [[assisted living]] and [[eldercare]]. Wearable sensors have a huge potential in generating [[big data]], with a great applicability to biomedicine and ambient assisted living.<ref>{{cite journal|title=What Does Big Data Mean for Wearable Sensor Systems?

As wearable technology continues to grow, it has begun to expand into other fields. The integration of wearables into healthcare has been a focus of research and development for various institutions. Wearables continue to evolve, moving beyond devices and exploring new frontiers such as smart fabrics. Applications involve using a fabric to perform a function such as integrating a [[QR code]] into the textile,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/20/technology/startups/jansport-programmable-backpack/index.html|title=JanSport's high-tech backpack gives teens a new way to express themselves|last=McFarland|first=Matt|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> or performance apparel that increases airflow during exercise<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2017/moisture-responsive-workout-suit-0519|title=Researchers design moisture-responsive workout suit|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref>

== Wearable technology and health ==
[[File:Smartwatches.jpg|thumb|[[Samsung Galaxy Watch]] is designed specifically for sports and health functions, including a step counter and a heart rate monitor.]]
Wearable technology is often used to monitor a user's health. Given that such a device is in close contact with the user, it can easily collect data. It started as soon as 1980 where first wireless ECG was invented. In the last decades, it shows rapid growth in research of textile-based, tattoo, patch, and contact lenses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harito |first1=Christian |last2=Utari| first2=Listya|last3=Putra |first3=Budi Riza|last4=Yuliarto| first4=Brian|last5=Purwanto| first5=Setyo|last6=Zaidi| first6=Syed S.J.|last7=Bavykin| first7=Dmitry V.|last8=Marken| first8=Frank|last9=Walsh| first9=Frank C.|title=Review—The Development of Wearable Polymer-Based Sensors: Perspectives|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|date=17 February 2020 |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=037566 |doi=10.1149/1945-7111/ab697c |arxiv=2003.00956 |bibcode=2020JElS..167c7566H |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Wearables can be used to collect data on a user's health including:
* Heart rate
* Calories burned
* Steps walked
* Blood pressure
*Release of certain biochemicals
* Time spent exercising
* Seizures
*physical strain<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wearable-solutions.de/dynasens/|title=Dynasens - physical strain|website=Wearable Solutions GmbH|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref>

These functions are often bundled together in a single unit, like an activity tracker or a smartwatch like the [[Apple Watch Series 2]] or [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]] Sport. Devices like these are used for physical training and monitoring overall physical health, as well as alerting to serious medical conditions such as seizures (e.g. Empatica Embrace).

Currently other applications within healthcare are being explored, such as:

While wearables can collect data in aggregate form, most of them are limited in their ability to analyze or make conclusions based on this data; thus, most are used primarily for general health information. (An exception is seizure-alerting wearables, which continuously analyze the wearer's data and make a decision about calling for help; the data collected can then provide doctors with objective evidence that they may find useful in diagnoses.)  Wearables can account for individual differences, although most just collect data and apply one-size-fits-all algorithms.

Today, there is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking, but also within corporate health and wellness programs. Given that wearables create a massive [[data trail]] which employers could repurpose for objectives other than health, more and more research has begun to study the dark side of wearables.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mettler |first1=Tobias |last2=Wulf| first2=Jochen |title=Physiolytics at the workplace: affordances and constraints of wearables use from an employee's perspective |journal=Information Systems Research |date=6 July 2018 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=245–273 |doi=10.1111/isj.12205 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Asha Peta Thompson]] founded Intelligent Textiles Limited, Intelligent Textiles, who create woven power banks and circuitry that can be used in e[[E-textiles|-]]<nowiki/>uniforms for [[infantry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/aug/03/wearable-technology-wardrobes-smart-fashion|title=Is wearable technology set to take over our wardrobes?|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=2015-08-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Current usage of epidermal technology is limited by existing fabrication processes. Its current application relies on various sophisticated fabrication techniques such as by lithography or by directly printing on a carrier substrate before attaching directly to the body. Research into printing epidermal electronics directly on the skin is currently available as a sole study source.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Ling|last2=Ji|first2=Hongjun|last3=Huang|first3=Houbing|last4=Yi|first4=Ning|last5=Shi|first5=Xiaoming|last6=Xie|first6=Senpei|last7=Li|first7=Yaoyin|last8=Ye|first8=Ziheng|last9=Feng|first9=Pengdong|last10=Lin|first10=Tiesong|last11=Liu|first11=Xiangli|date=2020-10-07|title=Wearable Circuits Sintered at Room Temperature Directly on the Skin Surface for Health Monitoring|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c11479|journal=ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces|volume=12|issue=40|pages=45504–45515|doi=10.1021/acsami.0c11479|pmid=32911929|s2cid=221625878|issn=1944-8244}}</ref>

The significance of epidermal electronics involves their mechanical properties, which resemble those of skin. The skin can be modeled as bilayer, composed of an epidermis having Young's Modulus (''E'') of 2-80 kPa and thickness of 0.3–3&nbsp;mm and a dermis having ''E'' of 140-600 kPa and thickness of 0.05-1.5&nbsp;mm. Together this bilayer responds plastically to tensile strains ≥ 30%, below which the skin's surface stretches and wrinkles without deforming.<ref name=":2" /> Properties of epidermal electronics mirror those of skin to allow them to perform in this same way. Like skin, epidermal electronics are ultrathin (''h'' < 100&nbsp;μm), low-modulus (''E'' ~ 70 kPa), and lightweight (<10&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), enabling them to conform to the skin without applying strain.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Siddharth R.|last2=Arafa|first2=Hany M.|last3=Kwon|first3=Kyeongha|last4=Deng|first4=Yujun|last5=Su|first5=Chun-Ju|last6=Reeder|first6=Jonathan T.|last7=Freudman|first7=Juliet|last8=Stankiewicz|first8=Izabela|last9=Chen|first9=Hsuan-Ming|last10=Loza|first10=Robert|last11=Mims|first11=Marcus|date=2020-03-06|title=Continuous, noninvasive wireless monitoring of flow of cerebrospinal fluid through shunts in patients with hydrocephalus|journal=NPJ Digital Medicine|volume=3|issue=1|page=29|doi=10.1038/s41746-020-0239-1|pmid=32195364|pmc=7060317|issn=2398-6352|doi-access=free}}</ref> Conformal contact and proper adhesion enable the device to bend and stretch without delaminating, deforming or failing, thereby eliminating the challenges with conventional, bulky wearables, including measurement artifacts, hysteresis, and motion-induced irritation to the skin. With this inherent ability to take the shape of skin, epidermal electronics can accurately acquire data without altering the natural motion or behavior of skin.<ref name=":6">{{Citation|last1=Chad Webb|first1=R.|title=Ultrathin, Skin-Like Devices for Precise, Continuous Thermal Property Mapping of Human Skin and Soft Tissues|date=2016|work=Stretchable Bioelectronics for Medical Devices and Systems|pages=117–132|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-28692-1|last2=Krishnan|first2=Siddharth|last3=Rogers|first3=John A.|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28694-5_6}}</ref> The thin, soft, flexible design of epidermal electronics resembles that of temporary tattoos laminated on the skin. Essentially, these devices are "mechanically invisible" to the wearer.<ref name=":2" />

Epidermal electronics devices may adhere to the skin via van der Waals forces or elastomeric substrates. With only van der Waals forces, an epidermal device has the same thermal mass per unit area (150 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>K) as skin, when the skin's thickness is <500&nbsp;nm. Along with van der Waals forces, the low values of ''E'' and thickness are effective in maximizing adhesion because they prevent deformation-induced detachment due to tension or compression.<ref name=":2" /> Introducing an elastomeric substrate can improve adhesion but will raise the thermal mass per unit area slightly.<ref name=":6" /> Several materials have been studied to produce these skin-like properties, including photolithography patterned serpentine gold nanofilm and patterned doping of silicon nanomembranes.<ref name=":3" />

== Entertainment ==
Wearables have expanded into the entertainment space by creating new ways to experience digital media. Virtual reality headsets and [[augmented reality]] glasses have come to exemplify wearables in entertainment. The influence of  these virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses are seen mostly in the gaming industry during the initial days, but are now used in the fields of medicine and education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/big-data-and-wearable-health-monitors-harnessing-the-benefits-and-overcoming-challenges/|title=Big Data and Wearable Health Monitors: Harnessing the Benefits and Overcoming Challenges|date=2019-09-17|website=Health Informatics Online Masters {{!}} Nursing & Medical Degrees|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>

Virtual reality headsets such as the [[Oculus Rift]], [[HTC Vive]], and Google Daydream View aim to create a more immersive media experience by either simulating a first-person experience or displaying the media in the user's full field of vision. Television, films, video games, and educational simulators have been developed for these devices to be used by working professionals and consumers. In a 2014 expo, Ed Tang of Avegant presented his "Smart Headphones". These headphones use Virtual Retinal Display to enhance the experience of the Oculus Rift.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.alistdaily.com/media/the-future-of-wearables-in-entertainment-at-wearable-tech-la/|title=The Future Of Wearables In Entertainment At Wearable Tech LA|date=2014-07-18|work=AListDaily|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> Some augmented reality devices fall under the category of wearables. Augmented reality glasses are currently in development by several corporations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/microsoft-research-augmented-reality-glasses/#suovjGvxZOqi|title=Microsoft Research shows off its augmented reality glasses|last=Strange|first=Adario|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref> [[Snap Inc.]]'s [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]] are sunglasses that record video from the user's point of view and pair with a phone to post videos on [[Snapchat]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/24/13042640/snapchat-spectacles-how-to-use|title=Here's how Snapchat's new Spectacles will work|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> Microsoft has also delved into this business, releasing Augmented Reality glasses, [[Microsoft HoloLens|HoloLens]], in 2017. The device explores using digital holography, or holograms, to give the user a first hand experience of Augmented Reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/holographic-near-eye-displays-virtual-augmented-reality/|title=Holographic Near-Eye Displays for Virtual and Augmented Reality - Microsoft Research|work=Microsoft Research|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> These wearable headsets are used in many different fields including the military.

Wearable technology has also expanded from small pieces of technology on the wrist to apparel all over the body. There is a shoe made by the company shiftwear that uses a smartphone application to periodically change the design display on the shoe.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiftwear.com/|title=ShiftWear - Designs In Motion - Shiftwear Sneakers|last=Inc.|first=ShiftWear|website=www.shiftwear.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> The shoe is designed using normal fabric but utilizes a display along the midsection and back that shows a design of your choice. The application was up by 2016 and a prototype for the shoes was created in 2017.<ref name=":0" />

Another example of this can be seen with Atari's headphone speakers. Atari and Audiowear are developing a face cap with built in speakers. The cap will feature speakers built into the underside of the brim, and will have Bluetooth capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://audiowear.com/|title=Audiowear|website=audiowear.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> [[Jabra (headset)|Jabra]] has released earbuds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds|title=Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds review|last=Leong 2019-11-20T23:25:39Z|first=Lewis|website=TechRadar|date=20 November 2019|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> in 2018, that cancel the noise around the user and can toggle a setting called "hearthrough." This setting takes the sound around the user through the microphone and sends it to the user. This gives the user an augmented sound while they commute so they will be able to hear their surroundings while listening to their favorite music.  Many other devices can be considered entertainment wearables and need only be devices worn by the user to experience media.

=== Gaming ===
The gaming industry has always incorporated new technology. The first technology used for electronic gaming was a controller for [[Pong]]. The way users game has continuously evolved through each decade. Currently, the two most common forms of gaming is either using a controller for video game [[Video game console|consoles]] or a mouse and keyboard for [[PC game]]s.

In 2012, virtual reality headsets were reintroduced to the public. VR headsets were first conceptualized in the 1950s and officially created in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/history-of-virtual-reality/|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-12-13|title=8 Major Milestones in the Brief History of Virtual Reality|date=2017-11-13}}</ref> The creation of the first virtual reality headset can be credited to Cinematographer Morton Heilig.

Headsets such as the HoloLens 2 allows the user to see a projected image at multiple angles and interact with the image. This helps gives a ''hands on'' experience to the user, which otherwise, they would not be able to get.

== Fashion ==
Fashionable wearables are "designed garments and accessories that combines aesthetics and style with functional technology."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Sabine|title=Fashionable Technology: The intersection of design, fashion, science and technology|date=2008|publisher=Springer Wien New York|isbn=978-3-211-74498-7}}</ref> Garments are the interface to the exterior mediated through digital technology. It allows endless possibilities for the dynamic customization of apparel. All clothes have social, psychological and physical functions. However, with the use of technology these functions can be amplified. There are some wearables that are called E-textiles. These are the combination of textiles(fabric) and electronic components to create wearable technology within clothing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-report/e-textiles-2019-2029-technologies-markets-and-players/671|title=E-Textiles 2019-2029: Technologies, Markets and Players: IDTechEx|date=2019-05-21|website=www.idtechex.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref><ref>[[E-textiles]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-textiles&oldid=880851242 this version])</ref> They are also known as smart textile and digital textile.

Wearables are made from a functionality perspective or from an aesthetic perspective. When made from a functionality perspective, designers and engineers create wearables to provide convenience to the user. [[Clothing]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] are used as a tool to provide assistance to the user. Designers and engineers are working together to incorporate technology in the manufacturing of garments in order to provide functionalities that can simplify the lives of the user. For example, through [[smartwatch]]es people have the ability to communicate on the go and track their health. Moreover, smart fabrics have a direct interaction with the user, as it allows sensing the customers' moves. This helps to address concerns such as [[privacy]], communication and well-being. Years ago, fashionable wearables were functional but not very aesthetic. As of 2018, wearables are quickly growing to meet fashion standards through the production of garments that are stylish and comfortable. Furthermore, when wearables are made from an aesthetic perspective, designers explore with their work by using technology and collaborating with engineers. These designers explore the different techniques and methods available for incorporating electronics in their designs. They are not constrained by one set of materials or colors, as these can change in response to the embedded sensors in the apparel. They can decide how their designs adapt and responds to the user.<ref name="crafting">{{cite book|last1=Guler|first1=Sibel Deren|title=Crafting wearables: blending technology with fashion|date=2016|publisher=New York: Apress}}</ref>

In 1968, the [[Museum of Contemporary Craft]] in New York City held an exhibition named Body Covering which presented the infusion of technological wearables with fashion. Some of the projects presented were clothing that changed temperature, and party dresses that light up and produce noises, among others. The designers from this exhibition creatively embedded electronics into the clothes and accessories to create these projects. As of 2018, fashion designers continue to explore this method in the manufacturing of their designs by pushing the limits of fashion and technology.<ref name="crafting"/>

There are several methods which companies manufacture e-textiles from fiber to garment and the insertion of electronics to the process. One of the methods being developed is when stretchable circuits are printed right into a fabric using conductive ink.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/9699/Embedding-Smart-Fabric-Sensors-in-Your-Next-Product.aspx|title=Embedding Smart Fabric Sensors in Your Next Product|last1=Solboda|first1=Laura|website=www.engineering.com|publisher=engineering.com|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The conductive ink uses metal fragments in the ink to become electrically conductive. Another method would be using [https://www.swicofil.com/consult/innovations/conductivity conductive thread or yarn]. This development includes the coating of non-conductive fiber (like [[Polyester]] PET) with conductive material such as metal like gold or silver to produce coated yarns or in order to produce an e-textile.<ref name="Wearable E-Textile Technologies: A">{{cite journal|last1=Gonçalves|first1=Carlos|last2=Ferreira da Silva|first2=Alexandre|last3=Gomes|first3=João|last4=Simoes|first4=Ricardo|year=2018|title=Wearable E-Textile Technologies: A Review on Sensors, Actuators and Control Elements Carlos Gonçalves 1,2,* ID, Alexandre Ferreira da Silva 3 ID, João Gomes 2 and|journal=Inventions|volume=3|pages=14|doi=10.3390/inventions3010014|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Military ==
Wearable technology within the military ranges from educational purposes, training exercises and sustainability technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Han|date=June 2019|title=Systematic Analysis of a Military Wearable Device based on a Multi-Level Fusion Framework: Research Directions|journal=Sensors |volume=19|issue=12|pages=2651 |doi=10.3390/s19122651|pmid=31212742|pmc=6631929|bibcode=2019Senso..19.2651S|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The technology used for educational purposes within the military are mainly wearables that tracks a soldier's vitals. By tracking a soldier's heart rate, blood pressure, emotional status, etc. helps the research and development team best help the soldiers. According to chemist, Matt Coppock, he has started to enhance a soldier's lethality by collecting different biorecognition receptors. By doing so it will eliminate emerging environmental threats to the soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/221184/|title=Wearable sensors could leverage biotechnology to monitor personal, environmental data|last=CCDC Army Research Laboratory|first=Public Affairs|date=May 2019|website=army.mil}}</ref>

With the emergence of virtual reality it is only natural to start creating simulations using VR. This will better prepare the user for whatever situation they are training for. In the military there are combat simulations that soldiers will train on. The reason the military will use VR to train its soldiers is because it is the most interactive/immersive experience the user will feels without being put in a real situation.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Office of Technology Assessment|first=Congress of the United States|date=September 1994|title=Virtual Reality|url=https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_1/DATA/1994/9444.PDF|journal=Ota-Bp-Iss-136|volume=136|pages=14–22}}</ref> Recent simulations include a soldier wearing a shock belt during a combat simulation. Each time they are shot the belt will release a certain amount of electricity directly to the user's skin. This is to simulate a shot wound in the most humane way possible.<ref name=":02" />

There are many sustainability technologies that military personnel wear in the field. One of which is a boot insert. This insert gauges how soldiers are carrying the weight of their equipment and how daily terrain factors impact their mission panning optimization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1192220/new-wearable-technology-designed-to-lighten-load-for-marines/|title=New Wearable Technology Designed to Lighten Load for Marines|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> These sensors will not only help the military plan the best timeline but will help keep the soldiers at best physical/mental health.

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] drafted a  guidance for low risk devices advises that personal health wearables are general wellness products if they only collect data on weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management, or sexual function.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm429674.pdf|title = General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices – Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff|date = January 2015|website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = FDA}}</ref> This was due to the privacy risks that were surrounding the devices. As more and more of the devices were being used as well as improved soon enough these devices would be able to tell if a person is showing certain health issues and give a course of action. With the rise of these devices being consumed so to the FDA drafted this guidance in order to decrease risk of a patient in case the app doesn't function properly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Theirer|first=Adam|date=2014|title=The internet of things and wearable technology: Addressing privacy and security concerns without derailing innovation.|url=http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jolt21&div=8&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|journal=Law and Technology|volume=21|pages=1–118}}</ref> It is argued the ethics of it as well because although they help track health and promote independence there is still an invasion of privacy that ensues to gain information. This is due to the huge amounts of data that has to be transferred which could raise issues for both the user and the companies if a third partied gets access to this data. There was an issue with the [[Google Glass|google glass]] that was used by surgeons in order to track vital signs of a patient where it had privacy issues relating to third party use of non-consented information. The issue is consent as well when it comes to wearable technology because it gives the ability to record and that is an issue when permission is not asked when a person is being recorded.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Segura Anaya LH, Alsadoon A, Costadopoulos N, Prasad PW |title=Ethical Implications of User Perceptions of Wearable Devices |journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/s11948-017-9872-8|pmid=28155094|year=2018|s2cid=46748322}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1426579/dod-studying-implications-of-wearable-devices-giving-too-much-info/|title=DoD Studying Implications of Wearable Devices Giving Too Much Info|website=U.S. Department of Defense|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>

Compared to smart phones, wearable devices pose several new reliability challenges to device manufacturers and software developers. Limited display area, limited computing power, limited volatile and non-volatile memory, non-conventional shape of the devices, abundance of sensor data, complex communication patterns of the apps, and limited battery size—all these factors can contribute to salient [[software bug]]s and failure modes, such as, resource starvation or device hangs.<ref name=":1" /> Moreover, since many of the wearable devices are used for health purposes<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /> (either monitoring or treatment), their accuracy and robustness issues can give rise to safety concerns. Some tools have been developed to evaluate the reliability and the security properties of these wearable devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Tianxiao|last2=Sun|first2=Chengnian|last3=Ma|first3=Xiaoxing|last4=Cao|first4=Chun|last5=Xu|first5=Chang|last6=Yao|first6=Yuan|last7=Zhang|first7=Qirun|last8=Lu|first8=Jian|last9=Su|first9=Zhendong|date=May 2019|title=Practical GUI Testing of Android Applications Via Model Abstraction and Refinement|journal=2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|location=Montreal, QC, Canada|publisher=IEEE|pages=269–280|doi=10.1109/ICSE.2019.00042|isbn=978-1-7281-0869-8|s2cid=89608086}}</ref> The early results point to a weak spot of wearable software whereby overloading of the devices, such as through high UI activity, can cause failures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yi|first1=Edgardo Barsallo|last2=Zhang|first2=Heng|last3=Maji|first3=Amiya K.|last4=Xu|first4=Kefan|last5=Bagchi|first5=Saurabh|date=2020-06-15|title=Vulcan: lessons on reliability of wearables through state-aware fuzzing|url=https://doi.org/10.1145/3386901.3388916|journal=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services|series=MobiSys '20|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|pages=391–403|doi=10.1145/3386901.3388916|isbn=978-1-4503-7954-0|s2cid=219398382}}</ref>
