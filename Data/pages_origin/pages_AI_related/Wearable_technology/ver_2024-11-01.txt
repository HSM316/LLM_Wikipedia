{{short description|Clothing and accessories incorporating computer and advanced electronic technologies}}
'''Wearable technology''' is any technology that is designed to be used while [[Clothing|worn]]. Common types of wearable technology include [[smartwatch]]es and [[smartglasses]]. Wearable electronic devices are often close to or on the surface of the skin, where they detect, analyze, and transmit information such as vital signs, and/or ambient data and which allow in some cases immediate biofeedback to the wearer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Düking |first1=Peter |last2=Achtzehn |first2=Silvia |last3=Holmberg |first3=Hans-Christer |last4=Sperlich |first4=Billy |title=Integrated Framework of Load Monitoring by a Combination of Smartphone Applications, Wearables and Point-of-Care Testing Provides Feedback that Allows Individual Responsive Adjustments to Activities of Daily Living |journal=Sensors |date=19 May 2018 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=1632 |doi=10.3390/s18051632 |doi-access=free |pmid=29783763 |pmc=5981295 }}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite journal |last1=Düking |first1=Peter |last2=Hotho |first2=Andreas |last3=Holmberg |first3=Hans-Christer |last4=Fuss |first4=Franz Konstantin |last5=Sperlich |first5=Billy |title=Comparison of Non-Invasive Individual Monitoring of the Training and Health of Athletes with Commercially Available Wearable Technologies |journal=Frontiers in Physiology |date=9 March 2016 |volume=7 |page=71 |doi=10.3389/fphys.2016.00071 |doi-access=free |pmid=27014077 |pmc=4783417 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O’Donoghue |first1=John |last2=Herbert |first2=John |title=Data Management within mHealth Environments: Patient Sensors, Mobile Devices, and Databases |journal=Journal of Data and Information Quality |date=October 2012 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1145/2378016.2378021 }}</ref>

Wearable devices such as [[activity tracker]]s are an example of the [[Internet of things]], since "things" such as [[electronics]], [[software]], [[sensor]]s, and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69916-3_7 |chapter=Patient Sensors: A Data Quality Perspective |title=Smart Homes and Health Telematics |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |date=2008 |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=John |last2=Herbert |first2=John |last3=Sammon |first3=David |volume=5120 |pages=54–61 |isbn=978-3-540-69914-9 }}</ref>) through the internet with a manufacturer, operator, and/or other connected devices, without requiring human intervention. Wearable technology offers a wide range of possible uses, from communication and entertainment to improving health and fitness, however, there are worries about privacy and security because wearable devices have the ability to collect personal data.

Wearable technology has a variety of use cases which is growing as the technology is developed and the market expands. Wearables are popular in consumer electronics, most commonly in the form factors of [[smartwatches]], [[smart ring]]s, and [[Implant (body modification)|implants]]. Apart from commercial uses, wearable technology is being incorporated into navigation systems, advanced textiles ([[e-textiles]]), and [[healthcare]]. As wearable technology is being proposed for use in critical applications, like other technology, it is vetted for its reliability and security properties.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |doi=10.1145/3081333.3081351 |chapter=Characterizing Smartwatch Usage in the Wild |title=Proceedings of the 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services |date=2017 |last1=Liu |first1=Xing |last2=Chen |first2=Tianyu |last3=Qian |first3=Feng |last4=Guo |first4=Zhixiu |last5=Lin |first5=Felix Xiaozhu |last6=Wang |first6=Xiaofeng |last7=Chen |first7=Kai |pages=385–398 |isbn=978-1-4503-4928-4 }}</ref>

== History ==
In the 1500s, German inventor [[Peter Henlein]] (1485-1542) created small watches that were worn as necklaces. A century later, [[pocket watch]]es grew in popularity as waistcoats became fashionable for men. Wristwatches were created in the late 1600s but were worn mostly by women as bracelets.<ref name="crafting"/>

In the late 1800s, the first wearable [[hearing aid]]s were introduced.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Alexander |first1=Howard |title=Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/26/technology/hearing-aids-smaller-and-smarter.html |work=The New York Times |date=26 November 1998 }}</ref>

In 1904, aviator [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] pioneered the modern use of the wristwatch.<ref name="crafting"/>

In the 1970s, [[calculator watch]]es became available, reaching the peak of their popularity in the 1980s.

From the early 2000s, [[wearable camera]]s were being used as part of a growing [[sousveillance]] movement.<ref name="Mann 1997 Wearable computing"/> Expectations, operations, usage and concerns about wearable technology was floated on the first International Conference on [[Wearable Computing]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Keynote speech of 1998 International Conference on Wearable Computing |url=http://eyetap.org/wearcam/icwc98/keynote.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030203172328/http://eyetap.org/wearcam/icwc98/keynote.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-03 |access-date=2024-04-08 }}</ref> In 2008, Ilya Fridman incorporated a hidden Bluetooth microphone into a pair of earrings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ripple Headset|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/203455/Ripple-Headset|website=Behance|date=March 2009 |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2009/07/and-you-thought-the-jawbone-headset-was-stylish.html |title=And you thought the Jawbone headset was stylish |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=13 August 2015|date=2009-07-20 }}</ref>

=== Prototypes ===
From 1991 to 1997, [[Rosalind Picard]] and her students, [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] and Jennifer Healey, at the [[MIT Media Lab]] designed, built, and demonstrated data collection and decision making from "Smart Clothes" that monitored continuous physiological data from the wearer. These "smart clothes", "smart underwear", "smart shoes", and smart jewellery collected data that related to affective state and contained or controlled physiological sensors and environmental sensors like cameras and other devices.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Steve |title=Smart clothing: The wearable computer and wearcam |journal=Personal Technologies |date=March 1997 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–27 |doi=10.1007/BF01317885 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Picard |first1=R.

At the same time, also at the MIT Media Lab, [[Thad Starner]] and Alex "Sandy" Pentland develop [[augmented reality]].  In 1997, their smartglass prototype is featured on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and enables rapid web search and instant messaging.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wearable Computing: rapid instant messaging and web search|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge0wbagV34o&ab_channel=ThadStarner|website=YouTube|access-date=21 January 2021|date=2010-11-19}}</ref>  Though the prototype's glasses are nearly as streamlined as modern smartglasses, the processor was a computer worn in a backpack – the most lightweight solution available at the time.

In 2009, [[Sony Ericsson]] teamed up with the [[London College of Fashion]] for a contest to design digital clothing. The winner was a cocktail dress with Bluetooth technology making it light up when a call is received.<ref>{{cite news|title=Does the Bluetooth dress signal the future of fashion|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2009/06/does-the-bluetooth-dress-signal-the-future-of-fashion.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=13 August 2015|date=2009-06-18}}</ref>

Zach "Hoeken" Smith of [[MakerBot Industries|MakerBot]] fame made keyboard pants during a "Fashion Hacking" workshop at a New York City creative collective.

The Tyndall National Institute<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tyndall.ie/|title=Tyndall|website=www.tyndall.ie|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref> in Ireland developed a "remote non-intrusive patient monitoring" platform which was used to evaluate the quality of the data generated by the patient sensors and how the end users may adopt to the technology.<ref>O'Donoghue, John, John Herbert, and Paul Stack. "Remote non-intrusive patient monitoring." ''Smart Homes and Beyond'' (2006): 180–87.</ref>

More recently, London-based fashion company [[CuteCircuit]] created costumes for singer [[Katy Perry]] featuring LED lighting so that the outfits would change color both during stage shows and appearances on the red carpet such as the dress Katy Perry wore in 2010 at the MET Gala in NYC.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/costume-institute-gala-2010 |access-date=2020-05-14 |website=British Vogue |title=Costume Institute Gala 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419175736/http://www.vogue.co.uk:80/gallery/costume-institute-gala-2010 |archive-date=2018-04-19 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, CuteCircuit created the world's first dress to feature Tweets, as worn by singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]].<ref name="Krupnick">{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/twitter-dress-nicole-scherzinger-photos_n_2064299.html|title=The Huffington Post: Twitter Dress | first=Ellie|last=Krupnick|date=2 November 2012}}</ref>

== Wearable technology and health ==
[[File:Smartwatches.jpg|thumb|[[Samsung Galaxy Watch]] is designed specifically for sports and health functions, including a step counter and a heart rate monitor.]]

Wearable technology is often used to monitor a user's health. Given that such a device is in close contact with the user, it can easily collect data. It started as soon as 1980 where first wireless ECG was invented. In the last decades, there has been substantial growth in research of e.g. textile-based, tattoo, patch, and contact lenses<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harito |first1=Christian |last2=Utari| first2=Listya|last3=Putra |first3=Budi Riza|last4=Yuliarto| first4=Brian|last5=Purwanto| first5=Setyo|last6=Zaidi| first6=Syed S.J.|last7=Bavykin| first7=Dmitry V.|last8=Marken| first8=Frank|last9=Walsh| first9=Frank C.|title=Review—The Development of Wearable Polymer-Based Sensors: Perspectives|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|date=17 February 2020 |volume=167 |issue=3 |page=037566 |doi=10.1149/1945-7111/ab697c |arxiv=2003.00956 |bibcode=2020JElS..167c7566H |doi-access=free}}</ref> as well as circulation of a notion of "[[quantified self]]", [[transhumanism]]-related ideas, and growth of [[life extension]] research.

Wearables can be used to collect data on a user's health including:{{additional citation needed|date=September 2022}}
* Heart rate<ref name="10.3390/mi13081356"/>
* Calories burned
* Steps walked
* Blood pressure

These functions are often bundled together in a single unit, like an activity tracker or a smartwatch like the [[Apple Watch Series 2]] or [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]] Sport. Devices like these are used for physical training and monitoring overall physical health, as well as alerting to serious medical conditions such as seizures (e.g. [[Empatica]] Embrace2).

While [[virtual reality]] (VR) was originally developed for gaming, it also can be used for rehabilitation. Virtual reality headsets are given to patients and the patients instructed to complete a series of tasks, but in a game format. This has significant benefits compared to traditional therapies. For one, it is more controllable; the operator can change their environment to anything they desire including areas that may help them conquer their fear, like in the case of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Another benefit is the price. On average, traditional therapies are several hundred dollars per hour, whereas VR headsets are only several hundred dollars and can be used whenever desired. In patients with neurological disorders like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]], therapy in game format where multiple different skills can be utilized at the same time, thus simultaneously stimulating several different parts of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tokgöz |first1=Pinar |last2=Stampa |first2=Susanne |last3=Wähnert |first3=Dirk |last4=Vordemvenne |first4=Thomas |last5=Dockweiler |first5=Christoph |title=Virtual Reality in the Rehabilitation of Patients with Injuries and Diseases of Upper Extremities |journal=Healthcare |date=16 June 2022 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=1124 |doi=10.3390/healthcare10061124 |pmc=9222955 |pmid=35742176 |doi-access=free }}</ref> VR's usage in physical therapy is still limited as there is insufficient research.

Detractors also point out that a total dependence on VR can lead to self-isolation and be coming overly dependent on technology, preventing patients from interacting with their friends and family. There are concerns about privacy and safety, as the VR software would need patient data and information to be effective, and this information could be compromised during a [[data breach]], like in the case of [[23andMe]].

Additionally, certain parts of VR like [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] and [[Finger tracking|tracking]] are still not advanced enough to be used reliably in a medical setting. Another issue is the amount of VR devices that are available for purchase. While this does increase the options available, the differences between VR systems could impact patient recovery. The vast number of VR devices also makes it difficult for medical professionals to give and interpret information, as they might not have had practice with the specific model, which could lead to faulty advice being given out.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

=== Applications to COVID-19 ===
Various wearable technologies have been developed in order to help with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Oxygen levels, antibody detection, blood pressure, heart rate, and so much more are monitored by small sensors within these devices.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal |last1=Ates |first1=H.

==== Wearable Devices to Detect Symptoms of COVID-19 ====

* Smart lenses
* On-teeth sensors
* Face masks
* [[E-textiles|Smart textiles]]
* Electronic epidermal tattoos
* Micro needle patches
* Wristbands
* [[Smart ring|Smart rings]]
* [[Smartwatch|Smartwatches]]<ref name=":32" />

==== Smartwatches ====
Wearable technology such as [[Apple Watch|Apple Watches]] and [[Fitbit|Fitbits]] have been used to potentially diagnose symptoms of [[COVID-19]]. Monitors within the devices have been designed to detect heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, etc.<ref name=":03" /> The diagnostic capabilities of wearable devices proposes an easier way to detect any abnormalities within the human body.

Estimation and prediction techniques of wearable technology for COVID-19 has several flaws due to the inability to differentiate between other illnesses and COVID-19. Elevations in [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], etc. as well as a fluctuation in oxygen level can be attributed to other sicknesses ranging from the common cold to [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases]].<ref name=":03" /> The inability to differentiate these illnesses has caused "unnecessary stress in patients, raising concern on the implementation of wearables for health."<ref name=":03" />

==== Smart Masks ====
In addition to wearable devices such as watches, professionals designed face masks with built in sensors for individuals to use during the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal |last1=Ates |first1=H. Ceren |last2=Yetisen |first2=Ali K. |last3=Güder |first3=Firat |last4=Dincer |first4=Can |date=January 2021 |title=Wearable devices for the detection of COVID-19 |journal=Nature Electronics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=13–14 |doi=10.1038/s41928-020-00533-1 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The built in sensors were designed to detect characteristics of exhaled breath such as "patterns and rates of respiration, biomarkers of inflammation and the potential detection of airborne [[Pathogen|pathogens]]."<ref name=":12" />

Smart masks "contain a sensor that monitors the presence of a [[SARS-CoV-2]] protease in the breath."<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |title=Smart Masks May Help Detect COVID-19 and Future Infections {{!}} NIH COVID-19 Research |url=https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/smart-masks-may-help-detect-covid-19-and-future-infections |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=covid19.nih.gov |language=en}}</ref> Contained in the mask is a blister pack, which, when broken, causes a [[chemical reaction]] to occur. As a result of the chemical reaction, the sensor will turn blue if the virus is detected from an individual's breathing.<ref name=":22" />

Issues occur however with the amount of protease needed to warrant a correct result from the sensor. An individual's breath only contains protease once the cells die. Then they make their way out of the body in fluids such a saliva, and through breathing. If too little [[protease]] is present, the mask may not be able to detect the protease thus causing a false result.<ref name=":22" />

==== Smart Lenses ====
Smart lenses have been developed to record [[intraocular pressure]].<ref name=":32" /> The lens conforms to the eyeball and contains sensors in which monitor glucose levels, eye movement, and certain [[Biomarker|biomarkers]] for particular diseases. Built into the lenses are micro electronics and processing units that are responsible for data collection. With the innovation of technology, smart lenses have the potential to "incorporate displays that superimpose information onto what the wearer sees."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kazanskiy |first1=Nikolay L. |last2=Khonina |first2=Svetlana N. |last3=Butt |first3=Muhammad A. |title=Smart Contact Lenses—A Step towards Non-Invasive Continuous Eye Health Monitoring |journal=Biosensors |date=18 October 2023 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=933 |doi=10.3390/bios13100933 |doi-access=free |pmid=37887126 |pmc=10605521 }}</ref>

==== Smart Textiles ====
Smart textiles have been developed to monitor skin temperature and [[Metabolite|metabolites]].<ref name=":32" /> These textiles contain sensors which are composed of three basic parts: "containing [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], active elements, and [[electrode]]/[[Interconnect (integrated circuits)|interconnect]]."<ref name=":42">{{Cite journal |last1=Saber |first1=Dalia |last2=Abd El-Aziz |first2=Khaled |date=June 2022 |title=Advanced materials used in wearable health care devices and medical textiles in the battle against coronavirus (COVID-19): A review |journal=Journal of Industrial Textiles |volume=51 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=246S–271S |doi=10.1177/15280837211041771 |pmid=38603366 |pmc=9301358 }}</ref> Although smart textiles can provide a way for individuals to diagnose abnormalities about their body, there are a multitude of challenges associated with the usage. Economic burdens to patients and hospitals as well as the high cost of purchasing and upkeep provide a hinderance to the application of smart textiles. The development of these sensors also face many challenges such as "the selection of suitable substrates, [[Biomaterial|biocompatible materials]], and manufacturing techniques, as well as the instantaneous monitoring of different analysts[sic], the washability, and uninterrupted signal display circuits."<ref name=":42" />

==== Smart Rings ====
Smart rings have been developed to monitor blood pressure. <ref name=":32" />

==== Micro Needle Patches ====
Micro needle patches have been developed to monitor [[Metabolite|metabolites]], inflammation markers, [[Drug|drugs]], etc.<ref name=":32" /> They are also very advantageous for various reasons: "improved [[immunogenicity]], dose-sparing effects, low manufacturing costs...ease of use...and greater acceptability compared to traditional hypodermic injections."<ref name=":52">{{Cite journal |last1=O’Shea |first1=Jesse |last2=Prausnitz |first2=Mark R. |last3=Rouphael |first3=Nadine |date=2021-04-01 |title=Dissolvable Microneedle Patches to Enable Increased Access to Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemic Outbreaks |journal=Vaccines |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=320 |doi=10.3390/vaccines9040320 |doi-access=free |pmc=8066809 |pmid=33915696 }}</ref> The implementation of micro needle patches is expected to expedite the vaccination process making it more applicable, efficient, and cost effective.<ref name=":52" />

Living a healthy life may not just solely be dependent on [[healthy diet|eating healthy]], sleeping well, or participating in a few exercises a week. Instead, it lies far beyond just a few things and rather is deeply connected to a variety of physiological and biochemical parts of the body in relation to physical activity and living a healthy lifestyle. In the past several years, the emergence of technological devices better known as "wearable technology" has improved the ability to measure physical activity and has given simple users and e.g. cardiologists to be able to analyze parameters related to their quality of life.

Wearable technology are devices that people can wear at all times throughout the day, and also throughout the night. They help measure certain values such as heartbeat and rhythm, quality of sleep,{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} total steps in a day, and may help recognize certain diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} They may promote ideas on how to improve one's health and stay away from certain impending diseases. These devices give daily feedback on what to improve on and what areas people are doing well in, and this motivates and continues to push the user to keep on with their improved lifestyle.

Over time, wearable technology has impacted the health and physical activity market an immense amount as, according to Pevnick et al 2018, "The consumer-directed wearable technology market is rapidly growing and expected to exceed $34B by 2020."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pevnick |first1=Joshua M. |last2=Birkeland |first2=Kade |last3=Zimmer |first3=Raymond |last4=Elad |first4=Yaron |last5=Kedan |first5=Ilan |title=Wearable technology for cardiology: An update and framework for the future |journal=Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine |date=February 2018 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=144–150 |doi=10.1016/j.tcm.2017.08.003 |pmid=28818431 |pmc=5762264 }}</ref> This shows how the wearable technology sector is increasingly becoming more and more approved amongst all people who want to improve their health and quality of life.

Wearable technology can come in all forms from watches, pads placed on the heart, devices worn around the arms, all the way to devices that can measure any amount of data just through touching the receptors of the device. In many cases, wearable technology is connected to an app that can relay the information right away ready to be analyzed and discussed with a cardiologist. In addition, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine they state, "wearables may be a low-cost, feasible, and accessible way for promoting PA."<ref name="Phillips 144–150">{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Siobhan M. |last2=Cadmus-Bertram |first2=Lisa |last3=Rosenberg |first3=Dori |last4=Buman |first4=Matthew P. |last5=Lynch |first5=Brigid M. |title=Wearable Technology and Physical Activity in Chronic Disease: Opportunities and Challenges |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |date=January 2018 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=144–150 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2017.08.015 |pmc=5736445 |pmid=29122356 }}</ref> Essentially, this insinuates that wearable technology can be beneficial to everyone and really is not cost prohibited. Also, when consistently seeing wearable technology being actually utilized and worn by other people, it promotes the idea of physical activity and pushes more individuals to take part.

Wearable technology also helps with chronic disease development and monitoring physical activity in terms of context. For example, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, "Wearables can be used across different chronic disease trajectory phases (e.g., pre- versus [[Post-surgical complications|post-surgery]]) and linked to [[electronic health record|medical record data]] to obtain granular data on how activity frequency, intensity, and duration changes over the disease course and with different treatments."<ref name="Phillips 144–150"/> Wearable technology can be beneficial in tracking and helping analyze data in terms of how one is performing as time goes on, and how they may be performing with different changes in their diet, workout routine, or sleep patterns. Also, not only can wearable technology be helpful in measuring results pre and post surgery, but it can also help measure results as someone may be rehabbing from a chronic disease such as cancer, or heart disease, etc.

Wearable technology has the potential to create new and improved ways of how we look at health and how we actually interpret that science behind our health. It can propel us into higher levels of medicine and has already made a significant impact on how patients are diagnosed, treated, and rehabbed over time. However, extensive research still needs to be continued on how to properly integrate wearable technology into health care and how to best utilize it. In addition, despite the reaping benefits of wearable technology, a lot of research still also has to be completed in order to start transitioning wearable technology towards very sick high risk patients.

===Sense-making of the data===
{{Expand section|date=March 2023}}
{{See also|Electronic health record#Use in research and development}}
While wearables can collect data in aggregate form, most of them are limited in their ability to analyze or make conclusions based on this data – thus, most are used primarily for general health information.

Exception include seizure-alerting wearables, which continuously analyze the wearer's data and make a decision about calling for help – the data collected can then provide doctors with objective evidence that they may find useful in diagnoses.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Wearables can account for individual differences, although most just collect data and apply one-size-fits-all algorithms. Software on the wearables may analyze the data directly or send the data to a nearby device(s), such as a smartphone, which processes, displays or uses the data for analysis. For analysis and real-term sense-making, [[machine learning]] algorithms can also be used.<ref name="10.1038/s41586-022-05498-z"/>

===Use in surveillance===
Today, there is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking, but also within corporate health and wellness programs. Given that wearables create a massive [[data trail]] which employers could repurpose for objectives other than health, more and more research has begun to study privacy- and security-related issues of wearables, including related to the use for [[surveillance capitalism|surveillance of workers]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mettler |first1=Tobias |last2=Wulf| first2=Jochen |title=Physiolytics at the workplace: affordances and constraints of wearables use from an employee's perspective |journal=Information Systems Research |date=6 July 2018 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=245–273 |doi=10.1111/isj.12205 |doi-access=free }}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=March 2023}} [[Asha Peta Thompson]] founded Intelligent Textiles who create woven power banks and circuitry that can be used in [[E-textiles|e]]-uniforms for [[infantry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/aug/03/wearable-technology-wardrobes-smart-fashion|title=Is wearable technology set to take over our wardrobes?|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=2015-08-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-22|language=en-GB }}</ref>

== By form factor ==
Wearable technology can exist in multiple different form factors. Popular smartwatches include the [[Samsung Galaxy Watch]] and the [[Apple Watch]]. A popular [[smart ring]] is the McLear Ring. A popular implant is the [[Dangerous Things]] NExT RFID + NFC [[Microchip implant (human)|Chip Implant]], albeit such is not worn but implanted.{{clarify|date=March 2023|reason=implants are also mentioned in the lead but they're usually only implanted not also worn}}{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

=== Head-worn ===
Glasses (including but not only [[smartglasses]]) are wearable technology that are head-worn.

====Headgear====
Headcaps, for example to measure [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], are head-worn. A study indicates EEG headgear could be used for [[neuroenhancement]], concluding that a "visual flicker paradigm to entrain individuals at their own brain rhythm (i.e. peak [[Alpha wave|alpha frequency]])" results in {{tooltip|substantially|according to the news report "This group improved at least three times faster than control groups"}} faster perceptual visual [[learning]], maintained the day following training.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brain-frequency primer accelerates learning and retention |url=https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/brain-frequency-learning/ |access-date=15 February 2023 |work=New Atlas |date=1 February 2023 |archive-date=15 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230215182922/https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/brain-frequency-learning/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Learning at your brain's rhythm: individualized entrainment boosts learning for perceptual decisions |journal=Cerebral Cortex |date=9 November 2022 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhac426|doi-access=free|last1=Michael |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Covarrubias |first2=Lorena Santamaria |last3=Leong |first3=Victoria |last4=Kourtzi |first4=Zoe |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=5382–5394 |pmid=36352510 |pmc=10152088 }}</ref> There is research into various forms of [[neurostimulation]], with various approaches including the use of wearable technology.

=== Epidermal electronics (skin-attached) ===
{{Further|#Applications}}
Epidermal electronics is an emerging field of wearable technology, termed for their properties and behaviors comparable to those of the epidermis, or outermost layer of the skin.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Dae-Hyeong|last2=Rogers|first2=John|date=2011|title=Epidermal Electronics|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6044|pages=838–843|doi=10.1126/science.1206157|pmid=21836009|bibcode=2011Sci...333..838K|osti=1875151 |s2cid=426960}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=R.

Current usage of epidermal technology is limited by existing fabrication processes. Its current application relies on various sophisticated fabrication techniques such as by lithography or by directly printing on a carrier substrate before attaching directly to the body. Research into printing epidermal electronics directly on the skin is currently available as a sole study source.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Ling|last2=Ji|first2=Hongjun|last3=Huang|first3=Houbing|last4=Yi|first4=Ning|last5=Shi|first5=Xiaoming|last6=Xie|first6=Senpei|last7=Li|first7=Yaoyin|last8=Ye|first8=Ziheng|last9=Feng|first9=Pengdong|last10=Lin|first10=Tiesong|last11=Liu|first11=Xiangli|date=2020-10-07|title=Wearable Circuits Sintered at Room Temperature Directly on the Skin Surface for Health Monitoring|journal=ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces|volume=12|issue=40|pages=45504–45515|doi=10.1021/acsami.0c11479|pmid=32911929|s2cid=221625878 |url=https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/resources/68f43a0c-eef1-49d9-8b4a-4f65c5090d6c }}</ref>

The significance of epidermal electronics involves their mechanical properties, which resemble those of skin. The skin can be modeled as bilayer, composed of an epidermis having Young's Modulus (''E'') of 2-80 kPa and thickness of 0.3–3&nbsp;mm and a dermis having ''E'' of 140-600 kPa and thickness of 0.05-1.5&nbsp;mm. Together this bilayer responds plastically to tensile strains ≥ 30%, below which the skin's surface stretches and wrinkles without deforming.<ref name=":2" /> Properties of epidermal electronics mirror those of skin to allow them to perform in this same way. Like skin, epidermal electronics are ultrathin (''h'' < 100&nbsp;μm), low-modulus (''E'' ~ 70 kPa), and lightweight (<10&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), enabling them to conform to the skin without applying strain.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Siddharth R.|last2=Arafa|first2=Hany M.|last3=Kwon|first3=Kyeongha|last4=Deng|first4=Yujun|last5=Su|first5=Chun-Ju|last6=Reeder|first6=Jonathan T.|last7=Freudman|first7=Juliet|last8=Stankiewicz|first8=Izabela|last9=Chen|first9=Hsuan-Ming|last10=Loza|first10=Robert|last11=Mims|first11=Marcus|date=2020-03-06|title=Continuous, noninvasive wireless monitoring of flow of cerebrospinal fluid through shunts in patients with hydrocephalus|journal=npj Digital Medicine|volume=3|issue=1|page=29|doi=10.1038/s41746-020-0239-1|pmid=32195364|pmc=7060317 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Conformal contact and proper adhesion enable the device to bend and stretch without delaminating, deforming or failing, thereby eliminating the challenges with conventional, bulky wearables, including measurement artifacts, hysteresis, and motion-induced irritation to the skin. With this inherent ability to take the shape of skin, epidermal electronics can accurately acquire data without altering the natural motion or behavior of skin.<ref name=":6">{{Citation|last1=Chad Webb|first1=R.|title=Ultrathin, Skin-Like Devices for Precise, Continuous Thermal Property Mapping of Human Skin and Soft Tissues|date=2016|work=Stretchable Bioelectronics for Medical Devices and Systems|pages=117–132|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-28692-1|last2=Krishnan|first2=Siddharth|last3=Rogers|first3=John A.|series=Microsystems and Nanosystems |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28694-5_6}}</ref> The thin, soft, flexible design of epidermal electronics resembles that of temporary tattoos laminated on the skin. Essentially, these devices are "mechanically invisible" to the wearer.<ref name=":2" />

Epidermal electronics devices may adhere to the skin via van der Waals forces or elastomeric substrates. With only van der Waals forces, an epidermal device has the same thermal mass per unit area (150 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>K) as skin, when the skin's thickness is <500&nbsp;nm. Along with van der Waals forces, the low values of ''E'' and thickness are effective in maximizing adhesion because they prevent deformation-induced detachment due to tension or compression.<ref name=":2" /> Introducing an elastomeric substrate can improve adhesion but will raise the thermal mass per unit area slightly.<ref name=":6" /> Several materials have been studied to produce these skin-like properties, including photolithography patterned serpentine gold nanofilm and patterned doping of silicon nanomembranes.<ref name=":3" />

=== Foot-worn ===
Smart shoes are an example of wearable technology that incorporate smart features into shoes. Smart shoes often work with smartphone applications to support tasks cannot be done with standard footwear. The uses include vibrating of the smart phone to tell users when and where to turn to reach their destination via [[Google Maps]] or self-lacing.<ref name="Euronews">{{cite news|title=Five Futuristic Trends which could change the face of Tourism|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/08/15/five-futuristic-trends-which-could-change-the-face-of-tourism|newspaper=[[Euronews]]|date=15 August 2017|access-date=15 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="xtech">{{cite news|title=The smartshoe: A much more sensible approach to wearable computing than Glass or a smartwatch

==Modern technologies==

[[File:Fitbit Charge HR.jpg|thumb|right|The Fitbit, a modern wearable device]]
On April 16, 2013, [[Google]] invited "Glass Explorers" who had pre-ordered its wearable glasses at the 2012 Google I/O conference to pick up their devices. This day marked the official launch of Google Glass, a device intended to deliver rich text and notifications via a heads-up display worn as eyeglasses. The device also had a 5 MP camera and recorded video at 720p.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tech specs|url=https://support.google.com/glass/answer/3064128?hl=en&ref_topic=3063354|access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref> Its various functions were activated via [[Speech recognition|voice command]], such as "OK Glass".

However, in early 2015, Google stopped selling the beta "explorer edition" of Glass to the public, after criticism of its design and the $1,500 price tag.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google has admitted that releasing Google Glass early may have been a mistake|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/tony-fadell-releasing-google-glass-explorer-beta-to-public-mistake-2015-7|website=Business Insider|access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref>

While optical head-mounted display technology remains a niche, two popular types of wearable devices have taken off: smartwatches and activity trackers. In 2012, [[ABI Research]] forecast that sales of smartwatches would hit $1.2 million in 2013, helped by the high penetration of smartphones in many world markets, the wide availability and low cost of MEMS sensors, energy efficient connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth 4.0, and a flourishing app ecosystem.<ref>[http://www.abiresearch.com/press/more-than-one-million-smart-watches-will-be-shippe More Than One Million Smart Watches will be Shipped in 2013], ABI Research</ref>

[[Crowdfunding]]-backed start-up [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] reinvented the smartwatch in 2013, with a campaign running on [[Kickstarter]] that raised more than $10m in funding. At the end of 2014, Pebble announced it had sold a million devices. In early 2015, Pebble went back to its crowdfunding roots to raise a further $20m for its next-generation smartwatch, Pebble Time, which started shipping in May 2015.{{update inline|date=March 2023}}

[[Crowdfunding]]-backed start-up [[McLear]] invented the smart ring in 2013, with a campaign running on [[Kickstarter]] that raised more than $300k in funding. McLear was the first mover in wearables technology in introducing payments, bitcoin payments, advanced secure access control, [[quantified self]] data collection, biometric data tracking, and monitoring systems for the elderly.

As wearable technology continues to grow, it has begun to expand into other fields. The integration of wearables into healthcare has been a focus of research and development for various institutions. Wearables continue to evolve, moving beyond devices and exploring new frontiers such as smart fabrics. Applications involve using a fabric to perform a function such as integrating a [[QR code]] into the textile,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/20/technology/startups/jansport-programmable-backpack/index.html|title=JanSport's high-tech backpack gives teens a new way to express themselves|last=McFarland|first=Matt|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> or performance apparel that increases airflow during exercise<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2017/moisture-responsive-workout-suit-0519|title=Researchers design moisture-responsive workout suit|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref>

== Entertainment ==
[[File:W Series Sports Walkman.jpg|thumb|A fully wearable [[Walkman]] music player ([[List of Sony Walkman products#W Series|W series]])]]
Wearables have expanded into the entertainment space by creating new ways to experience digital media. Virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses have come to exemplify wearables in entertainment. The influence of these virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses are seen mostly in the gaming industry during the initial days, but are now used in the fields of medicine and education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/big-data-and-wearable-health-monitors-harnessing-the-benefits-and-overcoming-challenges/|title=Big Data and Wearable Health Monitors: Harnessing the Benefits and Overcoming Challenges|date=2019-09-17|website=Health Informatics Online Masters {{!}} Nursing & Medical Degrees|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>

Virtual reality headsets such as the [[Oculus Rift]], [[HTC Vive]], and Google Daydream View aim to create a more immersive media experience by either simulating a first-person experience or displaying the media in the user's full field of vision. Television, films, video games, and educational simulators have been developed for these devices to be used by working professionals and consumers. In a 2014 expo, Ed Tang of Avegant presented his "Smart Headphones". These headphones use Virtual Retinal Display to enhance the experience of the Oculus Rift.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.alistdaily.com/media/the-future-of-wearables-in-entertainment-at-wearable-tech-la/|title=The Future Of Wearables In Entertainment At Wearable Tech LA|date=2014-07-18|work=AListDaily|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> Some augmented reality devices fall under the category of wearables. Augmented reality glasses are currently in development by several corporations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/microsoft-research-augmented-reality-glasses/#suovjGvxZOqi|title=Microsoft Research shows off its augmented reality glasses|last=Strange|first=Adario|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref> [[Snap Inc.]]'s [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]] are sunglasses that record video from the user's point of view and pair with a phone to post videos on [[Snapchat]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/24/13042640/snapchat-spectacles-how-to-use|title=Here's how Snapchat's new Spectacles will work|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> Microsoft has also delved into this business, releasing Augmented Reality glasses, [[Microsoft HoloLens|HoloLens]], in 2017. The device explores using digital holography, or holograms, to give the user a first hand experience of Augmented Reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/holographic-near-eye-displays-virtual-augmented-reality/|title=Holographic Near-Eye Displays for Virtual and Augmented Reality - Microsoft Research|work=Microsoft Research|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> These wearable headsets are used in many different fields including the military.

Wearable technology has also expanded from small pieces of technology on the wrist to apparel all over the body. There is a shoe made by the company shiftwear that uses a smartphone application to periodically change the design display on the shoe.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiftwear.com/|title=ShiftWear - Designs In Motion - Shiftwear Sneakers|website=www.shiftwear.com|access-date=2018-02-19|archive-date=2002-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923131127/https://www.shiftwear.com/}}</ref> The shoe is designed using normal fabric but utilizes a display along the midsection and back that shows a design of your choice. The application was up by 2016 and a prototype for the shoes was created in 2017.<ref name=":0" />

Another example of this can be seen with Atari's headphone speakers. Atari and Audiowear are developing a face cap with built in speakers. The cap will feature speakers built into the underside of the brim, and will have Bluetooth capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://audiowear.com/|title=Audiowear|website=audiowear.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> [[Jabra (headset)|Jabra]] has released earbuds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds|title=Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds review|last=Leong |first=Lewis|website=TechRadar|date=20 November 2019|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> in 2018, that cancel the noise around the user and can toggle a setting called "hearthrough." This setting takes the sound around the user through the microphone and sends it to the user. This gives the user an augmented sound while they commute so they will be able to hear their surroundings while listening to their favorite music.  Many other devices can be considered entertainment wearables and need only be devices worn by the user to experience media.

=== Gaming ===
The gaming industry has always incorporated new technology. The first technology used for electronic gaming was a controller for [[Pong]]. The way users game has continuously evolved through each decade. Currently, the two most common forms of gaming is either using a controller for video game [[Video game console|consoles]] or a mouse and keyboard for [[PC game]]s.

In 2012, virtual reality headphones were reintroduced to the public. VR headsets were first conceptualized in the 1950s and officially created in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/history-of-virtual-reality/|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-12-13|title=8 Major Milestones in the Brief History of Virtual Reality|date=2017-11-13}}</ref> The creation of the first virtual reality headset can be credited to Cinematographer Morton Heilig. He created a device known as the Sensorama in 1962.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://launchforth.io/blog/post/engineer-spotlight-morton-heilig/2363/|title=Engineer Spotlight: Morton Heilig |date=2017-07-17|work=Launch Forth|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-us|archive-date=2018-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306083425/https://launchforth.io/blog/post/engineer-spotlight-morton-heilig/2363/}}</ref> The Sensorama was a videogame like device that was so heavy that it needed to be held up by a suspension device.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/sensorama/|work=Media Art Net |last=Giannetti |first= Claudia|title=Morton Heilig: Sensorama|date=2019-12-13|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> There has been numerous different wearable technology within the gaming industry from gloves to foot boards. The gaming space has offbeat inventions. In 2016, Sony debuted its first portable, connectable virtual reality headset codenamed Project Morpheus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/best-vr-headsets-2017|title=Best VR headsets 2018: HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR compared|work=Wareable|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref> The device was rebranded for PlayStation in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sony-project-morpheus-now-playstation-vr|title=Sony's Project Morpheus now officially called 'PlayStation VR'|last=Collins|first=Katie|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> In early 2019, Microsoft debuts their [[HoloLens 2]] that goes beyond just virtual reality into mixed reality headset. Their main focus is to be use mainly by the working class to help with difficult tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019|title=Microsoft's HoloLens 2: a $3,500 mixed reality headset for the factory, not the living room|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2019-02-24|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> These headsets are used by educators, scientists, engineers, military personnel, surgeons, and many more. Headsets such as the HoloLens 2 allows the user to see a projected image at multiple angles and interact with the image. This helps gives a ''hands on'' experience to the user, which otherwise, they would not be able to get.

== Military ==
Wearable technology within the military ranges from educational purposes, training exercises and sustainability technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Han|date=June 2019|title=Systematic Analysis of a Military Wearable Device based on a Multi-Level Fusion Framework: Research Directions|journal=Sensors |volume=19|issue=12|page=2651 |doi=10.3390/s19122651|pmid=31212742|pmc=6631929|bibcode=2019Senso..19.2651S|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The technology used for educational purposes within the military are mainly wearables that tracks a soldier's vitals. By tracking a soldier's heart rate, blood pressure, emotional status, etc. helps the research and development team best help the soldiers. According to chemist, Matt Coppock, he has started to enhance a soldier's lethality by collecting different biorecognition receptors. By doing so it will eliminate emerging environmental threats to the soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/221184/|title=Wearable sensors could leverage biotechnology to monitor personal, environmental data|last=CCDC Army Research Laboratory|first=Public Affairs|date=May 2019|website=army.mil}}</ref>

With the emergence of virtual reality it is only natural to start creating simulations using VR. This will better prepare the user for whatever situation they are training for. In the military there are combat simulations that soldiers will train on. The reason the military will use VR to train its soldiers is because it is the most interactive/immersive experience the user will feels without being put in a real situation.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Office of Technology Assessment|first=Congress of the United States|date=September 1994|title=Virtual Reality|url=https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_1/DATA/1994/9444.PDF|journal=Ota-Bp-Iss-136|volume=136|pages=14–22}}</ref> Recent simulations include a soldier wearing a shock belt during a combat simulation. Each time they are shot the belt will release a certain amount of electricity directly to the user's skin. This is to simulate a shot wound in the most humane way possible.<ref name=":02" />

There are many sustainability technologies that military personnel wear in the field. One of which is a boot insert. This insert gauges how soldiers are carrying the weight of their equipment and how daily terrain factors impact their mission panning optimization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1192220/new-wearable-technology-designed-to-lighten-load-for-marines/|title=New Wearable Technology Designed to Lighten Load for Marines|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> These sensors will not only help the military plan the best timeline but will help keep the soldiers at best physical/mental health.

== Fashion ==
Fashionable wearables are "designed garments and accessories that combines aesthetics and style with functional technology."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Sabine|title=Fashionable Technology: The intersection of design, fashion, science and technology|date=2008|publisher=Springer Wien New York|isbn=978-3-211-74498-7}}</ref> Garments are the interface to the exterior mediated through digital technology. It allows endless possibilities for the dynamic customization of apparel. All clothes have social, psychological and physical functions. However, with the use of technology these functions can be amplified. There are some wearables that are called E-textiles. These are the combination of textiles(fabric) and electronic components to create wearable technology within clothing.<ref>{{Cite report |url=https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-report/e-textiles-2019-2029-technologies-markets-and-players/671|title=E-Textiles 2019-2029: Technologies, Markets and Players|date=2019-05-21|website=IDTechEx |language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> They are also known as smart textile and digital textile.

Wearables are made from a functionality perspective or from an aesthetic perspective. When made from a functionality perspective, designers and engineers create wearables to provide convenience to the user. [[Clothing]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] are used as a tool to provide assistance to the user. Designers and engineers are working together to incorporate technology in the manufacturing of garments in order to provide functionalities that can simplify the lives of the user. For example, through [[smartwatch]]es people have the ability to communicate on the go and track their health. Moreover, smart fabrics have a direct interaction with the user, as it allows sensing the customers' moves. This helps to address concerns such as [[privacy]], communication and well-being. Years ago, fashionable wearables were functional but not very aesthetic. As of 2018, wearables are quickly growing to meet fashion standards through the production of garments that are stylish and comfortable. Furthermore, when wearables are made from an aesthetic perspective, designers explore with their work by using technology and collaborating with engineers. These designers explore the different techniques and methods available for incorporating electronics in their designs. They are not constrained by one set of materials or colors, as these can change in response to the embedded sensors in the apparel. They can decide how their designs adapt and responds to the user.<ref name="crafting">{{cite book|last1=Guler|first1=Sibel Deren|title=Crafting wearables: blending technology with fashion|date=2016|publisher=New York: Apress}}</ref>

In 1967, French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, known for his futuristic designs created a collection of garments entitled "robe electronique" that featured a geometric embroidered pattern with LEDs (light emitting diodes).

In 1968, the [[Museum of Contemporary Craft]] in New York City held an exhibition named Body Covering which presented the infusion of technological wearables with fashion. Some of the projects presented were clothing that changed temperature, and party dresses that light up and produce noises, among others. The designers from this exhibition creatively embedded electronics into the clothes and accessories to create these projects. As of 2018, fashion designers continue to explore this method in the manufacturing of their designs by pushing the limits of fashion and technology.<ref name="crafting"/>

=== Manufacturing process of e-textiles ===
There are several methods which companies manufacture e-textiles from fiber to garment and the insertion of electronics to the process. One of the methods being developed is when stretchable circuits are printed right into a fabric using conductive ink.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/9699/Embedding-Smart-Fabric-Sensors-in-Your-Next-Product.aspx|title=Embedding Smart Fabric Sensors in Your Next Product|last1=Solboda|first1=Laura|website=www.engineering.com|publisher=engineering.com|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The conductive ink uses metal fragments in the ink to become electrically conductive. Another method would be using [https://www.swicofil.com/consult/innovations/conductivity conductive thread or yarn].

Compared to smartphones, wearable devices pose several new reliability challenges to device manufacturers and software developers. Limited display area, limited computing power, limited volatile and non-volatile memory, non-conventional shape of the devices, abundance of sensor data, complex communication patterns of the apps, and limited battery size—all these factors can contribute to salient [[software bug]]s and failure modes, such as, resource starvation or device hangs.<ref name=":1" /> Moreover, since many of the wearable devices are used for health purposes<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" /> (either monitoring or treatment), their accuracy and robustness issues can give rise to safety concerns.
