Wearable devices such as [[activity tracker]]s are an example of the [[internet of things|Internet of Things]], since "things" such as [[electronics]], [[software]], [[sensor]]s, and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality<ref>O’Donoghue, J., Herbert, J. and Sammon, D., 2008, June.

Wearable technology has a variety of applications which grows as the field itself expands. It appears prominently in consumer electronics with the popularization of the [[smartwatch]] and activity tracker. Apart from commercial uses, wearable technology is being incorporated into navigation systems, advanced textiles, and [[healthcare]].

==History==
The pre-history of wearable technology starts with the watch, which was worn by people to tell time. In 1500 the German inventor [[Peter Henlein]] created small watches which were worn as necklaces. A century later, men began to carry their watches in their pockets as the waistcoat became a fashionable item, which led to the creation of pocket watches. Wristwatches were also created in the late 1600s but were worn mostly by women as bracelets. 
Over time, the watch become smaller and more precise. In 1904, the aviator [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] pioneered the use of the wristwatch as it allowed him to have his hands unoccupied when piloting. This proved that the wrist is a convenient place to wear a watch which led people to start using wristwatches.<ref name="crafting"/> People started to create wearables to use in every occasion, from tools that help them win in gambling games, to rings used as a computational device by traders, to electronic headbands used as a costume in theaters, and a wearable camera strapped to a bird to take aerial photos, among others.

Modern wearable technology is related to both [[ubiquitous computing]] and the history and development of [[wearable computers]]. Wearables make technology pervasive by incorporating it into daily life. Through the history and development of wearable computing, pioneers have attempted to enhance or extend the functionality of clothing, or to create wearables as accessories able to provide users with [[sousveillance]] — the recording of an activity typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. Tracking information like movement, steps, and heart rate is part of the [[quantified self]] movement.

The origins of modern wearable technology are influenced by both of these responses to the vision of ubiquitous computing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wearable Computing: A First Step Toward Personal Imaging|journal=IEEE Computer|volume=30|number=2|url=http://wearcam.org/ieeecomputer/}}</ref> One early piece of widely adopted pre-modern wearable technology was the [[calculator watch]], which was introduced in the 1980s. An even earlier wearable technology was the [[hearing aid]].

In 2004, fashion design label [[CuteCircuit]] unveiled a concept [[Bluetooth]]-connected electronics called the HugShirt at the CyberArt Festival in Bilbao, Spain, where it won the Grand Prize at the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|author= |url=http://www.ciberartfestival.net/premiados.pdf|title=Premiados Ciberart}}</ref> The HugShirt, designed for tele-transmitting touch over distance, differs from previous early wearable technology examples (e.g. watches or the helmet designs of wearable computing in the 1990s) because the product is the first wearable technology that took the form of a garment of clothing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1PPAwAAQBAJ|title=Garments of Paradise: Wearable Discourse in the Digital Age by Susan Elizabeth Ryan|isbn=9780262323970|last1=Ryan|first1=Susan Elizabeth|date=2014-06-13}}</ref> As such, it is also the first piece of Bluetooth-connected and internet-connected clothing.

McLear and Fitbit are the first two technology companies to develop modern wearables for mass consumer use, and not solely as futurist conceptual products. McLear, today remaining as one of the leaders in the wearable computing space, began research and development on smart watches and invented the smart ring in 2010. <ref>{{Cite news|url= https://the-gadgeteer.com/2013/07/21/nfc-ring-review/|title=NFC Ring Review|work=The Gadgeteer}}</ref>

Fitbit released its first step counter in late 2010; [[List of Fitbit products|Fitbit products]] have primarily focused upon activity tracking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaewkannate|first=Kanitthika|last2=Kim|first2=Soochan|date=24 May 2016|title=A comparison of wearable fitness devices|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=16|pages=433|doi=10.1186/s12889-016-3059-0|pmid=27220855|pmc=4877805}}</ref> Fitbit is now owned by Alphabet and is no longer an independent wearable electronics company.

In the following years smartwatches began to be released by major electronics companies as well as by new start-ups. One of the first offerings was the [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]] in September 2013. Apple followed more than a year later with the [[Apple Watch]] in April 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-timeline-of-how-the-apple-watch-was-created-2015-3|title=A timeline of how the Apple Watch was created|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}</ref>  In January 2018, a small business, Empatica, received the first FDA clearance for their smartwatch in Neurology, the Embrace, which monitors and alerts for grand mal seizures, while also detecting steps and sleep.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/empaticas-consumer-facing-epileptic-seizure-detecting-wearable-gets-fda-clearance|title=Empatica's consumer-facing epileptic seizure-detecting wearable gets FDA clearance|work=MobiHealthNewsaccess-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Oculus VR|Oculus]] launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to start sales of the first consumer virtual reality headset.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://virtualspeech.com/blog/history-of-vr|title=History of VR - Timeline of Events and Tech Development|website=virtualspeech.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> In 2016, the company, [[HTC]] released a new generation of the VR headsets that allowed users to move freely within a virtual space.<ref name=":1" />

==Prototypes==
From 1995-1997, Jennifer Healey and [[Rosalind Picard]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]] designed, built, and demonstrated data collection and decision making from wearables that monitored continuous physiological data from the wearer. These shoes, jewelry, and clothing accessories collected data that related to affective state and controlled cameras and other devices.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Affective Wearables|journal=Personal Technologies|last1=Picard |first1=Rosalind |last2=Healey|first2=Jennifer|date=December 1997|volume=1|issue=4|pages=231–240|doi=10.1007/BF01682026}}</ref>

In 2009, [[Sony Ericsson]] teamed up with the London College of Fashion for a contest to design digital clothing. The winner was a cocktail dress with Bluetooth technology making it light up when a call is received.<ref>{{cite web|title=Does the Bluetooth dress signal the future of fashion|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2009/06/does-the-bluetooth-dress-signal-the-future-of-fashion.html|website=LA Times|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=2009-06-18}}</ref>

==Modern technologies==

[[File:Fitbit Charge HR.jpg|thumb|right|The Fitbit, a modern wearable device]]
On April 16, 2013, [[Google]] invited "Glass Explorers" who had pre-ordered its wearable glasses at the 2012 Google I/O conference to pick up their devices. This day marked the official launch of Google Glass, a device intended to deliver rich text and notifications via a heads-up display worn as eyeglasses. The device also had a 5 MP camera and recorded video at 720p.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tech specs|url=https://support.google.com/glass/answer/3064128?hl=en&ref_topic=3063354|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Its various functions were activated via voice command, such as "OK Glass". The company also launched the Google Glass companion app, MyGlass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Finally Reveals Glass Specifications, MyGlass App Now Live|url=http://selfscreens.com/archives/1794/google-finally-reveals-glass-specifications-myglass-app-now-live/|accessdate=11 August 2013|website = Self Screens}}</ref> The first third-party Google Glass App came from the ''[[New York Times]]'', which was able to read out articles and news summaries.

However, in early 2015, Google stopped selling the beta "explorer edition" of Glass to the public, after criticism of its design and the $1,500 price tag.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google has admitted that releasing Google Glass early may have been a mistake|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/tony-fadell-releasing-google-glass-explorer-beta-to-public-mistake-2015-7/|website=Business Insider|accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref>

While optical head-mounted display technology remains a niche, two popular types of wearable devices have taken off: smartwatches and activity trackers. In 2012, [[ABI Research]] forecast that sales of smartwatches would hit $1.2 million in 2013, helped by the high penetration of smartphones in many world markets, the wide availability and low cost of MEMS sensors, energy-efficient connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth 4.0, and a flourishing app ecosystem.<ref>[http://www.abiresearch.com/press/more-than-one-million-smart-watches-will-be-shippe More Than One Million Smart Watches will be Shipped in 2013], ABI Research</ref>

[[Crowdfunding]]-backed start-up [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] reinvented the smartwatch in 2013, with a campaign running on [[Kickstarter]] that raised more than $10m in funding. At the end of 2014, Pebble announced it had sold a million devices. In early 2015, Pebble went back to its crowdfunding roots to raise a further $20m for its next-generation smartwatch, Pebble Time, which started shipping in May 2015.

In March 2014, [[Motorola]] unveiled the [[Moto 360]] smartwatch powered by [[Android Wear]], a modified version of the mobile operating system Android designed specifically for smartwatches and other wearables.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moto 360: It's Time|url=http://motorola-blog.blogspot.in/2014/03/moto-360-its-time.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|website = The Official Motorola Blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sharing what's up our sleeve: Android coming to wearables|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2014/03/sharing-whats-up-our-sleeve-android.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|website = Official Google Blog}}</ref> Finally, following more than a year of speculation, Apple announced its own smartwatch, the [[Apple Watch]], in September 2014.

Wearable technology was a popular topic at the trade show [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2014, with the event dubbed "The Wearables, Appliances, Cars and Bendable TVs Show" by industry commentators.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wearable tech at CES 2014: Many, many small steps |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/wearable-tech-at-ces-2014-many-many-small-steps/ |accessdate=17 March 2016 |website=CNET}}</ref> Among numerous wearable products showcased were smartwatches, activity trackers, smart jewelry, head-mounted optical displays and earbuds. Nevertheless, wearable technologies are still suffering from limited battery capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Energy-Efficient Integration of Continuous Context Sensing and Prediction into Smartwatches|journal = Sensors|volume=15|issue=9|pages=22616–22645|doi=10.3390/s150922616|pmid=26370997|pmc = 4610428|year=2015|last1=Rawassizadeh|first1=Reza|last2=Tomitsch|first2=Martin|last3=Nourizadeh|first3=Manouchehr|last4=Momeni|first4=Elaheh|last5=Peery|first5=Aaron|last6=Ulanova|first6=Liudmila|last7=Pazzani|first7=Michael}}</ref>

Another field of application of wearable technology is monitoring systems for [[assisted living]] and [[eldercare]]. Wearable sensors have a huge potential in generating [[big data]], with a great applicability to biomedicine and ambient assisted living.<ref>{{cite journal|title=What Does Big Data Mean for Wearable Sensor Systems?

Wearable technology can also collect biometric data such as heart rate (ECG and HRV), brainwave (EEG), and muscle bio-signals (EMG) from the human body to provide valuable information in the field of health care and wellness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/topics/wearable-technology/biometric-information/data-collection/|title=Wearable Technology, Biometric Information, Data Collection {{!}} JD Supra|website=JD Supra|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>

Another increasingly popular wearable technology involves virtual reality. [[VR headset]]s have been made by a range of manufacturers for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. Recently Google released their headset, the Google Daydream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/41253/Singh_d912f5075af50e0812_2008.pdf?sequence=1|title=A survey of mobile and wireless technologies for augmented reality systems|last=Papagiannakis|first=George|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

In July 2014 a smart technology footwear was introduced in [[Hyderabad]], [[India]].

In recent years fitness trackers and smartwatches have become increasingly common and recognizable as examples of wearable technology. Examples include [[Garmin Forerunner|Garmin]], [[Fitbit]], [[Apple Watch]], and [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]].

In addition to commercial applications, wearable technology is being researched and developed for a multitude of uses. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] is one of the many research institutions developing and testing technologies in this field. For example, research is being done to improve [[haptic technology]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2013/wearable-tactile-displays-0614|title=Can you feel me now?|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> for its integration into next generation wearables. Another project focuses on using wearable technology to assist the visually impaired in navigating their surroundings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2017/wearable-visually-impaired-users-navigate-0531|title=Wearable system helps visually impaired users navigate|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>

As wearable technology continues to grow, it has begun to expand into other fields. The integration of wearables into healthcare has been a focus of research and development for various institutions. Wearables continue to evolve, moving beyond devices and exploring new frontiers such as smart fabrics. Applications involve using a fabric to perform a function such as integrating a [[QR code]] into the textile,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/20/technology/startups/jansport-programmable-backpack/index.html|title=JanSport's high-tech backpack gives teens a new way to express themselves|last=McFarland|first=Matt|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> or performance apparel that increases airflow during exercise<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2017/moisture-responsive-workout-suit-0519|title=Researchers design moisture-responsive workout suit|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref>

== Wearable technology and health ==
Wearable technology is often used to monitor a user's health. Given that such a device is in close contact with the user, it can easily collect data.

Wearables can be used to collect data on a user's health including:
* Heart rate
* Calories burned
* Steps walked
* Blood pressure
*Release of certain biochemicals
* Time spent exercising
* Seizures

These functions are often bundled together in a single unit, like an activity tracker or a smartwatch like the [[Apple Watch Series 2]] or [[Samsung Galaxy Gear]] Sport. Devices like these are used for physical training and monitoring overall physical health, as well as alerting to serious medical conditions such as seizures (e.g. Empatica Embrace).

Currently other applications within healthcare are being explored, such as:
* Forecasting changes in mood, stress, and health <ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90160775/this-mit-startup-is-developing-a-fitness-tracker-for-your-brain|title=This MIT Startup is Developing a Fitness Tracker for your Brain|last=Schwab|first=Kahtarine|work=Fastcompany|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>

While wearables can collect data in aggregate form, most of them are limited in their ability to analyze or make conclusions based on this data; thus, most are used primarily for general health information. (An exception is seizure-alerting wearables, which continuously analyze the wearer's data and make a decision about calling for help; the data collected can then provide doctors with objective evidence that they may find useful in diagnoses.)  Wearables can account for individual differences, although most just collect data and apply one-size-fits-all algorithms. 

Today, there is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking, but also within corporate health and wellness programs. Given that wearables create a massive [[data trail]] which employers could repurpose for objectives other than health, more and more research has begun to study the dark side of wearables.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mettler |first1=Tobias |last2=Wulf| first2=Jochen |title=Physiolytics at the workplace: affordances and constraints of wearables use from an employee's perspective |journal=Information Systems Research |date=6 July 2018 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=245–273 |doi=10.1111/isj.12205 }}</ref> [[Asha Peta Thompson]] founded Intelligent Textiles Limited, Intelligent Textiles, who create woven power banks and circuitry that can be used in e[[E-textiles|-]]<nowiki/>uniforms for [[infantry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/aug/03/wearable-technology-wardrobes-smart-fashion|title=Is wearable technology set to take over our wardrobes?|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=2015-08-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

== Entertainment ==
Wearables have expanded into the entertainment space by creating new ways to experience digital media. Virtual reality headsets and [[augmented reality]] glasses have come to exemplify wearables in entertainment. The influence of  these virtual reality headsets and augmented reality glasses are seen mostly in the gaming industry during the initial days, but are now used in the fields of medicine and education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/big-data-and-wearable-health-monitors-harnessing-the-benefits-and-overcoming-challenges/|title=Big Data and Wearable Health Monitors: Harnessing the Benefits and Overcoming Challenges|date=2019-09-17|website=Health Informatics Online Masters {{!}} Nursing & Medical Degrees|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> 

Virtual reality headsets such as the [[Oculus Rift]], [[HTC Vive]], and Google Daydream View aim to create a more immersive media experience by either simulating a first-person experience or displaying the media in the user's full field of vision. Television, films, video games, and educational simulators have been developed for these devices to be used by working professionals and consumers. In a 2014 expo, Ed Tang of Avegant presented his "Smart Headphones". These headphones use Virtual Retinal Display to enhance the experience of the Oculus Rift.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.alistdaily.com/media/the-future-of-wearables-in-entertainment-at-wearable-tech-la/|title=The Future Of Wearables In Entertainment At Wearable Tech LA|date=2014-07-18|work=AListDaily|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> Some augmented reality devices fall under the category of wearables. Augmented reality glasses are currently in development by several corporations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/microsoft-research-augmented-reality-glasses/#suovjGvxZOqi|title=Microsoft Research shows off its augmented reality glasses|last=Strange|first=Adario|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en}}</ref> [[Snap Inc.]]'s [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]] are sunglasses that record video from the user's point of view and pair with a phone to post videos on [[Snapchat]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/24/13042640/snapchat-spectacles-how-to-use|title=Here's how Snapchat's new Spectacles will work|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> Microsoft has also delved into this business, releasing Augmented Reality glasses, [[Microsoft HoloLens|HoloLens]], in 2017. The device explores using digital holography, or holograms, to give the user a first hand experience of Augmented Reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/holographic-near-eye-displays-virtual-augmented-reality/|title=Holographic Near-Eye Displays for Virtual and Augmented Reality - Microsoft Research|work=Microsoft Research|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}</ref> These wearable headsets are used in many different fields including the military. 

Wearable technology has also expanded from small pieces of technology on the wrist to apparel all over the body. There is a shoe made by the company shiftwear that uses a smartphone application to periodically change the design display on the shoe.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shiftwear.com/|title=ShiftWear - Designs In Motion - Shiftwear Sneakers|last=Inc.|first=ShiftWear|website=www.shiftwear.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> The shoe is designed using normal fabric but utilizes a display along the midsection and back that shows a design of your choice. The application was up by 2016 and a prototype for the shoes was created in 2017.<ref name=":0" /> 

Another example of this can be seen with Atari's headphone speakers. Atari and Audiowear are developing a face cap with built in speakers. The cap will feature speakers built into the underside of the brim, and will have Bluetooth capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://audiowear.com/|title=Audiowear|website=audiowear.com|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> [[Jabra (headset)|Jabra]] has released earbuds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds|title=Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds review|last=Leong 2019-11-20T23:25:39Z|first=Lewis|website=TechRadar|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>, in 2018, that cancel the noise around the user and can toggle a setting called "hearthrough." This setting takes the sound around the user through the microphone and sends it to the user. This gives the user an augmented sound while they commute so they will be able to hear their surroundings while listening to their favorite music.  Many other devices can be considered entertainment wearables and need only be devices worn by the user to experience media.

=== Gaming ===
The gaming industry has always incorporated new technology. The first technology used for electronic gaming was a controller for [[Pong]]. The way users game has continuously evolved through each decade. Currently, the two most common forms of gaming is either using a controller for video game [[Video game console|consoles]] or a mouse and keyboard for [[PC game|PC games]].

In 2012, virtual reality headsets were reintroduced to the public. VR headsets were first conceptualized in the 1950s and officially created in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/history-of-virtual-reality/|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> The creation of the first virtual reality headset can be credited to Cinematographer Morton Heilig. He created a device known as the Sensorama in 1962.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://launchforth.io/blog/post/engineer-spotlight-morton-heilig/2363/|title=Engineer Spotlight : Morton Heilig {{!}} Launch Forth|date=2017-07-17|work=Launch Forth|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-us}}</ref> The Sensorama was a videogame like device that was so heavy that it needed to be held up by a suspension device.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/sensorama/|title=Media Art Net {{!}} Heilig, Morton: Sensorama|last=Net|first=Media Art|date=2019-12-13|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> There has been numerous different wearable technology within the gaming industry from gloves to foot boards. The gaming space has offbeat inventions. In 2016 Sony debuted its first portable, connectable virtual reality headset codenamed Project Morpheus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/best-vr-headsets-2017|title=Best VR headsets 2018: HTC Vive, Oculus, PlayStation VR compared|work=Wareable|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref> The device was rebranded for PlayStation in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sony-project-morpheus-now-playstation-vr|title=Sony's Project Morpheus now officially called 'PlayStation VR'|last=Collins|first=Katie|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> Early 2019 Microsoft debut their [[HoloLens 2]] that goes beyond just virtual reality into mixed reality headset.

Headsets such as the HoloLens 2 allows the user to see a projected image at multiple angles and interact with the image. This helps gives a ''hands on'' experience to the user, which otherwise, they would not be able to get. 

== Fashion ==
Fashionable wearables are “designed garments and accessories that combines aesthetics and style with functional technology.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seymour|first1=Sabine|title=Fashionable Technology: The intersection of design, fashion, science and technology|date=2008|publisher=Springer Wien New York|isbn=978-3-211-74498-7}}</ref> Garments are the interface to the exterior mediated through digital technology. It allows endless possibilities for the dynamic customization of apparel. All clothes have social, psychological and physical functions. However, with the use of technology these functions can be amplified. There are some wearables that are called E-textiles. These are the combination of textiles(fabric) and electronic components to create wearable technology within clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-report/e-textiles-2019-2029-technologies-markets-and-players/671|title=E-Textiles 2019-2029: Technologies, Markets and Players: IDTechEx|date=2019-05-21|website=www.idtechex.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref><ref>[[E-textiles]] ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E-textiles&oldid=880851242 this version])</ref>They are also known as smart textile and digital textile.

Wearables are made from a functionality perspective or from an aesthetic perspective. When made from a functionality perspective, designers and engineers create wearables to provide convenience to the user. [[Clothing]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] are used as a tool to provide assistance to the user. Designers and engineers are working together to incorporate technology in the manufacturing of garments in order to provide functionalities that can simplify the lives of the user. For example, through [[smartwatch]]es people have the ability to communicate on the go and track their health. Moreover, smart fabrics have a direct interaction with the user, as it allows sensing the customers' moves. This helps to address concerns such as [[privacy]], communication and well-being. Years ago, fashionable wearables were functional but not very aesthetic. As of 2018, wearables are quickly growing to meet fashion standards through the production of garments that are stylish and comfortable. Furthermore, when wearables are made from an aesthetic perspective, designers explore with their work by using technology and collaborating with engineers. These designers explore the different techniques and methods available for incorporating electronics in their designs. They are not constrained by one set of materials or colors, as these can change in response to the embedded sensors in the apparel. They can decide how their designs adapt and responds to the user.<ref name="crafting">{{cite book|last1=Guler|first1=Sibel Deren|title=Crafting wearables: blending technology with fashion|date=2016|publisher=New York: Apress}}</ref>

In 1968, the [[Museum of Contemporary Craft]] in New York City held an exhibition named Body Covering which presented the infusion of technological wearables with fashion. Some of the projects presented were clothing that changed temperature, and party dresses that light up and produce noises, among others. The designers from this exhibition creatively embedded electronics into the clothes and accessories to create these projects. As of 2018, fashion designers continue to explore this method in the manufacturing of their designs by pushing the limits of fashion and technology.<ref name="crafting"/>

=== Project Jacquard ===
Project Jacquard, a [[Google]] project led by Ivan Poupyrev, has been combining clothing with technology.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3046864/meet-project-jacquard-googles-plan-to-turn-all-your-clothes-into-a-touchscreen|title=Meet Project Jacquard, Google's Plan To Turn Your Clothes Into A Touch Screen|last=Brownlee|first=John|date=2015-06-01|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}</ref>  Google collaborated with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi Strauss]] to create a jacket that has touch-sensitive areas that can control a smartphone.

[[File:Iris Van Herpen.jpg|thumb|Iris Van Herpen's water dress]]
Smart fabrics and 3D printing have been incorporated in high fashion by the designer [[Iris van Herpen]].  Van Herpen was the first designer to incorporate [[3D printing]] technology of [[rapid prototyping]] into the fashion industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amed|first1=Imran|title=The future of wearables is smart fabrics, says Business of Fashion founder|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/smart-fabrics-beat-smart-devices|journal=Wired UK|accessdate=20 January 2018|date=2016-01-12}}</ref> The Belgian company Materialise NV collaborates with her in the printing of her designs.

=== Manufacturing Process of E-textiles ===
There are several methods which companies manufacture e-textiles from fiber to garment and the insertion of electronics to the process. One of the methods being developed is when stretchable circuits are printed right into a fabric using conductive ink.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/9699/Embedding-Smart-Fabric-Sensors-in-Your-Next-Product.aspx|title=Embedding Smart Fabric Sensors in Your Next Product|last1=Solboda|first1=Laura|website=www.engineering.com|publisher=engineering.com|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> The conductive ink uses metal fragments in the ink to become electrically conductive. Another method would be using [https://www.swicofil.com/consult/innovations/conductivity conductive thread or yarn]. This development includes the coating of non-conductive fiber (like [[Polyester]] PET) with conductive material such as metal like gold or silver to produce coated yarns or in order to produce an e-textile.<ref name="Wearable E-Textile Technologies: A">{{cite journal|last1=Gonçalves|first1=Carlos|last2=Ferreira da Silva|first2=Alexandre|last3=Gomes|first3=João|last4=Simoes|first4=Ricardo|year=2018|title=Wearable E-Textile Technologies: A Review on Sensors, Actuators and Control Elements Carlos Gonçalves 1,2,* ID , Alexandre Ferreira da Silva 3 ID , João Gomes 2 and|journal=Inventions|volume=3|pages=14|doi=10.3390/inventions3010014}}</ref> 

Common fabrication techniques for e-textiles include the following traditional methods:

* Embroidery
* Sewing
* Weaving
* Non-woven
* Knitting
* Spinning
* Breading
* Coating
* Printing

== Military ==
Wearable technology within the military ranges from educational purposes, training exercises and sustainability technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Han|date=June 2019|title=Systematic Analysis of a Military Wearable Device based on a Multi-Level Fusion Framework: Research Directions|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/12/2651/pdf|journal=MDPI|volume=|pages=1–6|via=MDPI sensors}}</ref>

The technology used for educational purposes within the military are mainly wearables that tracks a soldier's vitals. By tracking a soldier's heart rate, blood pressure, emotional status, etc. helps the research and development team best help the soldiers. According to chemist, Matt Coppock, he has started to enhance a soldier's lethality by collecting different biorecognition receptors. By doing so it will eliminate emerging environmental threats to the soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/221184/|title=Wearable sensors could leverage biotechnology to monitor personal, environmental data|last=CCDC Army Research Laboratory|first=Public Affairs|date=May 2019|website=army.mil|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

With the emergence of virtual reality it is only natural to start creating simulations using VR. This will better prepare the user for whatever situation they are training for. In the military there are combat simulations that soldiers will train on. The reason the military will use VR to train its soldiers is because it is the most interactive/immersive experience the user will feels without being put in a real situation. <ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Office of Technology Assessment|first=Congress of the United States|date=September 1994|title=Virtual Reality|url=https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_1/DATA/1994/9444.PDF|journal=Ota-Bp-Iss-136|volume=136|pages=14–22|via=}}</ref> Recent simulations include a soldier wearing a shock belt during a combat simulation. Each time they are shot the belt will release a certain amount of electricity directly to the user's skin. This is to simulate a shot wound in the most humane way possible. <ref name=":02" />

There are many sustainability technologies that military personnel wear in the field. One of which is a boot insert. This insert gauges how soldiers are carrying the weight of their equipment and how daily terrain factors impact their mission panning optimization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/1192220/new-wearable-technology-designed-to-lighten-load-for-marines/|title=New Wearable Technology Designed to Lighten Load for Marines|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> These sensors will not only help the military plan the best timeline but will help keep the soldiers at best physical/mental health.

== Issues and Concerns ==
The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] drafted a  guidance for low risk devices advises that personal health wearables are general wellness products if they only collect data on weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management, or sexual function.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm429674.pdf|title = General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices - Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff|date = January 2015|accessdate = |website = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = FDA|last = |first = }}</ref> This was due to the privacy risks that were surrounding the devices. As more and more of the devices were being used as well as improved soon enough these devices would be able to tell if a person is showing certain health issues and give a course of action. With the rise of these devices being consumed so to the FDA drafted this guidance in order to decrease risk of a patient in case the app doesn't function properly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Theirer|first=Adam|date=2014|title=The internet of things and wearable technology: Addressing privacy and security concerns without derailing innovation.|url=http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jolt21&div=8&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|journal=Law and Technology|volume=21|pages=1–118|via=}}</ref> It is argued the ethics of it as well because although they help track health and promote independence there is still an invasion of privacy that ensues to gain information. This is due to the huge amounts of data that has to be transferred which could raise issues for both the user and the companies if a third partied gets access to this data. There was an issue with the [[Google Glass|google glass]] that was used by surgeons in order to track vital signs of a patient where it had privacy issues relating to third party use of non-consented information. The issue is consent as well when it comes to wearable technology because it gives the ability to record and that is an issue when permission is not asked when a person is being recorded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Segura Anaya, L.H., Alsadoon, A., Costadopoulos, N. et al.
