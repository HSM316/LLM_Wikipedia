The '''''Pinakes''''' ({{lang-grc|Πίνακες}} "tables", plural of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πίναξ|πίναξ]]}}) is a lost [[bibliography|bibliographic]] work composed by [[Callimachus]] (310/305–240 BCE) that is popularly considered to be the first [[library catalog]]; its contents were based upon the holdings of the [[Library of Alexandria]] during Callimachus' tenure there during the third century BCE.<ref>N. Krevans 2002: 173</ref>

==History==

The Library of Alexandria had been founded by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] about 306 BCE. The first recorded librarian was [[Zenodotus]] of Ephesus. During Zenodotus' tenure, Callimachus, who was never the head librarian, compiled many catalogues/lists, each called ''Pinakes''. His most famous one listed authors and their works; thus he became the first known bibliographer and the scholar who organized the library by authors and subjects about 245 BCE.<ref>Neil Hopkinson, ''A Hellenistic Anthology'' (CUP, 1988) 83.</ref><ref name ="alexandria3">{{cite web|url= http://www.greekplanet.com.au/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t486.html|title=Greek Inventions|accessdate= 2008-09-19}}</ref> His work was 120 volumes long.<ref>Hopkinson</ref>

[[Apollonius of Rhodes]] was the successor to Zenodotus. [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene succeeded Apollonius in 235 BCE and compiled his ''tetagmenos epi teis megaleis bibliothekeis'', the 'scheme of the great bookshelves'. In 195 BCE [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], Eratosthenes' successor, was the librarian and updated the ''Pinakes'',<ref>Pfeiffer, R. ''History of Classical Scholarship from the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age'' (OUP, 1968) 133.</ref> although it is also possible that his work was not a supplement of Callimachus' ''Pinakes'' themselves, but an independent polemic against, or commentary upon, their contents.<ref>Slater, W.J. "Grammarians on Handwashing", ''Phoenix'' 43 (1989) 100&ndash;11, at 102.</ref>

==Description==

The collection at the Library of Alexandria contained nearly 500,000 [[papyrus]] scrolls, which were grouped together by subject matter and stored in bins.<ref>P.J. Parson, "Libraries", in the ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd ed. (OUP, 1996) describes the evidence for the size of the library's holdings thus: "The first Ptolemies (see Ptolemy (1) ) collected ambitiously and systematically; the Alexandrian Library (see ALEXANDRIA (1) ) became legend, and *Callimachus (3)'s ''Pinakes'' made its content accessible. There were rivals at *Pella, *Antioch (1) (where *Euphorion (2) was librarian), and especially *Pergamum. Holdings were substantial: if the figures can be trusted, Pergamum held at least 200,000 rolls (Plut. ''Ant.'' 58. 9), the main library at Alexandria nearly 500,000 (*Tzetzes, ''Prolegomena de comoedia'' 11a. 2. 10–11 Koster)&mdash;the equivalent, perhaps, of 100,000 modern books."</ref> Each bin carried a label with painted tablets hung above the stored papyri. ''Pinakes'' was named after these tablets and are a set of index lists. The bins gave bibliographical information for every roll.<ref>Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418191647/http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm |date=2012-04-18 }}</ref> A typical entry started with a title and also provided the author's name, birthplace, father's name, any teachers trained under, and educational background. It contained a brief biography of the author and a list of the author's publications. The entry had the first line of the work, a summary of its contents, the name of the author, and information about the origin of the roll, as well as any doubts about the genuineness of the ascription.<ref name ="alexandria4">{{cite web|url= http://www.greece.org/hec01/www/arts-culture/alexandria/library/library11.htm|title= The Pinakes|accessdate= 2010-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616100618/http://www.greece.org/hec01/www/arts-culture/alexandria/library/library11.htm|archive-date= 2011-06-16|url-status= dead}}</ref>

Callimachus' system divided works into six [[genres]] and five sections of prose: rhetoric, law, epic, tragedy, comedy, lyric poetry, history, medicine, mathematics, natural science, and miscellanies. Each category was alphabetized by author.

Callimachus composed two other works that were referred as ''pinakes'' and were probably somewhat similar in format to the ''Pinakes'' (of which they "may or may not be subsections"<ref>Nita Krevans, "Callimachus and the Pedestrian Muse," in M.A. harder et al., eds., ''Callimachus II'' (Hellenistica Groningana 7), 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CL4A5I3K-KsC&lpg=PA173&dq=callimachus%20democritus%20catalog&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false 173] n. 1.</ref>), but were concerned with individual topics. These are listed by the ''[[Suda]]'' as: ''A Chronological Pinax and Description of [[Theatre director#The director in theatre history|Didaskaloi]] from the Beginning'' and ''Pinax of the Vocabulary and Treatises of [[Democritus]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/kappa/227|title=SOL Search|website=www.stoa.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}</ref>

==Later bibliographic ''pinakes''==
The term ''pinax'' was used for bibliographic catalogs beyond Callimachus. For example, [[Ptolemy-el-Garib]]'s catalog of [[Aristotle]]'s writings comes to us with the title ''Pinax (catalog) of Aristotle's writings''.<ref>[[Ingemar Düring]], ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'' (Göteborg 1957), p. 221.</ref>

==Legacy==
The ''Pinakes'' proved indispensable to librarians for centuries, and they became a model for [[Knowledge organization|organizing knowledge]] throughout the [[Mediterranean]]. Their later influence can be traced to medieval times, even to the Arabic counterpart of the tenth century: [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s ''Al-Fihrist'' ("Index").<ref name ="alexandria4"/>   Local variations for [[cataloging]] and [[library classification]] continued throughout the late 1800s, when [[Anthony Panizzi]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] paved the way for more shared and standardized approaches.
