'''Artisto''' is a video processing application with art and movie effects filters based on [[neural network|neural network algorithms]] created in 2016 by [[Mail.ru Group]] machine learning specialists.

At the moment the application can process videos up to 10 seconds long<ref>{{cite web|title= Artisto app is like Prisma for video, turning videos into instant art|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/06/artisto-prisma-for-video/#oNInXkT1ESqd|publisher=mashable.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-06}}</ref> and offers users 21 filters,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Ivan Mehta|title=Meet Prisma's Competitors In Photos And Video: Alter And Artisto|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/08/10/meet-prismas-competitors-in-photos-and-video-alter-and-artisto/|publisher=huffingtonpost.in|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814114508/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/08/10/meet-prismas-competitors-in-photos-and-video-alter-and-artisto/|archive-date=2016-08-14|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Tramandroid">{{cite web|author1=Uzair Ahmad|title=Give Artistic look like Prisma to your Videos using Artisto Android App|url=http://www.teamandroid.com/2016/08/14/give-artistic-look-like-prisma-to-your-videos-using-artisto-android-app/|publisher=teamandroid.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-14}}</ref> including those based on the works of famous artists (e.g. Blue Dream — [[Pablo Picasso]]), theme-based (Rio-2016 — related to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]) and others. The app works with both pre-recorded videos and videos recorded with the application.

==History==
Information on the application first appeared on Mail.ru Group Vice President Anna Artamonova's FB page on July 29, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mail.Ru Group разработал аналог Prisma для обработки видео|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3051899|publisher=kommersant.ru|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-07-29}}</ref> At the moment of posting there was only an Android version available. According to Anna, the application's first version only took eight days to develop. On July 31, the application was added to the AppStore for free download.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisto transforms your videos into moving paintings|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/03/artisto-prisma-for-videos/|publisher=engadget.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-03}}</ref>

From this moment and continuing into the present, Artisto has been the world's first app that uses neural networks for editing short videos, processing them in the style of famous artworks or any other source image.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Onsa Mustafa|title=Artisto- A Video Editing App Uses Neural Network Similar to Prisma|url=https://www.phoneworld.com.pk/artisto-a-video-editing-app-uses-neural-network-similar-to-prisma/|publisher=phoneworld.com.pk|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-10}}</ref> [[Prisma (app)]] application developers promise to deliver similar functionality at any moment.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Mark Melin|title=Prisma App's Video Editing Feature Coming Soon To Android, iOS|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/07/prisma-app-video-editing-android-ios/|publisher=valuewalk.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-07-27}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The application soon won recognition and started to attract the attention of both international brands (e.g. Korean auto manufacturer [[Kia Motors]]) and popular singers and musicians.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the steps of Prisma: Mail.Ru Group applies neural network technologies to videos|url=http://www.ewdn.com/2016/08/04/on-the-steps-of-prisma-mail-ru-group-applies-neural-network-technologies-to-videos/|publisher=ewdn.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-04}}</ref>

According to the independent App Annie analysis system, within the first two weeks on the market the application made it onto the TOP download lists in nine countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisto – Video Editor with Unique Art Filters and Movie Effects|url=https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/1137893020/|publisher=appannie.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-07-30}}</ref>

== Technology ==
The idea of transferring styles from works of famous artists to images was first mentioned in September 2015 after the publication of Leon Gatys's article "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style",<ref name="Neural">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gatys LA, Ecker AS, Bethge M | title=A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style| arxiv=1508.06576  | journal = Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition| pages = 16 | date = August 26, 2015 | bibcode=2015arXiv150806576G}}</ref> where he described the algorithm in detail. The major shortcoming of this algorithm is its slow performance, which is up to dozens of seconds depending on the algorithm's settings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

In March 2016, Russian researcher Dmitry Ulyanov's article was published, where he invented a way to improve the generation of stylized pictures using additional neuron generator network training.<ref name="Texture">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ulyanov D, Lebedev V, Vedaldi A, Lempitsky V | title=Texture Networks: Feed-forward Synthesis of Textures and Stylized Images| journal = Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition| pages=10 | date= March 10, 2016 | arxiv=1603.03417v1| bibcode=2016arXiv160303417U}}</ref> With this approach, stylized images can be generated within just dozens of milliseconds. Seventeen days after Ulyanov's article, Justin Johnson published an article containing an identical idea,<ref name="Perceptual">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ulyanov D, Johnson J, Alahi A, Fei-Fei L | title=Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution| journal = Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition| pages = 18 | date = March 27, 2016 | publisher =Department of Computer Science, Stanford University | arxiv=1603.08155| bibcode=2016arXiv160308155J}}</ref> the only difference being the structure of the generator network.

The Artisto application was developed using these open-source technologies, which Mail.ru Group's machine learning specialists improved for faster video processing and better quality.<ref name="Venturbeat">{{cite web|title=Mail.ru launches video-filter app Aristo to compete with Prisma|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/08/06/mail-ru-launches-aristo-to-compete-with-prisma|publisher=venturebeat.com|access-date=2016-08-23|date=2016-08-06}}</ref>
