'''Fluentd''' is a [[cross platform]] [[open-source software|open-source]] [[data collection]] software project originally developed at Treasure Data. It is written primarily in the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language.

== Overview ==
Fluentd is a [[Big Data]] tool for semi- or un-structured data sets. Like [[Apache Kafka]], it analyzes [[Logfile#Event logs|event log]]s, [[Application software|application]] logs, and [[clickstream]]s.<ref>Pasupuleti, Pradeep and Purra, Beulah Salome (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evioCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 ''Data Lake Development with Big Data'']. pp. 44–45; 48. [[Packt]]. {{ISBN|1785881663}}</ref> According to Suonsyrjä and Mikkonen, the "core idea of Fluentd is to be the unifying layer between different types of log inputs and outputs.",<ref>Suonsyrjä, Sampo and Mikkonen, Tommi [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TRWcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 "Designing an Unobtrusive Analytics Framework for Monitoring Java Applications"], pp. 170–173 in ''Software Measurement''. Springer. {{ISBN|3319242857}}</ref> Fluentd is available on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.<ref>Fluentd.org. [http://www.fluentd.org/download "Download Fluentd"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.</ref>

== History ==
Fluentd was created by Sadayuki Furuhashi as a project of the [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]]-based firm Treasure Data. Written primarily in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], its source code was released as [[open-source software]] in October 2011.<ref>Mayer, Chris (30 October 2013).

[http://www.fluentd.org/architecture "What is Fluentd?"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.</ref>
The company announced $5 million of funding in 2013.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Treasure Data raises $5M, fuses Hadoop and data warehouse in Amazon’s cloud |author= Derrick Harris |work= GigaOm |date= July 23, 2013 }}</ref>

Fluentd was one of the data collection tools recommended by [[Amazon Web Services]] in 2013, when it was said to be similar to [[Apache Flume]] or [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]].<ref>{{Cite web |title= Best Practices for Amazon EMR |author= Parviz Deyhim |date= August 2013 |publisher= Amazon Web Services |url= http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |page= 12 |access-date= March 24, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160326193947/http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |archive-date= 2016-03-26 |url-status= dead }}</ref> [[Google Cloud Platform]]'s [[BigQuery]] recommends Fluentd as default real-time data-ingestion tool, and uses Google's customized version of Fluentd, called google-fluentd, as a default logging agent.<ref>[[Google Cloud Platform]] (2016).
