'''Fluentd''' is a [[cross platform|cross-platform]] [[open-source software|open-source]] [[data collection]] software project originally developed at [[Treasure Data]].  It is written primarily in the [[C (Programming Language)|C]] programming language with a thin-[[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] wrapper that gives users flexibility.<ref>https://docs.fluentd.org/quickstart {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>

== Overview ==
Fluentd was positioned for "[[big data]]," semi- or un-structured data sets. It analyzes [[Logfile#Event logs|event log]]s, [[Application software|application]] logs, and [[clickstream]]s.<ref>Pasupuleti, Pradeep and Purra, Beulah Salome (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=evioCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 ''Data Lake Development with Big Data'']. pp. 44–45; 48. [[Packt]]. {{ISBN|1785881663}}</ref> According to Suonsyrjä and Mikkonen, the "core idea of Fluentd is to be the unifying layer between different types of log inputs and outputs.",<ref>Suonsyrjä, Sampo and Mikkonen, Tommi [https://books.google.com/books?id=TRWcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 "Designing an Unobtrusive Analytics Framework for Monitoring Java Applications"], pp. 170–173 in ''Software Measurement''. Springer. {{ISBN|3319242857}}</ref> Fluentd is available on [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref>Fluentd.org. [http://www.fluentd.org/download "Download Fluentd"].

== History ==
{{Update|date=May 2024}}
Fluentd was created by Sadayuki Furuhashi as a project of the [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]]-based firm Treasure Data. Written primarily in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], its source code was released as [[open-source software]] in October 2011.<ref>Mayer, Chris (30 October 2013). [https://jaxenter.com/treasure-data-breaking-down-the-hadoop-barrier-2-107032.html "Treasure Data: Breaking down the Hadoop barrier"]. ''JAXenter''</ref><ref name="fluentd-architecture">Fluentd.org. [http://www.fluentd.org/architecture "What is Fluentd?"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.</ref> The company announced $5 million of funding in 2013.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Treasure Data raises $5M, fuses Hadoop and data warehouse in Amazon's cloud |author= Derrick Harris |work= GigaOm |date= July 23, 2013 }}</ref>
Treasure Data was then sold to [[Arm Ltd.]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Arm unit Treasure Data to seek buyer or IPO before Nvidia sale |work= Nikkei Asia |date= November 19, 2020 |access-date= August 2, 2021 |url= https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Arm-unit-Treasure-Data-to-seek-buyer-or-IPO-before-Nvidia-sale }}</ref>

Fluentd was one of the data collection tools recommended by [[Amazon Web Services]] in 2013, when it was said to be similar to [[Apache Flume]] or [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]].<ref>{{Cite web |title= Best Practices for Amazon EMR |author= Parviz Deyhim |date= August 2013 |publisher= Amazon Web Services |url= http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |page= 12 |access-date= March 24, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160326193947/http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Amazon_EMR_Best_Practices.pdf |archive-date= 2016-03-26 |url-status= dead }}</ref> [[Google Cloud Platform]]'s [[BigQuery]] recommends Fluentd as the default real-time data-ingestion tool, and uses Google's customized version of Fluentd, called google-fluentd, as a default logging agent.<ref>[[Google Cloud Platform]] (2016). [https://cloud.google.com/solutions/real-time/fluentd-bigquery "Real-time logs analysis using Fluentd and BigQuery"]. Retrieved 10 March 2016.</ref><ref>Google Cloud Platform (2016).

== Fluent Bit ==
Fluent Bit is a log processor and log forwarder which is being developed as a [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation|CNCF]] sub-project under the umbrella of Fluentd project.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fluent Bit|url=https://fluentbit.io/|website=fluentbit.io|accessdate=2021-12-05}}</ref> Fluentd is written in C and Ruby and built as a Ruby gem so it consumes some amount of memory resources. On the other hand, since [[Fluent Bit]] is written only in C and has no dependencies, the consumed memory usage much decreased compared to Fluentd which makes it easy to run on the embedded Linux and container environment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fluentd & Fluent Bit - Fluent Bit: Official Manual|url=https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/about/fluentd-and-fluent-bit|accessdate=2021-12-05}}</ref>
