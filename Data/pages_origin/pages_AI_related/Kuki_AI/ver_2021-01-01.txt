'''Mitsuku''' is a [[chatbot]] created from [[AIML]] technology by Steve Worswick. It is a five-time [[Loebner Prize]] winner (in 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018 , 2019).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aisb.org.uk/events/loebner-prize |title=The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour |access-date=18 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019030117/http://www.aisb.org.uk/events/loebner-prize |archive-date=19 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mitsuku is available as a flash game on [[Mousebreaker]] Games, and on [[Facebook Messenger]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] group chat, [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] and [[Kik Messenger]] under the username "Pandorabots", and was available on [[Skype]] under the same name, but was removed by its developer.<ref>https://community.skype.com/t5/Skype-for-Windows-10/Mitsuku-channel-skype-disabled-for-bot/m-p/4525817/highlight/true#M3604</ref><ref>https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/</ref>

==Features==
Mitsuku claims to be an 18-year-old female chatbot from [[Leeds]], England. It contains all of [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|Alice]]'s AIML files, with many additions from user generated conversations, and is always a work in progress. Worswick claims she has been worked on since 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aidreams.co.uk/forum/index.php?page=Steve_Worswick_Interview_-_Loebner_2013_winner|title=Steve Worswick Interview - Loebner 2013 winner|website=aidreams.co.uk|access-date=13 September 2018}}</ref>

Her intelligence includes the ability to reason with specific objects. For example, if someone asks "Can you eat a house?", Mitsuku looks up the properties for "house". Finds the value of "made_from" is set to "brick" and replies "no", as a house is not edible.

She can play games and do magic tricks at the user's request. In 2015 she conversed, on average, in excess of a quarter of a million times daily.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mitsuku on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/MitsukuChatbot/status/671095095287029761|website = Twitter|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}</ref>

In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article titled “''Advertising’s New Frontier: Talk to the Bot'',” technology reporter [[Christopher Mims]] made the case for “chatvertising” in a piece about Mitsuku and Kik Messenger:<blockquote>If it seems improbable that so many teens—80% of Kik's users are under 22—would want to talk to a robot, consider what the creator of an award-winning, Web-accessible chat bot named Mitsuku told an interviewer in 2013. "What keeps me going is when I get emails or comments in the chat-logs from people telling me how Mitsuku has helped them with a situation whether it was dating advice, being bullied at school, coping with illness or even advice about job interviews. I also get many elderly people who talk to her for companionship." Any advertiser who doesn't sit bolt upright after reading that doesn't understand the dark art of manipulation on which their craft depends.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Advertising's New Frontier: Talk to the Bot|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/advertisings-new-frontier-talk-to-the-bot-1406493740|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-12-04|issn = 0099-9660|first = Christopher|last = Mims}}</ref></blockquote>Mitsuku has been featured in a number of other news outlets. ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' described Mitsuku as “quite impressive” and declared her the victor over [[Siri]] in a chatbot smackdown.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Will AI Destroy Humanity?
