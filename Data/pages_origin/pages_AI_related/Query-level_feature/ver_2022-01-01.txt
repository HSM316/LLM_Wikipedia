A '''query-level feature''' or '''QLF''' is a ranking feature utilized in a [[machine-learned ranking]] algorithm.

Example QLFs:
* How many times has this query been run in the last month?
* How many words are in the query?
* What is the sum/average/min/max/median of the [[Probabilistic relevance model (BM25)|BM25F]] values for the query?
