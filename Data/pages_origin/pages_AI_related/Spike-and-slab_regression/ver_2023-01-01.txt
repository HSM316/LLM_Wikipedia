{{Short description|Bayesian variable selection technique in statistics}}
'''Spike-and-slab regression''' is a type of [[Bayesian linear regression]] in which a particular [[hierarchical prior distribution]] for the regression coefficients is chosen such that only a [[Feature selection|subset of the possible regressors]] is retained. The technique that is particularly useful when the number of possible predictors is larger than the number of observations.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |authorlink=Hal Varian |title=Big Data: New Tricks for Econometrics |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2014 |pages=3–28 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.2.3 }}</ref> The idea of the spike-and-slab model was originally proposed by Mitchell & Beauchamp (1988).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=T.

== Model description ==
Suppose we have ''P'' possible predictors in some model. Vector ''γ'' has a length equal to ''P'' and consists of zeros and ones. This vector indicates whether a particular variable is included in the regression or not. If no specific prior information on initial inclusion probabilities of particular variables is available, a [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli prior]] distribution is a common default choice.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |first1=Steven L. |last1=Scott |first2=Hal R. |last2=Varian |title=Predicting the Present with Bayesian Structural Time Series |journal=International Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Optimisation |year=2014 |volume=5 |issue=1–2 |pages=4–23 |doi=10.1504/IJMMNO.2014.059942 }}</ref> Conditional on a predictor being in the regression, we identify a [[Prior probability|prior distribution]] for the model coefficient, which corresponds to that variable (''β''). A common choice on that step is to use a [[Normal distribution|Normal]] prior with mean equal to zero and a large variance calculated based on <math>(X^TX)^{-1}</math> (where <math>X</math> is a [[design matrix]] of explanatory variables of the model).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2012/fat.pdf|title=Bayesian variable selection for nowcasting economic time series|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

A draw of ''γ'' from its prior distribution is a list of the variables included in the regression. Conditional on this set of selected variables, we take a draw from the prior distribution of the regression coefficients (if ''γ''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1 then ''β''<sub>''i''</sub> ≠ 0 and if ''γ''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 then ''β''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0). ''βγ'' denotes the subset of ''β'' for which ''γ''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1. In the next step, we calculate a [[posterior probability]] for both inclusion and coefficients by applying a standard statistical procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41854.html|title=Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models|journal=Annals of Applied Statistics|year=2015|volume=9|pages=247–274|access-date=|last1=Brodersen|first1=Kay H.|last2=Gallusser|first2=Fabian|last3=Koehler|first3=Jim|last4=Remy|first4=Nicolas|last5=Scott|first5=Steven L.|doi=10.1214/14-AOAS788|arxiv=1506.00356|s2cid=2879370}}</ref> All steps of the described algorithm are repeated thousands of times using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) technique. As a result, we obtain a posterior distribution of ''γ'' (variable inclusion in the model), ''β'' (regression coefficient values) and the corresponding prediction of ''y''.

The model got its name (spike-and-slab) due to the shape of the two prior distributions. The "spike" is the probability of a particular coefficient in the model to be zero. The "slab" is the prior distribution for the regression coefficient values.

An advantage of Bayesian variable selection techniques is that they are able to make use of prior knowledge about the model. In the absence of such knowledge, some reasonable default values can be used; to quote Scott and Varian (2013): "For the analyst who prefers simplicity at the cost of some reasonable assumptions, useful prior information can be reduced to an expected model size, an expected ''R''<sup>2</sup>, and a sample size ''ν'' determining the weight given to the guess at ''R''<sup>2</sup>."<ref name=":0" /> Some researchers suggest the following default values: ''R''<sup>2</sup> = 0.5, ''ν'' = 0.01, and {{pi}} = 0.5 (parameter of a prior Bernoulli distribution).<ref name=":0" />
