'''New Lab''' opened in June 2016, as a multi-disciplinary technology center. Housed in Building 128 of the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the $35 million project<ref name="cbsnews.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-lab-brooklyn-navy-yard-reborn-as-a-high-tech-center/|title=The Brooklyn Navy Yard's rebirth as a high-tech center|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}</ref> serves as a hardware-focused [[shared workspace]], research lab, and hatchery for socially-oriented tech manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digital.nyc/news/how-old-shipyard-became-home-hardware-startups|title=How an Old Shipyard Became a Home for Hardware Startups|date=2017-02-21|work=Digital.NYC|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>

Using the [[MIT Media Lab]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/|title=News & Updates – MIT Media Lab|website=MIT Media Lab|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref> as a model, the impetus for the independent organization was to provide space and services to new manufacturing enterprises. Current members work in fields such as robotics, connected devices, energy, nanotechnology, life sciences, and urban tech.

Media coverage of New Lab has focused on the company's role in revitalizing the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.surfacemag.com/articles/brooklyn-navy-yard-waterfront-development-interview/|title=Renaissance Plan - SURFACE|date=2016-11-16|work=SURFACE|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref> its public-private partnership lease structure, and Urban Tech initiative with the [[New York City Economic Development Corporation|New York CIty Economic Development Corporation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-launches-urban-tech-nyc-support-companies-building-smart-and-sustainable-cities|title=NYCEDC Launches Urbantech NYC to Support Companies Building Smart And Sustainable Cities|work=NYCEDC|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooklyns-new-lab-is-an-inventors-paradise-1476714981|title=Brooklyn's New Lab Is an Inventor's Paradise|last=Krause|first=Elliott|date=2016-10-17|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

== History and Formation of New Lab ==
[[David Belt]] and partner Scott Cohen formed the concept for New Lab in 2011 after prospecting the decaying Building 128 with Navy Yard president David Ehrenberg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/navy-yard-news/ny1-online-president-of-brooklyn-navy-yard-talks-changes/|title=NY1 Online: President of Brooklyn Navy Yard Talks Changes : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynnavyyard.org/about-bnydc/staff/|title=Executive Staff : BROOKLYN NAVY YARD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION|website=brooklynnavyyard.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref> The partners found the maritime manufacturing history of the structure, specifically the manufacturing innovations that took place there, synchronous with their aim to provide a platform for emerging hardware technologies in New York City. The city was abundant in resources and opportunities for entrepreneurs working in software, Belt said in a recent interview, but space, tools and resources for those working in the new manufacturing hardware community were lacking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn's Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en}}</ref>

Belt leveraged his development firm, [[Macro Sea]], a company that specializes "in bringing historic properties back into cultural relevance,"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/vision/|title=Vision {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref> to obtain funding, architectural expertise, and begin constructing a lease with the city of New York. The Navy Yard was in the initial stages of its current revitalization at the time and, because the city owned the property, special arrangements were needed to develop there.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2016/09/the-plan-new-lab-at-the-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=The Plan: New Lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2016-09-22|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

Cohen began scouting the companies who would comprise their core members and helped work to capitalize them. To date, venture capitalists have invested approximately $250 million in New Lab and its members.<ref name="cbsnews.com"/>

== Historical Significance of Building 128 ==
[[File:USS Arizona in New York City Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieces of the USS Arizona were machined in Building 128. The ship is shown heading back to the yard after sea trials.]]

=== Lineage of the Site ===
The land predating New Lab has a rich historical cultural lineage and narrative of experimental and innovative breakthroughs. That past was a major factor in the decision to develop New Lab in the Navy Yard. Before colonial settlement, the area that would become the Navy Yard served as a clamming site for the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. It was then settled by the Dutch and sold to a developer, thus beginning its employment as a center for manufacturing.<ref>{{Citation|last=Thirteen.org|title=The City Concealed: Brooklyn Navy Yard|date=2009-01-25|url=https://vimeo.com/2950807|accessdate=2017-09-13}}</ref> Among the technological advancements that took place at the Navy Yard are: the first use of the steam-powered pile driver; construction of the first undersea telegraph cable; development of a commercialized form of anesthetic ether by E.R. Squibb;<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bhtVlobtuLUC&q=squibb+anaesthesia&pg=PT61|title=Blessed Days of Anaesthesia: How anaesthetics changed the world|last=Snow|first=Stephanie J.|date=2009-09-10|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191622342|language=en}}</ref> and a broadcast of the first person to sing over the radio, [[Eugenia Farrar]] performing "I Love You Truly",<ref>"I Was First to Sing Over the Radio" by Eugenia H. Farrar, ''The American Swedish Monthly'', January 1955, pages 10, 26.</ref> was heard at the Yard in 1907.<ref>[http://www.sowp.org/membership-applications/lr-2811161803-wyckoff-ma#page=3 "Society of Wireless Pioneers: Membership Application & History Sheet: Oliver A. Wyckoff, Sr."] (pdf), July 30, 1969.</ref>

Construction of navy ships like the Fulton II, a first-of-its-kind steam-powered warship, and fabrication of the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS Arizona]], state-of-the-art among its peers, induced many influential manufacturing process refinements and advancements.

In interviews, Belt and Cohen both cite this maritime and technological history as inspiration for New Lab, both in guiding the renovation of the facility and in shaping its mission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/ruki-founder-s-journal/newlab-cab35fee1172|title=Scott Cohen (New Lab) on why he is building a hardware hub in NYC|last=РУКИ|date=2017-03-17|website=Medium|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>

=== Building 128 ===
According to a [[The Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation|Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation]] document, 128 was raised in 1899 as a "steel structure... used to assemble large boiler engines and fabricated sections of naval vessels." It served as the primary machine shop for every major ship launched during World Wars One and Two. Designed to accommodate the significant height of a warship, the sequence of its hulking steel girders resembles an airport hangar. 128 has been slated for, but avoided, plans for non-naval readaptation. The City of New York sought to adapt it for reuse as a "food complex at one point," but the effort was not sustained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kensinger.blogspot.com/2007/12/brooklyn-navy-yard-building-128.html|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard: Building 128|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>

=== Renovation and Architecture ===
[[File:New Lab Building128 Renovation.jpg|thumb|350px|left|August 31, 2015 photo of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 128 in the later stages of renovation for New Lab]]
Marvel Architects, New Lab's architect of record, along with DBI Projects,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.dbinyc.com/|title=DBI Projects|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref> Belt's project management firm, worked together to craft and execute the renovation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Press regarding New Lab often states that the company occupies Building 128 of the Navy Yard, but this is slightly misleading in that 128 is a complex of warehouses and New Lab occupies the southernmost portion.

Recladding the building's armature and repurposing of the 51,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> machine shop into an 84,000&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> multidisciplinary design, prototyping, and advanced manufacturing space took approximately 5 years and continued until the company's full opening in September 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2016/06/new-lab-opens-brooklyn-navy-yard/|title=New Lab opens in Brooklyn Navy Yard - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|date=June 22, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref> The undertaking utilized approximately 9,000&nbsp;lbs of steel in total according to the developer.<ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab">{{Cite news|url=http://newlab.com/about/space/|title=Space {{!}} New Lab|date=2015-09-08|work=New Lab|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

A guiding principle of the redesign was to harmonize of the needs of the forthcoming lab environment with the original structural features. Modern workplace design elements were fused with the 19th century industrial characteristics of the building's centerline.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://marvelarchitects.com/project/brooklyn-navy-yard-new-lab/|title=Brooklyn Navy Yard {{!}} New Lab {{!}} Marvel Architects|work=Marvel Architects|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Floor Plan ===
New Lab's open floor design was intended, spatially, to reinforce its mission, the layout meant to encourage member companies to collaborate and cross-pollinate ideas. Communal meeting rooms, office pods, and interior plazas on both floors emphasize the developer's intention to create a collaborative design and fabrication center.<ref name=":0" />

Upon completion, the rebuild subdivided Building 128's usable space into: Private studios = 31,664&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; Open private studios = 6,226&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; Fabrication lab = 6,834&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; Cafe kitchen = 600&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; Conference rooms = 2,014&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup>; Coworking desks = 144; Flex space = 66 desks.<ref name="Space {{!}} New Lab"/>

There is an additional 6,174&nbsp;ft<sup>2</sup> of event space which hosts talks, hackathons, and new manufacturing events such as the recent Urban Tech Hub launch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/urban-tech-hub-launch-tickets-33215215604|title=Urban Tech Hub Launch|website=Eventbrite|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>

== Prototyping and Fabrication Lab ==
Additive Manufacturing (3D printing) technology is a component of the design process for many New Lab residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/design/the-daily/brooklyns-industrial-revolution|title=Brooklyn's industrial revolution|date=2016-12-09|work=1843|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref> Prototyping shops are a distinguishing feature of the hardware-centric facility. New Lab leverages partnerships with firms like AutoDesk, Stratasys, BigRep, Haas, Ultimaker, and others to provide and maintain equipment and filament for printing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=auto+desk+newlab+brooklyb|title=auto desk newlab brooklyb - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/224785/3d-printers-co-working-space/|title=3D Printers Open New Opportunities for Co-Working Space {{!}} 3DPrint.com {{!}} The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing|website=3dprint.com|date=September 12, 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref> The organization has amassed several million dollars of digital fabrication and manufacturing machine assets such as 3D Printers, electronic workbenches, fabrication tools, and CNC equipment since its opening.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/new-lab/|title=New Lab is a new home for hardware startups in Brooklyn's Navy Yard|last=Ha|first=Anthony|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}</ref>
