==History==
===2014===
SenseTime was co-founded in October 2014 by [[Tang Xiao'ou]], a professor of the Department of Information Engineering at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK), and computer scientist [[Xu Li (computer scientist)|Xu Li]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-19 |title=Xu Li |url=http://fortune.com/40-under-40/xu-li-7/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721073138/http://fortune.com/40-under-40/xu-li-7/ |archive-date=21 July 2018 |access-date=2019-04-09 |website=Fortune |language=en}}</ref> Tang is also the founder of CUHK's Multimedia Laboratory, the only representative from Asia to make it onto [[Nvidia]]'s 2016 Top 10 Leading AI Labs list.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 August 2016 |title=Pioneer in Research on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning |url=https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/node/926 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328042721/https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/node/926 |archive-date=28 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> The CUHK-SenseTime Joint Lab has published and presented more than 400 computer vision papers in the world's top academic journals and conferences, second only to [[Microsoft]]. During 2014, SenseTime unveiled its face recognition algorithms, DeepID, which was the first computer vision algorithm to have better detection accuracy than [[human eye]]s, ahead of [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 June 2014 |title=Face Recognition Tech Beats Facebook DeepFace |url=https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/7757/chinese-university-of-hong-kong-deepid-face-recognition-tech-beats-facebook-deepface/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328020429/https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/7757/chinese-university-of-hong-kong-deepid-face-recognition-tech-beats-facebook-deepface/ |archive-date=28 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>

===2015===

During 2015, many of SenseTime's papers were accepted into the [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]] (CVPR). A total of 9 papers were recognized, all within the first year of SenseTime's inception.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CVPR 2015 Open Access |url=https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/CVPR2015.py |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205105350/https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/CVPR2015.py |archive-date=5 December 2018 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>

===2017===

SenseTime set a record for the highest round of financing in the global AI industry: Series B raised US$410 million. It was during this time that a total of 43 publications were recognized by the CVPR and the [[International Conference on Computer Vision]] (ICCV).<ref>{{Cite web |title=CVPR 2017 Open Access |url=http://openaccess.thecvf.com/CVPR2017.py |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306172626/http://openaccess.thecvf.com/CVPR2017.py |archive-date=6 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ICCV 2017 Open Access |url=http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2017.py |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317172753/http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2017.py |archive-date=17 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> This number ranked first within Asia and even surpassed those numbers of [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] for that year.

===2018===
In February 2018, SenseTime and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] announced the creation of a programme to further advance AI research. The programme was cancelled by MIT in 2020 following revelations of SenseTime's involvement in the persecution of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MIT Cuts Ties With a Chinese AI Firm Amid Human Rights Concerns |url=https://www.wired.com/story/mit-cuts-ties-chinese-ai-firm-human-rights/ |via=www.wired.com}}</ref>

In April 2018, Series C financing amounted to US$600 million, which was then followed up immediately in the next month by a Series C+ round of US$620 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SenseTime: Overview |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensetime#section-overview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308180415/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensetime#section-overview |archive-date=8 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>

In the same month, SenseTime, [[Alibaba]], and the [[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation]] (HKSTP) partnered together to form a [[nonprofit]] artificial intelligence lab in Hong Kong.  The “HKAI Lab” is aimed to “advance the frontiers of AI” and make Hong Kong one of the global hubs for AI. Preliminary funding for start-ups will be provided by Alibaba while SenseTime will offer access to its deep-learning resources.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alibaba's newest initiative aims to make Hong Kong a global AI hub |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/alibaba-senstime-hong-kong-ai-lab/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328005359/https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/alibaba-senstime-hong-kong-ai-lab/ |archive-date=28 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> The following month, SenseTime debuted in [[Singapore]] by signing a collaborative [[memorandum of understanding]] with [[Nanyang Technological University]] (NTU), the National Supercomputing Centre of Singapore and [[Singapore Telecommunications Limited]] (SingTel). The ceremony was held on 29 June 2018 in Singapore and aimed to promote the advancement of AI within Singapore. NTU hopes to develop its own “smart campus,” and SingTel will apply SenseTime technology to their [[retail]] platforms and solutions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SenseTime Debuts in Singapore by Signing Memoranda of Understanding with Local Giants NTU, NSCC and Singtel |url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sensetime-debuts-in-singapore-by-signing-memoranda-of-understanding-with-local-giants-ntu-nscc-and-singtel-1027330334 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328065804/https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sensetime-debuts-in-singapore-by-signing-memoranda-of-understanding-with-local-giants-ntu-nscc-and-singtel-1027330334 |archive-date=28 March 2019 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> In August of that same summer, SenseTime launched its first ever [[North America]]n smart health lab in [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=SenseTime Establishes Smart Medical R&D Lab in New Jersey |url=https://www.redpulse.com/china/20180822/sensetime-establishes-smart-medical-rd-lab-in-new-jersey-9b10a64eb4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205103607/https://www.redpulse.com/china/20180822/sensetime-establishes-smart-medical-rd-lab-in-new-jersey-9b10a64eb4 |archive-date=5 December 2018 |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>
