==History==
===2014===
SenseTime was co-founded in October 2014 by [[Tang Xiao'ou]], a professor of the Department of Information Engineering at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK), and computer scientist [[Xu Li (computer scientist)|Xu Li]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/40-under-40/xu-li-7/|title=Xu Li|date=2018-07-19|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> Tang is also the founder of CUHK's Multimedia Laboratory, the only representative from Asia to make it onto Nvidia's 2016 Top 10 Leading AI Labs list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pioneer in Research on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning|url=https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/node/926}}</ref> The CUHK-SenseTime Joint Lab has published and presented more than 400 computer vision papers in the world's top academic journals and conferences, second only to [[Microsoft]]. During 2014, SenseTime unveiled its face recognition algorithms, DeepID, which was the first computer vision algorithm to have better detection accuracy than [[human eye|human eyes]], ahead of [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Face Recognition Tech Beats Facebook DeepFace|url=https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/7757/chinese-university-of-hong-kong-deepid-face-recognition-tech-beats-facebook-deepface/}}</ref>

===2015===

During 2015, many of SenseTime's papers were accepted into the [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]] (CVPR). A total of 9 papers were recognized, all within the first year of SenseTime's inception.<ref>{{cite web|title=CVPR 2015 Open Access|url=https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/CVPR2015.py}}</ref>

===2016===

In 2016, SenseTime increased the amount of its selected papers up to 16 in the CVPR Conference, and during this year's ImageNet competition, the company won first place in the [[object detection]], video object detection, and scene analysis.<ref>{{cite web|title=CVPR 2016 Open Access|url=https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/CVPR2016.py}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Engineering team won in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge

===2017===

SenseTime set a record for the highest round of financing in the global AI industry: Series B raised US$410 million. It was during this time that a total of 43 publications were recognized by the CVPR and the [[International Conference on Computer Vision]] (ICCV).<ref>{{cite web|title=CVPR 2017 Open Access|url=http://openaccess.thecvf.com/CVPR2017.py}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ICCV 2017 Open Access|url=http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2017.py}}</ref> This number ranked first within Asia and even surpassed those numbers of [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] for that year.

SenseTime also saw many additional partnerships with global industry leaders and major municipalities. In October of that year, [[Qualcomm]] worked with SenseTime.<ref>{{cite web|title=SenseTime and Qualcomm to Collaborate to Drive On-Device Artificial Intelligence|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/10/20/sensetime-and-qualcomm-collaborate-drive-device-artificial-intelligence}}</ref> The following month, the [[Shanghai|Shanghai Municipal Government]] signed a [[strategic alliance]] agreement with SenseTime.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=https://www.sensetime.com/road}}</ref> In December 2017, Honda and SenseTime signed a collaboration agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honda is working with Chinese AI unicorn SenseTime on self-driving tech|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/07/honda-sensetime-self-driving-car/}}</ref>

===2018===
In February 2018, SenseTime and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] announced the creation of a joint alliance to further advance AI research. In April 2018, Series C financing amounted to US$600 million, which was then followed up immediately in the next month by a Series C+ round of US$620 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=SenseTime: Overview|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensetime#section-overview}}</ref>

In the same month, SenseTime, [[Alibaba]], and the [[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation]] (HKSTP) partnered together to form a [[nonprofit]] artificial intelligence lab in Hong Kong.  The “HKAI Lab” is aimed to “advance the frontiers of AI” and make Hong Kong one of the global hubs for AI. Preliminary funding for start-ups will be provided by Alibaba while SenseTime will offer access to its deep-learning resources. <ref>{{cite web|title=Alibaba’s newest initiative aims to make Hong Kong a global AI hub |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/alibaba-senstime-hong-kong-ai-lab/
}}</ref> The following month, SenseTime debuted in [[Singapore]] by signing a collaborative [[memorandum of understanding]] with [[Nanyang Technological University]] (NTU), the National Supercomputing Centre of Singapore and [[Singapore Telecommunications Limited]] (SingTel). The ceremony was held on 29 June 2018 in Singapore and aimed to promote the advancement of AI within Singapore. NTU hopes to develop its own “smart campus,” and SingTel will apply SenseTime technology to their [[retail]] platforms and solutions. <ref>{{cite web|title=SenseTime Debuts in Singapore by Signing Memoranda of Understanding with Local Giants NTU, NSCC and Singtel|url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sensetime-debuts-in-singapore-by-signing-memoranda-of-understanding-with-local-giants-ntu-nscc-and-singtel-1027330334}}</ref> In August of that same summer, SenseTime launched its first ever [[North America|North American]] smart health lab in [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SenseTime Establishes Smart Medical R&D Lab in New Jersey|url=https://www.redpulse.com/china/20180822/sensetime-establishes-smart-medical-rd-lab-in-new-jersey-9b10a64eb4}}</ref>
