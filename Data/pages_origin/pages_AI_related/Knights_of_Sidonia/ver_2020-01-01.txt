{{nihongo|'''''Knights of Sidonia'''''|シドニアの騎士|Shidonia no Kishi|lead=yes}} is a [[space opera]] and [[mecha]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/knights-of-sidonia-is-a-mecha-anime-with-a-realistic-tw-1603375533|title=Knights of Sidonia Is a Mecha Anime with a Realistic Twist|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> [[manga]] series by [[Tsutomu Nihei]], serialized by [[Kodansha]] in their magazine ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'' between April 2009 and September 2015, localized in English by [[Vertical (company)|Vertical]]. The series tells the story of Nagate Tanikaze, an "under-dweller" destined to become a Garde pilot, whose mission is to defend the massive spaceship ''Sidonia'' from a hostile alien species called Gauna. An [[anime]] television series adaptation, produced by [[Polygon Pictures]], aired between April and June 2014 and a second season aired between April and June 2015.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The story is set in the year 3394, a thousand years after mankind flees from [[Earth]] after it was destroyed by a race of shapeshifting [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]]&nbsp;– the {{Nihongo|Gauna|{{furi|奇居子|ガウナ}}}}, aboard hundreds of massive spaceships created from the remains of the planet. One such ship is the ''Sidonia'', which has developed its own human culture closely based on that of [[Japan]] where [[human cloning]], [[asexual reproduction]], and human genetic engineering, such as granting humans [[photosynthesis]], are commonplace. It is also revealed that the top echelons of this society have secretly been granted [[immortality]]. With a population of over 500,000 people, ''Sidonia'' is possibly the last human settlement remaining as the fates of the other ships are unknown.

Little is known about the true nature of the Gauna or their motivation for attacking humanity. Each Gauna has a near invulnerable core protected by a huge mass of malleable material known as {{Nihongo|"placenta"|胞衣|ena}}. Once the ena is shed away and the core is destroyed, the Gauna's body disintegrates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nihei|first=Tsutomu|title=Knights of Sidonia Vol. 2|publisher=Vertical inc, New York|isbn=9781935654810|page=89}}</ref>

''Sidonia'' is defended by [[mecha|large mechanized weapons]] called {{Nihongo|Gardes|衛人|Morito}} whose weaponry and mobility is powered by {{Nihongo|"Higgs particles"|ヘイグス粒子|Heigusu Ryūshi}},<ref>It's different from {{Nihongo|[[Higgs Boson]]|ヒッグス粒子|Higgusu Ryūshi}} in Japanese</ref> armed with a high-output cannon for long range assaults and a special spear known as "Kabizashi" for close combat. The tip of the kabizashi is made of a rare and little-understood material which has the unique property of being able to destroy a Gauna's core. Later the Guardians are also equipped with firearms whose ammunition have the same material of the Kabizashi after a means to artificially mass-produce it is discovered. Most people in the surviving human population are screened and drafted as Guardian pilots at a young age, if they are shown to be capable of piloting them.

===Story===
{{see also|List of Knights of Sidonia characters}}
The story follows the adventures of Garde pilot Nagate Tanikaze, who lived in the underground layer of ''Sidonia'' since birth and was raised by his grandfather. Never having met anyone else, he trains himself in an old Guardian pilot simulator every day, eventually mastering it. After his grandfather's death, he emerges to the surface and is selected as a Guardian pilot, just as ''Sidonia'' is once again threatened by the Gauna.

==Reception==
The manga was ranked #47 in [[Oricon Charts]] on October 30, 2013 with an estimate of 20,934 copies sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-30/japanese-comic-ranking-october-21-27|title=Japanese Comic Ranking, October 21–27|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2013-10-30|accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> Carlo Santos gave the first manga volume a B stating, "It's got a young man piloting a giant robot against alien enemies, but ''Knight of Sidonia'' is no ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion|Evangelion]]''. Yet it's not as bleak or incomprehensible as Tsutomu Nihei works like ''[[Blame!]]'' or ''[[Biomega (manga)|Biomega]]'', either—rather, it's the best of both worlds, bringing Nihei's hard sci-fi mentality into a more conventional space-adventure environment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2013-02-12|title=Neverwinter Knights|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2013-02-12|accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> The Young Adult Library Services Association listed ''Knights of Sidonia'' in its 2014 list of Top 10 Graphic Novels for Teens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-01/strobe-edge-ranks-in-yalsa-top-10-graphic-novels-for-teens|title=Strobe Edge Ranks in YALSA's Top 10 Graphic Novels for Teens|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-02-01|accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

The anime series received positive reviews, even from famous members of the Japanese anime/game industry, like [[Hideo Kojima]], creator of the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, who claims that "It's a kind of anime that we haven't seen for a while that has that sci-fi spirit. Using digital technology cultivated through games, it creates animation that encapsulates Japan's cultural assets like manga, [[Cel shading|cel animation]], kanji, giant robots, etc. What's born is a unique made-in-Japan work that could never be cooked up in Hollywood. Japanese culture has lost its 'cool', and ''Knights of Sidonia'' will be the white knight that saves it". Other industry pros left acknowledgements as well, including [[Akiko Higashimura]], Digitarou and Yoshinao Dao.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-06-20/metal-gear-hideo-kojima-praises-knights-of-sidonia-anime/.75701|title=Metal Gear's Hideo Kojima Praises Knights of Sidonia Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-06-21|accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref>
