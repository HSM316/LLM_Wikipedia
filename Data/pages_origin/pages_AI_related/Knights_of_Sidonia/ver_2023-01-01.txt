{{nihongo|'''''Knights of Sidonia'''''|シドニアの騎士|Shidonia no Kishi|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Tsutomu Nihei]]. It was serialized by [[Kodansha]] in their [[Seinen manga|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Monthly Afternoon]]'' between April 2009 and September 2015, with its chapters collected in 15 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. It tells the story of Nagate Tanikaze, an "under-dweller" destined to become a Garde pilot, whose mission is to defend the massive starship ''Sidonia'' from a hostile alien species called Gauna.

The manga was licensed for English release in North America by [[Vertical (company)|Vertical]]. An [[anime]] television series adaptation was produced by [[Polygon Pictures]]. The first season aired from April to June 2014; the second between April and June 2015. An anime film sequel titled ''Knights of Sidonia: Love Woven in the Stars'' premiered in June 2021.

In 2015, ''Knights of Sidonia'' recived the 39th [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the general category, as well as the 47th [[Seiun Award]] in the Best Comic category in 2016.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The story is set in the year 3394, a thousand years after mankind flees from Earth after it was destroyed by a race of shapeshifting [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]], the {{Nihongo|Gauna|{{furi|奇居子|ガウナ}}}}, aboard hundreds of colossal spacecraft created from the remains of the planet. One such ship is the ''Sidonia'', which has developed its own human culture closely based on that of Japan where [[human cloning]], [[asexual reproduction]], and human genetic engineering, such as granting humans [[photosynthesis]], are commonplace. It is also revealed that the top echelons of this society have secretly been granted [[immortality]]. With a population of over 500,000 people, ''Sidonia'' is possibly the last human settlement remaining, as the fates of the other ships are unknown.

Little is known about the true nature of the Gauna or their motivation for attacking humanity. At any given time, a Gauna consists of a nearly impenetrable core protected by a dense layer of malleable flesh known as {{Nihongo|"placenta"|胞衣|ena}}. Once the ena is shed away and the core is destroyed, the Gauna's body disintegrates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nihei|first=Tsutomu|title=Knights of Sidonia Vol. 2|year=2014|publisher=Vertical inc, New York|isbn=9781935654810|page=89}}</ref>

''Sidonia'' is defended by [[mecha|large mechanized weapons]] called {{Nihongo|Gardes|衛人|Morito}} whose weaponry and mobility is powered by {{Nihongo|"Higgs particles"|ヘイグス粒子|Heigusu Ryūshi}},<ref>It's different from {{Nihongo|[[Higgs Boson]]|ヒッグス粒子|Higgusu Ryūshi}} in Japanese</ref> armed with a high-output cannon for long range assaults and a special spear known as "Kabizashi" for close combat. The tip of the kabizashi is made of a rare and little-understood material which has the unique property of being able to destroy a Gauna's core. Later the Gardes are also equipped with firearms whose ammunition have the same material of the Kabizashi after a means to artificially mass-produce it is discovered. Most people in the surviving human population are screened and drafted as Garde pilots at a young age, if they are shown to be capable of piloting them.

===Story===
{{see also|List of Knights of Sidonia characters}}
The story follows the adventures of Garde pilot Nagate Tanikaze, who lived in the underground layer of ''Sidonia'' since birth and was raised by his grandfather. Never having met anyone else, he trains himself in an old Guardian pilot simulator every day, eventually mastering it. After his grandfather's death, he emerges to the surface and is selected as a Garde pilot, just as ''Sidonia'' is once again threatened by the Gauna.

Carlo Santos from ''[[Anime News Network]]'' gave the first manga volume a B, stating, "It is got a young man piloting a giant robot against alien enemies, but ''Knight of Sidonia'' is no ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. Yet it is not as bleak or incomprehensible as Tsutomu Nihei works like ''[[Blame!]]'' or ''[[Biomega (manga)|Biomega]]'', either—rather, it is the best of both worlds, bringing Nihei's hard sci-fi mentality into a more conventional space-adventure environment".<ref>{{cite web |last=Santos |first=Carlo |date=February 12, 2013 |title=Neverwinter Knights |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2013-02-12 |access-date=February 12, 2013 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |publisher=}}</ref>

===Anime===
The anime series received positive reviews, even from famous members of the Japanese anime/game industry, like [[Hideo Kojima]], creator of the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, who claims that "It's a kind of anime that we haven't seen for a while that has that sci-fi spirit. Using digital technology cultivated through games, it creates animation that encapsulates Japan's cultural assets like manga, [[Cel shading|cel animation]], kanji, giant robots, etc. What's born is a unique made-in-Japan work that could never be cooked up in Hollywood. Japanese culture has lost its 'cool', and ''Knights of Sidonia'' will be the white knight that saves it". Other industry pros left acknowledgements as well, including [[Akiko Higashimura]], Digitarou and Yoshinao Dao.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dong |first=Bamboo |date=June 21, 2014 |title=Metal Gear's Hideo Kojima Praises Knights of Sidonia Anime |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-06-20/metal-gear-hideo-kojima-praises-knights-of-sidonia-anime/.75701 |access-date=June 21, 2014 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |publisher=}}</ref>
