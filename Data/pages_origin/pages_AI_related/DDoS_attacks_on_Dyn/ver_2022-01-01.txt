The '''DDoS attack on Dyn''' was a series of [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed DoS|distributed denial-of-service attacks]] (DDoS attacks) on October 21, 2016, targeting systems operated by [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) provider [[Dyn (company)|Dyn]]. The attack caused major Internet platforms and services to be unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/|title=Many sites including Twitter, Shopify and Spotify suffering outage|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|last2=Conger|first2=Kate|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-21/internet-service-disrupted-in-large-parts-of-eastern-u-s|title=The Possible Vendetta Behind the East Coast Web Slowdown|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}</ref> The groups [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack, but scant evidence was provided.<ref name="politico1"/>

As a DNS provider, Dyn provides to end-users the service of mapping an Internet [[domain name]]—when, for instance, entered into a [[web browser]]—to its corresponding [[IP address]]. The [[denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attack was accomplished through numerous DNS lookup requests from tens of millions of IP addresses.<ref name="wired"/> The activities are believed to have been executed through a [[botnet]] consisting of many [[Internet of things|Internet-connected devices]]—such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[IP camera]]s, [[residential gateway]]s and [[baby monitor]]s—that had been infected with the [[Mirai (malware)|Mirai]] malware.
