'''Inferential Theory of Learning''' ('''ITL''') is an area of [[machine learning]] which describes inferential processes performed by learning agents. ITL has been continuously developed by [[Ryszard S. Michalski]], starting in the 1980s. The first known publication of ITL was in 1983.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michalski|first=Ryszard S.|date=1993|title=Inferential theory of learning as a conceptual basis for multistrategy learning|journal=Machine Learning|volume=11|issue=2–3|pages=111–151|doi=10.1007/bf00993074|issn=0885-6125|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the ITL [[Learning|learning process]] is viewed as a search ([[inference]]) through hypotheses space guided by a specific goal. The results of learning need to be [[Data storage device|stored]]. Stored information will later be used by the learner for future [[inference]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mli.gmu.edu/index.php/research/inferential-theory-of-learning/|title=Inferential Theory of Learning – GMU Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory|website=www.mli.gmu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> Inferences are split into multiple categories including [https://www.mli.gmu.edu/index.php/research/inferential-theory-of-learning/ conclusive, deduction, and induction.] In order for an inference to be considered complete it was required that all categories must be taken into account.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Machine learning methods for commonsense reasoning processes : interactive models|author=Naidenova, Xenia|date=2010|publisher=Information Science Reference|isbn=9781605668109|location=Hershey, PA|oclc=606360112}}</ref> This is how the ITL varies from other machine learning theories like [[Computational learning theory|Computational Learning Theory]] and [[Statistical learning theory|Statistical Learning Theory]]; which both use singular forms of inference.

==Usage==

The most relevant published usage of ITL was in scientific journal published in 2012 and used ITL as a way to describe how agent-based learning works. According to the journal "The Inferential Theory of Learning (ITL) provides an elegant way of describing learning processes by agents".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wojtusiak|first=Janusz|last2=Warden|first2=Tobias|last3=Herzog|first3=Otthein|date=December 2012|title=Machine learning in agent-based stochastic simulation: Inferential theory and evaluation in transportation logistics|journal=Computers & Mathematics with Applications|volume=64|issue=12|pages=3658–3665|doi=10.1016/j.camwa.2012.01.079|issn=0898-1221|doi-access=free}}</ref>
