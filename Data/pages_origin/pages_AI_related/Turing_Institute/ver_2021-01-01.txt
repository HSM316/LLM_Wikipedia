'''The Turing Institute''' was an [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence laboratory]] based in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] between 1983 and 1994. The company undertook basic and applied research, working directly with large companies across [[Europe]], the [[United States]], and [[Japan]] developing software as well as providing training, consultancy and information services.<ref name="books.google">{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=John|title=Making Friends with Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMaVDEwRhpcC&q=Machine+learning+conference+glasgow+turing+institute&pg=PA30|work=The New Scientist|accessdate=10 December 2013| date=August 1985 }}</ref>

==Formation==
[[File:Turing Institute Board Meeting 1984.jpg|thumb|Turing Institute Board Meeting 1984. Left to right: Peter Mowforth, Tim Niblett, Lord Balfour, Donald Michie, and Jim Alty.]]
The Institute was formed in June 1983 by [[Donald Michie]], Peter Mowforth and Tim Niblett. The Institute was named after [[Alan Turing]] who Donald Michie had worked with at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].

The organisation grew out of the Machine Intelligence Research Unit at [[Edinburgh University]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jim|title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY : A PERSPECTIVE|url=http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/about/AIhistory.html|accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>  with a plan to combine research in Artificial Intelligence with technology transfer to industry. In 1983, [[Graham John Hills|Sir Graham Hills]] was instrumental in the Institute moving to [[Glasgow]] where, with support from the [[Scottish Enterprise|Scottish Development Agency]] it formed a close working relationship with [[Strathclyde University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Turing Institute|url=http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/turing-institute|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>
[[Lord Balfour of Burleigh]]{{clarify|date=May 2019}} (Chairman) and [[Shirley Williams]] joined the board along with a growing team of researchers and AI specialists. Notable amongst these was [[Stephen Muggleton]] who was responsible for work developing [[Inductive Logic Programming]].

Professor Jim Alty<ref>{{cite web|title=Professor Jim Alty|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/a/13232/James%20Lenton+ALTY.aspx|publisher=Debretts|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> moved his Man Machine Interaction (HCI) group (later the Scottish HCI Centre) to the Turing Institute in 1984. The move included a significant expansion of the Postgraduate school at the Institute. Jim Alty joined the Turing Institute Board and became Chief Executive. The HCI Centre and the Institute collaborated on a wide range of projects.

In 1984, following the UK Government [[Alvey|Alvey Report on AI]], the Institute became an Alvey Journeyman centre<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cooperation creates products for profit|journal=New Scientist|date=2 July 1987|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esWe5fuCCRoC&q=%22Alvey+Journeyman%22&pg=PA47|accessdate=5 December 2013|last1=Information|first1=Reed Business}}</ref>  for the UK.

In 1987, the Turing Institute won a project to build a large, scalable, network-available user-manual for

Various other robot projects were undertaken at the Turing Institute where key researchers included Paul Siebert, Eddie Grant, Paul Grant, David Wilson, Bing Zhang and Colin Urquhart (e.g.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mowforth|first=Peter|author2=Paul Siebert |author3=Jin Zhengping |author4=Colin Urquhart |title=A head called Richard|journal=Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference| date=September 1990 |pages=361–365|url=http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1990/bmvc-90-064.pdf|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul|author2=Peter Mowforth |title=Economical and Cautious Approaches to Local Path Planning for a Mobile Robot|journal=Proceedings of the Alvey Vision Conference|year=1989|pages=297–300|url=http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1989/avc-89-053.pdf|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Edward|title=Array tactile sensing : integration, calibration and application|publisher=The Turing Institute|oclc=17425044}}</ref> ).

In 1990 the Turing Institute organised and ran the [[First Robot Olympics]] with the venue at the [[University of Strathclyde]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Willard|first=Tim|title=No Relay Race on This Olympic Field|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-17/business/fi-2345_1_hazardous-waste-management|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1991-07-17}}</ref>

From 1989 onwards, the company faced financial difficulties that caused it to close in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Column 468: The Turing Institute|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1994-06-14/Writtens-15.html|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>
