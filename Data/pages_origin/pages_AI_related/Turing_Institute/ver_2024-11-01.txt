'''The Turing Institute''' was an [[artificial intelligence]] laboratory in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], between 1983 and 1994. The company undertook basic and applied research, working directly with large companies across [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] developing software as well as providing training, consultancy and information services.<ref name="books.google">{{cite book|last=Lamb|first=John|title=Making Friends with Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BMaVDEwRhpcC&q=Machine+learning+conference+glasgow+turing+institute&pg=PA30|work=The New Scientist|access-date=10 December 2013| date=August 1985 |via=Google Books }}</ref>

==Formation==
[[File:Turing Institute Board Meeting 1984.jpg|thumb|Turing Institute Board Meeting 1984. Left to right: Peter Mowforth, Tim Niblett, Lord Balfour, Donald Michie, Jim Alty.]]
The Institute was formed in June 1983 by [[Donald Michie]], [[Peter Mowforth]] and Tim Niblett. It was named after [[Alan Turing]] with whom Donald Michie had worked at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].

The organisation grew out of the Machine Intelligence Research Unit at [[Edinburgh University]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jim|title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY: A PERSPECTIVE|url=http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/about/AIhistory.html|access-date=4 December 2013}}</ref> with a plan to combine research in artificial intelligence with technology transfer to industry. In 1983, [[Graham John Hills|Sir Graham Hills]] was instrumental in the institute moving to Glasgow where, with support from the [[Scottish Enterprise|Scottish Development Agency]], it formed a close working relationship with [[Strathclyde University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Turing Institute|url=http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/turing-institute|access-date=10 December 2013}}</ref> [[Lord Balfour of Burleigh]]{{clarify|date=May 2019}} (chairman) and [[Shirley Williams]] joined the board along with a growing team of researchers and AI specialists. Notable amongst these was [[Stephen Muggleton]] who was responsible for work developing [[inductive logic programming]].

Professor Jim Alty<ref>{{cite web|title=Professor Jim Alty|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/a/13232/James%20Lenton+ALTY.aspx|publisher=Debretts|access-date=20 December 2013}}</ref> moved his Man Machine Interaction (HCI) group (later the Scottish HCI Centre) to the Turing Institute in 1984. The move included a significant expansion of the postgraduate school at the institute. Alty joined the Turing Institute Board and became chief executive. The HCI Centre and the institute collaborated on a wide range of projects.

In 1984, following the UK Government [[Alvey|Alvey Report on AI]], the institute became an Alvey Journeyman centre<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cooperation creates products for profit|journal=New Scientist|date=2 July 1987|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esWe5fuCCRoC&q=%22Alvey+Journeyman%22&pg=PA47|access-date=5 December 2013|last=Oakley|first=Brian |via=Google Books}}</ref> for the UK.

Throughout its existence, the institute organised a wide range of workshops and international conferences. Notable among these were the Turing Memorial Lecture Series whose speakers included [[Tony Hoare]], [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter to Professor H.A.

Various other robot projects were undertaken at the Turing Institute where key researchers included Paul Siebert, Eddie Grant, Paul Grant, David Wilson, Bing Zhang and Colin Urquhart.<ref>For example:<br />- {{cite journal|last=Mowforth|first=Peter|author2=Paul Siebert |author3=Jin Zhengping |author4=Colin Urquhart |title=A head called Richard |journal=Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference| date=September 1990 |pages=361–365|url=http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1990/bmvc-90-064.pdf|access-date=20 December 2013}}<br />- {{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Paul|author2=Peter Mowforth |title=Economical and Cautious Approaches to Local Path Planning for a Mobile Robot|journal=Proceedings of the Alvey Vision Conference|year=1989|pages=297–300|url=http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1989/avc-89-053.pdf|access-date=20 December 2013}}<br />- {{cite book |last=Grant |first=Edward |title=Array tactile sensing: integration, calibration and application |publisher=The Turing Institute|oclc=17425044}}</ref>

In 1990, the Turing Institute organised and ran the [[First Robot Olympics]] with the venue at the [[University of Strathclyde]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Willard|first=Tim|title=No Relay Race on This Olympic Field|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-07-17-fi-2345-story.html|access-date=20 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1991-07-17}}</ref>

==Closure==
From 1989 onwards, the company faced financial difficulties that caused it to close in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Column 467-468: The Turing Institute |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1994-06-14/Writtens-15.html|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=11 December 2013}}</ref>

A 1973's James Lighthill Report. ([[Artificial Intelligence]]: A General Survey: British Science Research Council) an evaluation of academic research on AI, formed the basis for UK government funding and support, stated "in no part of the field have discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised". Therefore AI research was to be reduced.

[[Peter Mowforth]], a former member of the Turing team stated, "Someone decided that Britain only really needed three computers as there wasn't much future in it! Not for the last occasion, at a time when Scotland ruled the roost globally, the plug was pulled."<ref name="Heraldscotland">{{cite web|title=Obscure research unit in Scotland flying the space shuttle and the invention of the internet|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/13189678.connected-scientist-whose-life-inspires-major-new-film-obscure-research-unit-scotland-flying-space-shuttle-invention-internet/ |publisher=Heraldscotland|access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref>  Faced with the decline of heavy industry, Britain's failure to invest in cutting-edge science that could prove economically transformative only began to be reversed in the late 80s, in reaction to Japanese advances in software design.

The technological and commercial empowerment that should have followed was never fulfilled. The institute went out of business in 1994, amid questions in the [[House of Commons]] and bitter recriminations between the scientists and the [[Scottish Development Agency]].<ref name="Heraldscotland"/>
