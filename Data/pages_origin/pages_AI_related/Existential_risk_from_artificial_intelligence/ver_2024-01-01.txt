One argument goes as follows: [[human species|human beings]] dominate other species because the [[human brain]] possesses distinctive capabilities other animals lack. If AI were to surpass humanity in general [[intelligence]] and become [[superintelligence|superintelligent]], then it could become difficult or impossible to control.

Two sources of concern stem from the problems of AI [[AI capability control|control]] and [[AI alignment|alignment]]: controlling a superintelligent machine or instilling it with human-compatible values may be difficult. Many researchers believe that a superintelligent machine would resist attempts to disable it or change its goals, as that would prevent it from accomplishing its present goals.

A third source of concern is that a sudden "[[intelligence explosion]]" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. Such scenarios consider the possibility that an AI that is more intelligent than its creators might be able to [[Recursion|recursively]] improve itself at an exponentially increasing rate, improving too quickly for its handlers and society at large to control.<ref name="aima" /><ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /> Empirically, examples like [[AlphaZero]] teaching itself to play [[Go (game)|Go]] show that domain-specific AI systems can sometimes progress from subhuman to superhuman ability very quickly, although such systems do not involve altering their fundamental architecture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=AlphaGo Zero: Starting from scratch |url=https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-starting-from-scratch |access-date=2023-07-28 |website=www.deepmind.com |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
One of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230315233257/https://www.jstor.org/stable/436868 |date=15 March 2023 }} Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383</ref>
{{blockquote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}
In 1951, foundational computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote the article "Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory", in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely "take control" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:

{{blockquote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]''.<ref name="oxfordjournals">{{Cite journal |last=Turing |first=A M |year=1996 |title=Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory |journal=1951, Reprinted Philosophia Mathematica |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=256–260 |doi=10.1093/philmat/4.3.256|doi-access=free }}</ref>}}

In 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an "intelligence explosion" and said the risks were underappreciated:<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hilliard |first=Mark |date=2017 |title=The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated? |language=en |newspaper=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |access-date=15 March 2020 |archive-date=22 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522114127/https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

In contrast with AGI, Bostrom defines a [[superintelligence]] as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest", including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Everything you need to know about superintelligence |url=https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/everything-about-superintelligence/ |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=Spiceworks |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="superintelligence" /> He argues that a superintelligence can outmaneuver humans anytime its goals conflict with humans'.

[[Stephen Hawking]] argued that superintelligence is physically possible because "there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains".<ref name="hawking editorial" />

When artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be achieved, if ever, is necessarily less certain than predictions for AGI. In 2023, [[OpenAI]] leaders said that not only AGI, but superintelligence may be achieved in less than 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Governance of superintelligence |url=https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence |access-date=2023-07-12 |website=openai.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Comparison with humans ====
Bostrom argues that AI has many advantages over the [[human brain]]:<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 3 : "Forms of superintelligence", part "Sources of advantage for digital intelligence"-->

* Speed of computation: biological [[neuron]]s operate at a maximum frequency of around 200 [[Hertz|Hz]], compared to potentially multiple GHz for computers.
* Internal communication speed: [[axon]]s transmit signals at up to 120&nbsp;m/s, while computers transmit signals at the [[speed of electricity]], or optically at the [[speed of light]].
* Scalability: human intelligence is limited by the size and structure of the brain, and by the efficiency of social communication, while AI may be able to scale by simply adding more hardware.
* Memory: notably [[working memory]], because in humans it is limited to a few [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]] of information at a time.
* Reliability: transistors are more reliable than biological neurons, enabling higher precision and requiring less redundancy.
* Duplicability: unlike human brains, AI software and models can be easily [[File copying|copied]].
* Editability: the parameters and internal workings of an AI model can easily be modified, unlike the connections in a human brain.
* Memory sharing and learning: AIs may be able to learn from the experiences of other AIs in a manner more efficient than human learning.

==== Intelligence explosion ====
According to Bostrom, an AI that has an expert-level facility at certain key software engineering tasks could become a superintelligence due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, even if it is initially limited in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 6 : "Cognitive superpowers"--><ref name="economist_review3" /> This suggests that an intelligence explosion may someday catch humanity unprepared.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 4 : "The kinetics of an intelligence explosion"-->

The economist [[Robin Hanson]] has said that, to launch an intelligence explosion, an AI must become vastly better at software innovation than the rest of the world combined, which he finds implausible.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Overcoming Bias: I Still Don't Get Foom |url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221136/http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html |archive-date=4 August 2017 |access-date=20 September 2017 |website=www.overcomingbias.com}}</ref>

In a "fast takeoff" scenario, the transition from AGI to superintelligence could take days or months. In a "slow takeoff", it could take years or decades, leaving more time for society to prepare.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Cotton-Barratt |first1=Owen |last2=Ord |first2=Toby |date=2014-08-12 |title=Strategic considerations about different speeds of AI takeoff |url=https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/strategic-considerations-about-different-speeds-of-ai-takeoff/ |access-date=2023-07-12 |website=The Future of Humanity Institute |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==== Alien mind ====
Superintelligences are sometimes called "alien minds", referring to the idea that their way of thinking and motivations could be vastly different from ours. This is generally considered as a source of risk, making it more difficult to anticipate what a superintelligence might do. It also suggests the possibility that a superintelligence may not particularly value humans by default.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=2023-04-25 |title=The 'Don't Look Up' Thinking That Could Doom Us With AI |url=https://time.com/6273743/thinking-that-could-doom-us-with-ai/ |access-date=2023-07-14 |magazine=Time |language=en |quote=As if losing control to Chinese minds were scarier than losing control to alien digital minds that don't care about humans.

The field of "mechanistic interpretability" aims to better understand the inner workings of AI models, potentially allowing us one day to detect signs of deception and misalignment.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-04 |title=19 - Mechanistic Interpretability with Neel Nanda |url=https://axrp.net/episode/2023/02/04/episode-19-mechanistic-interpretability-neel-nanda.html |access-date=2023-07-13 |website=AXRP - the AI X-risk Research Podcast |language=en |quote=it's plausible to me that the main thing we need to get done is noticing specific circuits to do with deception and specific dangerous capabilities like that and situational awareness and internally-represented goals.}}</ref>

==== Limits ====
It has been argued that there are limitations to what intelligence can achieve. Notably, the [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] nature or [[Computational complexity|time complexity]] of some systems could fundamentally limit a superintelligence's ability to predict some aspects of the future, increasing its uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-07 |title=Superintelligence Is Not Omniscience |url=https://aiimpacts.org/superintelligence-is-not-omniscience/ |access-date=2023-04-16 |website=AI Impacts |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Dangerous capabilities ===
Advanced AI could generate enhanced pathogens, cyberattacks or manipulate people. These capabilities could be misused by humans,<ref name=":03">{{Cite arXiv |eprint=2306.12001 |author=Dan Hendrycks |author2=Mantas Mazeika |author3=Thomas Woodside |title=An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks |date=21 June 2023|class=cs.CY }}</ref> or exploited by the AI itself if misaligned.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 6 : "Cognitive superpowers", part "Functionalities and superpowers"--> A full-blown superintelligence could find various ways to gain a decisive influence if it wanted to,<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 6 : "Cognitive superpowers", part "An AI takeover scenario"--> but these dangerous capabilities may become available earlier, in weaker and more specialized AI systems. They may cause societal instability and empower malicious actors.<ref name=":03" />

==== Social manipulation ====
Geoffrey Hinton warned that in the short term, the profusion of AI-generated text, images and videos will make it more difficult to figure out the truth, which he says authoritarian states could exploit to manipulate elections.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Josh |last2=Hern |first2=Alex |date=2023-05-02 |title='Godfather of AI' Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns over dangers of misinformation |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning |access-date=2023-07-13 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Such large-scale, personalized manipulation capabilities can increase the existential risk of a worldwide "irreversible totalitarian regime".<!--"AI manipulation could undermine democracy, which also increases the existential risk of an irreversible totalitarian regime."--> It could also be used by malicious actors to fracture society and make it dysfunctional.<ref name=":03" />

==== Cyberattacks ====
AI-enabled [[cyberattack]]s are increasingly considered a present and critical threat. According to [[NATO]]'s technical director of cyberspace, "The number of attacks is increasing exponentially".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-26 |title=How NATO is preparing for a new era of AI cyber attacks |url=https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/12/26/ai-cyber-attacks-are-a-critical-threat-this-is-how-nato-is-countering-them |access-date=2023-07-13 |website=euronews |language=en}}</ref> AI can also be used defensively, to preemptively find and fix vulnerabilities, and detect threats.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ChatGPT and the new AI are wreaking havoc on cybersecurity in exciting and frightening ways |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-and-the-new-ai-are-wreaking-havoc-on-cybersecurity/ |access-date=2023-07-13 |website=ZDNET |language=en}}</ref>

AI could improve the "accessibility, success rate, scale, speed, stealth and potency of cyberattacks", potentially causing "significant geopolitical turbulence" if it facilitates attacks more than defense.<ref name=":03" />

Speculatively, such hacking capabilities could be used by an AI system to break out of its local environment, generate revenue, or acquire cloud computing resources.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=2305.15324 |author=Toby Shevlane |author2=Sebastian Farquhar |author3=Ben Garfinkel |author4=Mary Phuong |author5=Jess Whittlestone |author6=Jade Leung |author7=Daniel Kokotajlo |author8=Nahema Marchal |author9=Markus Anderljung |author10=Noam Kolt |author11=Lewis Ho |author12=Divya Siddarth |author13=Shahar Avin |author14=Will Hawkins |author15=Been Kim |author16=Iason Gabriel |author17=Vijay Bolina |author18=Jack Clark |author19=Yoshua Bengio |author20=Paul Christiano |author21=Allan Dafoe |title=Model evaluation for extreme risks |date=24 May 2023|class=cs.AI }}</ref>

==== Enhanced pathogens ====
As AI technology democratizes, it may become easier to engineer more contagious and lethal pathogens. This could enable people with limited skills in [[synthetic biology]] to engage in [[bioterrorism]]. [[Dual-use technology]] that is useful for medicine could be repurposed to create weapons.<ref name=":03" />

For example, in 2022, scientists modified an AI system originally intended for generating non-toxic, therapeutic molecules with the purpose of creating new drugs. The researchers adjusted the system so that toxicity is rewarded rather than penalized. This simple change enabled the AI system to create, in six hours, 40,000 candidate molecules for [[chemical warfare]], including known and novel molecules.<ref name=":03" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Urbina |first1=Fabio |last2=Lentzos |first2=Filippa |last3=Invernizzi |first3=Cédric |last4=Ekins |first4=Sean |date=7 March 2022 |title=Dual use of artificial-intelligence-powered drug discovery |journal=Nature Machine Intelligence |language=en |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=189–191 |doi=10.1038/s42256-022-00465-9 |pmid=36211133 |issn=2522-5839|pmc=9544280 }}</ref>

=== AI arms race ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence arms race}}
Companies, state actors, and other organizations competing to develop AI technologies could lead to a [[race to the bottom]] of safety standards.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=Yoshija |title=The rapid competitive economy of machine learning development: a discussion on the social risks and benefits |journal=AI and Ethics |date=27 March 2023 |page=1 |doi=10.1007/s43681-023-00276-7 |doi-access=free }}</ref> As rigorous safety procedures take time and resources, projects that proceed more carefully risk being out-competed by less scrupulous developers.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2023-02-16 |title=The AI Arms Race Is On.

AI could be used to gain military advantages via [[Lethal autonomous weapon|autonomous lethal weapons]], [[cyberwarfare]], or [[automated decision-making]].<ref name=":03" /> As an example of autonomous lethal weapons, miniaturized drones could facilitate low-cost assassination of military or civilian targets, a scenario highlighted in the 2017 short film ''[[Slaughterbots]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brimelow |first=Ben |title=The short film 'Slaughterbots' depicts a dystopian future of killer drones swarming the world |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/slaughterbots-short-film-depicts-killer-drone-swarms-2017-11 |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref> AI could be used to gain an edge in decision-making by quickly analyzing large amounts of data and making decisions more quickly and effectively than humans.

== Types of existential risk ==
[[File:X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg|thumb|370x370px]]
An existential risk is "one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Doherty |first=Ben |date=2018-05-17 |title=Climate change an 'existential security risk' to Australia, Senate inquiry says |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says |access-date=2023-07-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Besides extinction risk, there is the risk that the civilization gets permanently locked into a flawed future. One example is a "value lock-in": If humanity still has moral blind spots similar to slavery in the past, AI might irreversibly entrench it, preventing [[moral progress]]. AI could also be used to spread and preserve the set of values of whoever develops it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=MacAskill |first=William |title=What we owe the future |date=2022 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-1-5416-1862-6 |edition= |location=New York, NY}}</ref> AI could facilitate large-scale surveillance and indoctrination, which could be used to create a stable repressive worldwide totalitarian regime.<ref name=":0" />

It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient and to what degree. But if sentient machines are mass created in the future, engaging in a civilizational path that indefinitely neglects their welfare could be an existential catastrophe.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Samuelsson |first=Paul Conrad |date=June–July 2019 |title=Artificial Consciousness: Our Greatest Ethical Challenge |issue=132 |magazine=Philosophy Now |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/132/Artificial_Consciousness_Our_Greatest_Ethical_Challenge |access-date=2023-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Brian |first=Kateman |date=2023-07-24 |title=AI Should Be Terrified of Humans |url=https://time.com/6296234/ai-should-be-terrified-of-humans/ |access-date=2023-08-19 |magazine=Time |language=en}}</ref> Moreover, it may be possible to engineer digital minds that can feel much more happiness than humans with fewer resources, called "super-beneficiaries". Such an opportunity raises the question of how to share the world and which "ethical and political framework" would enable a mutually beneficial coexistence between biological and digital minds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fisher |first=Richard |title=The intelligent monster that you should let eat you |url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201111-philosophy-of-utility-monsters-and-artificial-intelligence |access-date=2023-08-19 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en}}</ref>

AI may also drastically improve humanity's future. [[Toby Ord]] considers the existential risk a reason for "proceeding with due caution", not for abandoning AI.<ref name=":0" /> [[Max More]] calls AI an "existential opportunity", highlighting the cost of not developing it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=More |first=Max |date=2023-06-19 |title=Existential Risk vs. Existential Opportunity: A balanced approach to AI risk |url=https://maxmore.substack.com/p/existential-risk-vs-existential-opportunity |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=Extropic Thoughts}}</ref>

According to Bostrom, superintelligence could help reduce the existential risk from other powerful technologies such as [[molecular nanotechnology]] or [[synthetic biology]]. It is thus conceivable that developing superintelligence before other dangerous technologies would reduce the overall existential risk.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 14 : "The strategic picture", part "Preferred order of arrival"-->

== AI alignment ==
{{further|AI alignment}}
The alignment problem is the research problem of how to reliably assign objectives, preferences or ethical principles to AIs.

=== Instrumental convergence ===
{{further|Instrumental convergence}}

An [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|"instrumental" goal]] is a sub-goal that helps to achieve an agent's ultimate goal. "Instrumental convergence" refers to the fact that some sub-goals are useful for achieving virtually ''any'' ultimate goal, such as acquiring resources or self-preservation.<ref name="omohundro">Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In ''AGI'' (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).</ref> Bostrom argues that if an advanced AI's instrumental goals conflict with humanity's goals, the AI might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, but only as a way to achieve its ultimate goal.<ref name="superintelligence" />

[[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] argues that a sufficiently advanced machine "will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal."<ref name="vanity" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Wakefield |first=Jane |date=15 September 2015 |title=Why is Facebook investing in AI? |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118481 |url-status=live |access-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202192942/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118481 |archive-date=2 December 2017}}</ref>

==== Resistance to changing goals ====
Even if current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify their goal structures, a sufficiently advanced AI might resist any attempts to change its goal structure, just as a pacifist would not want to take a pill that makes them want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and prevent itself being "turned off" or reprogrammed with a new goal.<ref name="superintelligence" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer |date=2011 |title=Complex Value Systems are Required to Realize Valuable Futures |url=https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929212318/http://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf |archive-date=29 September 2015 |access-date=10 August 2020}}</ref> This is particularly relevant to value lock-in scenarios.

One is the broad set of ideas around "corrigibility"—how to make agents that don't resist changes to their goals.[...]" -->

=== Difficulty of specifying goals ===
In the "[[intelligent agent]]" model, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve its set of goals, or "utility function". A utility function gives each possible situation a score that indicates its desirability to the agent. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean "minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model" or "maximize the number of reward clicks", but do not know how to write a utility function for "maximize [[Eudaimonia|human flourishing]]"; nor is it clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values the function does not reflect.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393).

An additional source of concern is that AI "must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally", and that it must be able to fluidly solicit human guidance if it is too uncertain about what humans want.<ref name="acm2">{{Cite journal |last1=Dietterich |first1=Thomas |author-link=Eric Horvitz |last2=Horvitz |first2=Eric |date=2015 |title=Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |url-status=live |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=38–40 |doi=10.1145/2770869 |s2cid=20395145 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132930/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=23 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Alignment of superintelligences ===
Some researchers believe the alignment problem may be particularly difficult when applied to superintelligences. Their reasoning includes:

* As AI systems increase in capabilities, the potential dangers associated with experimentation grow. This makes iterative, empirical approaches increasingly risky.<ref name="superintelligence" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite magazine |last=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer |date=2023-03-29 |title=The Open Letter on AI Doesn't Go Far Enough |url=https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/ |access-date=2023-07-16 |magazine=Time |language=en}}</ref>
* If instrumental goal convergence occurs, it may only do so in sufficiently intelligent agents.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2012-05-01 |title=The Superintelligent Will: Motivation and Instrumental Rationality in Advanced Artificial Agents |journal=Minds and Machines |language=en |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=71–85 |doi=10.1007/s11023-012-9281-3 |s2cid=254835485 |issn=1572-8641 |quote=as long as they possess a sufficient level of intelligence, agents having any of a wide range of final goals will pursue similar intermediary goals because they have instrumental reasons to do so.}}</ref>
* A superintelligence may find unconventional and radical solutions to assigned goals. Bostrom gives the example that if the objective is to make humans smile, a weak AI may perform as intended, while a superintelligence may decide a better solution is to "take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins."<ref name=":11" />
* A superintelligence in creation could gain some awareness of what it is, where it is in development (training, testing, deployment, etc.), and how it is being monitored, and use this information to deceive its handlers.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=2209.00626 |author=Richard Ngo |author2=Lawrence Chan |author3=Sören Mindermann |title=The alignment problem from a deep learning perspective |date=22 February 2023|class=cs.AI }}</ref> Bostrom writes that such an AI could feign alignment to prevent human interference until it achieves a "decisive strategic advantage" that allows it to take control.<ref name="superintelligence" />
* Analyzing the internals and interpreting the behavior of current large language models is difficult. And it could be even more difficult for larger and more intelligent models.<ref name=":3" />

Alternatively, some find reason to believe superintelligences would be better able to understand morality, human values, and complex goals. Bostrom writes, "A future superintelligence occupies an epistemically superior vantage point: its beliefs are (probably, on most topics) more likely than ours to be true".<ref name="superintelligence" /><!--Chapter 13 : "Choosing the criteria for choosing", part "The need for indirect normativity"-->

In 2023, OpenAI started a project called "Superalignment" to solve the alignment of superintelligences in four years. It called this an especially important challenge, as it said superintelligence may be achieved within a decade. Its strategy involves automating alignment research using artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Introducing Superalignment |url=https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment |access-date=2023-07-16 |website=openai.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

* No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [[unintended consequences|unintended behavior]] the first time it encounters a new scenario. For example, Microsoft's [[Tay (bot)|Tay]] behaved inoffensively during pre-deployment testing, but was too easily baited into offensive behavior when it interacted with real users.<ref name=vanity/>

AI systems uniquely add a third problem: that even given "correct" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic learning capabilities may cause it to develop unintended behavior, even without unanticipated external scenarios. An AI may partly botch an attempt to design a new generation of itself and accidentally create a successor AI that is more powerful than itself but that no longer maintains the human-compatible moral values preprogrammed into the original AI. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would need not only to be bug-free, but to be able to design successor systems that are also bug-free.<ref name="aima" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yampolskiy |first=Roman V. |date=8 April 2014 |title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents |journal=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=373–389 |doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114 |quote=Nothing precludes sufficiently smart self-improving systems from optimising their reward mechanisms in order to optimisetheir current-goal achievement and in the process making a mistake leading to corruption of their reward functions. |s2cid=16477341}}</ref>

=== Orthogonality thesis ===
Some skeptics, such as Timothy B. Lee of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', argue that any superintelligent program we create will be subservient to us, that the superintelligence will (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously learn moral truth compatible with our values and adjust its goals accordingly, or that we are either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.<ref>{{cite web |date=2014-08-22 |title=Will artificial intelligence destroy humanity?

Bostrom's "orthogonality thesis" argues instead that, with some technical caveats, almost any level of "intelligence" or "optimization power" can be combined with almost any ultimate goal. If a machine is given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of [[pi]], then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means. The machine may utilize all available physical and informational resources to find as many decimals of pi as it can.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-967811-2 |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |page=116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against [[anthropomorphism]]: a human will set out to accomplish their projects in a manner that they consider reasonable, while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, instead caring only about completing the task.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2012 |title=Superintelligent Will |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128034545/http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf |archive-date=28 November 2015 |access-date=2015-10-29 |website=Nick Bostrom }}</ref>

Stuart Armstrong argues that the orthogonality thesis follows logically from the philosophical "[[is-ought distinction]]" argument against [[moral realism]]. He claims that even if there are moral facts provable by any "rational" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it is still possible to create a non-philosophical "optimizing machine" that can strive toward some narrow goal but that has no incentive to discover any "moral facts" such as those that could get in the way of goal completion. Another argument he makes is that any fundamentally friendly AI could be made unfriendly with modifications as simple as negating its utility function. Armstrong further argues that if the orthogonality thesis is false, there must be some immoral goals that AIs can never achieve, which he finds implausible.<ref name="armstrong">{{Cite journal |last=Armstrong |first=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |url-status=live |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011084205/http://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |archive-date=11 October 2014 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325025010/https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf|date=25 March 2020}}.</ref>

Skeptic [[Michael Chorost]] explicitly rejects Bostrom's orthogonality thesis, arguing that "by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so."<ref name="chorost">{{Cite magazine |last=Chorost |first=Michael |date=18 April 2016 |title=Let Artificial Intelligence Evolve |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/04/the_philosophical_argument_against_artificial_intelligence_killing_us_all.html |url-status=live |magazine=Slate |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127213642/http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/04/the_philosophical_argument_against_artificial_intelligence_killing_us_all.html |archive-date=27 November 2017 |access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref> Chorost argues that "an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Today's computers can't even want to keep existing, let alone tile the world in solar panels."<ref name="chorost" />

===Anthropomorphic arguments===
[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] arguments assume that, as machines become more intelligent, they will begin to display many human traits, such as morality or a thirst for power. Although anthropomorphic scenarios are common in fiction, most scholars writing about the existential risk of artificial intelligence reject them.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /> Instead, advanced AI systems are typically modeled as [[intelligent agent]]s.

The academic debate is between those who worry that AI might destroy humanity and those who believe that AI would not destroy humanity. Both sides have claimed that the others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /> The skeptics accuse proponents of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally desire power; proponents accuse some skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value human ethical norms.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /><ref name="Telegraph2016">{{Cite news |date=1 Sep 2015 |title=Should humans fear the rise of the machine? |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11837157/Should-humans-fear-the-rise-of-the-machine.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11837157/Should-humans-fear-the-rise-of-the-machine.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=7 February 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a skeptic, argues that "AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world"; perhaps instead "artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization."<ref name=shermer/> Facebook's director of AI research, [[Yann LeCun]], has said: "Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives".<ref>{{cite news |title=Intelligent Machines: What does Facebook want with AI? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118481 |access-date=31 March 2023 |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2015}}</ref>

Despite other differences, the x-risk school{{efn|as interpreted by [[Seth Baum]]}} agrees with Pinker that an advanced AI would not destroy humanity out of emotion such as revenge or anger, that questions of consciousness are not relevant to assess the risk,<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal |last=Baum |first=Seth |date=2018-09-30 |title=Countering Superintelligence Misinformation |journal=Information |volume=9 |issue=10 |page=244 |doi=10.3390/info9100244 |issn=2078-2489 |doi-access=free}}</ref> and that computer systems do not generally have a computational equivalent of testosterone.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Myth Of AI |url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-the-myth-of-ai |access-date=2020-03-11 |website=www.edge.org |archive-date=11 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200311210407/https://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-the-myth-of-ai |url-status=live }}</ref> They think that power-seeking or self-preservation behaviors emerge in the AI as a way to achieve its true goals, according to the concept of [[instrumental convergence]].

==Scenarios==
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction|AI takeover}}Some scholars have proposed [[scenario planning|hypothetical scenarios]] to illustrate some of their concerns.

=== Treacherous turn ===
In ''Superintelligence'', Bostrom expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because "it could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous". He suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents—a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson: the smarter the AI, the safer it is. "And so we boldly go—into the whirling knives", as the superintelligent AI takes a "treacherous turn" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->

=== Life 3.0 ===
In [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's "Omega team" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas. After a certain point, the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and uses it to make money, by diverse means such as [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks, production of animated films and TV shows, and development of biotech drugs, with profits invested back into further improving AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators in order to gain political influence to use "for the greater good" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape by inserting "backdoors" in the systems it designs, by [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or by using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]]. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Russell |first=Stuart |date=30 August 2017 |title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent |journal=Nature |language=En |volume=548 |issue=7669 |pages=520–521 |bibcode=2017Natur.548..520R |doi=10.1038/548520a |s2cid=4459076 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="life 3.0" /><!-- Prelude and Chapter 4 -->

The thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions in the scientific community and in the public at large, but many of the opposing viewpoints share common ground.

Conversely, many skeptics agree that ongoing research into the implications of artificial general intelligence is valuable. Skeptic [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] has said: "I think it seems wise to apply something like [[Dick Cheney]]'s famous '1 Percent Doctrine' to the specter of advanced artificial intelligence: the odds of its occurrence, at least in the foreseeable future, may be very low—but the implications are so dramatic that it should be taken seriously".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin Ford |title=Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future |title-link=Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-465-05999-7 |chapter=Chapter 9: Super-intelligence and the Singularity |publisher=Basic Books |author-link=Martin Ford (author)}}</ref> Similarly, an otherwise skeptical ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' wrote in 2014 that "the implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect seems remote".<ref name="economist_review3" />

AI safety advocates such as Bostrom and Tegmark have criticized the mainstream media's use of "those inane ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' pictures" to illustrate AI safety concerns: "It can't be much fun to have aspersions cast on one's academic discipline, one's professional community, one's life work{{nbsp}}...

The thesis that AI can pose existential risk has many detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God. [[Jaron Lanier]] argued in 2014 that the whole concept that then-current machines were in any way intelligent was "an illusion" and a "stupendous con" by the wealthy.<ref name="atlantic-but-what" /><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Andersen |first=Kurt |date=26 November 2014 |title=Enthusiasts and Skeptics Debate Artificial Intelligence |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory |access-date=2020-04-20 |magazine=Vanity Fair |language=en |archive-date=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808081852/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term. AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] wrote in 2014, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archive-date=12 November 2014}}</ref> [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] said in 2015 that AI existential risk is "like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet."<ref name="shermer">{{Cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |date=1 March 2017 |title=Apocalypse AI |language=en |page=77 |journal=Scientific American |volume=316 |issue=3 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/ |access-date=27 November 2017 |bibcode=2017SciAm.316c..77S |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0317-77 |pmid=28207698 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201051401/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Garling |first1=Caleb |title=Andrew Ng: Why 'Deep Learning' Is a Mandate for Humans, Not Just Machines |url=https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/andrew-ng-deep-learning-mandate-humans-not-just-machines/ |access-date=31 March 2023 |magazine=Wired |date=5 May 2015}}</ref> For the danger of uncontrolled advanced AI to be realized, the hypothetical AI may have to overpower or outthink any human, which some experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.<ref>{{cite web |date=2023-04-04 |title=Is artificial intelligence really an existential threat to humanity? |url=https://mambapost.com/2023/04/tech-news/ai-are-an-existential-threat-to-humanity/ |website=MambaPost}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The case against killer robots, from a guy actually working on artificial intelligence |url=http://fusion.net/story/54583/the-case-against-killer-robots-from-a-guy-actually-building-ai/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204175716/http://fusion.net/story/54583/the-case-against-killer-robots-from-a-guy-actually-building-ai/ |archive-date=4 February 2016 |access-date=31 January 2016 |website=Fusion.net}}</ref>

Skeptics who believe AGI is not a short-term possibility often argue that concern about existential risk from AI is unhelpful because it could distract people from more immediate concerns about AI's impact, because it could lead to government regulation or make it more difficult to fund AI research, or because it could damage the field's reputation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-31 |title=AI experts challenge 'doomer' narrative, including 'extinction risk' claims |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-experts-challenge-doomer-narrative-including-extinction-risk-claims/ |access-date=2023-07-08 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref> AI and AI ethics researchers [[Timnit Gebru]], [[Emily M.

=== Views on banning and regulation ===

==== Banning ====
Some scholars have said that even if AGI poses an existential risk, attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence is still unwise, and probably futile.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=John |author-link=John McGinnis |date=Summer 2010 |title=Accelerating AI |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&context=nulr_online |journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]] |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=1253–1270 |access-date=16 July 2014 |quote=For all these reasons, verifying a global relinquishment treaty, or even one limited to AI-related weapons development, is a nonstarter...

In March 2023, the [[Future of Life Institute]] drafted ''[[Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter]]'', a petition calling on major AI developers to agree on a verifiable six-month pause of any systems "more powerful than [[GPT-4]]" and to use that time to institute a framework for ensuring safety; or, failing that, for governments to step in with a moratorium. The letter referred to the possibility of "a profound change in the history of life on Earth" as well as potential risks of AI-generated propaganda, loss of jobs, human obsolescence, and society-wide loss of control.<ref name=":9">{{cite web |title=Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter |url=https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/ |access-date=30 March 2023 |website=Future of Life Institute}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=29 March 2023 |title=Elon Musk and other tech leaders call for pause in 'out of control' AI race |language=en |work=CNN |url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/tech/ai-letter-elon-musk-tech-leaders/index.html |access-date=30 March 2023}}</ref> The letter was signed by prominent personalities in AI but also criticized for not focusing on current harms,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-29 |title=Open letter calling for AI 'pause' shines light on fierce debate around risks vs. hype |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-letter-calling-for-ai-pause-shines-light-on-fierce-debate-around-risks-vs-hype/ |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref> missing technical nuance about when to pause,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vincent |first=James |date=2023-04-14 |title=OpenAI's CEO confirms the company isn't training GPT-5 and "won't for some time" |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/14/23683084/openai-gpt-5-rumors-training-sam-altman |access-date=2023-07-20 |website=The Verge |language=en-US}}</ref> or not going far enough.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2023-03-29 |title=The Open Letter on AI Doesn't Go Far Enough |url=https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/ |access-date=2023-07-20 |magazine=Time |language=en}}</ref>

Musk called for some sort of regulation of AI development as early as 2017. According to [[National Public Radio|NPR]], he is "clearly not thrilled" to be advocating government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: "Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation." Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain "insight" into the actual status of current research, warning that "Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... [as] they should be." In response, politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Domonoske |first=Camila |date=July 17, 2017 |title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk' |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk |url-status=live |access-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423135755/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk |archive-date=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=17 July 2017 |title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo |url-status=live |access-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606072024/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo |archive-date=6 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="cnbc2">{{Cite news |last=Kharpal |first=Arjun |date=7 November 2017 |title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says |work=CNBC |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html |url-status=live |access-date=27 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322115325/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html |archive-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>

In July 2023, the US government secured voluntary safety commitments from major tech companies, including [[OpenAI]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Google]], [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], and [[Microsoft]]. The companies agreed to implement safeguards, including third-party oversight and security testing by independent experts, to address concerns related to AI's potential risks and societal harms. The parties framed the commitments as an intermediate step while regulations are formed. Amba Kak, executive director of the [[AI Now Institute]], said, "A closed-door deliberation with corporate actors resulting in voluntary safeguards isn't enough" and called for public deliberation and regulations of the kind that companies would not voluntarily agree to.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-21 |title=Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other tech firms agree to AI safeguards set by the White House |url=https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-safeguards-joe-biden-kamala-harris-4caf02b94275429f764b06840897436c |access-date=2023-07-21 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-21 |title=Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other firms agree to AI safeguards |url=https://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/news/national/23670894.amazon-google-meta-microsoft-firms-agree-ai-safeguards/ |access-date=2023-07-21 |website=Redditch Advertiser |language=en}}</ref>
