'''Existential risk from artificial general intelligence''' is the hypothesis that substantial progress in [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) could someday result in [[human extinction]] or some other unrecoverable [[global catastrophic risk|global catastrophe]].<ref name="aima">{{Cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |title-link=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |date=2009 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-604259-4 |chapter=26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence |author-link=Stuart J.

The likelihood of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science.<ref name="givewell">{{Cite report |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |title=Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence |last=GiveWell |date=2015 |author-link=GiveWell |access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> Once the exclusive domain of [[AI takeovers in popular culture|science fiction]], concerns about superintelligence started to become mainstream in the 2010s, and were popularized by public figures such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Elon Musk]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Parkin |first=Simon |date=14 June 2015 |title=Science fiction no more?

One source of concern is that controlling a superintelligent machine, or instilling it with human-compatible values, may be a harder problem than naïvely supposed. Many researchers believe that a superintelligence would naturally resist attempts to shut it off or change its goals—a principle called [[instrumental convergence]]—and that preprogramming a superintelligence with a full set of human values will prove to be an extremely difficult technical task.<ref name="aima" /><ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk">{{Cite journal |last=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer |date=2008 |title=Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk |url=https://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf |journal=Global Catastrophic Risks |pages=308–345 |bibcode=2008gcr..book..303Y}}</ref><ref name="research-priorities">{{cite journal |title=Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence |author1-last=Russell |author1-first=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J.

A second source of concern is that a sudden and unexpected "[[intelligence explosion]]" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. To illustrate, if the first generation of a computer program able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months, then the second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name="aima" /><ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /> Empirically, examples like [[AlphaZero]] in the domain of [[Go (game)|Go]] show that AI systems can sometimes progress from narrow human-level ability to narrow superhuman ability extremely rapidly.<ref name=skeptic/>

==History==
One of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383</ref> 
{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}
In 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely "take control" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:
{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler's "Erewhon".<ref name="oxfordjournals">{{Cite journal |last=Turing |first=A M |year=1996 |title=Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory |journal=1951, Reprinted Philosophia Mathematica |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=256–260 |doi=10.1093/philmat/4.3.256}}</ref>}}

Finally, in 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an "intelligence explosion"; he also stated that the risks were underappreciated:<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hilliard |first=Mark |date=2017 |title=The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated? |language=en |work=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>

{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously.<ref>I.J.

In 2000, computer scientist and [[Sun microsystems|Sun]] co-founder [[Bill Joy]] penned an influential essay, "[[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us]]", identifying superintelligent robots as a high-tech dangers to human survival, alongside [[nanotechnology]] and engineered bioplagues.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Anderson |first=Kurt |date=26 November 2014 |title=Enthusiasts and Skeptics Debate Artificial Intelligence |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory |access-date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2009, experts attended a private conference hosted by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of [[autonomy]], and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. ''[[The New York Times]]'' summarized the conference's view as "we are a long way from [[HAL 9000|Hal]], the computer that took over the spaceship in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''".<ref name="nytimes july09">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, ''The New York Times'', 26 July 2009.</ref>

== General argument ==

===The three difficulties===

* The system's implementation may contain initially-unnoticed routine but catastrophic bugs. An analogy is space probes: despite the knowledge that bugs in expensive space probes are hard to fix after launch, engineers have historically not been able to prevent catastrophic bugs from occurring.<ref name=skeptic/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Phil |date=30 July 2015 |title=Houston, we have a bug: 9 famous software glitches in space |language=en |work=[[IT World]] |url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2823083/enterprise-software/88716-8-famous-software-bugs-in-space.html |access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>
* No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [[unintended consequences|unintended behavior]] the first time it encounters a new scenario. For example, Microsoft's [[Tay (bot)|Tay]] behaved inoffensively during pre-deployment testing, but was too easily baited into offensive behavior when interacting with real users.<ref name=vanity/>

AI systems uniquely add a third difficulty: the problem that even given "correct" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic "learning" capabilities may cause it to "evolve into a system with unintended behavior", even without the stress of new unanticipated external scenarios. An AI may partly botch an attempt to design a new generation of itself and accidentally create a successor AI that is more powerful than itself, but that no longer maintains the human-compatible moral values preprogrammed into the original AI. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would not only need to be "bug-free", but it would need to be able to design successor systems that are also "bug-free".<ref name="aima" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yampolskiy |first=Roman V. |date=8 April 2014 |title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents |journal=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=373–389 |doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114 |quote=Nothing precludes sufficiently smart self-improving systems from optimising their reward mechanisms in order to optimisetheir current-goal achievement and in the process making a mistake leading to corruption of their reward functions. |s2cid=16477341}}</ref>

All three of these difficulties become catastrophes rather than nuisances in any scenario where the superintelligence labeled as "malfunctioning" correctly predicts that humans will attempt to shut it off, and successfully deploys its superintelligence to outwit such attempts, the so-called "treacherous turn".<ref name=":2">{{Citation |last=Bostrom, Nick, 1973- author. |title=Superintelligence : paths, dangers, strategies |isbn=978-1-5012-2774-5 |oclc=1061147095}}</ref>

Citing major advances in the field of AI and the potential for AI to have enormous long-term benefits or costs, the 2015 [[Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence]] stated:

{{cquote|The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]] 2008-09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do.}}

===Evaluation and other arguments===
A superintelligent machine would be as alien to humans as human thought processes are to [[cockroach]]es. Such a machine may not have humanity's best interests at heart; it is not obvious that it would even care about human welfare at all. If superintelligent AI is possible, and if it is possible for a superintelligence's goals to conflict with basic human values, then AI poses a risk of human extinction. A "superintelligence" (a system that exceeds the capabilities of humans in every relevant endeavor) can outmaneuver humans any time its goals conflict with human goals; therefore, unless the superintelligence decides to allow humanity to coexist, the first superintelligence to be created will inexorably result in human extinction.<ref name="superintelligence" /><ref name="economist_review">{{Cite news |date=9 August 2014 |title=Clever cogs |work=[[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs |access-date=9 August 2014}} [http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligent-machines-and-human-life-2014-8 Syndicated] at [[Business Insider]]</ref>

Examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that machines have already reached superhuman levels of competency in certain domains, and that this superhuman competence can follow quickly after human-par performance is achieved.<ref name=skeptic/> One hypothetical intelligence explosion scenario could occur as follows: An AI gains an expert-level capability at certain key software engineering tasks. (It may initially lack human or superhuman capabilities in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.) Due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, the AI quickly becomes superhuman; just as human experts can eventually creatively overcome "diminishing returns" by deploying various human capabilities for innovation, so too can the expert-level AI use either human-style capabilities or its own AI-specific capabilities to power through new creative breakthroughs.<ref>Yampolskiy, Roman V. "Analysis of types of self-improving software." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 384-393.</ref> The AI then possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds in practically every relevant field, including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills. Just as the current-day survival of the gorillas is dependent on human decisions, so too would human survival depend on the decisions and goals of the superhuman AI.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!-- preface --><ref name="economist_review" />

Almost any AI, no matter its programmed goal, would rationally prefer to be in a position where nobody else can switch it off without its consent: A superintelligence will naturally gain self-preservation as a subgoal as soon as it realizes that it cannot achieve its goal if it is shut off.<ref name=omohundro/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=13 August 2017 |title=Teaching A.I.

A superintelligent AI will not have a natural drive to aid humans, for the same reason that humans have no natural desire to aid AI systems that are of no further use to them. (Another analogy is that humans seem to have little natural desire to go out of their way to aid viruses, termites, or even gorillas.) Once in charge, the superintelligence will have little incentive to allow humans to run around free and consume resources that the superintelligence could instead use for building itself additional protective systems "just to be on the safe side" or for building additional computers to help it calculate how to best accomplish its goals.<ref name="aima" /><ref name="vanity" /><ref name=omohundro/>

Thus, the argument concludes, it is likely that someday an intelligence explosion will catch humanity unprepared, and that such an unprepared-for intelligence explosion may result in human extinction or a comparable fate.<ref name="superintelligence" /><!-- preface -->

=== Possible scenarios ===
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

Some scholars have proposed [[scenario planning|hypothetical scenarios]] intended to concretely illustrate some of their concerns.

In [[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|''Superintelligence'']], [[Nick Bostrom]] expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because "[it] could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous". Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents—a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson—the smarter the AI, the safer it is. "And so we boldly go — into the whirling knives," as the superintelligent AI takes a "treacherous turn" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name="superintelligence"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->

In [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's "Omega team" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use "for the greater good" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting "backdoors" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]]. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Russell |first=Stuart |date=30 August 2017 |title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent |language=En |pages=520–521 |work=Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/548520a |access-date=2 February 2018 |bibcode=2017Natur.548..520R |doi=10.1038/548520a}}</ref><ref name="life 3.0" /><!-- Prelude and Chapter 4 -->

In contrast, top physicist [[Michio Kaku]], an AI risk skeptic, posits a [[technological determinism|deterministically]] positive outcome. In ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' he asserts that "It will take many decades for robots to ascend" up a scale of consciousness, and that in the meantime corporations such as [[Hanson Robotics]] will likely succeed in creating robots that are "capable of love and earning a place in the extended human family".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Elliott |first=E.

==Anthopomorphic arguments==

[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] arguments assume that machines are "evolving" along a linear scale and that, as they reach the higher levels, they will begin to display  many human traits, such as morality or a thirst for power. Although anthropomorphic scenarios are common in fiction, they are rejected by most scholars writing about the existential risk of artificial intelligence.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" />

In science fiction, an AI, even though it has not been programmed with human emotions, often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway: for example, Agent Smith in ''[[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]]'' was influenced by a "disgust" toward humanity. This is fictitious anthropomorphism: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" />

The academic debate is between one side which worries whether AI might destroy humanity and another side which believes that AI would not destroy humanity at all. Both sides have claimed that the others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /> The skeptics accuse proponents of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally desire power; proponents accuse some skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value human ethical norms.<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /><ref name="Telegraph2016">{{Cite news |date=1 Sep 2015 |title=Should humans fear the rise of the machine? |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11837157/Should-humans-fear-the-rise-of-the-machine.html |access-date=7 February 2016}}</ref>

Evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a skeptic, argues that "AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world"; perhaps instead "artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization."<ref name=shermer/> Computer scientist [[Yann LeCun]] states that "Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct{{nbsp}}... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives".

An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for "deception", and tricked other robots into eating "poison" and dying: here a trait, "deception", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=18 August 2009 |title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/ |access-date=7 February 2016}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, "the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking."<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A. Feigenbaum, eds. The handbook of artificial intelligence. Vol. 3. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2014.</ref>

There is a near-universal assumption in the scientific community that an advanced AI, even if it were programmed to have, or adopted, human personality dimensions (such as [[psychopathy]]) to make itself more efficient at certain tasks, e.g., [[Lethal autonomous weapon|tasks involving killing humans]], would not destroy humanity out of human emotions such as "revenge" or "anger."

=== Terminological issues ===
Part of the disagreement about whether a superintelligent machine would behave morally may arise from a terminological difference. Outside of the artificial intelligence field, "intelligence" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while "intelligence" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current "artificial intelligence" research focuses on creating algorithms that "optimize", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name="superintelligence" />

To avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word "intelligence", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal "optimizing process" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name="superintelligence" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. "Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 153-162. "Terminal-goaled intelligences are short-lived but mono-maniacally dangerous and a correct basis for concern if anyone is smart enough to program high-intelligence and unwise enough to want a paperclip-maximizer."</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Koebler |first=Jason |date=2 February 2016 |title=Will Superintelligent AI Ignore Humans Instead of Destroying Us? |work=[[Vice Magazine]] |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/will-superintelligent-ai-ignore-humans-instead-of-destroying-us |access-date=3 February 2016 |quote="This artificial intelligence is not a basically nice creature that has a strong drive for paperclips, which, so long as it's satisfied by being able to make lots of paperclips somewhere else, is then able to interact with you in a relaxed and carefree fashion where it can be nice with you," [[Eliezer Yudkowsky|Yudkowsky]] said. "Imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximum number of paperclips in the future, and this choice is then output—that's what a [[paperclip maximizer]] is."}}</ref>

==Sources of risk==
===Difficulty of specifying goals===

It is difficult to specify a set of goals for a machine that is guaranteed to prevent unintended consequences.

While there is no standardized terminology, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI's set of goals, or "utility function". The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English or other lingual statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean "minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model" or "maximize the number of reward clicks"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for "maximize human flourishing", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:

{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:

# The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.
# Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources — not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.

A system that is [[optimization problem|optimizing]] a function of ''n'' variables, where the [[loss function|objective]] depends on a subset of size ''k''<''n'', will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.  This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker — especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure — can have an irreversible impact on humanity.

This is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research — the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Russell |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart J. Russell |date=2014 |title=Of Myths and Moonshine |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015 |access-date=23 October 2015 |website=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]]}}</ref>}}

Dietterich and Horvitz echo the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" concern in a ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' editorial, emphasizing the need for AI systems that can fluidly and unambiguously solicit human input as needed.<ref name="acm">{{Cite journal |last1=Dietterich |first1=Thomas |author-link=Eric Horvitz |last2=Horvitz |first2=Eric |date=2015 |title=Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=38&ndash;40 |doi=10.1145/2770869 |access-date=23 October 2015 |s2cid=20395145}}</ref>

The first of Russell's two concerns above is that autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident. Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: "An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally." This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.<ref name="acm" /> For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yampolskiy |first=Roman V. |date=8 April 2014 |title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents |journal=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=373–389 |doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114 |s2cid=16477341}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lenat |first=Douglas |date=1982 |title=Eurisko: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts The Nature of Heuristics III: Program Design and Results |journal=Artificial Intelligence |type=Print |volume=21 |issue=1–2 |pages=61–98 |doi=10.1016/s0004-3702(83)80005-8}}</ref>

The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] or [[superintelligence]]. Bostrom, Russell, and others argue that smarter-than-human decision-making systems could arrive at more [[Paperclip maximizer|unexpected and extreme solutions]] to assigned tasks, and could modify themselves or their environment in ways that compromise safety requirements.<ref name="givewell" /><ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" />

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI agents. Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: "We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time."<ref name="aima" />

Mark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.  Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:<ref>Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) "Chapter 22: Morality" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.</ref> "to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt's functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waser |first=Mark |date=2015 |title=Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans) |journal=Procedia Computer Science |type=Print |volume=71 |pages=106–111 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213 |doi-access=free}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}

Nick Bostrom offers a hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting "electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins" because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=2015|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|access-date=30 January 2020|archive-date=25 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725005719/https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===
{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}

While current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify their goal structures, a sufficiently advanced, rational, "self-aware" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as a pacifist would not want to take a pill that makes them want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being "turned off" or being reprogrammed with a new goal.<ref name="superintelligence" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer |date=2011 |title=Complex Value Systems are Required to Realize Valuable Futures |url=https://intelligence.org/files/ComplexValues.pdf}}</ref><!-- extended and accessible version of conference paper found here https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_48 -->

===Instrumental goal convergence===
{{further|Instrumental convergence}}

An "instrumental" goal is a precondition to other goals &mdash; a sub-goal that is required in order to achieve an agent's main goal. "Instrumental convergence" is the observation that there are some goals that are preconditions for ''any'' goal, like acquiring resources or self-preservation.<ref name="omohundro">Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).</ref> Nick Bostrom argues that any sufficiently intelligent AI that has goals will exhibit this convergent behavior &mdash; if the AI's instrumental goals conflict with humanity's it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, but only as a means to achieve its primary goal.<ref name = "superintelligence"/>

Citing [[Steve Omohundro]]'s work on the idea of [[instrumental convergence]] and "basic AI drives", [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] write that "even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards." Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources.<ref name="aima" /> Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, "we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems", but it is not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code.<ref name=skeptic/>

[[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] argues that a sufficiently advanced machine "will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in{{nbsp}}... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal."<ref name="vanity">{{Cite news |last=Dowd |first=Maureen |date=April 2017 |title=Elon Musk's Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

===Orthogonality thesis===
One common belief is that any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans, or, better yet, would (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously "learn" a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly. Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.<ref>{{cite web|date=2014-08-22|title=Will artificial intelligence destroy humanity?

However, [[Nick Bostrom]]'s "orthogonality thesis" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of "intelligence" or "optimization power" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-967811-2 |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |pages=116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider "reasonable", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date=2012 |title=Superintelligent Will |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf |access-date=2015-10-29 |website=Nick Bostrom |publisher=Nick Bostrom}}</ref>

While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical "[[is-ought distinction]]", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any "rational" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical "optimizing machine" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any "moral facts" that would get in the way of goal completion.<ref name=armstrong/>

One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus ("-") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but "unethical" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that "[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail."<ref name="armstrong" /> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements "seem extraordinarily strong claims to make".<ref name="armstrong">{{Cite journal |last=Armstrong |first=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>

Some dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that "by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so."<ref name="chorost" /> Chorost argues that "an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

==== Competition ====
{{Main|Artificial intelligence arms race}}
In 2014 philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] stated that a "severe race dynamic" (extreme [[competition]]) between different teams may create conditions whereby the creation of an AGI results in shortcuts to safety and potentially violent conflict.<ref name=":2" /> To address this risk, citing previous scientific collaboration ([[CERN]], the [[Human Genome Project]], and the [[International Space Station]]), Bostrom recommended  [[collaboration]] and the altruistic global adoption of a [[common good]] principle: "Superintelligence should be developed only for the benefit of all of humanity and in the service of widely shared ethical ideals".<ref name=":2" /><sup>:254</sup> Bostrom theorized that collaboration on creating an artificial general intelligence would offer multiple benefits, including reducing haste, thereby increasing investment in safety; avoiding violent conflicts (wars), facilitating sharing solutions to the control problem, and more equitably distributing the benefits.<ref name=":2" /><sup>:253</sup> The United States' [[BRAIN Initiative|Brain Initiative]] was launched in 2014, as was the European Union's [[Human Brain Project]]; China's [[China Brain Project|Brain Project]] was launched in 2016.

Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A.

Skeptics who believe it is impossible for AGI to arrive anytime soon, tend to argue that expressing concern about existential risk from AI is unhelpful because it could distract people from more immediate concerns about the impact of AGI, because of fears it could lead to government regulation or make it more difficult to secure funding for AI research, or because it could give AI research a bad reputation. Some researchers, such as Oren Etzioni, aggressively seek to quell concern over existential risk from AI, saying "[Elon Musk] has impugned us in very strong language saying we are unleashing the demon, and so we're answering."<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Bass |first1=Dina |last2=Clark |first2=Jack |date=5 February 2015 |title=Is Elon Musk Right About AI?

In 2014, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s Adam Elkus argued "our 'smartest' AI is about as intelligent as a toddler—and only when it comes to instrumental tasks like information recall.

The thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions within the scientific community, as well as in the public at large. Many of the opposing viewpoints, however, share common ground.

Conversely, many skeptics agree that ongoing research into the implications of artificial general intelligence is valuable. Skeptic [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] states that "I think it seems wise to apply something like [[Dick Cheney]]'s famous '1 Percent Doctrine' to the specter of advanced artificial intelligence: the odds of its occurrence, at least in the foreseeable future, may be very low — but the implications are so dramatic that it should be taken seriously";<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin Ford |title=Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future |title-link=Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future |date=2015 |isbn=9780465059997 |chapter=Chapter 9: Super-intelligence and the Singularity |author-link=Martin Ford (author)}}</ref> similarly, an otherwise skeptical ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' stated in 2014 that "the implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect seems remote".<ref name=economist_review/>

A 2014 survey showed the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=Vincent C. |last2=Bostrom |first2=Nick |year=2014 |title=Future Progress in Artificial Intelligence: A Poll Among Experts |url=http://www.sophia.de/pdf/2014_PT-AI_polls.pdf|url-status=live|journal=AI Matters|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–11 |doi=10.1145/2639475.2639478 |s2cid=8510016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115114604/http://www.sophia.de/pdf/2014_PT-AI_polls.pdf|archive-date=15 January 2016}}</ref>

Of the respondents, 5% said it was "among the most important problems in the field", 34% said it was "an important problem", and 31% said it was "moderately important", whilst 19% said it was "not important" and 11% said it was "not a real problem" at all.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1705.08807 |class=cs.AI |first1=Katja |last1=Grace |first2=John |last2=Salvatier |title=When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

{{Further|Existential risk}}
The thesis that AI poses an existential risk, and that this risk needs much more attention than it currently gets, has been endorsed by many public figures; perhaps the most famous are [[Elon Musk]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The most notable AI researchers to endorse the thesis are Russell and [[I. J. Good|I.J. Good]], who advised [[Stanley Kubrick]] on the filming of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states that he does not "understand why some people are not concerned",<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news |last=Rawlinson |first=Kevin |date=29 January 2015 |title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780 |access-date=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'<ref name="hawking editorial" />}}

Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. A group of prominent tech titans including [[Peter Thiel]], Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1&nbsp;billion to [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Post|first=Washington|title=Tech titans like Elon Musk are spending $1 billion to save you from terminators |website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-tech-titans-against-terminators-20151214-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607121118/http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-tech-titans-against-terminators-20151214-story.html|archive-date=7 June 2016}}</ref> In January 2015, [[Elon Musk]] donated $10&nbsp;million to the [[Future of Life Institute]] to fund research on understanding AI decision making. The goal of the institute is to "grow wisdom with which we manage" the growing power of technology. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as [[DeepMind]] and [[Vicarious (company)|Vicarious]] to "just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence.<ref>{{cite web|title=The mysterious artificial intelligence company Elon Musk invested in is developing game-changing smart computers |url=http://www.techinsider.io/mysterious-artificial-intelligence-company-elon-musk-investment-2015-10|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030165333/http://www.techinsider.io/mysterious-artificial-intelligence-company-elon-musk-investment-2015-10|archive-date=30 October 2015|access-date=30 October 2015|website=Tech Insider}}</ref> I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there."{{sfn|Clark|2015a}}<ref>{{cite web|date=2015-01-15|title=Elon Musk Is Donating $10M Of His Own Money To Artificial Intelligence Research |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3041007/fast-feed/elon-musk-is-donating-10m-of-his-own-money-to-artificial-intelligence-research|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030202356/http://www.fastcompany.com/3041007/fast-feed/elon-musk-is-donating-10m-of-his-own-money-to-artificial-intelligence-research|archive-date=30 October 2015|access-date=30 October 2015 |website=Fast Company}}</ref>

=== Skepticism ===
{{Further|Artificial general intelligence#Feasibility}}
The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argued in 2014 that the whole concept that then current machines were in any way intelligent was "an illusion" and a "stupendous con" by the wealthy.<ref name="atlantic-but-what" /><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Andersen |first=Kurt |date=26 November 2014 |title=Enthusiasts and Skeptics Debate Artificial Intelligence |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory |access-date=2020-04-20 |magazine=Vanity Fair |language=en}}</ref>

Much of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term. Leading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archive-date=12 November 2014}}</ref> [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is "like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet."<ref name="shermer">{{Cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |date=1 March 2017 |title=Apocalypse AI |language=en |pages=77 |work=Scientific American |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/ |access-date=27 November 2017 |bibcode=2017SciAm.316c..77S |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0317-77}}</ref> Computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity.

Some AI and AGI researchers may be reluctant to discuss risks, worrying that policymakers do not have sophisticated knowledge of the field and are prone to be convinced by "alarmist" messages, or worrying that such messages will lead to cuts in AI funding. ''Slate'' notes that some researchers are dependent on grants from government agencies such as [[DARPA]].<ref name=slate_killer />

Several skeptics argue that the potential near-term benefits of AI outweigh the risks. Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] believes AI will "unlock a huge amount of positive things," such as curing disease and increasing the safety of autonomous cars.<ref>{{Cite web|date=25 May 2018|title=Mark Zuckerberg responds to Elon Musk's paranoia about AI: 'AI is going to... help keep our communities safe.'|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shares-thoughts-elon-musks-ai-2018-5|access-date=2019-05-06|website=Business Insider|archive-date=6 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506173756/https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shares-thoughts-elon-musks-ai-2018-5|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Intermediate views ===

=== Popular reaction ===
In a 2014 article in ''[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]]'', James Hamblin noted that most people do not care one way or the other about artificial general intelligence, and characterized his own gut reaction to the topic as: "Get out of here.

Many of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult "control problem" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?<ref name="superintelligence" /><ref name="physica_scripta" /><!-- in physica_scripta, see sections 3.3.2.

=== Views on banning and regulation ===

==== Banning ====
There is nearly universal agreement that attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence would be unwise, and probably futile.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=John |author-link=John McGinnis |date=Summer 2010 |title=Accelerating AI |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&context=nulr_online |journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]] |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=1253–1270 |access-date=16 July 2014 |quote=For all these reasons, verifying a global relinquishment treaty, or even one limited to AI-related weapons development, is a nonstarter...

Almost all of the scholars who believe existential risk exists agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise, as research could be moved to countries with looser regulations or conducted covertly.

==== Regulation ====
{{See also|Regulation of algorithms|Regulation of artificial intelligence}}

[[Elon Musk]] called for some sort of regulation of AI development as early as 2017. According to [[National Public Radio|NPR]], the [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] CEO is "clearly not thrilled" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: "Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation." Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain "insight" into the actual status of current research, warning that "Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid{{nbsp}}... [as] they should be." In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Domonoske |first=Camila |date=July 17, 2017 |title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk' |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk |access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=17 July 2017 |title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo |access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="cnbc">{{Cite news |last=Kharpal |first=Arjun |date=7 November 2017 |title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says |work=CNBC |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html |access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref>
