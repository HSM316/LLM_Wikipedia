'''Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization''' ('''QUBO''') is a [[pattern matching]] technique, common in [[machine learning]] applications. QUBO is an [[NP hard]] problem. Examples of problems that can be formulated as QUBO problems are the [[Maximum cut]], [[Graph coloring]] and the [[Partition problem]].<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Glover |first1=Fred |last2=Kochenberger|first2=Gary |eprint=1811.11538 |title=A Tutorial on Formulating and Using QUBO Models |class= cs.DS|date=2019 }}</ref>

QUBO problems may sometimes be well-suited to algorithms aided by [[quantum annealing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/514686/d-waves-quantum-computer-goes-to-the-races-wins/

QUBO is the problem of minimizing a quadratic polynomial over binary variables.  The quadratic polynomial will be of the form 
<math>E(X_1, X_2, ... , X_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^i Q_{ij} \times X_i \times X_j</math>
with <math>X_i \in \{0,1\}</math> and <math>c_i, Q_{ij} \in R </math>.
