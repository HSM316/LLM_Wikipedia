'''[[Artificial intelligence]]''' (AI) has a range of uses in '''[[government]]'''. It can be used to further [[public policy]] objectives (in areas such as emergency services, health and welfare), as well as assist the public to interact with the government  (through the use of [[virtual assistant]]s, for example). According to the [[Harvard Business Review]], "Applications of artificial intelligence to the public sector are broad and growing, with early experiments taking place around the world."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url=https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-ai-could-help-the-public-sector|title=How AI Could Help the Public Sector|last=Martinho-Truswell|first=Emma|date=26 January 2018|journal=Harvard Business Review|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> Hila Mehr from the [[Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation]] at [[Harvard University]] notes that AI in government is not new, with postal services using machine methods in the late 1990s to [[handwriting recognition|recognise handwriting]] on envelopes to automatically route letters.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://ash.harvard.edu/files/ash/files/artificial_intelligence_for_citizen_services.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services and Government|last=Mehr|first=Hila|date=August 2017|website=ash.harvard.edu|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> The use of AI in government comes with significant benefits, including efficiencies resulting in cost savings (for instance by reducing the number of front office staff), and reducing the opportunities for corruption.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=Zheng, Yongqing Yu, Han Cui, Lizhen Miao, Chunyan Leung, Cyril Yang, Qiang|title=Smarths: An AI platform for improving government service provision|date=2018|oclc=1125199733}}</ref> However, it also carries risks (described below).

== Uses of AI in government ==
The potential uses of AI in government are wide and varied,<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Wirtz|first1=Bernd W.|last2=Weyerer|first2=Jan C.|last3=Geyer|first3=Carolin|date=24 July 2018|title=Artificial Intelligence and the Public Sector—Applications and Challenges|journal=International Journal of Public Administration|volume=42|issue=7|pages=596–615|doi=10.1080/01900692.2018.1498103|s2cid= 158829602|issn=0190-0692|url=https://zenodo.org/record/3569435}}</ref> with [[Deloitte]] considering that "Cognitive technologies could eventually revolutionize every facet of government operations".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/cognitive-technologies/artificial-intelligence-government-summary.html|title=Executive Summary - Demystifying artificial intelligence in government {{!}} Deloitte Insights|date=26 April 2017|website=www2.deloitte.com|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> Mehr suggests that six types of government problems are appropriate for AI applications:<ref name=":1" />

# Resource allocation - such as where administrative support is required to complete tasks more quickly.
# Large datasets - where these are too large for employees to work efficiently and multiple datasets could be combined to provide greater insights.
# Experts shortage - including where basic questions could be answered and niche issues can be learned.
# Predictable scenario - historical data makes the situation predictable.
# Procedural - repetitive tasks where inputs or outputs have a binary answer.
# Diverse data - where data takes a variety of forms (such as visual and linguistic) and needs to be summarised regularly.

Mehr states that "While applications of AI in government work have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of AI in the private sector, the potential use cases in the public sector mirror common applications in the private sector."<ref name=":1" />

Potential and actual uses of AI in government can be divided into three broad categories: those that contribute to public policy objectives; those that assist public interactions with the government; and other uses.

=== Contributing to public policy objectives ===
There are a range of examples of where AI can contribute to public policy objectives.<ref name=":10"/> These include:

* Receiving benefits at job loss, retirement, bereavement and child birth almost immediately, in an automated way (thus without requiring any actions from citizens at all)<ref>[https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/enabling-e-government-estonias-national-digital-advisor-marten-kaevats/ Marten Kaevats on the 'invisible government']</ref>
*Social insurance service provision<ref name=":9" />
* Classifying emergency calls based on their urgency (like the system used by the [[Cincinnati Fire Department]] in the United States<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.capgemini.com/consulting/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2017/10/ai-in-public-sector.pdf|title=Unleashing the potential of Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector|last=Capgemini Consulting|date=2017|website=www.capgemini.com|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>)

=== Assisting public interactions with government ===
AI can be used to assist members of the public to interact with government and access government services,<ref name=":10" /> for example by:

* [[question answering|Answering questions]] using [[virtual assistant]]s or [[chatbot]]s (see below)
* Directing requests to the appropriate area within government<ref name=":1" />
* Filling out forms<ref name=":1" />
* Assisting with searching documents (e.g. [[IP Australia]]'s trade mark search<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/innovation/innovative-government/innovation2018.htm|title=Embracing Innovation in Government: Global Trends 2018|last=OECD|date=2018|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>)
* Scheduling appointments<ref name=":7" />

Examples of virtual assistants or chatbots being used by government include the following:

* Launched in February 2016, the [[Australian Taxation Office]] has a virtual assistant on its [https://www.ato.gov.au website] called "Alex".<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/commitments-and-reporting/in-detail/ato-regulator-performance-framework-self-assessment-report-2016-17/?page=3|title=ATO Regulator Performance Framework self-assessment report 2016-17|last=Australian Taxation Office|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> As at 30 June 2017, Alex could respond to more than 500 questions, had engaged in 1.5 million conversations and resolved over 81% of enquiries at first contact.<ref name=":3" />
* Australia's [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]] (NDIS) is developing a virtual assistant called "Nadia" which takes the form of an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] using the voice of actress [[Cate Blanchett]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cio.com.au/article/614647/ndia-recruits-cate-blanchett-voice-new-avatar/|title=NDIA recruits Cate Blanchett to voice new avatar|date=22 February 2017|website=CIO|access-date=31 December 2018|archive-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100816/https://www.cio.com.au/article/614647/ndia-recruits-cate-blanchett-voice-new-avatar/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nadia is intended to assist users of the NDIS to navigate the service. Costing some $4.5 million,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/api/qon/downloadattachment?attachmentId=92f4e55a-820f-42e8-8ec9-2924b113f36f|title=Answers to Estimates Questions on Notice - Question No. NDIA SQ17-000196|date=6 December 2017|website=www.aph.gov.au|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> the project has been postponed following a number of issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/National_Disability_Insurance_Scheme/NDISICTSystems/Report|title=NDIS ICT Systems|last=Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme|date=December 2018|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-21/government-stalls-ndis-virtual-assistant-voiced-by-cate-blanchet/8968074|title=Government's Blanchett-voiced AI venture for NDIS stalls|date=21 September 2017|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> Nadia was developed using [[Watson (computer)|IBM Watson]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22committees/estimate/4f0bb71a-b09f-4adc-934f-c8d5de8ec54f/0002%22|title=Hansard, Community Affairs Legislation Committee|date=31 May 2017|website=Parliament of Australia}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> however, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] is considering other platforms such as [[Cortana (virtual assistant)|Microsoft Cortana]] for its further development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/api/qon/downloadattachment?attachmentId=a3af3394-0167-4cf1-8b00-983bb8e33792|title=Answers to Estimates Questions on Notice - Question No. NDIA SQ17-000199|date=6 December 2017|website=www.aph.gov.au|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>
* The Australian Government's [[Department of Human Services (Australia)|Department of Human Services]] uses virtual assistants on parts of its [https://www.humanservices.gov.au website] to answer questions and encourage users to stay in the digital channel.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/about-us/annual-reports/annual-report-2017-18|title=Annual Report 2017-18 - Australian Government Department of Human Services|last=Department of Human Services|website=www.humanservices.gov.au|access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref> As at December 2018, a virtual assistant called "Sam" could answer general questions about family, job seeker and student payments and related information. The department also introduced an internally-facing virtual assistant called "MelissHR" to make it easier for departmental staff to access human resources information.<ref name=":5" />
* Estonia is building a virtual assistant which will guide citizens through any interactions they have with the government. Automated and proactive services "push" services to citizens at key events of their lives (including births, bereavements, unemployment, ...). One example is the automated registering of babies when they are born.<ref>[https://govinsider.asia/innovation/marten-kaevats-national-digital-advisor-estonias-vision-for-an-invisible-government/ Estonia's vision for an 'invisible government']</ref><ref>[https://medium.com/swlh/estonias-national-strategy-for-artificial-intelligence-2623259ddf4c Estonia's National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence]</ref>

=== Gerrymandering ===
[[Gerrymandering]] is an insidious method of influencing political process.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/ai-drawn-voting-districts-could-help-stamp-out-gerrymandering/ |last=Coldewey |first=Devin |work=Tech Crunch |title=AI-drawn voting districts could stamp out gerrymandering |date=5 September 2020}}</ref> Depending on the objective of its use, the application of artificial intelligence to redraw districts based on voter distribution and demographic datasets can either contribute to impartiality, or sustain partisan gains for interested stakeholders in the election process.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/for-2022-2061/html?lang=en |title=AI and Redistricting: Useful Tool for the Courts or Another Source of Obfuscation? |last1=Cho |first1=Wendy|first2=Bruce |last2=Cain |journal=The Forum |volume=20 |issue=3–4 |year=2022 |pages=395–408 |doi=10.1515/for-2022-2061}}</ref>

=== Other uses ===
Other uses of AI in government include:

* [[Translation]]<ref name=":1" />
*[[Language interpretation]] pioneered by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Interpretation|Directorate General for Interpretation]] and [[Florika Fink-Hooijer]].
* Drafting documents<ref name=":1" />

== Potential benefits ==
AI offers potential efficiencies and costs savings for the government. For example, [[Deloitte]] has estimated that automation could save [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] employees between 96.7 million to 1.2 billion hours a year, resulting in potential savings of between $3.3 billion to $41.1 billion a year.<ref name=":2" /> The [[Harvard Business Review]] has stated that while this may lead a government to reduce employee numbers, "Governments could instead choose to invest in the quality of its services. They can re-employ workers' time towards more rewarding work that requires lateral thinking, empathy, and creativity — all things at which humans continue to outperform even the most sophisticated AI program."<ref name=":0" />

== Risks ==

Risks associated with the use of AI in government include AI becoming susceptible to bias,<ref name=":1" /> a lack of transparency in how an AI application may make decisions,<ref name=":6" /> and the accountability for any such decisions.<ref name=":6" />

AI in governance and the economic world might make the market more difficult for companies to keep up with the increases in technology. Large U.S. companies like Apple and Google are able to dominate the market with their latest and most advanced technologies. This gives them an advantage over smaller companies that do not have the means of advancing as far in the digital technology fields with AI.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv20pxz2v |title=Handbook of Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation: Policy and Government Applications |date=2020 |publisher=Anthem Press |doi=10.2307/j.ctv20pxz2v |jstor=j.ctv20pxz2v |isbn=978-1-78527-495-4|s2cid=242891260 }}</ref>
