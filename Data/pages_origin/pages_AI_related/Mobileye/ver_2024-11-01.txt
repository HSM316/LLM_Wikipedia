==History==
Mobileye was founded in 1999 by [[Hebrew University]] professor [[Amnon Shashua]]. He evolved his academic research into a vision system that could detect vehicles using a camera and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=543997&privcapId=24494124 |title=Amnon Shashua: Executive Profile & Biography - Businessweek |website=www.bloomberg.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204085223/http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=543997&privcapId=24494124 |archive-date=4 February 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It developed into a supplier of automotive safety technologies based on adding "intelligence" to inexpensive cameras for commercialization.<ref>{{cite web|title=At High Speed, On the Road to a Driverless Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/science/on-the-road-in-mobileyes-self-driving-car.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|date=May 27, 2013|website=NY Times}}</ref>

Mobileye established its first research center in 2004. It launched the first generation EyeQ1 processor in 2008. The technology offered driver assistance including [[Collision avoidance system|automatic emergency braking]]. One of the first vehicles to use this technology was the fifth-generation [[BMW 7 Series]]. Versions of the chip were released in 2010, 2014 and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside the Suppliers: Mobileye|url=https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/inside-the-suppliers-mobileye|date=February 21, 2021|website=www.carexpert.com}}</ref>

In 2017, Mobileye unveiled a mathematical model for safe self-driving cars based on research by CEO Amnon Shashua and VP of Technology Shai Shalev-Shwartz.
