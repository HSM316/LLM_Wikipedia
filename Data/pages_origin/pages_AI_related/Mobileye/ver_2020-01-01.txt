==History==
Mobileye N.V. was founded in 1999, by [[Amnon Shashua]] (a researcher of the [[Hebrew University]]), when he evolved his academic research into a technical solution for a vision system which could detect vehicles using only a camera and software [[algorithms]] on a processor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160204085223/http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=543997&privcapId=24494124]</ref> After receiving a license to use the technology which was owned by [[Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University|Yissum]] it was possible to incorporate the company. Together with Ziv Aviram, he set up the company's [[R&D]] headquarters in Jerusalem, Israel.

[[File:Mobileye logo.jpg|thumb|Original Mobileye logo]]

At first, the company developed algorithms, and a [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|custom accelerator processor chip]] called the ''EyeQ'' chip. All of Mobileye's proprietary image processing algorithms run on the EyeQ chip. The company's first clients were [[automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] such as BMW, General Motors and Volvo. These companies electronics suppliers integrated Mobileye's technologies into the companies' cars, at first as an optional accessory when buying a new car, and later as a standard option in new cars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sarah |first=Viva |url=http://www.israel21c.org/what-drives-israels-serial-entrepreneurs/ |title=What drives Israel’s serial entrepreneurs? |publisher=ISRAEL21c |date=2014-03-23 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>{{Not in citation|date=May 2019}}

In 2006, Mobileye set up an aftermarket department, which sells finished products manufactured by Mobileye at their [[Philippines]] factory, IMI. The [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] products are sold to an international network of distributors on all continents who sell the products to fleets of trucks and buses, to car dealerships, and to car accessory shops.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/nyc-taxis-to-be-a-little-safer-thanks-to-mobileye/ NYC taxis to be a little safer, thanks to Mobileye: Israeli road safety alert system is being installed in New York cabs to help their operators drive more safely], David Shamah, Times of Israel 15 June 2015</ref>

==Technologies==
The firm's technology is based on the use of optical vision systems with motion detection algorithms running on a custom hardware accelerator{{snd}} the '''EyeQ''' chip. This is unlike many other competing systems which use a combination of visual detection, radar, and laser scanning. The firm's vehicle detection algorithms recognize motorised vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and trucks, in day and night time conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The firm's version performs its vehicle detection based functions using a single camera mounted in the rear view mirror, unlike the usual approach of using radars, laser scanners or in some cases stereo-cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/11/safety-upgrades-for-your-car/index.htm |title=Mobileye 560 Review &#124; Goshers Blind Spot Detection System |publisher=Consumer Reports |date= |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>

In 2011, the firm introduced the world's first OEM production of vision-only [[Precrash system|forward collision warning system]] (NHTSA compliant) on multiple BMW, GM and Opel vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Lane departure warning system]]s are in-vehicle electronic systems that monitor the position of a vehicle within a roadway lane and warn a driver if the vehicle deviates or is about to deviate outside the lane. Mobileye's version was launched in multiple production platforms through 2007 and 2008 with [[General Motors|GM]], [[BMW]] and [[Volvo]].{{citation needed |date=January 2013}}

The firm's [[pedestrian detection]] technology is based on the use of mono cameras only, using pattern recognition and classifiers with image processing and optic flow analysis. Both static and moving pedestrians can be detected to a range of around 30&nbsp;m using [[VGA]] resolution imagers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The firm announced in 2008 that by mid-2010 they would launch a world's first application of full emergency braking for collision mitigation for pedestrians. Mobileye announced in May 2009 as part of the next generation Volvo radar-vision fusion system which also provides lane departure warning and vehicle detection with radar-vision fusion for an enhanced collision mitigation by braking system on the next [[Volvo S60]] vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Administrator |first=Cars |url=http://carszainfo.blogspot.com/2009/10/volvo-cars-tests-new-unique-safety.html |title=Cars.co.za: Volvo Cars tests new, unique safety technology in Copenhagen – in a disguised S60 prototype |publisher=Carszainfo.blogspot.com |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}

Since 2008, BMW 7-Series cars have been equipped with the Mobileye [[traffic sign recognition]] systems, developed in cooperation with automotive supplier [[Continental AG]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604100132/http://www.motortrend.com/features/newswire/38117/index.html]</ref>

Adaptive [[High beam|highbeam]] systems automatically raise and lower the high beams without inconveniencing oncoming or preceding traffic. The firm's version, Intelligent Headlight Control, is in production on the [[BMW 7 Series (F01)|BMW 7 series]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.autospies.com/news/BMW-7-Series-and-its-amazing-Headlights-System-38669 |title=BMW 7 Series and its amazing Headlights System |website=Autospies.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>

In 2011, the firm introduced multi-functional bundles including vision based FCW on the [[Opel Zafira]] and [[Opel Insignia]].

In 2016, Mobileye announced a deal to work with [[Renault|Renault Nissan]] on digital maps that will help the automaker's move towards driverless cars.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Mobileye takes fight to Google in autonomous cars|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/21dbe238-da3a-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz416qWYkRE|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2016-02-24|access-date = 2016-02-24|issn = 0307-1766|first = John|last = Reed|first2 = Murad|last2 = Ahmed}}</ref>

===Aftermarket===
Since 2007 the firm has offered a range of aftermarket vision based ADAS systems, based on the same core technology as for production models. They currently offer lane departure warning, forward collision warning, headway monitoring and warning, low speed urban collision warning, intelligent headlamp control, speed limit indication (tsr) and pedestrian collision warning (including bicycles).
These systems have also been integrated with fleet management systems.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://fleetowner.com/equipment/news/installernet-mobileye-installation-0414|title = InstallerNet to handle installation of Mobileye systems|date = Apr 14, 2010|accessdate = 2015-01-26|website = Fleet Owner|publisher = Fleet Owner|last = |first = }}</ref>
