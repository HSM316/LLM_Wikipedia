==History==
Mobileye N.V. was founded in 1999, by [[Amnon Shashua]] (a researcher of the [[Hebrew University]]), when he evolved his academic research into a technical solution for a vision system which could detect vehicles using only a camera and software [[algorithms]] on a processor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160204085223/http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=543997&privcapId=24494124]</ref> The goal of Mobileye since its foundation is to reduce vehicle injuries and fatalities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobileye.com/about/mobileye-timeline/|title = Timeline}}</ref>

[[File:Mobileye logo.jpg|thumb|Original Mobileye logo]]

At first, the company developed algorithms, and a [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|custom accelerator processor chip]] called the ''EyeQ'' chip. All of Mobileye's proprietary image processing algorithms run on the EyeQ chip. The company's first clients were [[automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] such as BMW, General Motors and Volvo. These companies electronics suppliers integrated Mobileye's technologies into the companies' cars, at first as an optional accessory when buying a new car, and later as a standard option in new cars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sarah |first=Viva |url=http://www.israel21c.org/what-drives-israels-serial-entrepreneurs/ |title=What drives Israel's serial entrepreneurs? |publisher=ISRAEL21c |date=2014-03-23 |access-date=2017-03-18}}</ref>{{Not in citation|date=May 2019}}

In late March 2017, Reuters reported that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] had charged two Israelis with engaging in insider trading, prior to the announcement of the acquisition of Mobileye by Intel.<ref> Two Israelis accused of Mobileye insider Trading, March 24, 2017, https://www.timesofisrael.com/two-israelis-accused-of-mobileye-insider-trading/ </ref> According to the report, [[Ariel Darvasi]] was accused of making a profit of over $400,000, and Amir Waldman was accused of profiting more than $4 million.<ref>Ibid.</ref> The case was filed in federal court in New York City (the "New York Court"). Neither Intel nor Mobileye were accused by the SEC of violating the law. Within days the SEC obtained an emergency court order, freezing certain assets of Virginia residents Lawrence F.

Shaoul who allegedly used insider information to make approximately $1 million on Intel’s purchase of Mobileye.<ref>["SEC Freezes Assets Of Traders," Financial Advisor online, April 7, 2017, https://www.fa-mag.com/news/sec-freezes-assets-of-traders-32217.html SEC freezes assets of traders]</ref>

In September 2017, the Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]] speculated that the addition of Cluff and Shaoul as defendants raised the "possibility" that Mobileye founders Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram may be eventually named as well.<ref>"The Ticker: U.S. adds Israeli to Mobileye insider trading indictment," Haaretz, Sept. 19, 2017, https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/the-ticker-u-s-adds-israeli-to-mobileye-insider-trading-indictment-1.5452044</ref> That did not happen.

In November 2017, the SEC filed a motion with a New York court for assistance from Israel in taking evidence from four Israeli witnesses concerning the allegations of insider trading.<ref>"US Seeks Israel's Help in Mobileye Insider Trading Probe," Nocamels, Nov. 20, 2017, https://nocamels.com/2017/11/us-seeks-israels-help-in-mobileye-insider-trading-probe/ </ref> The request was eventually increased to five Israeli witnesses.<ref>See Addendum to Request for International Assistance Pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters," Feb. 7, 2018, https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?pscCourtId=NYSDC&appurl=https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127121835857 (hereinafter, the "Supplemental Request").</ref> 

In early December 2017, the Israeli news outlet [[The Marker]] reported that Waldman flew to Canada to provide information to the SEC to try to convince it to drop the case.<ref> The Marker (Hebrew), Dec. 5, 2017, https://www.themarker.com/markets/1.4652974 </ref> The report in The Marker also stated that it is expected that the questioning of the Israeli witnesses would be done by the Israeli Securities Authority.<ref>Ibid.</ref> That did not happen. The SEC asked the New York court to request of the Israeli court to appoint American-Israeli lawyer Eric Sherby to take evidence from the Israeli witnesses.<ref> See the Supplemental Request; SEC Hires an Israel-Based Lawyer to Handle Mobileye Insider Trading Investigation, Calcalist, Jan. 28, 2018, https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3730582,00.html </ref>

In order to keep the asset order in place, in December 2017, the SEC filed (among other things) an expert affidavit of Joseph Mason. Mason testified that he reviewed the trading records of Waldman and concluded from those records that Waldman was targeting "something that is nonpublic that he expects to occur before March 17," 2017; the offer by Intel was announced on March 13.<ref> See Decision of the New York Court, April 20, 2018, p. 4.</ref> Mason also analyzed the trading records of defendant Lawrence Cluff. According to Mason, "the purchase of Mobileye options in the Cluff accounts shared similar unusual and risk characteristics as those purchased by Waldman."<ref> See Ibid., pp. 3-4.</ref> On behalf of Waldman, an expert affidavit was submitted by Garrick Tsui. Tsui conceded that Waldman's February and March 2017 Mobileye option purchases "were significantly greater than at any time in the past."<ref> Ibid. at p. 4.</ref> 

In papers filed by the SEC in May 2018,<ref>[https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District_Court/1--17-cv-02088/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_v._Waldman_et_al/130/ Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion to Modify Scheduling Order] (May 25, 2018).</ref> the SEC informed the New York Court that two out of the five Israeli witnesses had testified in Israel pursuant to the Supplemental Request,<ref> Ibid., pp. 3-4.</ref> and the SEC asserted that it had obtained from the first two Israeli witnesses "valuable evidence" relating to the insider trading allegations.<ref> Ibid, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, counsel for Waldman asserted in court papers filed a few weeks later that the two Israeli witnesses had provided "exculpatory" testimony regarding the insider trading allegations.<ref>Defendant Amir Waldman's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiff's Appeal of Magistrate Judge Fox's Discovery Order, Aug. 17, 2017, pp. 1, 6, 13.</ref>

In November 2019, the Israeli press reported a settlement involving two defendants,<ref> Calcalist, Mobileye Insider Trading Defendant to Sign Settlement With SEC," https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3772988,00.html </ref> but the amount of the settlement was not reported. The press report again speculated that Mobileye's founders "could potentially be facing lawsuits of their own."<ref> Ibid.</ref> Again, that did not happen.

The SEC issued a press release in April 2020, announcing that it obtained a final judgement against the "last" defendant in the Mobileye insider trading case.<ref> Litigation Release No. 24799 / April 17, 2020, https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24799.htm </ref> Waldman was ordered to pay [[disgorgement]] in the amount of $1,078,300, prejudgment interest in the amount of $40,889, and a civil penalty in the amount of $1,078,300.<ref> Ibid.</ref>
