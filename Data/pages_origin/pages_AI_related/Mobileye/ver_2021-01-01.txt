==History==
Mobileye N.V. was founded in 1999, by [[Amnon Shashua]] (a researcher of the [[Hebrew University]]), when he evolved his academic research into a technical solution for a vision system which could detect vehicles using only a camera and software [[algorithms]] on a processor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160204085223/http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=543997&privcapId=24494124]</ref> After receiving a license to use the technology which was owned by [[Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University|Yissum]] it was possible to incorporate the company. Together with Ziv Aviram, he set up the company's [[R&D]] headquarters in Jerusalem, Israel.

[[File:Mobileye logo.jpg|thumb|Original Mobileye logo]]

At first, the company developed algorithms, and a [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|custom accelerator processor chip]] called the ''EyeQ'' chip. All of Mobileye's proprietary image processing algorithms run on the EyeQ chip. The company's first clients were [[automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] such as BMW, General Motors and Volvo. These companies electronics suppliers integrated Mobileye's technologies into the companies' cars, at first as an optional accessory when buying a new car, and later as a standard option in new cars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sarah |first=Viva |url=http://www.israel21c.org/what-drives-israels-serial-entrepreneurs/ |title=What drives Israel's serial entrepreneurs? |publisher=ISRAEL21c |date=2014-03-23 |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>{{Not in citation|date=May 2019}}

In 2006, Mobileye set up an aftermarket department, which sells finished products manufactured by Mobileye at their [[Philippines]] factory, IMI. The [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] products are sold to an international network of distributors on all continents who sell the products to fleets of trucks and buses, to car dealerships, and to car accessory shops.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/nyc-taxis-to-be-a-little-safer-thanks-to-mobileye/ NYC taxis to be a little safer, thanks to Mobileye: Israeli road safety alert system is being installed in New York cabs to help their operators drive more safely], David Shamah, Times of Israel 15 June 2015</ref>

==Technology==
The firm's technology is based on the use of optical vision systems with motion detection algorithms running on a custom hardware accelerator{{snd}} the '''EyeQ''' chip. This is unlike many other competing systems which use a combination of visual detection, radar, and laser scanning. The firm's vehicle detection algorithms recognize motorised vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and trucks, in day and night time conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The firm's version performs its vehicle detection based functions using a single camera mounted in the rear view mirror, unlike the usual approach of using radars, laser scanners or in some cases stereo-cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/11/safety-upgrades-for-your-car/index.htm |title=Mobileye 560 Review &#124; Goshers Blind Spot Detection System |publisher=Consumer Reports |accessdate=2017-03-18}}</ref>

In 2011, the firm introduced the world's first OEM production of vision-only [[Precrash system|forward collision warning system]] (NHTSA compliant) on multiple BMW, GM and Opel vehicles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The firm’s version of [[lane departure warning system]]s was launched in multiple production platforms through 2007 and 2008 with [[General Motors|GM]], [[BMW]] and [[Volvo]].{{citation needed |date=January 2013}}

The firm's [[pedestrian detection]] technology is based on the use of mono cameras only, using pattern recognition and classifiers with image processing and optic flow analysis. Both static and moving pedestrians can be detected to a range of around 30&nbsp;m using [[VGA]] resolution imagers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The firm announced in 2008 that by mid-2010 they would launch a world's first application of full emergency braking for collision mitigation for pedestrians. Mobileye announced in May 2009 as part of the next generation Volvo radar-vision fusion system which also provides lane departure warning and vehicle detection with radar-vision fusion for an enhanced collision mitigation by braking system on the next [[Volvo S60]] vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Administrator |first=Cars |url=http://carszainfo.blogspot.com/2009/10/volvo-cars-tests-new-unique-safety.html |title=Cars.co.za: Volvo Cars tests new, unique safety technology in Copenhagen – in a disguised S60 prototype |publisher=Carszainfo.blogspot.com |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}}

Since 2008, BMW 7-Series cars have been equipped with the Mobileye [[traffic sign recognition]] systems, developed in cooperation with automotive supplier [[Continental AG]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604100132/http://www.motortrend.com/features/newswire/38117/index.html]</ref>

Adaptive [[High beam|highbeam]] systems automatically raise and lower the high beams without inconveniencing oncoming or preceding traffic.

==Insider Trading Scandal==

In late March 2017, Reuters reported that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] had charged two Israelis with engaging in insider trading, prior to the announcement of the acquisition of Mobileye by Intel.<ref> Two Israelis accused of Mobileye insider Trading, March 24, 2017, https://www.timesofisrael.com/two-israelis-accused-of-mobileye-insider-trading/ </ref> According to the report, [[Ariel Darvasi]] was accused of making a profit of over $400,000, and Amir Waldman was accused of profiting more than $4 million.<ref>Ibid.</ref>

The case was filed in federal court in New York City (the "New York Court").<ref>Ibid.</ref>  

Neither Intel nor Mobileye were accused by the SEC of violating the law.<ref>Ibid.</ref>

Within days the SEC obtained an "emergency" court order, freezing certain assets of two Virginia residents, Lawrence F. Cluff, Jr. and Roger E. Shaoul, who allegedly used insider information to make approximately $1 million on Intel’s purchase of Mobileye.<ref>"SEC Freezes Assets Of Traders," Financial Advisor online, April 7, 2017, https://www.fa-mag.com/news/sec-freezes-assets-of-traders-32217.html </ref>

In September 2017, the Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]] speculated that the addition of Cluff and Shaoul as defendants raised the "possibility" that Mobileye founders Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram may be eventually named as well.<ref>"The Ticker: U.S. adds Israeli to Mobileye insider trading indictment," Haaretz, Sept. 19, 2017, https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/the-ticker-u-s-adds-israeli-to-mobileye-insider-trading-indictment-1.5452044</ref> That did not happen.

In November 2017, the SEC filed a motion with a New York court for assistance from Israel in taking evidence from four Israeli witnesses concerning the allegations of insider trading.<ref>"US Seeks Israel's Help in Mobileye Insider Trading Probe," Nocamels, Nov. 20, 2017, https://nocamels.com/2017/11/us-seeks-israels-help-in-mobileye-insider-trading-probe/ </ref> The request was eventually increased to five Israeli witnesses.<ref>See Addendum to Request for International Assistance Pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters," Feb. 7, 2018, https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf?pscCourtId=NYSDC&appurl=https://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127121835857 (hereinafter, the "Supplemental Request").</ref> 

In early December 2017, the Israeli news outlet [[The Marker]] reported that Waldman flew to Canada to provide information to the SEC to try to convince it to drop the case.<ref> The Marker (Hebrew), Dec. 5, 2017, https://www.themarker.com/markets/1.4652974 </ref> The report in The Marker also stated that it is expected that the questioning of the Israeli witnesses would be done by the Israeli Securities Authority.<ref>Ibid.</ref> That did not happen. The SEC asked the New York court to request of the Israeli court to appoint American-Israeli lawyer Eric Sherby to take evidence from the Israeli witnesses.<ref> See the Supplemental Request; SEC Hires an Israel-Based Lawyer to Handle Mobileye Insider Trading Investigation, Calcalist, Jan. 28, 2018, https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3730582,00.html </ref>

In order to keep the asset order in place, in December 2017, the SEC filed (among other things) an expert affidavit of Joseph Mason. Mason testified that he reviewed the trading records of Waldman and concluded from those records that Waldman was targeting "something that is nonpublic that he expects to occur before March 17," 2017; the offer by Intel was announced on March 13.<ref> See Decision of the New York Court, April 20, 2018, p. 4.</ref> Mason also analyzed the trading records of defendant Lawrence Cluff. According to Mason, "the purchase of Mobileye options in the Cluff accounts shared similar unusual and risk characteristics as those purchased by Waldman."<ref> See Ibid., pp. 3-4.</ref> On behalf of Waldman, an expert affidavit was submitted by Garrick Tsui. Tsui conceded that Waldman's February and March 2017 Mobileye option purchases "were significantly greater than at any time in the past."<ref> Ibid. at p. 4.</ref> 

In papers filed by the SEC in May 2018,<ref> Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion to Modify Scheduling Order, May 25, 2018, available at https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District_Court/1--17-cv-02088/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_v._Waldman_et_al/130/ , hereinafter "SEC Memo."</ref> the SEC informed the New York Court that two out of the five Israeli witnesses had testified in Israel pursuant to the Supplemental Request,<ref> Ibid., pp. 3-4.</ref> and the SEC asserted that it had obtained from the first two Israeli witnesses "valuable evidence" relating to the insider trading allegations.<ref> Ibid, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, counsel for Waldman asserted in court papers filed a few weeks later that the two Israeli witnesses had provided "exculpatory" testimony regarding the insider trading allegations.<ref> Defendant Amir Waldman's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiff's Appeal of Magistrate Judge Fox's Discovery Order, Aug. 17, 2017, pp. 1, 6, 13.</ref>

In November 2019, the Israeli press reported a settlement involving two defendants,<ref> Calcalist, Mobileye Insider Trading Defendant to Sign Settlement With SEC," https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3772988,00.html </ref> but the amount of the settlement was not reported. The press report again speculated that Mobileye's founders "could potentially be facing lawsuits of their own."<ref> Ibid.</ref> Again, that did not happen.

The SEC issued a press release in April 2020, announcing that it obtained a final judgement against the "last" defendant in the Mobileye insider trading case.<ref> Litigation Release No. 24799 / April 17, 2020, https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24799.htm </ref> Waldman was ordered to pay [[disgorgement]] in the amount of $1,078,300, prejudgment interest in the amount of $40,889, and a civil penalty in the amount of $1,078,300.<ref> Ibid.</ref>
