{{Short description|Set of related problems in graph theory}}
The '''pebble motion problems''', or '''pebble motion on graphs''', are a set of related problems in [[graph theory]] dealing with the movement of multiple objects ("pebbles") from vertex to vertex in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with a constraint on the number of pebbles that can occupy a vertex at any time. Pebble motion problems occur in domains such as multi-[[robot]] [[motion planning]] (in which the pebbles are robots) and [[network routing]] (in which the pebbles are [[Data packet|packets]] of data). The best-known example of a pebble motion problem is the famous [[15 puzzle]] where a disordered group of fifteen tiles must be rearranged within a 4x4 grid by sliding one tile at a time.

==Theoretical formulation==
The general form of the pebble motion problem is Pebble Motion on Graphs{{r|Kornhauser}} formulated as follows:

Let <math>G = (V,E)</math> be a graph with <math>n</math> vertices. Let <math>P = \{1,\ldots,k\}</math> be a set of pebbles with <math>k < n</math>. An arrangement of pebbles is a mapping <math>S : P \rightarrow V</math> such that <math>S(i) \neq S(j)</math> for <math>i \neq j</math>. A move <math>m = (p, u, v)</math> consists of transferring pebble <math>p</math> from vertex <math>u</math> to adjacent unoccupied vertex <math>v</math>. The Pebble Motion on Graphs problem is to decide, given two arrangements <math>S_0</math> and <math>S_+</math>, whether there is a sequence of moves that transforms <math>S_0</math> into <math>S_+</math>.

===Variations===
Common variations on the problem limit the structure of the graph to be:
* a [[Tree graph|tree]]{{r|Auletta}}
* a [[Lattice graph|square grid]],{{r|Calinescu}}
* a [[Biconnected graph|bi-connected]] graph.{{r|Surynek}}

Another set of variations consider the case in which some{{r|Papadimitriou}} or all{{r|Calinescu}} of the pebbles are unlabeled and interchangeable.

Other versions of the problem seek not only to prove reachability but to find a (potentially optimal) sequence of moves (i.e. a plan) which performs the transformation.

==Complexity==
Finding the shortest solution sequence in the pebble motion on graphs problem (with labeled pebbles) is known to be [[NP hard|NP-hard]]{{r|Ratner}} and [[APX|APX-hard]].{{r|Calinescu}}  The unlabeled problem can be solved in polynomial time when using the cost metric mentioned above (minimizing the total number of moves to adjacent vertices), but is [[NP hard|NP-hard]] for other natural cost metrics.{{r|Calinescu}}
