A [[computer vision]] algorithm processes input from cameras within Sophia's eyes, giving Sophia visual information on its surroundings. It can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. It can process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.<ref name="auto"/> Around January 2018, Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Video|first1=Telegraph|title=Sophia the robot takes her first steps|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/01/08/sophia-robot-takes-first-steps/|access-date=January 12, 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=2018|archive-date=January 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112111602/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/01/08/sophia-robot-takes-first-steps/|url-status=live}}</ref> CNBC has commented on Sophia's "lifelike" skin and its ability to emulate more than 60 facial expressions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Harriet |title=Could you fall in love with this robot? |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/could-you-fall-in-love-with-this-robot.html |access-date=16 May 2020 |work=CNBC |date=16 March 2016 |language=en |archive-date=July 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720215735/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/could-you-fall-in-love-with-this-robot.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as ''[[60 Minutes]]''{{'}}s [[Charlie Rose]].<ref name=cbs/> In a piece for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much [[Elon Musk]].

On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced to the [[United Nations]] with a brief conversation with the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, [[Amina J. Mohammed]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/oct/13/sophia-the-robot-tells-un-i-am-here-to-help-humanity-create-the-future-video|title='Sophia' the robot tells UN: 'I am here to help humanity create the future'|work=The Guardian|date=October 13, 2017|access-date=October 26, 2017|archive-date=July 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730080322/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/oct/13/sophia-the-robot-tells-un-i-am-here-to-help-humanity-create-the-future-video|url-status=live}}</ref> On October 25, at the Future Investment Summit in [[Riyadh]], the robot was "granted [[Saudi Arabia]]n citizenship", becoming the first robot ever to have a nationality, described as a [[publicity stunt]].<ref name=tc>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/|title=Saudi Arabia bestows citizenship on a robot named Sophia|work=TechCrunch|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2016|archive-date=October 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027023101/https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-robot-sophia-muslim-694152|title=Saudi Arabia gives citizenship to a non-Muslim, English-Speaking robot|work=Newsweek|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=October 26, 2017|archive-date=November 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108055113/http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-robot-sophia-muslim-694152|url-status=live}}</ref> This attracted controversy as some commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder. Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia's human rights record]]. In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia would use its citizenship to advocate for women's rights in its new country of citizenship; ''[[Newsweek]]'' criticized that "What [Hanson] means, exactly, is unclear".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sophia-robot-saudi-arabia-women-735503|title=Saudi robot Sophia is advocating for women's rights now|date=December 5, 2017|work=Newsweek|access-date=January 4, 2018|archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103223246/http://www.newsweek.com/sophia-robot-saudi-arabia-women-735503|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

According to ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'', experts who have reviewed the robot's [[open-source]]<ref>[https://github.com/hansonrobotics/chatbot chatbot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611005318/https://github.com/hansonrobotics/chatbot |date=June 11, 2018 }} on [[github.com]]/hansonrobotics</ref><ref>[http://www.hansonrobotics.com/about/innovations-technology/ Innovations Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810210759/http://www.hansonrobotics.com/about/innovations-technology/ |date=August 10, 2018 }} on hansonrobotics.com ''"Our AI software is open source: www.cogchar.org, www.friendularity.org, and www.glue.ai."''</ref> code state that Sophia is best categorized as a chatbot with a face.<ref name=qz/> Many experts in the AI field disapprove of Sophia's overstated presentation. [[Ben Goertzel]], the former chief scientist for the company that made Sophia, acknowledged that it is "not ideal" that some think of Sophia as having human-equivalent intelligence, but argues Sophia's presentation conveys something unique to audiences: "If I show them a beautiful smiling robot face, then they get the feeling that 'AGI' ([[artificial general intelligence]]) may indeed be nearby and viable... None of this is what I would call AGI, but nor is it simple to get working." Goertzel added that Sophia did utilize what ''[[The Verge]]'' described as "AI methods", including [[face tracking]], [[emotion recognition]], and robotic movements generated by [[deep neural network]]s. Sophia's dialogue is generated via a [[decision tree]], but is integrated with these outputs uniquely.<ref name=verge>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16617092/sophia-the-robot-citizen-ai-hanson-robotics-ben-goertzel|title=Sophia the robot's co-creator says the bot may not be true AI, but it is a work of art|work=The Verge|access-date=January 4, 2018|archive-date=December 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222230054/https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16617092/sophia-the-robot-citizen-ai-hanson-robotics-ben-goertzel|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Verge]]'', Hanson often exaggerates and "grossly misleads" about Sophia's capacity for consciousness, for example by agreeing with [[Jimmy Fallon]]<ref name=qz/><ref>{{cite web|title=Tonight Showbotics: Jimmy Meets Sophia the Human-Like Robot|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg_tJvCA8zw&t=3m10s|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|access-date=February 24, 2018|date=April 25, 2017|archive-date=November 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119050316/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg_tJvCA8zw&t=3m10s|url-status=live}}</ref> in 2017 that Sophia was "basically alive".<ref name=verge/><!-- verge incorrectly states "Jimmy Kimmel", but video linked from Verge article is to Jimmy Fallon --> In a piece produced by [[CNBC]] which indicates that their own interview questions for Sophia were heavily rewritten by its creators, Goertzel responds to the Hanson quote by suggesting Hanson means Sophia is "alive" in the way that, to a sculptor, a piece of sculpture becomes "alive" in the sculptor's eyes as the work nears completion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Humanoid Robot Sophia - Almost Human Or PR Stunt |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fnCQC7bLs0 |website=YouTube |publisher=[[CNBC]] |access-date=July 29, 2018 |archive-date=June 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608002933/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fnCQC7bLs0&app=desktop |url-status=live }}</ref>

In January 2018, Facebook's director of artificial intelligence, [[Yann LeCun]], tweeted that Sophia was "complete bullshit" and slammed the media for giving coverage to "[[Potemkin village#Other uses|Potemkin]] AI". In response, Goertzel stated he had never pretended Sophia was close to human-level intelligence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Facebook's AI boss described Sophia the robot as 'complete b------t' and 'Wizard-of-Oz AI' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ai-yann-lecun-sophia-robot-bullshit-2018-1 |access-date=January 7, 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=January 4, 2018 |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107070334/http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ai-yann-lecun-sophia-robot-bullshit-2018-1 |url-status=live }}</ref>
