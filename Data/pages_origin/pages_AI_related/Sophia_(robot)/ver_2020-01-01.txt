According to the manufacturer, [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]], Sophia uses [[artificial intelligence]], visual data processing and [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. Sophia also imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansonrobotics.com/news/|title=Hanson Robotics in the news|work=Hanson Robotics}}</ref> Sophia uses [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] (speech-to-text) technology from [[Alphabet Inc.]] (parent company of [[Google]]) and is designed to get smarter over time. Her [[speech synthesis|speech-synthesis]] ability is provided by Cereproc's Text-to-Speech engine and also allows her to sing.

Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help crowds at large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain [[social skills]].<ref name=bi>{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-robot-citizen-sophia-animatronic-humanoid-2017-10|title=Meet the first-ever robot citizen — a humanoid named Sophia that once said it would 'destroy humans'|work=Business Insider|date=October 27, 2017|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}</ref>

==Features==
[[File:Sophia at the AI for Good Global Summit 2018 (27254369807) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sophia's internals]]
Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see. She can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. She is able to process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.<ref name="auto"/> Around January 2018 Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Video|first1=Telegraph|title=Sophia the robot takes her first steps|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/01/08/sophia-robot-takes-first-steps/|accessdate=January 12, 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=2018}}</ref>

Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program [[ELIZA]], which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-sophia-the-robot-is-not-what-it-seems-20171030-gzbi3p.html|title=Why Sophia the robot is not what it seems|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Caitlin|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref> The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a [[chatbot]].

Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as ''[[60 Minutes|60 Minutes']]'' [[Charlie Rose]].<ref name=cbs/> In a piece for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much [[Elon Musk]]. And watching too many Hollywood movies".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/elon-musk-sophia-robot-ai.html|title=A robot threw shade at Elon Musk so the billionaire hit back|work=CNBC|date=October 26, 2017|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref> Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch ''[[The Godfather]]'' and asked "what's the worst that could happen?"<ref>{{cite tweet| user=elonmusk| number=923339941957976065| author=Elon Musk| date=October 25, 2017| title=Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.

On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced to the [[United Nations]] with a brief conversation with the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, [[Amina J. Mohammed]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/oct/13/sophia-the-robot-tells-un-i-am-here-to-help-humanity-create-the-future-video|title='Sophia' the robot tells UN: 'I am here to help humanity create the future'|work=The Guardian|date=October 13, 2017}}</ref> On October 25, at the Future Investment Summit in [[Riyadh]], the robot was granted [[Saudi Arabia]]n citizenship, becoming the first robot ever to have a nationality.<ref name=tc>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/|title=Saudi Arabia bestows citizenship on a robot named Sophia|work=TechCrunch|date=October 26, 2017|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-robot-sophia-muslim-694152|title=Saudi Arabia gives citizenship to a non-Muslim, English-Speaking robot|work=Newsweek|date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> This attracted controversy as some commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder. Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia's human rights record]]. In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia would use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her new country of citizenship;
''[[Newsweek]]'' criticized that "What [Hanson] means, exactly, is unclear".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sophia-robot-saudi-arabia-women-735503|title=Saudi robot Sophia is advocating for women's rights now|date=December 5, 2017|work=Newsweek|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref>
On November 27, 2018, Sophia was given a visa by Azerbaijan while attending Global Influencer Day Congress held in Baku. December 15, 2018, Sophia was appointed a [[Belt and Road]] Innovative Technology Ambassador by [[China]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hansonrobotics.com/news-china-awards-belt-and-road-innovative-technology-ambassador-honor-to-sophia-the-robot/|title=China Honors Sophia the Robot with “Belt and Road Innovative Technology Ambassador” Award|date=January 2, 2019|work=Hanson Robotics|access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>

==Controversy over hype in the scientific community==
According to ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'', experts who have reviewed the robot's [[open-source]]<ref>[https://github.com/hansonrobotics/chatbot chatbot] on [[github.com]]/hansonrobotics</ref><ref>[http://www.hansonrobotics.com/about/innovations-technology/ Innovations Technology] on hansonrobotics.com ''"Our AI software is open source: www.cogchar.org, www.friendularity.org, and www.glue.ai."''</ref> code state that Sophia is best categorized as a chatbot with a face.<ref name=qz/> Many experts in the AI field disapprove of Sophia's overstated presentation. [[Ben Goertzel]], the former chief scientist for the company that made Sophia, acknowledged that it is "not ideal" that some think of Sophia as having human-equivalent intelligence, but argues Sophia's presentation conveys something unique to audiences: "If I show them a beautiful smiling robot face, then they get the feeling that 'AGI' (artificial general intelligence) may indeed be nearby and viable... None of this is what I would call AGI, but nor is it simple to get working." Goertzel added that Sophia did utilize AI methods including [[face tracking]], [[emotion recognition]], and robotic movements generated by [[deep neural network]]s. Sophia's dialogue is generated via a [[decision tree]], but is integrated with these outputs uniquely.<ref name=verge>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16617092/sophia-the-robot-citizen-ai-hanson-robotics-ben-goertzel|title=Sophia the robot’s co-creator says the bot may not be true AI, but it is a work of art |work=The Verge |access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Verge]]'', Hanson often exaggerates and "grossly misleads" about Sophia's capacity for consciousness, for example by agreeing with [[Jimmy Fallon]]<ref name=qz/><ref>{{cite web|title=Tonight Showbotics: Jimmy Meets Sophia the Human-Like Robot|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg_tJvCA8zw&t=3m10s|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|accessdate=February 24, 2018|date=April 25, 2017}}</ref> in 2017 that Sophia was "basically alive".<ref name=verge/><!-- verge incorrectly states "Jimmy Kimmel", but video linked from Verge article is to Jimmy Fallon --> In a piece produced by [[CNBC]] which indicates that their own interview questions for Sophia were heavily rewritten by her creators, Goertzel responds to the Hanson quote by suggesting Hanson means Sophia is "alive" in the way that, to a sculptor, a piece of sculpture becomes "alive" in the sculptor's eyes as the work nears completion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Humanoid Robot Sophia - Almost Human Or PR Stunt |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fnCQC7bLs0 |website=YouTube |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2018, Facebook's director of artificial intelligence, [[Yann LeCun]], tweeted that Sophia was "complete bullshit" and slammed the media for giving coverage to "[[Potemkin village#Other uses|Potemkin]] AI". In response, Goertzel stated that he had never pretended Sophia was close to human-level intelligence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Facebook's AI boss described Sophia the robot as 'complete b------t' and 'Wizard-of-Oz AI' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ai-yann-lecun-sophia-robot-bullshit-2018-1 |accessdate=January 7, 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=January 4, 2018}}</ref>
