'''Sophia''' is a social [[humanoid robot]] developed by the [[Hong Kong]]-based company [[Hanson Robotics]].{{sfnp|Greshko|2018}} Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016,{{sfnp|Mallonee|2018}} and made its first public appearance in mid-March 2016 at [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, United States.<ref>{{harvp|Raymundo|2016}}</ref> Sophia is marketed as a "social robot" that can mimic social behavior and induce feelings of love in humans.{{sfnp|Greshko|2018}}{{sfnp|Hanson|2019}}

Sophia has been covered by media around the globe, and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia was granted [[Saudi Arabian nationality law|Saudi Arabian citizenship]], becoming the first robot to receive legal personhood in any country.{{sfnp|Reynolds|2018}} In November 2017, Sophia was named the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s first Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given a United Nations title.{{sfnp|UNDP|2017}}

According to founder David Hanson, Sophia's [[source code]] is about 70% [[open source]].{{sfnp|Jewell|2018}} A paper describing of one of Sophia's open-source subsystems, called "Open Arms", was submitted to 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems ([[NeurIPS]] 2022).{{sfnp|Hanson|Imran|Morales|Krisciunas|2022}}

Sophia was first activated on Valentines Day,<ref name="Ball">{{harvp|Ball|2022|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1sSHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT164 164]}}</ref> February 14, 2016.{{sfnp|Mallonee|2018}} The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian [[Queen Nefertiti]],{{sfnp|Hanson|2019b}} [[Audrey Hepburn]], and its inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,{{sfnp|Greshko|2018}}{{sfnp|Stone|2017}} is known for its human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).<ref name="Ball"/>

Hanson has said that he designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, to help crowds at large events or parks, or to serve in customer service, therapy, and educational applications,<ref name="Ball"/><ref>{{harvp|Burgess|2017}}</ref> and that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain [[social skills]].{{sfnp|Jotham|2017}}

On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced to the [[United Nations]] with a brief conversation with the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, [[Amina J. Mohammed]].<ref>{{harvp|UN Web TV|2017}}</ref>

On October 25, when Sophia was scheduled to appear at the Future Investment Summit in [[Riyadh]], the Saudi [[Ministry of Culture and Information (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry for Culture and Information]] issued a press release on the [[Center for International Communication (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Center for International Communication]] website, announcing that Saudi Arabia was granting citizenship to Sophia.{{sfnp|Staff|2017}} At the Summit, the host interviewing Sophia announced that "We just learned, Sophia – I hope you are listening to me – you have been awarded what is going to be the first [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] citizenship for a robot",{{sfnp|Elouazi|2017}} making Sophia the first robot to receive legal personhood in any country.{{sfnp|Reynolds|2018}} In an interview, Hanson stated that he had been taken by surprise by this turn of events.{{sfnp|Hanson|2019b}}

On November 21, 2017, Sophia was named the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s first Innovation Champion for Asia and the Pacific.{{sfnp|UNDP|2017}} The announcement was made at the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore, an event hosted by the UNDP in Asia and the Pacific and Global Initiatives. On stage, it was assigned its first task by UNDP Asia Pacific Chief of Policy and Program, Jaco Cilliers.<ref>{{Citation|last=UNDP RCB|title=Sophia the Robot is UNDP's Innovation Champion for Asia-Pacific|date=November 21, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwFEFQUDNTs|access-date=January 4, 2018|archive-date=December 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202143030/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwFEFQUDNTs&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

Social media users have used Sophia's citizenship to criticize [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia's human rights record]].{{sfnp|Maza|2017}} In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia would use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her new country of citizenship.{{sfnp|Hanson|2019b}}<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news |first=Ryan |last=Browne |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/05/hanson-robotics-ceo-sophia-the-robot-an-advocate-for-womens-rights.html |title=World's first robot 'citizen' Sophia is calling for women's rights in Saudi Arabia |website=CNBC |language=en |access-date=May 16, 2018 |archive-date=May 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514193434/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/05/hanson-robotics-ceo-sophia-the-robot-an-advocate-for-womens-rights.html|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Williams|2017}}

In 2019, Sophia displayed the ability to create drawings, including portraits. In 2021, a self-portrait created by Sophia sold for nearly $700,000 at auction.{{sfnp|Holland|2021}}

Sophia has at least nine robot humanoid "siblings" who were also created by [[Hanson Robotics]].<ref name="auto2">{{harvp|Weller|2017b}}</ref> Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, [[Albert HUBO|Albert Einstein Hubo]], [[BINA48]], Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K.

Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as ''[[60 Minutes]]''{{'}}s [[Charlie Rose]].<ref name=cbs/>

In an October 2017 interview for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much [[Elon Musk]]. And watching too many Hollywood movies".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/elon-musk-sophia-robot-ai.html|title=A robot threw shade at Elon Musk so the billionaire hit back|work=CNBC|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|archive-date=July 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705204132/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/elon-musk-sophia-robot-ai.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch ''[[The Godfather]]'' and asked "what's the worst that could happen?"<ref>{{cite tweet| user=elonmusk| number=923339941957976065| author=Elon Musk| date=October 25, 2017| title=Just feed it The Godfather movies as input.

[[Business Insider]]'s chief UK editor Jim Edwards interviewed Sophia, and while the answers were "not altogether terrible", he predicted that Sophia was a step towards "conversational artificial intelligence".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/sophia-ai-robot-video-viral-future-tech-2017-11?r=US&IR=T|title=Watch this viral video of Sophia — the talking AI robot that is so lifelike humans are freaking out|first=Justin|last=Maiman|work=Business Insider|date=November 13, 2017|access-date=November 14, 2017|archive-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202624/http://uk.businessinsider.com/sophia-ai-robot-video-viral-future-tech-2017-11?r=US&IR=T|url-status=live}}</ref> At the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], a [[BBC News]] reporter described talking with Sophia as "a slightly awkward experience".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42616687|title=CES 2018: A clunky chat with Sophia the robot|work=BBC News|date=January 9, 2018|access-date=January 12, 2018|archive-date=January 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112001922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42616687|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2018, photographer Giulio Di Sturco did a photo shoot of Sophia which appeared in ''[[National Geographic]]''.{{sfnp|Greshko|2018}} ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' reported on the shoot.{{sfnp|Mallonee|2018}}

In 2019, Sophia participated as a speaker at ''[[Reflect Festival]]'', a technology event taking place in, Limassol, Cyprus. On stage, she was interviewed by Stefan van der Fluit and replied to written questions by the participants at the festival.

== Citizenship quandary ==
Saudi Arabia's move of granting citizenship to Sophia immediately raised questions, as commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry, or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder.{{sfnp|Maza|2017}}

While some sources characterized the move as a publicity stunt on the part of the Saudi government to promote the conference,{{sfnp|Vincent|2017}}{{sfnp|Maza|2017}} other sources have treated it seriously.{{sfnp|Reynolds|2018}} Tyler L. Jaynes writes that there was a "lack of universal acceptance of Sophia the Robot's citizenship and its portrayal and acceptance as a public relations stunt".{{sfnp|Jaynes|2021}} Jaynes goes on to note that "a refusal to seriously treat this event as being legitimate ''already'' displays the struggles that will be faced by patients undergoing surgical augmentation when integrating self-learning artificial intelligence systems (SLAIS) into their chemically organic forms."{{sfnp|Jaynes|2021}}

Simon Nease, writing in the ''Penn Political Review'', suggests that it was a competitive move on the part of Saudi Arabia to attract AI and robotics companies to the country, noting that "Japan has also made preliminary provisions for AI obtaining citizenship".{{sfnp|Nease|2020}} The [[British Council]] has published an article, "Should robots be citizens?", which notes that Sophia was issued a passport and goes on to address the "legal quandary" of robot citizenship.{{sfnp|British Council|2020}}

== Criticism ==
According to ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'', experts who have reviewed the robot's partially [[open-source]]{{sfnp|Jewell|2018}} code state that Sophia is best categorized as a chatbot with a face.<ref name=qz/>

According to ''[[The Verge]]'', Hanson has exaggerated Sophia's capacity for consciousness, for example by having said that Sophia is "basically alive",<ref name=verge/> which Verge writer James Vincent described as "grossly misleading".<ref name=verge/> In a piece produced by [[CNBC]] which indicates that their own interview questions for Sophia were heavily rewritten by its creators, Goertzel responds to the Hanson quote by suggesting Hanson means Sophia is "alive" in the way that, to a sculptor, a piece of sculpture becomes "alive" in the sculptor's eyes as the work nears completion.<ref name=CNBC/>

In January 2018, Facebook's director of artificial intelligence, [[Yann LeCun]], tweeted that Sophia was "complete bullshit" and slammed the media for giving coverage to "[[Potemkin village#Other uses|Potemkin]] AI".<ref name="bullshit">{{cite news |title=Facebook's AI boss described Sophia the robot as 'complete b------t' and 'Wizard-of-Oz AI' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ai-yann-lecun-sophia-robot-bullshit-2018-1 |access-date=January 7, 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=January 4, 2018 |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107070334/http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ai-yann-lecun-sophia-robot-bullshit-2018-1 |url-status=live }}</ref> In response, [[Ben Goertzel]], the former chief scientist for the company that made Sophia, stated he had never suggested that Sophia was close to human-level intelligence.<ref name="bullshit"/>

Goertzel has also acknowledged that it is "not ideal" that some think of Sophia as having human-equivalent intelligence, but argues Sophia's presentation conveys something unique to audiences, saying "If I show them a beautiful smiling robot face, then they get the feeling that [[Artificial general intelligence|AGI]] may indeed be nearby and viable"<ref name=verge/> and "None of this is what I would call AGI, but nor is it simple to get working. And it is absolutely cutting-edge in terms of dynamic integration of perception, action, and dialogue".<ref name=verge/>

==In popular culture==
Sophia has appeared in videos and music videos, including ''[[The White King (film)|The White King]]'', and as the lead female character in pop singer Leehom Wang's music video A.I.<ref>{{Citation|last=王力宏 Wang Leehom|title=王力宏 Leehom Wang《A.I. 愛》官方 Official MV|date=September 19, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DuqEL0ChQ|access-date=January 4, 2018|archive-date=March 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318191019/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4DuqEL0ChQ&feature=youtu.be&list=PUu2FqeCJmyxVEHS2PfZz8sw|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2022, Sophia collaborated with Italian artist [[Andrea Bonaceto]]. For this project, he created digital portraits of Sophia and her creators, which were then processed by Sophia's neural network to produce a unique output that evolved from Bonaceto’s original artworks. Bonaceto then created a series of NFTs as video loops displaying the evolution of the work, starting with Andrea drawings, morphing into the robot interpretation, and then transitioning back to Andrea’s work. The cornerstone piece of the release “Sophia Instantiation” was auctioned on NFT platform [[Nifty Gateway]] for $688,888.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NFT 'self-portrait' by Sophia the Robot sells for nearly $700,000 |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/25/nft-self-portrait-by-sophia-the-robot-sells-for-nearly-700k |access-date=2023-09-15 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>
