'''Professor Emma Hart,''' FRSE (born 1967) is an English computer scientist known for her work in [[Artificial immune system|artificial immune systems (AIS)]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[Optimisation (computer science)|optimisation]]. She is a professor of [[computational intelligence]] at [[Edinburgh Napier University]], editor-in-chief of the ''[[Evolutionary Computation (journal)|Journal of Evolutionary Computation]]'' (MIT Press), and D. Coordinator of the Future & Emerging Technologies (FET) Proactive Initiative, Fundamentals of Collective Adaptive Systems.

== Early life and education ==
Hart was born in [[Middlesbrough]], England in 1967.<ref name="Minervascientifica">{{cite web |title=Emma Hart: Bio-inspired computing |url=http://minervascientifica.co.uk/emma-hart/ |website=Minerva Scientifica |publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]], [[British Society for the History of Science]] |access-date=15 February 2019 |location=Edinburg, Scotland |date=6 November 2017}}</ref> In 1990 she graduated from the [[University of Oxford]] with a first class BA(Hons) in Chemistry. She then continued her studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence in 1994, followed by a PhD that explored the use of immunology as an inspiration for computing, examining a range of techniques applied to optimization and data classification problems.<ref name="Ishibuchi2015">{{cite book |editor-last=Ishibuchi |editor-first=Hisao |title=Computational Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZhgCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA138 |volume=II |year=2015 |publisher=[[UNESCO]], [[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|ELOSS Publishers Ltd.]] |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-78021-021-6 |pages=138}}</ref> Her dissertation was titled ''Immunology as a metaphor for computational information processing: Fact or fiction?,''<ref name="Dissertation">{{Cite book|last=Hart|first=Emma|date=2002|title=Immunology as a metaphor for computational information processing: fact or fiction?

== Career ==
In 2000 Hart took a position as a lecturer at [[Edinburgh Napier University]], and was promoted to a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]], [[Professor]], and in 2008 Chair in [[Natural Computation]].<ref name="Ishibuchi2015" /> She is now director of the [[Centre of Algorithms, Visualisation and Evolving Systems]] (CAVES) group in the School of Computing. She continues to research in the area of developing novel bio-inspired techniques for solving a range of real-world optimisation and classification problems,<ref name="RobotEvolutionProject">{{cite web |title=Autonomous robot evolution cradle to grave |url=https://www.napier.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-search/projects/autonomous-robot-evolution-cradle-to-grave |website=Edinburgh Napier University |language=en}}</ref> as well as exploring  the fundamental properties of immune-inspired computing through modelling and simulation.<ref name="Ishibuchi2015" /> She is also involved in editorial activity and currently occupies the position of Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Evolutionary Computation (journal)|Journal of Evolutionary Computation]]'' (MIT Press).<ref name="MIT2017">{{cite news |title=Welcome Emma Hart |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/welcome-emma-hart |access-date=21 February 2019 |work=The MIT Press |date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Emma|last1= Hart |first2=Barry|last2= Gardiner |title=Storm Damage to Forests Costs Billions – Here's How AI Can Help |url=http://www.brinknews.com/storm-damage-to-forests-costs-billions-heres-how-ai-can-help/ |access-date=15 February 2019 |agency=Marsh & McLennan Insights |newspaper=Brink News |date=29 May 2018 |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

Her interests lie in the area of [[bio-inspired computing]]''''',''''' in particular [[Artificial immune system|artificial immune systems (AIS)]]''.'' She also undertakes research in three main areas:'' ''[[Optimisation (computer science)|optimisation]]'','' [[Self-organization|self-organising/self-adaptive systems]]'', ''and [[artificial intelligence]]''.''

Hart is D. Coordinator of Fundamentals of Collective Adaptive Systems (FoCAS), a Future and Emerging Technologies Proactive Initiative funded by the European Commission under FP7.<ref name="AboutFoCAS">{{cite web |title=About FoCAS |url=http://www.focas.eu/about-focas/ |website=Fundamentals of Collective Adaptive Systems}}</ref>
