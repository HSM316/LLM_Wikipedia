'''Leela Zero''' is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[computer Go]] program released on 25 October 2017. It is developed by Belgian programmer [[Gian-Carlo Pascutto]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/09/c_137097436.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409062437/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/09/c_137097436.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2018|title=Feature: One man's Go program looks to remake AlphaGo Zero - and beyond|publisher=[[Xinhuanet]]|date=9 April 2018|access-date=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.xinhuanet.com/c/2018-02/05/c_1122370241.htm|title=围棋AI"丽拉"获赞接近职业棋手水准，它的作者竟是一个不太会下棋的程序员|publisher=[[Xinhuanet]]|date=5 February 2018|access-date=27 April 2018|language=zh}}</ref><ref name="Xinhuanet20180408">{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/sports/2018-04/08/c_1122648768.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409051235/http://www.xinhuanet.com/sports/2018-04/08/c_1122648768.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2018|title=更开放，更共享，比利时围棋AI"丽拉·元"重塑"阿尔法元"|publisher=[[Xinhuanet]]|date=8 April 2018|access-date=27 April 2018|language=zh}}</ref> the author of chess engine [[Sjeng (software)|Sjeng]] and Go engine [[Leela (software)|Leela]].<ref name="baduknews">{{cite web|url=http://baduknews.com/news/view.php?idx=236|title=프로 수준급 인공지능 바둑 프로그램 '릴라(Leela)' 무료 공개|publisher=Baduk News|language=Korean|date=23 February 2017|access-date=27 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706021721/http://baduknews.com/news/view.php?idx=236|archive-date=6 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberoro.com/board/oro_view.oro?bd_div=1&bd_num=16436|title=릴라의 출현과 온라인 대국의 비극적인 종말...|publisher=Cyberoro|date=3 March 2017|access-date=27 April 2018|language=Korean}}</ref> 

Leela Zero's algorithm is based on [[DeepMind]]'s 2017 paper about [[AlphaGo Zero]].<ref name="Xinhuanet20180408"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/gcp/leela-zero|title=leela-zero|publisher=[[GitHub]]|date=|access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>
Unlike the original Leela, which has a lot of human knowledge and heuristics programmed into it, the program code in Leela Zero only knows the basic rules and nothing more.  The knowledge that makes Leela Zero a strong player is contained in a [[artificial neural network|neural network]], which is trained based on the results of previous games that the program played.<ref name="egf interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogofed.org/?id=205| title=Gian-Carlo Pascutto - The man behind LeelaZero |publisher=[[European Go Federation]] |date=24 May 2018 |access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref>

Leela Zero is trained by a distributed effort, which is coordinated at the Leela Zero website. Members of the community provide computing resources by running the client, which generates [[Self-play (reinforcement learning technique)|self-play]] games and submits them to the server. The self-play games are used to train newer networks. Generally, over 500 clients have connected to the server to contribute resources.<ref name="egf interview"/> The community has provided high quality code contributions as well.<ref name="egf interview"/>

Leela Zero finished third at the BerryGenomics Cup World AI Go Tournament in [[Fuzhou]], [[Fujian]], China on 28 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/go/2018-04-28/doc-ifzvpatq5885312.shtml |title=世界AI大赛决赛腾讯内战 凤凰2-1绝艺夺冠|publisher=[[sina.com.cn]]|date=28 April 2018|access-date=28 April 2018|language=zh}} </ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' at the end of 2018 characterized Leela and Leela Zero as "the world’s most successful open-source Go engines".<ref>{{cite news |title=How the Artificial-Intelligence Program AlphaZero Mastered Its Games |url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/how-the-artificial-intelligence-program-alphazero-mastered-its-games |access-date=31 December 2018 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2018}}</ref>

In early 2018, another team branched [[Leela Chess Zero]] from the same code base, also to verify the methods in the [[AlphaZero]] paper as applied to the game of chess. AlphaZero's use of Google TPUs was replaced by a crowd-sourcing infrastructure and the ability to use graphics card GPUs via the OpenCL library. Even so, it is expected to take a year of crowd-sourced training to make up for the dozen hours that AlphaZero was allowed to train for its chess match in the paper.<ref name="SilverApril2018">{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Albert |title=Leela Chess Zero: AlphaZero for the PC |url=https://en.chessbase.com/post/leela-chess-zero-alphazero-for-the-pc |website=Chess News |access-date=11 June 2018 |date=26 April 2018}}</ref>
