'''rnn''' is an open-source [[machine learning]] framework that implements [[Recurrent Neural Network]] architectures, such as [[LSTM]] and [[gated recurrent unit|GRU]], natively in the [[R (programming language)|R]] programming language, that has been downloaded over 30,000 times (from the RStudio servers alone).<ref>{{Citation|last=Quast|first=Bastiaan|title=GitHub - bquast/rnn: Recurrent Neural Networks in R.|date=2019-08-30|url=https://github.com/bquast/rnn|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

The '''rnn''' package is distributed through the [[Comprehensive R Archive Network]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CRAN - Package rnn|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnn}}</ref> under the [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[GPL v3]] license.

== Workflow ==
The below example from the '''rnn''' documentation show how to train a recurrent neural network to solve the problem of bit-by-bit binary addition.

<source lang="rsplus">
> # install the rnn package, including the dependency sigmoid
> install.packages('rnn')

> # load the rnn package
> library(rnn)

> # create input data 
> X1 = sample(0:127, 10000, replace=TRUE)
> X2 = sample(0:127, 10000, replace=TRUE)

> # create output data
> Y <- X1 + X2

> # convert from decimal to binary notation 
> X1 <- int2bin(X1, length=8)
> X2 <- int2bin(X2, length=8)
> Y  <- int2bin(Y,  length=8)

> # move input data into single tensor
> X <- array( c(X1,X2), dim=c(dim(X1),2) )

> # train the model
> model <- trainr(Y=Y,
+                 X=X,
+                 learningrate   =  1,
+                 hidden_dim     = 16  )
Trained epoch: 1 - Learning rate: 1
Epoch error: 0.839787019539748

== sigmoid ==
The [[sigmoid function]]s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package '''sigmoid''', with the intention to enable more general use. The '''sigmoid''' package is a dependency of the '''rnn''' package and therefore automatically installed with it.<ref>{{cite web|title=CRAN - Package sigmoid|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=sigmoid}}</ref>

== Reception ==
With the release of version 0.3.0 in April 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/bquast/rnn/releases/tag/0.3.0|title=bquast/rnn|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref> the use in production and research environments became more widespread. The package was reviewed several months later on the R blog The Beginner Programmer as "R provides a simple and very user friendly package named '''rnn''' for working with recurrent neural networks.",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/08/plain-vanilla-recurrent-neural-networks.html|title=The Beginner Programmer: Plain vanilla recurrent neural networks in R: waves prediction|last=Mic|date=2016-08-05|website=The Beginner Programmer|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref> which further increased usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6964/lstm-or-other-rnn-package-for-r|title=LSTM or other RNN package for R|website=Data Science Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>

The book [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/ Neural Networks in R] by Balaji Venkateswaran and Giuseppe Ciaburro uses '''rnn''' to demonstrate [[recurrent neural networks]] to R users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/9219bb11-a546-4e48-aa5f-689cc720228e.xhtml|title=Neural Networks with R|last=|first=|date=September 2017|work=Neural Networks with R|access-date=2018-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002130929/https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/9219bb11-a546-4e48-aa5f-689cc720228e.xhtml|archive-date=2018-10-02|publisher=O'Reilly|language=en|isbn=9781788397872}}</ref>

The RStudio CRAN mirror download logs
<ref>{{cite web|title=RStudio CRAN logs|url=http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/}}</ref> show that the package is downloaded on average about 1000 per month from those servers
,<ref>{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/rnn}}</ref> with a total of over 20,000 downloads since the first release
,<ref>{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/rnn}}</ref> according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 15th percentile of most popular R packages
