'''rnn''' is an open-source [[machine learning]] framework that implements [[recurrent neural network]] architectures, such as [[LSTM]] and [[gated recurrent unit|GRU]], natively in the [[R (programming language)|R]] programming language, that has been downloaded over 100,000 times (from the RStudio servers alone).<ref>{{Citation|last=Quast|first=Bastiaan|title=GitHub - bquast/rnn: Recurrent Neural Networks in R.|date=2019-08-30|url=https://github.com/bquast/rnn|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

The '''rnn''' package is distributed through the [[Comprehensive R Archive Network]]<ref>{{Citation|last1=Quast|first1=Bastiaan|title=rnn: Recurrent Neural Network|date=2019-05-27|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105091006/https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnn/index.html|access-date=2020-01-05|archive-date=2020-01-05|last2=Fichou|first2=Dimitri}}</ref> under the [[Open-source software|open-source]] [[GPL v3]] license.

== Workflow ==
[[File:Rnn demonstration.gif|thumb|Demonstration of RNN package]]
The below example from the '''rnn''' documentation show how to train a recurrent neural network to solve the problem of bit-by-bit binary addition.

<syntaxhighlight lang="rout">
> # install the rnn package, including the dependency sigmoid

> # load the rnn package

== sigmoid ==
The [[sigmoid function]]s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package '''sigmoid''', with the intention to enable more general use. The '''sigmoid''' package is a dependency of the '''rnn''' package and therefore automatically installed with it.<ref>{{Citation|last=Quast|first=Bastiaan|title=sigmoid: Sigmoid Functions for Machine Learning|date=2018-06-21|url=https://cran.r-project.org/package=sigmoid|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105091653/https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sigmoid/index.html|access-date=2020-01-05|archive-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>

== Reception ==
With the release of version 0.3.0 in April 2016<ref>{{Citation|last=Quast|first=Bastiaan|title=RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks in R releases|date=2020-01-03|url=https://github.com/bquast/rnn|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> the use in production and research environments became more widespread. The package was reviewed several months later on the R blog The Beginner Programmer as "R provides a simple and very user friendly package named '''rnn''' for working with recurrent neural networks.",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/08/plain-vanilla-recurrent-neural-networks.html|title=The Beginner Programmer: Plain vanilla recurrent neural networks in R: waves prediction|last=Mic|date=2016-08-05|website=The Beginner Programmer|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105085817/http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/08/plain-vanilla-recurrent-neural-networks.html|archive-date=2020-01-05|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> which further increased usage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6964/lstm-or-other-rnn-package-for-r|title=LSTM or other RNN package for R|website=Data Science Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>

The RStudio CRAN mirror download logs
<ref>{{cite web|title=RStudio CRAN logs|url=http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/}}</ref> show that the package is downloaded on average about 2,000 per month from those servers
,<ref>{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/rnn}}</ref> with a total of over 100,000 downloads since the first release,<ref>{{cite web|title=CRANlogs rnn package|url=https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/rnn}}</ref> according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 15th percentile of most popular R packages
