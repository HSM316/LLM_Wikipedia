'''Mila - Quebec AI Institute''' (originally ''Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms'') is a research institute in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], focusing mainly on [[machine learning]] research. Approximately 500 researchers, including faculty and students, were part of Mila in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mila.quebec/mila/|website=mila.quebec|language=en|access-date=2020-07-26|title=Mila website}}</ref>

== History ==
Mila was founded as ''Laboratoire d'informatique des systèmes adaptatifs'' (LISA)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Laboratoire d'Informatique des Systèmes Adaptatifs|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/lisa-francais.html|access-date=2020-08-11|website=www.iro.umontreal.ca}}</ref> at the [[Université de Montréal]] in 1993 by [[Yoshua Bengio]], a [[Turing award]] winner and one of the founders of the field of [[deep learning]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/media-center/2019/march/turing-award-2018|title=Fathers of the Deep Learning revolution receive 2018 ACM A.M.

Since 2017, Mila is the result of a partnership between the Université de Montréal and [[McGill University]] with [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]] and [[HEC Montréal]].

In December 2020, Mila teamed up with [[IBM]] to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning research using open-source technology in a bid to integrate the Quebec institute’s open-source software, Oríon, with IBM’s Watson Machine Learning Accelerator, an AI model training and inference tool that the tech giant offers to businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-11|title=Mila, IBM collaborating on open-source AI and machine learning project {{!}} BetaKit|url=https://betakit.com/mila-ibm-collaborating-on-open-source-ai-and-machine-learning-project/|access-date=2020-12-19|language=en-CA}}</ref>

== Notable researchers ==
Besides Bengio, Mila's faculty members include [[Joëlle Pineau]] and [[Doina Precup]]. Some of its graduates include [[Hugo Larochelle]] and [[Ian Goodfellow]].

== Research activities ==
Research at Mila is largely, but not exclusively focused on [[deep learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]]. Specific research topics include:
* [[generative model]]s
* [[natural language processing]]
* [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]]
* [[computer vision]]
* [[reinforcement learning]]
* applications of AI, including: [[climate change research]] and [[COVID-19]] research.

== Other activities ==
Mila is both a research and educational institution, providing [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoc]] and [[internship]] positions, and granting [[PhD]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degrees in [[machine learning]].

Mila members have also contributed to [[open-source software]]. [[Theano (software)|Theano]], one of the early programming frameworks for [[deep learning]] originated at Mila. In 2020, active projects included myia, a deep learning framework for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and baby-ai, a platform for simulating language learning with a human in the loop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mila-iqia|website=github.com|language=en|access-date=2020-07-26|title=Mila Github Page}}</ref>

In addition, Mila is also involved in numerous partnerships with private companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mila.quebec/mila/partenaires-industriels/|website=mila.quebec|language=en|access-date=2020-07-26|title=Mila industrial partner list}}</ref>
