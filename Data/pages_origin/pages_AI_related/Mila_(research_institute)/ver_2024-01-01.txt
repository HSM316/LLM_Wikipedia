'''Mila - Quebec AI Institute''' (originally ''Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms'') is a research institute in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], focusing mainly on [[machine learning]] research. Approximately 1000 students and researchers and 100 faculty members, were part of Mila in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mila.quebec/en/mila/|website=mila.quebec|language=en|access-date=2022-06-20|title=Mila website}}</ref> Along with Alberta's [[Amii (research institute)]] and Toronto's [[Vector Institute (Canada)]], Mila is part of the [[Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cifar.ca/ai/|website=cifar.ca/ai|language=en|access-date=2023-03-21|title=CIFAR AI Strategy}}</ref>

== History ==
Mila traces its foundations to the ''Laboratoire d'informatique des systèmes adaptatifs'' (LISA) <ref>{{Cite web|title=Laboratoire d'Informatique des Systèmes Adaptatifs|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/lisa-francais.html|access-date=2020-08-11|website=www.iro.umontreal.ca}}</ref> at the [[Université de Montréal]] and to the Reasoning and Learning Lab (RL-Lab)<ref>url=http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/index.html</ref> at [[McGill University]]. LISA was founded in 1993 by [[Yoshua Bengio]], a [[Turing award]] winner and one of the founders of the field of [[deep learning]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/media-center/2019/march/turing-award-2018|title=Fathers of the Deep Learning revolution receive 2018 ACM A.M.

In 2017, Mila was established as a partnership between the [[Université de Montréal]] and [[McGill University]] with [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]] and [[HEC Montréal]].

In December 2020, Mila teamed up with [[IBM]] to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning research using open-source technology in a bid to integrate the Quebec institute’s open-source software, Oríon, with IBM’s Watson Machine Learning Accelerator, an AI model training and inference tool that the tech giant offers to businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-11|title=Mila, IBM collaborating on open-source AI and machine learning project {{!}} BetaKit|url=https://betakit.com/mila-ibm-collaborating-on-open-source-ai-and-machine-learning-project/|access-date=2020-12-19|language=en-CA}}</ref>

== Notable researchers ==
Besides Bengio, Mila's faculty members include [[Joëlle Pineau]] and [[Doina Precup]]. Some of its graduates include Marc Bellemare (MSc 2007 - RL-Lab), [https://mila.quebec/en/person/hugo-larochelle/ Hugo Larochelle] (PhD 2009 - LISA) and [[Ian Goodfellow]] (PhD 2014 - LISA).

== Research activities ==
Research at Mila is largely, but not exclusively focused on [[deep learning]] and [[reinforcement learning]]. Specific research topics include:
* [[generative model]]s
* [[natural language processing]]
* [[Meta learning (computer science)|meta learning]]
* [[computer vision]]
* [[reinforcement learning]]
* applications of AI, including: [[climate change research]] and [[COVID-19]] research.
