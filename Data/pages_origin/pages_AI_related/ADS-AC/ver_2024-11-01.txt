'''ADS-AC''' is an experimental [[open-source model|open source]] program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System (ADS), a proposed mechanism for [[Artificial consciousness|artificial consciousness (AC)]].

This article is not about a claim, but about a software that does things in a certain way. Whether it's the right way can be decided by the user.

==Implementation==
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.
