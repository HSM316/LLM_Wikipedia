'''SolveIT Software Pty Ltd''' is a provider of [[advanced planning and scheduling]] [[enterprise software]] for [[supply and demand]] optimisation and [[predictive modelling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdsinternational.com/Blog/Details/36/SolveIT-Software-to-Attend-the-Next-Generation-Oil|title=SolveIT Software to Attend the Next Generation Oil & Gas Summit, ANZ 2012|publisher=GDS International|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> Based in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], 70% of its turnover is generated from software deployed in the [[mining]] and [[bulk material handling]] sectors.<ref name=Mine/>

==History==
The company was set up in 2005 by four academics who were also experienced business people, all recent immigrants to [[Australia]]. The team was headed by ex-[[Ernst and Young]] consultant [[Matthew Michalewicz]], who had moved to Adelaide in 2004 after selling his last company, [[NuTech]].<ref name=AdNowRec/> The other three partners were [[Zbigniew Michalewicz | Zbigniew Michalewicz Ph.D]], Martin Schmidt and Constantin Chiriac, all four of which were co-authors of the book ''Adaptive Business Intelligence®''.<ref name=ABI>{{cite book|title=Adaptive Business Intelligence®|author=Zbigniew Michalewicz, Martin Schmidt, [[Matthew Michalewicz]], Constantin Chiriac|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|date=10 Nov 2006|ISBN=3540329285}}</ref>

The company first developed an optimization and predictive modeling platform based on [[Artificial Intelligence]],<ref name=ABI/> and then built its supply chain applications for planning, scheduling, and demand forecasting on this platform. Early customers included [[Orlando Wines]], [[ABB Grain]], the [[Treasury Wine Estates|Fosters wine brands]] and later [[Pernod Ricard]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istart.com.au/index/HM20/AL211017/AR211607|title=Pernod Ricard picks SolveIT Software for planning and scheduling|publisher=iStart.com.au|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> that were also located in the [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley region]].<ref name=AdNowRec/>

In 2008, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] [[Iron Ore]] asked the company to improve its mining planning and scheduling operations based at [[Pilbara]]. SolveIT succeeded in applying its advanced planning and scheduling product, based on non-linear optimization, to the Rio Tinto mine scheduling problem, after many other vendors had failed over a period of ten years.<ref name=AdNowRec/>

With 30 employees at this point, it then won an additional contract in the mining sector with [[BHP Billiton]]/[[Mitsubishi]] Alliance Coal,<ref name=AdNowRec/><ref name=Mine/> leading to subsequent tender wins in the sector, including: [[BHP Billiton]]; [[CBH Group]]; [[Fortescue Metals Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/412582|title=SolveIT Software Goes Live on Time and on Budget at Fortescue Metals Group for Mine-to-Port Supply Chain Optimisation|publisher=pr.com|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> [[Hills Holdings]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsholdings.com.au/en/News/SolveIT|title=Team Poly signs contract with SolveIT Software for Transportation |publisher=[[Hills Holdings]]|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> [[Pacific National|Pacific National Coal]];<ref name=ABI/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://adaptivebusinessintelligence.com/|title=Adaptive Business Intelligence®|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|date=10 Nov 2006|accessdate=2012-07-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721034826/http://www.adaptivebusinessintelligence.com/|archivedate=21 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Xstrata Coal]].<ref name=AdNowRec/><ref name=AboutUs/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-279242381.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610062216/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-279242381.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2014|title=SolveIT Software Pty Ltd signs contract with Xstrata Coal Queensland|publisher=International Resource News|date=7 February 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>

On 3 September 2012, SolveIT announced it was acquired by [[Schneider Electric]], a global specialist in energy management.<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schneider-electric-acquires-solveit-software-168332406.html</ref>

==Operations==
Headquartered in Adelaide, the company has over 150 staff based across operational offices in:<ref name=AboutUs/> [[Melbourne]]; [[Brisbane]]; [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]; and [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].<ref name=Contact>{{cite web|url=http://www.solveitsoftware.com/contact_us/contact|title=Contact Us|publisher=SolveIT Software|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>

The company develops [[advanced planning and scheduling]] business optimisation software, which helps manage complex operations using artificial intelligence. Most of the products were initially developed around the key [[South Australia]]n industries of [[wine]] and [[grain]] handling, and today SolveIt has a specialist [[mining]] division due to early adoption of the company's software within the mining market.<ref name=Mine/> The software helps companies accurately predict and plan their [[Production (economics)|production]], [[supply chain]], [[shipping]] and [[currency]] [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].<ref name=AdNowRec/><ref name=AboutUs>{{cite web|url=http://www.solveitsoftware.com/Company/about|title=About Us|publisher=SolveIT Software|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

Due to the scientific optimisation components embedded in the company’s software products, it sometimes uses a prize-based system to [[recruitment|recruit]] the required high-level of talent. In 2011, the company used a [[Magic square]] problem, won by [[University of Nottingham]] graduate Yuri Bykov, who developed a program which solved a constrained version of a 2600 by 2600 magic square within a minute.<ref name=AdNowRec>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/solveit-software-is-wining-and-mining/story-e6frede3-1226239867515|title=SolveIT Software is wining and mining|author=Cameron England|publisher=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=9 January 2012|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>

In 2011, the company won the Australian National iAward in the e-Logistics and Supply Chain category for its [[Supply Chain]] Network Optimiser (SCNO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmagazine.com.au/news/solveit-software-wins-the-national-iaward-for-e-lo|title=SolveIT Software wins the National iAward for e-Logistics and Supply Chain Management|publisher=Logistics & Materials Handling magazine|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> In February 2012, SolveIT and [[Schneider Electric]] became co-organisers of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120414105633/http://www.ipos2012.com/ Integrated Planning and Optimisation Summit], held at the [[Adelaide Convention Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tia.asn.au/news/media-activity/schneider,-solveit-to-host-planning-and-optimisation-summit|title=Schneider, SolveIT to host Planning and Optimisation Summit|publisher=Technology Industry Association|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>
