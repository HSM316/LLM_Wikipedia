'''''The Outer Limits''''' is a Canadian-American [[television series]] that originally aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[Syfy]] and in syndication between 1995 and 2002. The series is a [[List of old television series that were returned to after years|revival]] of the original ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' series that aired from 1963–65.

''The Outer Limits'' is an [[anthology series|anthology]] of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a [[plot twist]] at the end. The revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring [[story arc]]s that were then tied together during season-finale [[clip show]]s. 

==History==
After an attempt to bring back ''The Outer Limits'' during the early 1980s, it was finally relaunched in 1995. The success of television [[speculative fiction]] such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and anthology shows such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' convinced rights holder [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to revive ''The Outer Limits''. A deal was made with Trilogy Productions, the company behind such cinema hits as ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''. The show would run on the pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] (Trilogy, a Los Angeles- and Canada-based company, is credited with creating the 1995 series).<ref name=trilogy1>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+Worldwide+Television+and+Trilogy+Entertainment+Group+enter...-a019111727|title=MGM Worldwide Television and Trilogy Entertainment Group enter exclusive, multiyear television deal.|date=1997-02-07}}</ref><ref name=trilogycanada>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |title=Speakers – Toronto Screenwriting Conference |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118191525/http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}<!-- page gives 2016 speakers --></ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pen-densham/9/9bb/393|title=Pen Densham|access-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref>

The episodes appeared in syndication the following season (the same arrangement as MGM/Showtime series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]''). It continued on Showtime until 2001, when [[Syfy|Sci-Fi]] quietly took over production for the seventh and final season. As a result, that season, unlike the previous ones, was completely free of any swearing or nudity. It was canceled in 2002, after a total of 154 episodes—far more than the original incarnation of the show.<ref name="GarciaPhillips2008">{{cite book|author1=Frank Garcia|author2=Mark Phillips|title=Science Fiction Television Series, 1990-2004: Histories, Casts and Credits for 58 Shows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQIDAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169|date=10 December 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9183-4|pages=169–}}</ref> In the revived show, the Control Voice was supplied by [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]. The new series distanced itself from the "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]" mandate that had characterized the original series from its inception; while there were plenty of aliens and monsters, they dramatize a specific scientific concept and its effect on humanity.<ref name="Westfahl2005">{{cite book|author=Gary Westfahl|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_3kNDKhxIcC&pg=PA1193|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32953-1|pages=1193–}}</ref> Examples of this include "[[Dark Rain (The Outer Limits)|Dark Rain]]" (biochemical warfare causing worldwide sterility), "[[Final Exam (The Outer Limits)|Final Exam]]" (discovery of practical cold fusion power), "[[A Stitch in Time (The Outer Limits)|A Stitch in Time]]" (a time traveler tinkers with history), as well as two episodes revolving around a human mutation known as Genetic Rejection Syndrome (humans mutating into violent creatures) as a result of an outlawed eugenics attempt to create superior children.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Production==
The series was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Stories by [[Harlan Ellison]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Eando Binder]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[George R.R. Martin]], [[Stephen King]], and [[James Patrick Kelly]] were adapted.

[[Leslie Stevens]] was a program consultant for the first four seasons (until his death), while [[Joseph Stefano]] served as an executive consultant and later senior advisor throughout the whole series. Stefano also remade his episode "[[A Feasibility Study]]", retitling it "[[Feasibility Study (The Outer Limits)|Feasibility Study]]" for the third season. [[John Van Tongeren]] and [[Mark Mancina]] composed new music different from that of Dominic Frontiere and Harry Lubin. [[John Van Tongeren]] scored ten episodes for the first season and continued through season 6. The musical theme for the modern ''Outer Limits'' series is credited to John Van Tongeren and Mark Mancina.

In most seasons there was a [[clip show]] that intertwines the plots of several of the show's episodes (see "[[The Voice of Reason]]" for an example). At each [[television commercial|commercial]] interval, the Control Voice can be heard saying "The Outer Limits...please stand by".

A number of episodes from seasons 1–6 feature nudity and other adult content. Though originally broadcast uncensored, those episodes have been edited for commercial syndication.

Season 1 was released uncut and with extra features on DVD in the US (MGM, 2005), UK ([[20th Century Fox]], 2007) and Germany (Fox/MGM, 2008). Because sales of the set did not meet expectations no further seasons were released.
