'''''Sunspring''''' is a 2016 [[experimental film|experimental]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] short film entirely written by an [[artificial intelligence]] bot using [[neural networks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thereforefilms.com/sunspring.html|title = Sunspring}}</ref> It was conceived by [[BAFTA]]-nominated filmmaker [[Oscar Sharp]] and [[NYU]] AI researcher [[Ross Goodwin]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nofilmschool.com/2016/06/sunspring-algorithm-wrote-sci-fi-movie | title=An Algorithm Wrote This Movie, and It's Somehow Amazing | publisher=No Film School | date=June 10, 2016 | accessdate=June 13, 2016 | author=Buder, Emily}}</ref><ref name="Ars">{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2016/06/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/ | title=Movie written by algorithm turns out to be hilarious and intense | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=June 9, 2016 | accessdate=June 13, 2016 | author=Newitz, Annalee}}</ref> and produced by film production company, End Cue along with Allison Friedman and Andrew Swett. It stars [[Thomas Middleditch]], Elisabeth Grey, and [[Humphrey Ker]] as three people, namely H, H2, and C, living in a future world and eventually connecting with each other through a [[love triangle]]. The script of the film was authored by a recurrent neural network called [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) by an AI bot named Benjamin.

Originally made for the [[Sci-Fi-London]] film festival's 48hr Challenge, it was released online by technology news website [[Ars Technica]] on 9 June 2016.<ref name="Ars"/>

== Premise ==
''Sunspring'' narrates the story of three people - H (Middleditch), H2 (Grey), and C (Ker) - set in a futuristic world and entangled with murder and love.<ref name="Script"/>

== Cast ==
* [[Thomas Middleditch]] as H
* Elisabeth Grey as H2
* [[Humphrey Ker]] as C

== Production ==
Oscar Sharp originally created the film for the 48hr Film Challenge contest of [[Sci-Fi-London]], a film festival which focuses on science fiction. For the challenge, contestants are given a set of prompts (mostly props and lines) that have to appear in a movie they make over the next two days. It eventually contested in the festival and was nominated among the final top ten films<ref name="Ars" />

Sharp collaborated with his longtime associate Ross Goodwin, an AI researcher in [[New York University]] to create the AI bot, which was initially called Jetson. The bot, which later came to call itself Benjamin, wrote the screenplay including stage directions and dialog.<ref name="Script">{{cite book | url=https://www.docdroid.net/lCZ2fPA/sunspring-final.pdf.html | title=Sunspring Final | publisher=DocDroid | author=Benjamin | year=2016 | location=American | pages=5}}</ref> The garbled script was then interpreted by Sharp who directed the actors to construe the plot points themselves and enact the play. According to Ars Technica, the final plot turned out to be a tale of romance and murder, set in a dark future world.<ref name="Ars" />

=== Benjamin, the automatic screenwriter ===
Called the world's first automatic screenwriter, Benjamin is a self-improving LSTM RNN machine intelligence trained on human screenplays conceived by Goodwin and Sharp. It was trained to write the screenplay by feeding it with a corpus of dozens of sci-fi screenplays found onlineâ€”mostly movies from the 1980s and 90s.<ref name="Ars" />

== Music ==
The film contains a song from [[Brooklyn]]-based electro-acoustic duo Tiger and Man, with lyrics written by Benjamin using a database of 30,000 folk songs. As well as a score written by composer Andrew Orkin.<ref name="Ars" />

== Reception ==
[[CNet]] called it "a beautiful, bizarre sci-fi novelty." Critic Amanda Kooser said, "...probably won't start a rush for replacing human screenwriters with machines. Some day, neural networks may get better at imitating the art of coherent storytelling, but we're not there yet. That doesn't mean "Sunspring" isn't entertaining or worthy of viewing. It is. It's a thought experiment come to life, a novelty."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/ai-written-film-sunspring-a-surreal-delight-upchucked-eyeball-included/ | title=AI-written film 'Sunspring' a surreal delight, upchucked eyeball included | publisher=CNet | date=13 June 2016 | accessdate=June 14, 2016 | author=Kooser, Amanda}}</ref> As of April [[2019 in film|2019]], it has surpassed 1 million views on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/arstechnicavideos/videos/mostviewed|title=Ars Technica Statistics|website=Social Blade}}</ref>
