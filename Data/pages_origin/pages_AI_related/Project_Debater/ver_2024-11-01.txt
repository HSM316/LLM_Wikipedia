'''Project Debater''' is an [[IBM]] [[artificial intelligence]] project, designed to participate in a full live debate with expert human debaters.<ref name="guardian" /><ref name="bloomberg" /><ref name="bbc" /><ref name="bbc2" /> It follows on from the [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] project which played ''[[Jeopardy!]]''<ref name="cnet" />

== Development ==
Project Debater was developed at [[IBM]]'s lab in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].<ref name="cnet" /> The project was proposed by Noam Slonim in 2011 as the IBM Research next Grand Challenge, following [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] and the victory of Watson in ''Jeopardy!''<ref name="verge" /><ref name="nyt" /> It was exposed for the first time in a closed media event at June 18, 2018, in San Francisco, under the leadership of Ranit Aharonov and Slonim, both from the IBM Research lab in Haifa, Israel.<ref name="fastcompany" /> The AI technology debated two human debaters, Noa Ovadia, who was the 2016 Israeli debate champion and Dan Zafrir. The two debated on the topics "We should subsidize space exploration"<ref name="engadget" /> and "Should we increase the use of telemedicine."<ref name="usatoday" />

A demonstration of Project Debater also aired on the Discovery Channel in June 2018 debating the question of whether sports gambling should be legalized.<ref>Discovery Channel.

== Live Debate ==
On February 11, 2019, Project Debater was revealed to the world in a live debate in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Live Debate - IBM Project Debater |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3u-1yttrVw |access-date=April 26, 2022 |website=Intelligence Squared U.S. YouTube Channel| date=11 February 2019 }}</ref> Nonpartisan media group [[Intelligence Squared U.S. Debates]] hosted the debate which was moderated by journalist [[John Donvan]]. The debate took place between Project Debater and Harish Natarajan, who holds the world record in number of debate competition victories. The motion was “We should subsidize preschools.”<ref>{{Cite news |last=IBM Research Editorial Staff |date=February 12, 2019 |title=Think 2019 Kicks Off with Live Debate Between Man and Machine |work=IBM |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/02/ai-debate-recap-think-2019/ |access-date=April 26, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Live Debate - IBM Project Debater |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3u-1yttrVw |access-date=April 26, 2022 |website=Intelligence Squared U.S. YouTube Channel| date=11 February 2019 }}</ref><ref name="vox">{{cite news |last1=Samuel|first1=Sigal|title=An AI system competed against a human debate champion.

== That's Debatable Television Show ==
Project Debater was featured in a television series called “That’s Debatable” presented by [[Intelligence Squared U.S. Debates]] and [[Bloomberg Media]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 3, 2020 |title=Bloomberg Media and Intelligence Squared U.S. present a new limited debate series "That's Debatable" hosted by Award-Winning Journalist and Moderator John Donvan and featuring AI from IBM Watson |work=Bloomberg Media |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bloomberg-media-and-intelligence-squared-us-present-a-new-limited-debate-series-thats-debatable-hosted-by-award-winning-journalist-and-moderator-john-donvan-and-featuring-ai-from-ibm-watson-301123833.html |access-date=April 3, 2022}}</ref> For each episode of “That’s Debatable,” Project Debater provided insight into three distinct debate topics on the [[redistribution of wealth]], modern monetary theory, and a US-China space race.<ref>{{Cite news |title=AI Can Now Debate With Humans and Sometimes Convince Them Too |work=Scientific American |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/ai-can-now-debate-with-humans-and-sometimes-convince-them-too/ }}</ref> More than 5,000 arguments were submitted online from around the world across the three topics, which were then analyzed and distilled into key points that were highlighted on the television show and discussed by human debaters.<ref>{{Cite news |title=IBM showcases latest A.I. advancements on "That's Debatable" TV show |work=Fortune |url=https://fortune.com/2020/10/09/ibm-ai-advancements-bloomberg-thats-debatable-clinton-administration/ |access-date=October 9, 2020}}</ref>

== Artificial Intelligence Capabilities ==
To develop Project Debater, the IBM Research team had to endow the system<ref name="ibm" /> with the following AI capabilities:

* Data-driven speech writing and delivery: Project Debater is the first demonstration of a computer that can digest massive corpora, and given a short description of a controversial topic, write a well-structured speech, and deliver it with clarity and purpose, while even incorporating humor where appropriate.
* Listening comprehension: the ability to identify the key concepts and claims hidden within long continuous spoken language.<ref name="emnlp" />
* Four minutes of persuasive speech: the guarantee of producing four minutes of persuasive speech.<ref name="howitworks" />
* Modeling human dilemmas: modeling the world of human controversy and dilemmas in a unique [[knowledge representation]], enabling the system to suggest principled arguments as needed.

An article on the project was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 2021.<ref name="nature" />
