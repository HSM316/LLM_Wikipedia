<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
'''Artificial wisdom''' is a [[software system]] that can demonstrate one or more qualities of being [[wikt:wise|wise]].

Artificial wisdom can be described as [[artificial intelligence]] reaching the top-level of decision-making when confronted with the most complex challenging situations.<ref>{{cite book | title=Studies in Computational Intelligence | chapter=Intelligent Decision Making: An AI-Based Approach | publisher=Springer | year=2008 | volume=97 | isbn=978-3-540-76828-9 | issn=1860-949X | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-76829-6 | page=}}</ref> The term artificial wisdom is used when the "intelligence" is based on more than by chance collecting and interpreting data, but by design<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suarez | first1 = Juan Francisco | title = Wise by Design: A Wisdom-Based Framework for Innovation and Organizational Design and its Potential Application in the Future of Higher Education | year = 2014 | pages = 131 | journal = Dissertations & Theses Antioch University | url = http://aura.antioch.edu/etds/131}}</ref> enriched with smart and conscience strategies that wise people would use.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Feng-Hsu | title = Personalized recommendation for web-based learning based on ant colony optimization with segmented-goal and meta-control strategies | year = 2011 | pages = 2054–2059 | journal = IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems | doi = 10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007628 | isbn = 978-1-4244-7315-1 | s2cid = 33702266 }}</ref>

The worries about the future with artificial intelligence is bend to a more positive perspective when considering computer-aided wisdom; the collaboration between artificial intelligence and [[contemplative neuroscience]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Karamjit | first1 = Gill | title = Citizens and netizens: a contemplation on ubiquitous technology | year = 2013 | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–132 | journal =  AI & Society| doi = 10.1007/s00146-013-0451-5 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
