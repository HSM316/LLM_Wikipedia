The '''International Conference on Learning Representations''' ('''ICLR''') is a [[machine learning]] [[Academic conference|conference]] typically held in late April or early May each year. Along with [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NeurIPS]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]], it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] research.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Artificial Intelligence - Google Scholar Metrics |url=https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence |access-date=2024-07-10 |website=scholar.google.es}}</ref>

The conference includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers. Since its inception in 2013, ICLR has employed an [[open peer review]] process to referee paper submissions (based on models proposed by [[Yann LeCun]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yann.lecun.com/ex/pamphlets/publishing-models.html|title=Proposal for A New Publishing Model in Computer Science|website=yann.lecun.com}}</ref>). In 2019, there were 1591 paper submissions, of which 500 accepted with poster presentations (31%) and 24 with oral presentations (1.5%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2019/Conference|title=ICLR 2019 Conference|website=openreview.net}}</ref> In 2021, there were 2997 paper submissions, of which 860 were accepted (29%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference|title=ICLR 2021 Conference|website=openreview.net}}</ref>
