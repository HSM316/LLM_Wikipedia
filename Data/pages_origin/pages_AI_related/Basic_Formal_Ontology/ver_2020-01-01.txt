'''Basic Formal Ontology''' ('''BFO''') is a [[Upper ontology|top-level ontology]] developed by [[Barry Smith (academic)|Barry Smith]] and his associates for the purposes of promoting interoperability among domain ontologies built in its terms through a process of downward population.<ref name="BFO">{{cite web |url=http://basic-formal-ontology.org/ |title=Home |website=Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) |accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>  A guide to building BFO-conformant domain ontologies was published by MIT Press in 2015.<ref>Arp, R., Smith, B., and Spear, A. D. ''[http://mitpress.mit.edu/building-ontologies Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology]'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, August 2015, xxiv + 220pp.</ref> 

The structure of BFO is based on a division of entities into two disjoint categories of ''continuant'' and ''occurrent'', the former comprehending for example objects and spatial regions, the latter comprehending processes conceived as extended through (or as spanning) time. BFO thereby seeks to consolidate both time and space within a single framework.

==Applications==

BFO has been adopted as a foundational ontology by over 300 ontology projects,<ref>{{cite web |title=Users |url=http://basic-formal-ontology.org/users.html |website=Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) |accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref> principally in the areas of biomedical ontology and security and defense (intelligence) ontology.<ref name="BFO"/> An example application of BFO can be seen in the [[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations]] (OBI) and in the [[Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry]].
