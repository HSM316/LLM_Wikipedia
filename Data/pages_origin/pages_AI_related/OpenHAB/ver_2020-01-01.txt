'''open Home Automation Bus''' ('''openHAB''') is an open source home automation software written in [[Java_(programming_language)|Java]]. It is deployed on premise and connects to devices and services from different vendors. As of 2019, close to 300 bindings are available as [[OSGi]] modules.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.openhab.org/addons/ |publisher=openHAB Foundation e.V. |title=openHAB Add-on Reference |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> Actions, such as switching on lights, are triggered by rules, voice commands, or controls on the openHAB user interface.
The openHAB project started in 2010. In 2013, the core functionality became an official project of the [[Eclipse_Foundation|Eclipse Foundation]] under the name Eclipse SmartHome.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/ |title=Eclipse SmartHome - A Flexible Framework for the Smart Home |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> openHAB is based on Eclipse SmartHome and remains the project for the development of bindings.
According to [[Open_Hub|Black Duck Open Hub]], it is developed by one of the largest open-source teams in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Summary: Factoids - Open Hub |url=https://www.openhub.net/p/openhab/factoids |publisher=Black Duck Software, Inc. |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> It also has an active user community.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - openHAB Community |url=https://community.openhab.org/about |publisher=openHAB Foundation e.V. |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>

== Features ==

=== Installation and Runtime ===

openHAB requires a [[JVM]] and can be deployed on servers running various operating systems, a dedicated [[Raspberry_Pi|Raspberry Pi]] instance, or some [[Network-attached_storage|network-attached storage]] systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=PINE A64 is a $15, 'high-performance' take on the Raspberry Pi |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/09/pine-a64-64-bit-4k-maker-board/ |publisher=Engadget, Verizon Media |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to install openHAB 2 on Synology Diskstation |url=https://smarthome-training.com/en/how-to-install-openhab-2-on-synology-diskstation/ |publisher=Smarthome Training |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> The required bindings can be added at runtime via OSGi. openHAB supports a number of persistence backends for storing and querying the smart home data, including [[Relational_database|relational]] and [[Time_series_database|time series]] databases.

=== Discovery and Configuration ===

After installation, openHAB scans the local network and discovers devices that can be included in the smart home solution. Users can provide credentials and meaningful device names via an administration user interface.

=== Sitemaps ===

Sitemaps allow the user to determine how the devices in the smart home are arranged. A sitemap groups devices by floor and room and determines how they are visualized and controlled. The following example illustrates what a typical sitemap definition might look like:

<source>
sitemap demo label="My home automation" {
    Frame label="Date" {
        Text item=Date
    }
    Frame label="Demo" {
        Switch item=Lights icon="light"
        Text item=LR_Temperature label="Livingroom [%.1f °C]"
        Group item=Heating
        Text item=LR_Multimedia_Summary label="Multimedia [%s]" icon="video" {
            Selection item=LR_TV_Channel mappings=[0="off", 1="DasErste", 2="BBC One", 3="Cartoon Network"]
            Slider item=LR_TV_Volume
        }
    }
}
</source>

=== User Interface ===

Once the system is configured, openHAB users can view data and perform actions using a number of user interfaces. These include a browser based interface as well as apps for [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]], [[Windows_10|Windows 10]], and [[IOS|iOS]].<ref>{{cite web |title=openHAB - Apps on Google Play |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid&hl=en_US |publisher=Google Corporation |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=openHAB on the App Store |url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openhab/id492054521 |publisher=Apple Corporation |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Get openHAB - Microsoft Store |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/openhab/9nmq39ctwxgt?activetab=pivot:overviewtab |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref> All of these UIs are defined by the sitemap mechanism. A screenshot of the browser based UI can be seen on [https://www.openhab.org/assets/img/sitemap_demo_fullexample.1c576625.png this screenshot].

=== Rules ===

An [[Event_condition_action|event, condition, action]] rule based system is used to automate the smart home. The following example turns off a light once the sun rises at the configured location.

<source>
rule "Start wake up light on sunrise"
when
    Channel "astro:sun:home:rise#event" triggered
then
    switch(receivedEvent.getEvent()) {
        case "START": {
            Light.sendCommand(OFF)
        }
    }
end
</source>

=== openHAB Cloud ===

openHAB Cloud is a companion cloud service and backend for openHAB. It provides secure remote access and enables openHAB users to remotely monitor, control and steer their homes through the internet. The openHAB foundation provides a demo system without SLA guarantees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to myopenHAB |url=https://www.myopenhab.org/ |publisher=openHAB Foundation e.V. |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>

== Security ==

Many security and privacy concerns have been raised with home automation and [[Internet_of_things|IoT]] in general. openHAB’s on-premise engine and open source character are answers to these concerns.<ref name="wired">{{cite web |title=Smart-Home Gadgets Need a Translator Real Bad—Here's How to Get One |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/smart-home-hubs-apps/ |publisher=Wired |accessdate=26 November 2019 |date=May 2016}}</ref> However, it was criticized for its use of default configurations.<ref>{{cite web |title=1990s technology exposes 32,000 smart homes, businesses to exploit |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/32000-smart-homes-businesses-are-at-risk-of-data-leaks-due-to-flawed-mqtt-protocol/ |publisher=ZDNet |date=August 2018}}</ref>
