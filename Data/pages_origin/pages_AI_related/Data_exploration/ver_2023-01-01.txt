'''Data exploration''' is an approach similar to initial [[data analysis]], whereby a [[data analyst]] uses visual exploration to understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data, rather than through traditional data management systems.<ref name="Foster">[https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/sites/default/files/pdf/2933.pdf FOSTER Open Science], Overview of Data Exploration Techniques: Stratos Idreos, Olga Papaemmonouil, Surajit Chaudhuri.</ref> These characteristics can include size or amount of data, completeness of the data, correctness of the data, possible relationships amongst data elements or files/tables in the data.

Data exploration is typically conducted using a combination of automated and manual activities.<ref name="Foster" /><ref name="Stanford2011">[http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-Wrangler-CHI.pdf Stanford.edu], 2011 Wrangler: Interactive Visual Specification of Data Transformation Scripts, Kandel, Paepcke, Hellerstein Heer.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Guided Interaction: Rethinking the Query-Result Paradigm|publisher=International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) 2011|author=Arnab Nandi|author2= H. V. Jagadish|url=http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p1466-nandi.pdf}}</ref> Automated activities can include [[data profiling]] or [[data visualization]] or [[tabular report]]s to give the analyst an initial view into the data and an understanding of key characteristics.<ref name="Foster"/>

This is often followed by manual [[drill-down]] or filtering of the data to identify anomalies or patterns identified through the automated actions.  Data exploration can also require manual scripting and queries into the data (e.g. using languages such as [[SQL]] or [[R (language)|R]]) or using [[spreadsheet]]s or similar tools to view the [[raw data]].<ref name="Stanford2012">[http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2012-EnterpriseAnalysisInterviews-VAST.pdf Stanford.edu], IEEE Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST), Oct 2012 Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization: An Interview Study., Sean Kandel, Andreas Paepcke, Joseph Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer Proc.</ref>

All of these activities are aimed at creating a mental model and understanding of the data in the mind of the analyst, and defining basic [[metadata]] (statistics, structure, relationships) for the data set that can be used in further analysis.<ref name="Foster"/>

Once this initial understanding of the data is had, the data can be pruned or refined by removing unusable parts of the data ([[data cleansing]]), correcting poorly formatted elements and defining relevant relationships across datasets.<ref name="Stanford2011" /> This process is also known as determining [[data quality]].<ref name="Stanford2012" />

Data exploration can also refer to the ad hoc querying or visualization of data to identify potential relationships or insights that may be hidden in the data and does not require to formulate assumptions beforehand.<ref name="Foster" />

Traditionally, this had been a key area of focus for statisticians, with [[John Tukey]] being a key evangelist in the field.<ref name="Tukey, John W.">[https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/Papers/EDASage.pdf Exploratory Data Analysis], Pearson. {{ISBN|978-0201076165}}</ref> Today, data exploration is more widespread and is the focus of data analysts and [[data scientists]]; the latter being a relatively new role within enterprises and larger organizations.

== Interactive Data Exploration ==
This area of data exploration has become an area of interest in the field of [[machine learning]]. This is a relatively new field and is still evolving.<ref name="Stanford2012" />  As its most basic level, a machine-learning algorithm can be fed a data set and can be used to identify whether a hypothesis is true based on the dataset. Common machine learning algorithms can focus on identifying specific patterns in the data.<ref name="Stanford2011" /> Many common patterns include [[Regression analysis|regression]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]] or [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], but there are many possible patterns and algorithms that can be applied to data via machine learning.

By employing machine learning, it is possible to find patterns or relationships in the data that would be difficult or impossible to find via manual inspection, trial and error or traditional exploration techniques.<ref>[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/talks/glasgow2017/ Machine Learning for Data Exploration]</ref>
