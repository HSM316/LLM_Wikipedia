The '''Argument Interchange Format''' (AIF) is an international effort to develop a representational mechanism for exchanging argument resources between research groups, tools, and domains using a semantically rich language. AIF traces its history back to a 2005 colloquium in Budapest. The result of the work in Budapest was first published as a draft description in 2006.<ref name="chesnevar">Chesnevar, Carlos, Sanjay Modgil, Iyad Rahwan, Chris Reed, Guillermo Simari, Matthew South, Gerard Vreeswijk, and Steven Willmott. "Towards an argument interchange format." The knowledge engineering review 21, no. 4 (2006): 293-316.</ref>

AIF-RDF is the extended ontology represented in the [[RDF Schema|Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS)]] semantic language.
