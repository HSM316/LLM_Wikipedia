The '''Argument Interchange Format''' (AIF) is an international effort to develop a representational mechanism for exchanging argument resources between research groups, tools, and domains using a semantically rich language. AIF traces its history back to a 2005 colloquium in Budapest. The result of the work in Budapest was first published as a draft description in 2006.<ref name="chesnevar">Chesnevar, Carlos, Sanjay Modgil, Iyad Rahwan, Chris Reed, Guillermo Simari, Matthew South, Gerard Vreeswijk, and Steven Willmott. "Towards an argument interchange format."

AIF-RDF is the extended ontology represented in the [[RDF Schema|Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS)]] semantic language.

The Argument Interchange Format introduces a small set of ontological concepts that aim to capture a common understanding of argument -- one that works in multiple domains (both domains of argumentation and also domains of academic research), so that data can be shared and re-used across different projects in different areas. These ontological concepts are:<ref name="chesnevar" />
* Information (I-nodes)
* Applications of Rules of Inference (RA-nodes)
* Applications of Rules of Conflict (CA-nodes)
* Applications of Rules of Preference (PA-nodes)
extended by:<ref name="wwaw" />
* Schematic Forms (F-nodes) that are instantiated by RA, CA and PA nodes

The AIF has "reifications" in a variety of development environments and implementation languages including
* MySQL database schema
* RDF
* Prolog
* JSON
as well as translations to visual languages such as DOT and SVG.
