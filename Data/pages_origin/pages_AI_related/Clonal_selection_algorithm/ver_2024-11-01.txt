{{Evolutionary algorithms}}
In [[artificial immune systems]], '''clonal selection algorithms''' are a class of algorithms inspired by the [[clonal selection]] theory of [[acquired immunity]] that explains how B and T [[lymphocyte]]s improve their response to [[antigens]] over time called [[affinity maturation]]. These algorithms focus on the [[Universal Darwinism|Darwinian]] attributes of the theory where selection is inspired by the affinity of [[antigen-antibody interaction|antigen-antibody interactions]], reproduction is inspired by [[cell division]], and variation is inspired by [[somatic hypermutation]]. Clonal selection algorithms are most commonly applied to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[pattern recognition]] domains, some of which resemble parallel [[hill climbing]] and the [[genetic algorithm]] without the recombination operator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/immune/clonal_selection_algorithm.html|title=Clonal Selection Algorithm|last=Brownlee|first=Jason|website=Clonal Selection Algorithm}}</ref>
