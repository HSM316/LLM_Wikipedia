[[Artificial intelligence]] applications have been used in a wide range of fields including [[medical diagnosis]], [[stock trading]], [[robot control]], [[law]], scientific discovery and toys.  However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI:  "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/07/24/ai.bostrom/ AI set to exceed human brain power] CNN.com (July 26, 2006)</ref><ref name=andreas>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein structure artificial intelligence along three evolutionary stages: 1) artificial narrow intelligence – applying AI only to specific tasks; 2) [[artificial general intelligence]] – applying AI to several areas and able to autonomously solve problems they were never even designed for; and 3) artificial [[super intelligence]] – applying AI to any area capable of scientific [[creativity]], [[social skills]], and general [[wisdom]].<ref name=andreas/>

To allow comparison with human performance, artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well-defined problems.  Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s.  Also, smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.

In his famous [[Turing test]], Alan Turing picked language, [[Animal language#Aspects of human language|the defining feature of human beings]], for its basis.<ref>{{Turing 1950}}</ref> Yet, there are many other useful abilities that can be described as showing some form of intelligence. This gives better insight into the comparative success of artificial intelligence in different areas.

Broad classes of outcome for an AI test may be given as:
* '''optimal''': it is not possible to perform better (note: some of these entries were solved by humans)
* '''super-human''': performs better than all humans
* '''high-human''': performs better than most humans
* '''par-human''': performs similarly to most humans
* '''sub-human''': performs worse than most humans

==Past and current predictions==
An expert poll around 2016, conducted by [[Katja Grace]] of the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] and associates, gave median estimates of 3 years for championship Angry Birds, 4 years for the World Series of Poker, and 6 years for StarCraft. On more subjective tasks, the poll gave 6 years for folding laundry as well as an average human worker, 7–10 years for expertly answering 'easily Googleable' questions, 8 years for average speech transcription, 9 years for average telephone banking, and 11 years for expert songwriting, but over 30 years for writing a New York Times bestseller or winning the [[Putnam competition|Putnam math competition]].<ref name=bbc/><ref name=ns/><ref name=grace/>

===Go===
[[AlphaGo]] defeated a European Go champion in October 2015, and [[Lee Sedol]] in March 2016, one of the world's top players (see [[AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol]]). According to [[Scientific American]] and other sources, most observers had expected superhuman Computer Go performance to be at least a decade away.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koch|first1=Christof|title=How the Computer Beat the Go Master|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-computer-beat-the-go-master/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2016|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='I'm in shock!'

===Human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI)===
AI pioneer and economist [[Herbert A. Simon]] inaccurately predicted in 1965: "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". Similarly, in 1970 [[Marvin Minsky]] wrote that "Within a generation... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved."<ref name=superintelligence>{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199678112|language=en|title-link=Superintelligence (book)}}</ref>

Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the [[median]] estimate among experts for when AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll.<ref name=newyorker>{{cite news|last1=Khatchadourian|first1=Raffi|title=The Doomsday Invention|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=16 November 2015}}</ref><ref>Müller, V. C., & Bostrom, N. (2016). Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion. In Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence (pp. 555-572). Springer, Cham.</ref>

The Grace poll around 2016 found results varied depending on how the question was framed. Respondents asked to estimate "when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers" gave an aggregated median answer of 45 years and a 10% chance of it occurring within 9 years. Other respondents asked to estimate "when all occupations are fully automatable. That is, when for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers" estimated a median of 122 years and a 10% probability of 20 years. The median response for when "AI researcher" could be fully automated was around 90 years. No link was found between seniority and optimism, but Asian researchers were much more optimistic than North American researchers on average; Asians predicted 30 years on average for "accomplish every task", compared with the 74 years predicted by North Americans.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Richard|title=How long will it take for your job to be automated?|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170619-how-long-will-it-take-for-your-job-to-be-automated|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=BBC|date=2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name=ns>{{cite news|title=AI will be able to beat us at everything by 2060, say experts|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133188-ai-will-be-able-to-beat-us-at-everything-by-2060-say-experts/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=New Scientist|date=2018}}</ref><ref name=grace>Grace, K., Salvatier, J., Dafoe, A., Zhang, B., & Evans, O.
