[[Artificial intelligence art|Artificial intelligence]] researchers have developed several specialized '''programming languages for artificial intelligence''':

== Languages ==
* [[Artificial Intelligence Markup Language]] (AIML)<ref name="AIML_Repository">according to (the intro page to) the [http://nlp-addiction.com/chatbot/aiml/ AIML Repository] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414030045/http://nlp-addiction.com/chatbot/aiml/ |date=2015-04-14}} at nlp-addiction.com</ref> is an [[XML]] dialect<ref name="alicebot.org_aiml">See the [http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html AIML "Intro" (web) page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205936/http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html |date=2013-10-29}} at www.alicebot.org</ref> for use with [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity]] (A.L.I.C.E.)-type [[chatterbot]]s. 
* [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] can be used to develop high level machine learning models using [[Microsoft]]’s [[.NET]] suite. ML.NET was developed to aid integration with existing .NET projects, simplifying the process for existing software using the .NET platform.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, such as lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, [[data type]]s, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.
* [[Smalltalk]] has been used extensively for simulations, neural networks, machine learning, and genetic algorithms. It implements a pure and elegant form of object-oriented programming using message passing.
* [[Prolog]]<ref>

[[Prolog]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=477–491}},
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=641–676, 575–581}}
</ref> is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running ''queries'' over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.
* [[Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver]] (STRIPS) is a language to express [[automated planning and scheduling|automated planning problem instance]]s. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.
* [[Planner (programming language)|Planner]] is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.
* [[POP-11]] is a [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]] [[programming language]] with many of the features of an [[interpreted language]]. It is the core language of the [[Poplog]] [[Computer programming|programming]] [[system platform|environment]] developed originally by the [[University of Sussex]], and recently in the [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/ School of Computer Science] at the [[University of Birmingham]] which hosts [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html the Poplog website], It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], who find POP syntax more familiar than that of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. One of POP-11's features is that it supports [[first-class function]]s.
*[[R (programming language)|R]] is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis, the use of [[Bayesian inference]], neural networks and in general [[machine learning]]. In domains like finance, biology, sociology or medicine it is considered one of the main standard languages. It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation, functional programming and object-oriented programming.
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is widely used for artificial intelligence, with packages for several applications including general AI, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[artificial neural network]]s.<ref>[https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence Python For Artificial Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101045354/http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence |date=2012-11-01}} Python Wiki 2015</ref> The application of AI to develop programs that do human-like jobs and portray human skills is machine learning. Both artificial intelligence and machine learning are closely connected and are being used widely today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.technologysumo.com/why-python-is-good-for-artificial-intelligence/ |title=Top 10 Reasons Why Python is Good for Artificial Intelligence |last=Lopez |first=Matthew |date=11 January 2021}}</ref>
* [[Haskell]] is a very good language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]] make it easy to express non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for [[search tree]]s. The language's features enable a compositional way to express algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of functional purity.
* [[Wolfram Language]] includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, and image.<ref name="Wolfram Language">[http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html Wolfram Language]</ref>
* [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], e.g. for machine learning, using native or non-native libraries.
* [[Mojo (programming language)|Mojo]] can run some [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programs, and supports programmability of AI hardware.<ref name=IWFirst>{{cite news |last1=Yegulalp |first1=Serdar |title=A first look at the Mojo language |url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3697739/a-first-look-at-the-mojo-language.html |work=InfoWorld |date=7 June 2023 |language=en}}</ref>
