'''Microsoft HoloLens 2''' is a [[mixed reality]] [[head-mounted display]] developed and manufactured by [[Microsoft]]. It is the successor to the original [[Microsoft HoloLens]]. The first variant of the device, The HoloLens 2 enterprise edition, debuted on February 24, 2019. This was followed by a developer edition that was announced on May 2, 2019. The HoloLens 2 was subsequently released in limited numbers on November 7, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Strategy |first=Moor Insights and |title=Hololens 2: Microsoft's Enterprise AR Power Play For Windows Mixed Reality |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2019/04/08/hololens-2-microsofts-enterprise-ar-power-play-for-windows-mixed-reality/ |access-date=2023-02-04 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref>

== Description ==
The HoloLens 2 was announced by lead HoloLens developer [[Alex Kipman]] on February&nbsp;24, 2019 at [[Mobile World Congress]] (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-hololens-2-mwc-2019 |title=Microsoft Hololens 2 ushers in the next generation of augmented reality|publisher=[[mashable.com]]|date=February 24, 2019|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/24/tech/microsoft-hololens-2/index.html|title=Microsoft's new $3,500 HoloLens 2 headset means business|publisher=[[cnn.com]]|date=February 24, 2019|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref> On May&nbsp;7, 2019 the HoloLens 2 was shown again at the [[Microsoft Build]] developer conference. There, it showcased an application created with the [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Game Engine]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Apollo 11 HoloLens 2 Demo {{!}} Microsoft Build 2019 {{!}} Unreal Engine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ubiU3PRHw|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>

The HoloLens 2 are combination [[waveguide]] and [[laser]]-based [[stereoscopic]] & full-color [[mixed reality]] [[smartglasses]] developed and manufactured by [[Microsoft]]. The US military's [[Integrated Visual Augmentation System]] is a further development of Hololens 2.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kress |first=Bernard C. |last2=Cummings |first2=William J. |date=May 2017 |title=11-1: Invited Paper : Towards the Ultimate Mixed Reality Experience: HoloLens Display Architecture Choices |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdtp.11586 |journal=SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers |language=en |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=127–131 |doi=10.1002/sdtp.11586}}</ref>

The HoloLens 2 is an early [[augmented reality|AR]] device. The displays on the HoloLens 2 are simple waveguide displays with a fixed focus of approximately two meters. Because of the fixed focus, the displays exhibit the [[Vergence-Accommodation Conflict]], which is an unpleasant visual sensation for the viewer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Comfort - Mixed Reality |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/comfort |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=learn.microsoft.com |language=en-us}}</ref>

On August 20, 2019, at the [[Hot Chips|Hot Chips 31]] symposium Microsoft presented their Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) 2.0 custom design for the HoloLens 2 with the following features:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14775/hot-chips-31-live-blogs-microsoft-hololens-20-silicon|title=Hot Chips 31 Live Blogs: Microsoft Hololens 2.0 Silicon|last=Cutress|first=Dr Ian|website=www.anandtech.com|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

On August 29, 2019, at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Microsoft's Executive Vice President, Harry Shum, revealed that HoloLens 2 would go on sale in September 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tech-microsoft-idUSKCN1VJ07Z|title=Microsoft says new augmented reality headset to go on sale in...|date=2019-08-29|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-29|language=en}}</ref> The product started shipping on November&nbsp;7, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20946589/microsoft-hololens-2-mixed-reality-headset-preorder-shipping-price-upgrade|title=The Microsoft HoloLens 2 ships today for $3,500|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2019-11-07|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>

== Improvements over the previous model ==
Microsoft highlighted three main improvements made to the device: immersiveness, ergonomics and business friendliness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy|title=HoloLens 2 pricing and preorder|publisher=[[microsoft.com]]|access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=New HoloLens 2 gives Microsoft the edge in the next generation of computing |url=https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hololens-2/ |website=Innovation Stories at Microsoft |date=24 February 2019 |publisher=Microsoft |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

HoloLens 2 has a diagonal [[Field of view (image processing)|field of view]] of 52 degrees, improving over the 34 degree field of view (FOV) of the first edition of HoloLens, although Karl Guttag states that it offers less than 20 pixels per degree of resolution<ref>{{cite web|title=Hololens 2 Display Evaluation (Part 2: Comparison to Hololens 1)|url=https://kguttag.com/2020/07/08/hololens-2-display-evaluation-part-2-comparison-to-hololens-1/|website=KGOnTech|date=8 July 2020|publisher=KGOnTech|access-date=21 May 2021}}</ref> (despite Microsoft's claim that it would keep a resolution of 47 pixels per degree<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/akipman/status/1100069645661495298|title=No secrets... - The first HoloLens had a 34-degree diagonal FOV; the new headset's field of view … 52-degree diagonal field of view.

Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) 2.0 improvements compared to the HPU 1.0:<ref name=":0" />

* 1.7x compute
* 2x effective DRAM bandwidth
* Improved hologram stability
* New hardware accelerated workloads such as eye tracking, fully articulated hand tracking, semantic labeling, spatial audio and JBL filter

== HoloLens 2 emulation ==
The HoloLens 2 Emulator was made available to developers on April 17, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com/2019/04/first-look-at-hololens-2-emulator.html|title=First look at the HoloLens 2 emulator|last=Schaik|first=Joost Van|date=2019-04-17|website=Dotnet by Example|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref> This [[emulator]] allows developers to create applications for the HoloLens 2 before the device ships.
