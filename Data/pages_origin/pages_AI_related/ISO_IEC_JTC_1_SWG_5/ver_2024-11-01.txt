'''ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 Internet of Things (IoT)''' is a [[standardization]] special working group (SWG) of the Joint Technical Committee [[ISO/IEC JTC 1]] of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which develops and facilitates the development of standards for [[Internet of Things]] (IoT). ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 was established in 2012 at the 27th plenary meeting of ISO/IEC JTC 1 in Jeju. The special working group was established as a result of growing interest in the field of IoT by other standards organizations.<ref name=ANSI>{{cite web| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 Forms Two New Special Working Groups| author=ANSI| date=2012-11-16| accessdate=2013-11-22| location=New York| url=http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=3423}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=The Internet of Things in the spotlight - JTC1 forms two new Special Working Groups| accessdate=2013-11-22| date=2012-11-23| author=PRWeb| url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10163314.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222130945/http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10163314.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=December 22, 2013| location=Geneva}}</ref> The international [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 is the [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]] (KATS), located in the Republic of Korea.<ref name=ANSI/>

* Identify market requirements and standardization gaps for IoT
* Encourage JTC 1 SCs and WGs to address the need for ISO/IEC standards for IoT
* Facilitate cooperation across JTC 1 entities
* Promote JTC 1 developed standards for IoT and encourage them to be recognized and utilized by industry and other standards setting organizations
* Facilitate the coordination of JTC 1 IoT activities with IEC, ISO, ITU, and other organizations that are developing standards for IoT
* Periodically report results and recommendations to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 3 on Planning
* Provide a written report of activities and recommendations to JTC 1 in advance of each JTC 1 plenary
* Study IoT Reference Architectures/Frameworks and provide a study report. This study report should be written so it could be referenced in a possible JTC 1 New Work Item Proposal on IoT. The report shall be made available to JTC 1 no later than the 2014 JTC 1 Plenary.
The purpose of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 is not to develop or publish IoT related standards, but to coordinate with ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommittees, working groups, and special working groups and with other standards organizations to help better identify and convey the needs and gaps in the IoT world.

==Structure==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 is made up of four Ad Hoc groups, each of which carries out specific tasks in relation to IoT. The four Ad Hoc groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 are:<ref name=agenda2013>{{cite report| type=Meeting Agenda| author=Yoo, Sangkeun| title=Agenda for 3rd ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 Meeting (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 N 94)| date=2013-12-06}}</ref>

==Documents and current work==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 does not develop or facilitate the development of standards, but consolidates the standardization activity, for IoT, of multiple groups, both internal and external to ISO and IEC. The special working group also identifies current and future trends, needs, and gaps in IoT. The result of the special working group’s IoT collection of data is a number of documents, including the IoT mind map and a collection of definitions for the IoT, M2M, and CPS. Both of these documents were produced by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5’s Ad Hoc Group 1, and are meant to provide a better understanding of what is meant by IoT. The mind map visually describes the technologies related to, and application domains, requirements, and stakeholders of, IoT. Standardization related to IoT is not included in the mind map, as that area of work is covered by Ad Hoc Group 3.<ref>{{cite report| date=2013-04-24| type=Meeting Report| url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/download.php/41360/ISO-IECJTC1-SWG5_N0037_Report_of_the_1st_Meeting_of_ISO_IEC_.pdf| author=Yoo, Sangkeun| title=Report of the 1st Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5/Ad Hoc Group 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Mind Map| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5}}</ref>  The definition list provides a list of collected definitions from various standards-setting organizations divided into four categories: Internet of Things (IoT), [[Machine to Machine]] Communications (M2M), Machine Type Communications (MTC), and [[Cyber-physical system|Cyber Physical Systems]] (CPS).<ref>{{cite journal| title=A Collection of Definitions for the IoT, M2M, MTC, and CPS| date=2013-07-20| author=Moayeri, Nader}}</ref> Ad Hoc Group 2 is working on collecting data on the market requirements for IoT and will soon develop a document describing these market requirements, which will be presented  based on a pre-determined template.<ref>{{cite report| title=Report of the 5th Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5/Ad-Hoc Group 2| author=Evanhoe, Chuck| date=2013-11-22| type=Meeting Report}}</ref> Ad Hoc Group 3 is developing a document that will identify standardization gaps within IoT, as well as a standards roadmap, both of which will take into account the inputs of relevant stakeholders.<ref name=business2013/><ref>{{cite report| title=Recommendations of the 1st ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 Meeting (revised)| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5| date=2013-03-25| type=Meeting Report}}</ref> Ad Hoc Group 4 is studying IoT Reference Architectures/Frameworks which includes collecting, comparing and summarizing of existing IoT Architectures/Frameworks.

At the 29th meeting of ISO/IEC JTC 1 in November 2014, a resolution was adopted to dissolve ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 given the establishment of ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 10 on Internet of Things. All relevant documents were transferred from the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SWG 5 Secretariat to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 10 Convenor for archiving.<ref name=resolutionsUAE>{{cite report| date=2014-11-27| type=Meeting Resolutions| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1| title=Resolutions Adopted at the 29th Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC 1 15-20 November 2014 in Abu Dhabi, UAE}}</ref>
