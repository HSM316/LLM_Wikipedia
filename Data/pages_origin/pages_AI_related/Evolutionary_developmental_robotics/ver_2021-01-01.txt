'''Evolutionary developmental robotics''' ('''evo-devo-robo''' for short) refers to methodologies that systematically integrate [[evolutionary robotics]], [[epigenetic robotics]] and [[morphogenetic robotics]] to study the evolution, physical and mental development and learning of natural intelligent systems in robotic systems. The field was formally suggested and fully discussed in a published paper<ref>Y. Jin and Y. Meng, "Morphogenetic robotics: A new emerging field in developmental robotics. ''IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Reviews and Applications, 41(2):145-160, 2011''</ref> and further discussed in a published dialogue.<ref>Y. Jin and Y. Meng. "Evolutionary Developmental Robotics: The Next Step to Go?" IEEE CIS AMD Newsletter, 8(1):13-14, 2011</ref>

The theoretical foundation of evo-devo-robo includes [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo), [[evolutionary developmental psychology]], [[developmental cognitive neuroscience]] etc. Further discussions on evolution, development and learning in robotics and design can be found in a number of papers,<ref>H.
