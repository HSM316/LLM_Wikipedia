'''GIMIAS''' is a [[workflow]]-oriented environment focused on [[biomedical]] image computing and [[Computer simulation|simulation]]. The [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Framework (computer science)|framework]] is extensible through [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and is focused on building research and clinical software [[prototypes]]. Gimias has been used to develop clinical prototypes in the fields of [[cardiac]] imaging and simulation, [[angiography]] imaging and simulation, and [[neurology]]<ref>I. Larrabide, P. Omedas, Y.

GIMIAS is a development framework that allows developers to create their own medical applications using different plug-ins that can be dynamically loaded and combined. The prototypes developed on GIMIAS can be verified by end users in real scenarios and with real data at early development stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cilab2.upf.edu/gimias2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=59 |title=GIMIAS Home Page |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720101525/http://cilab2.upf.edu/gimias2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=59 |archivedate=2011-07-20 }}</ref>

Is developed using [[C++]] language, has a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture, and is [[cross-platform]] by means of the standard [[CMake]] tool. Is possible to integrate new libraries using CSnake tool and is based on common open source libraries like [[VTK]], [[Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit|ITK]], MITK, [[Boost C++ Libraries|BOOST]] and [[wxWidgets]]. A plug-in can extend the framework adding new processing components, GUI components like toolbars or windows, new data processing types or new rendering libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/GIMIAS/gimias-architecture |author=GIMIAS Team |title=GIMIAS architecture |publisher=slideshare |accessdate=}}</ref>

GIMIAS supports several types of plug-ins, starting from a simple DLL, a [[3D Slicer]] compatible command line plug-in or a more complex GIMIAS plug-in with customized graphical interface. Automated GUI generation and extensible data object model allow to share plug-ins with other frameworks and empower interoperability.

The software is available on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]], [[64-bit]] and [[32-bit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goomedic.com/gimias-medical-image-analysis-and-simulation-solution-for-windows-and-linux.html |title=GIMIAS Medical Image Analysis and Simulation Solution for Windows and Linux |author=Hamza Emadeen Mousa |publisher=goomedic |accessdate=}}</ref>

== History ==

Initial versions of the open source framework was released by the end of 2009 (GIMIAS 0.6.15 was released on October 2009).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/gimias/files/ |title=GIMIAS on SourceForge |author=GIMIAS Team |publisher=SourceForge |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2010, more effort was done to empower the open source framework itself, providing more functionality like workflow manager, [[3D Slicer]] plug-in compatibility, signal viewer and customizable views. GIMIAS version 0.8.1, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 were released during this year.

== Clinical Prototypes ==

* '''AngioLab''' is a software tool developed within the GIMIAS framework and is part of a more ambitious pipeline for the integrated management of cerebral aneurysms. AngioLab currently includes four plug-ins: angio segmentation, angio morphology virtual stenting and virtual angiography. In December 2009, 23 clinicians completed an evaluation questionnaire about AngioLab. This activity was part of a teaching course held during the 2nd European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurovascular Treatment (ESMINT) Teaching Course held at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. The Automated Morphological Analysis (angio morphology plug-in) and the Endovascular Treatment Planning (stenting plug-in) were evaluated. In general, the results provided by these tools were considered as relevant and as an emerging need in their clinical field.<ref>M.C. Villa-Uriol, I. Larrabide, J.M. Pozo, H. Bogunovic, P. Omedas, V.

* '''FocusDET''': Accurate localization of epileptogenic foci in intractable partial epilepsy is essential for assessing the possibility of surgery as a treatment. A specific software package was developed to locate the epileptogenic focus using Ictal and Inter-ictal SPECT images and MRI employing the SISCOM methodology. FocusDET was developed using GIMIAS facilities.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=B. Mart√≠ |author2=√ì. Esteban |author3=X. Planes |author4=P. Omedas |author5=G. Wollny |author6=A. Cot |author7=X.
