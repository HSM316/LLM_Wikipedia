==History==

Myfox was founded in 2005 by entrepreneur Jean Prunet, with the creation of the IntelliTAG smart sensor. This technology is based on the concept of “proactive deterrence.” The vibration sensor attaches to doors and windows to alert users in case of an attempted break-in, with the capacity to differentiate between break-in attempts and normal, everyday events. The end result is a DYI security solution that can catch intruders before they can enter the home.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

The brand launched the first connected alarm solution on the market in 2009. The same year, Jean-Marc Prunet, Jean Prunet's son, took the helm of the company as chief executive officer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

The company grew from its roots in Toulouse, France, to become an international company in 2014. Alongside the launch of the third generation of IntelliTAG, it expanded distribution to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Spain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In 2015, Myfox launched two new products, the Myfox Home Alarm and Security Camera.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In June 2015, the company entered the North American market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In September 2015, Myfox announced the Myfox Home Alarm's compatibility with the [[Nest]] Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect: Smoke and Carbon Monoxide alarm.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In October 2015, Myfox announced their Security Channel on [[IFTTT]] that connects their Home Alarm and Security Camera with software that allowed for interaction between the products, apps and IoT devices. In 2016, the company announced the availability of 24/7 professional monitoring.<ref name="24/7 Pro Monitoring">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/at-ces-myfox-makes-month-to-month-security-monitoring-a-reality/#ftag=CADf328eec |title=At CES, Myfox makes month-to-month security monitoring a reality |first=Meghan|last=Wollerton |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=January 6, 2015}}</ref> The company reached an agreement with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in February 2016 and is now available for sale at Apple stores in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as online in over twenty more countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Products==

===Myfox Home Alarm===
Myfox Home Alarm is a DIY security system that works with a [[Bluetooth]] key fob to recognize users and automatically disarm the alarm.

The system's IntelliTAG can detect break-in attempts by analyzing and differentiating vibrations and impacts. Myfox Home Alarm also allows the user to invite people from his/her network (friends, neighbors, family) to keep an eye on his/her home through what it calls a “community”.

The system includes an IntelliTAG, a 110 dB siren, a Bluetooth key fob to disarm the alarm, and a Link to ensure Wi-Fi connection.

Myfox Home Alarm is wireless; it connects to [[Wi-Fi|Wifi]] and can be controlled through the Myfox app. When a break-in attempt is detected, a smartphone notification is sent to the user and/or their community, including the option to call a designated emergency contact, which can be local authorities. The application also informs users about who is in the home.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

===Myfox Security Camera===
Myfox Security Camera is equipped with a motorized shutter to respect users' privacy needs. The camera's integrated infrared detector registers movement and records it while the user is away, but the motorized shutter automatically covers the camera lens for privacy when the user comes home. Additionally, the shutter can also be closed remotely with just a click on the smartphone application.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}
