{{about|the vaccine development tool||Mimic (disambiguation)}}
'''MIMIC''', or '''modular immune in vitro construct''', is an artificial system imitating the human immune system.  It has applications in vaccine development.

White blood cells, specifically peripheral blood mononuclear cells including [[T cells]] and [[B cells]], from human donors are placed in standard tubes containing specially designed tissue constructs made out of [[collagen]], where they develop into small but functioning immune systems. Up to ninety-six individual tubes can be carried on a plate the size of a deck of cards, allowing scientists to use cells from almost a hundred different donors at once.<ref name="TIME">{{Citation

The MIMIC system replaces some steps in the vaccine development process that would otherwise be [[animal testing|performed on animals]] and offers scientists better speed and flexibility than traditional methods.  However, critics are concerned that MIMIC may be too simple for use as widespread as its developers hope.<ref name="TIME"/>

The MIMIC system was developed by [[VaxDesign]] and became available for use in 2008.
