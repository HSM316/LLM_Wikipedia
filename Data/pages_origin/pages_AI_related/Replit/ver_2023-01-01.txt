== History ==
Replit was co-founded by programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in 2016.<ref name="cnbc">{{Cite web |last=Rodriguez |first=Salvador |date=October 22, 2018 |title=Former Facebook engineer quit to build the programming tool he always wanted |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-leads-4point5-million-seed-round-in-replit.html |website=CNBC}}</ref><ref name="vator">{{Cite web |date=2019-04-30 |title=Today's Entrepreneur: Faris Masad |url=https://vator.tv/news/2019-04-30-todays-entrepreneur-faris-masad |access-date=2021-01-12 |website=VatorNews}}</ref> Once listed as a co-founder alongside Masad, Max Shawabkeh left the venture early on.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Repl.it |url=http://repl.it/about |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824072203if_/http://repl.it/about |archive-date=24 August 2014 |access-date=8 June 2021 |website=repl.it/about}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenberg |first1=Bart |title=#42 Computer Science 2.0: Part 1―Amjad Masad: Engineer, Codecademy; Co-inventor, repl.it |url=https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/software_designers/0042 |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Spina |first1=Carli |date=May 5, 2014 |title=Practice Programming Languages In Your Browser With Repl.it |url=https://carlispina.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/repl-it/ |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref> Its name comes from the acronym [[REPL]], which stands for "read–evaluate–print loop".

Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook]], where he built development tools. He also helped found [[Codecademy]]. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit over a decade before its creation.<ref name="VB">{{cite web |last1=Sawers |first1=Paul |date=18 February 2021 |title=Replit raises $20 million for collaborative browser-based coding |url=https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/ |access-date=13 March 2021 |website=VentureBeat}}</ref>

In 2009, Amjad Masad tried to write every programming language in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], but it was not practical. He saw great leaps in browser and web technologies and he was inspired by the web capabilities of [[Google Docs]]. He thought of the idea of being able to write and share code all in a web browser. He spent two years creating an open-source product with Haya Odeh called "pyRepl".<ref name="dotcom">{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Amjad |title=Replit Dotcom |url=https://blog.replit.com/dotcom |access-date=13 March 2021 |website=Replit}}</ref> This product allowed him to compile languages into Python. It powered [[Udacity]] and Codecademy's tutorials. After becoming an early employee of Codecademy, this project was put off until years later, when he and Odeh decided to revive the project of a programming environment in a browser.<ref name="techcrunch" /><ref name="VB" />

As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something emulated in the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards professional developers.<ref name="techcrunch" />

Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default [[domain name]] for the web service replacing the older "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's name as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|l|ɪ|t}} instead of {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|əl}}.<ref name="dotcom" /> Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the ".it" [[Top-level domain|TLD]], such as renewal restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Masad |first=Amjad |date=February 13, 2021 |title=what happened to repl.it??? |url=https://replit.com/talk/ask/Hi-this-was-by-mistake-We-will-be-movin/121581/449321 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Replit originally was only a REPL. However, the [[Ace (editor)|Ace]] editor was eventually implemented, allowing for editing of programs as well. In 2017, Replit switched to the Monaco code editor, the same editor used in [[Visual Studio Code]]. Due to issues with mobile support, the code editor was switched to [[CodeMirror]] over 2021 - 2022. This decision was met with backlash and criticism from the Replit community, which eventually calmed down after bugs and major issues were addressed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Faris |title=Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You Use in the Browser |url=https://blog.replit.com/code-editors |access-date=2 March 2022 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref>

== Features ==
Replit is an [[online integrated development environment]] ([[integrated development environment|IDE]]) that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[C++]], [[Node.js]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], and any other language available with the [[NixOS|Nix]] packager. It uses the [[CodeMirror|CodeMirror 6]] editor component,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Betting on CodeMirror |url=https://blog.replit.com/codemirror |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> the same editor component employed by other major websites such as [[CodePen]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CodeMirror: Real-world uses |url=https://codemirror.net/2/doc/realworld.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=codemirror.net}}</ref>

Replit's key feature is collaborative coding, the ability to share a Repl with one or many other users and see real-time edits across files, message each other, and debug code together.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Collaboratively code in realtime with Replit Multiplayer |url=https://replit.com/site/multiplayer |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref> Using a shared compute engine, code can be run and displayed the same to multiple users in a Repl.<ref name=":1" /> Replit's IDE also has live chatting<ref name=":1" /> and in-line threads<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Introducing Threads: Have Conversations Around Code |url=https://blog.replit.com/threads |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> which allows users to discuss around the code. Through Replit's global community, users can share projects, ask for help, learn from tutorials, and use templates.<ref name=":0" />

Replit supported over 50 programming languages, but as of February 23, 2022, Replit uses [[NixOS]] on all Repls<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=All New Repls are Powered By Nix |url=https://blog.replit.com/powered-by-nix |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> meaning users have access to the entire NixOS package database and can use any programming language within. New Repls can be created through official language templates or through a user's custom Nix configuration. Users can configure anything from the [[Language Server Protocol]] to debugger support for a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Nix with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/nix-on-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref>

Repl environments, called Workspaces, have many tools to make development easier. Replit has built-in [[source control]] via Git<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Git with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/git-with-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> on all Repls. Using a [[graphical user interface]] in the menu tab, a user can switch branches, push files, and revert code. Replit can also pull a user's code from a [[GitHub]] repository and link the Repl to their GitHub repository, a feature called ''Repl from Repo''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=GitHub and the Run button {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/github-and-run-button |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> Some Repls also have [[debugger]] and [[unit testing]] support. Replit uses the Debugger Adapter Protocol to provide debugging services in Java, Python, Node.js and C++ for all users connected to a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Multiplayer Debugging Experience for Python, Node.js, Java, and C/C++ |url=https://blog.replit.com/multiplayer-debugging |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Replit also has zero-setup unit testing in several languages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=No-setup Unit Testing |url=https://blog.replit.com/unit-tests |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Repls also have [[Environment variable|secrets management]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Announcing Secrets Management |url=https://blog.replit.com/secrets |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> allowing users to hide values from others who see the Repl publicly.

Users could also import projects from [[Glitch (application)|Glitch]], which provides a similar service to Replit. Though it is unknown if this feature is still officially supported, as of July 2022 it is functional.

Replit also has web hosting services, providing free HTTPS for static websites and servers on a user's special subdomain.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Hosting web pages {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/hosting/hosting-web-pages |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> Users can connect their websites to a domain they own via the Custom Domains tool. A user can keep their website always running through the Always On feature.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Hosting Apps with Always On |url=https://blog.replit.com/alwayson |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref>

Hacker plan is the paid version of Replit and it allows users to 5 boosted repls (faster and more memory), 5 always on repls (which allow near 24/7 hosting), more storage space, and various extra features not available in the free tier.<ref>{{Cite web |last=replit |title=Pricing |url=https://replit.com/pricing |access-date=2022-07-02 |website=replit |language=en}}</ref>
