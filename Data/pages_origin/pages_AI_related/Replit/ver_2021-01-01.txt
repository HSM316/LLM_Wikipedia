A "Repl" at Repl.it is an interactive programming environment. You can create a workspace in most popular programming languages, where you are given a container on a virtual machine where your code can run. In any given Repl, there are two main parts - the editor and the console.

The editor uses [https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/ Monaco], the same technology that powers [[Visual Studio Code]]. On mobile, the editor is [[Ace (editor)|Ace]].

Repl.it has a premium tier called the Hacker plan. It allows for more storage space, private code, and unlimited collaborators on a project. The [[GitHub]] Education plan includes 3 months free of the Hacker plan.

There are over 60 different programming languages on repl.it, including [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[HTML]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], along with lesser-known, esoteric languages like [[LOLCODE]] and [[Brainfuck]].

The company has received funding from [[Y Combinator]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]], [[Bloomberg Beta]], and others.<ref name="cnbc">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-leads-4point5-million-seed-round-in-replit.html|title=Former Facebook engineer quit to build the programming tool he always wanted|first=Salvador|last=Rodriguez|date=October 22, 2018|website=CNBC}}</ref> The company has over 500,000 weekly active developers<ref name=":1" /> and over 3 million users.{{Citation needed|reason=Neither the 500,000 weekly nor the 3M total figures are supported by the TechCrunch reference|date=March 2020}}
