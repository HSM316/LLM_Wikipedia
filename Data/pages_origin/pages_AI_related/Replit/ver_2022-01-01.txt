==History==
Replit was created by programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in 2016.<ref name="cnbc" /><ref name="vator" /> Programmer Max Shawabkeh was also involved in the creation of Replit, but he departed early on. He was listed as a co-founder alongside Amjad Masad in 2013 and 2014 in various media and on the official company website.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Repl.it |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824072203if_/http://repl.it/about |website=repl.it/about |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenberg |first1=Bart |title=#42 Computer Science 2.0: Part 1―Amjad Masad: Engineer, Codecademy; Co-inventor, repl.it |url=https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/software_designers/0042 |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Spina |first1=Carli |title=Practice Programming Languages In Your Browser With Repl.it |date=May 5, 2014 |url=https://carlispina.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/repl-it/ |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref>

Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook]], where he built development tools. He also helped found [[Codecademy]]. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit over a decade before its creation.<ref name="VB" />

In 2009, Masad tried to write every programming language in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], but it was not practical. He saw great leaps in browser and web technologies and he was inspired by [[Google Docs]] web capabilities. He thought of the idea of being able to write code in a browser and make it easy to share it. He spent two years creating an open-source product with Haya Odeh called "pyRepl".<ref name="dotcom">{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Amjad |title=Replit Dotcom |url=https://blog.replit.com/dotcom |website=Replit |access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref> This product allowed him to compile languages into Python. This product powered [[Udacity]] and Codecademy's tutorials. After becoming an early employee of Codecademy, this project was put off until years later, when he and Odeh decided to revive the project of a programming environment in a browser.<ref name="techcrunch" /><ref name="VB" />

As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something emulated in the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards professional developers.<ref name="techcrunch" />

Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default [[domain name]] for the web service replacing the older "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's name as rep·lit instead of re·pu̇l.<ref name="dotcom" /> Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the ".it" [[Top-level domain|TLD]], such as renewal restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Masad|first=Amjad|date=February 13, 2021|title=what happened to repl.it???|url=https://replit.com/talk/ask/Hi-this-was-by-mistake-We-will-be-movin/121581/449321|url-status=live}}</ref>
