'''Replit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|l|ɪ|t}}), formerly '''Repl.it''', is an American start-up and an [[online integrated development environment]] (IDE).<ref name="techcrunch">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/repl-it-lets-you-program-in-your-browser/|title=Repl.it lets you program in your browser|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=January 5, 2019}}</ref> Replit allows users to create online projects called Repls.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Odeh |first=Haya |date=2017-05-29 |title=Check out my Repl! |url=https://blog.replit.com/sessions-repls |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027180235/https://blog.replit.com/sessions-repls |archive-date=2021-10-27 |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit}}</ref>

== History ==
Replit was co-founded by [[programmers]] Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in 2016.<ref name="cnbc">{{Cite web |last=Rodriguez |first=Salvador |date=October 22, 2018 |title=Former Facebook engineer quit to build the programming tool he always wanted |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-leads-4point5-million-seed-round-in-replit.html |website=CNBC}}</ref><ref name="vator">{{Cite web |date=2019-04-30 |title=Today's Entrepreneur: Faris Masad |url=https://vator.tv/news/2019-04-30-todays-entrepreneur-faris-masad |access-date=2021-01-12 |website=VatorNews}}</ref> Once listed as a co-founder alongside Masad, Max Shawabkeh left the venture early on.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Repl.it |url=http://repl.it/about |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824072203if_/http://repl.it/about |archive-date=24 August 2014 |access-date=8 June 2021 |website=repl.it/about}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenberg |first1=Bart |title=#42 Computer Science 2.0: Part 1―Amjad Masad: Engineer, Codecademy; Co-inventor, repl.it |url=https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/software_designers/0042 |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Spina |first1=Carli |date=May 5, 2014 |title=Practice Programming Languages In Your Browser With Repl.it |url=https://carlispina.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/repl-it/ |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref> Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "[[Read–eval–print loop|read–evaluate–print loop]]".

Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook]], where he built development tools. He also helped found [[Codecademy]]. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit over a decade before its creation.<ref name="VB">{{cite web |last1=Sawers |first1=Paul |date=18 February 2021 |title=Replit raises $20 million for collaborative browser-based coding |url=https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/ |access-date=13 March 2021 |website=VentureBeat}}</ref>

In 2009, Amjad Masad sought to write implementations of other programming languages in [[JavaScript]], but realized it was not practically feasible. He saw great leaps in browser and web technologies and was inspired by the web capabilities of [[Google Docs]]. He thought of the idea of being able to write and share code all in a web browser. He spent two years creating an open-source product with Haya Odeh called "JSRepl".<ref name="dotcom">{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Amjad |title=Replit Dotcom |url=https://blog.replit.com/dotcom |access-date=13 March 2021 |website=Replit}}</ref> This product allowed him to compile languages into JavaScript. It powered [[Udacity]] and Codecademy's tutorials. After becoming an early employee of Codecademy, this project was put off until years later, when he and Odeh decided to revive the project of a programming environment in a browser.<ref name="techcrunch" /><ref name="VB" />

As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something emulated in the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards professional developers.<ref name="techcrunch" />

Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default [[domain name]] for the web service replacing the older "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's name as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|l|ɪ|t}} instead of {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|əl}}.<ref name="dotcom" /> Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the "[[.it]]" top-level domain, such as renewal restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Masad |first=Amjad |date=February 13, 2021 |title=what happened to repl.it??? |url=https://replit.com/talk/ask/Hi-this-was-by-mistake-We-will-be-movin/121581/449321 }}</ref>

Replit originally was only a REPL. However, the [[Ace (editor)|Ace]] editor was eventually implemented, allowing for editing of programs as well. In 2017, Replit switched to the Monaco code editor, the same editor used in [[Visual Studio Code]]. Due to issues with mobile support, the code editor was switched to [[CodeMirror]] over 2021 - 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Faris |title=Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You Use in the Browser |url=https://blog.replit.com/code-editors |access-date=2 March 2022 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> This decision was met with backlash and criticism from the Replit community, which eventually calmed down after bugs and major issues were addressed.

Replit offered Teams for Education,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Teams for Education |url=https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref> a product to assist in teaching programming in the classroom. It was announced that from November 15th 2023, bug fixes and features would no longer be added to teams for education.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-14 |title=The end of teams for education |url=https://ask.replit.com/t/the-end-of-teams-for-education/82771/23?page=2 |access-date=2023-12-05 |website=Replit Ask |language=en}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=December 2023}}

== Features ==
Replit is an [[online integrated development environment]] ([[integrated development environment|IDE]]) that can be used with a variety of programming languages.

Replit originally supported over 50 programming language but as of February 23, 2022, Replit uses the [[Nix (package manager)|Nix package manage]]<nowiki/>r<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=All New Repls are Powered By Nix |url=https://blog.replit.com/powered-by-nix |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> which allows users access to the entire Nixpkgs package database. New Repls can be created through official language templates or through a user's custom Nix configuration. Users can configure anything from the [[Language Server Protocol]] to debugger support for a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Nix with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/nix-on-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref>

It uses the [[CodeMirror|CodeMirror 6]] editor component,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Betting on CodeMirror |url=https://blog.replit.com/codemirror |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> the same editor component employed by other major websites such as [[CodePen]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CodeMirror: Real-world uses |url=https://codemirror.net/2/doc/realworld.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=codemirror.net}}</ref>

Replit's supports collaborative coding with the ability for multiple users to edit a shared repl, real-time edits across files, and instant messaging.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Collaboratively code in realtime with Replit Multiplayer |url=https://replit.com/site/multiplayer |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref> Using a shared compute engine, code can be run and displayed the same to multiple users in a Repl.<ref name=":1" />

Repl environments have built-in [[source control]] via [[Git]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Git with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/git-with-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> on all Repls and users can switch branches, push files, and revert code. Replit allows for the pulling of code form a [[GitHub]] repository and linking Repls to GitHub repositories.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=GitHub and the Run button {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/github-and-run-button |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> Some Repls also have [[debugger]] and [[unit testing]] support. Replit uses the Debugger Adapter Protocol to provide debugging services in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Node.js]], and [[C++]] for all users connected to a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Multiplayer Debugging Experience for Python, Node.js, Java, and C/C++ |url=https://blog.replit.com/multiplayer-debugging |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Replit has zero-setup unit testing in several languages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=No-setup Unit Testing |url=https://blog.replit.com/unit-tests |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Repls also have [[Environment variable|secrets management]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Announcing Secrets Management |url=https://blog.replit.com/secrets |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> allowing users to hide values from others who see the Repl publicly.

Users could also import projects from [[Glitch (application)|Glitch]], which provides a similar service to Replit, though it is unknown if this feature is still officially supported; as of July 2022 it is functional.
