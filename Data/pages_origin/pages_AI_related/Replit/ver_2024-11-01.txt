'''Replit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|l|ɪ|t}}), formerly '''Repl.it''', is an American [[Startup company|start-up]] and an [[online integrated development environment]] (IDE).<ref name="techcrunch">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/repl-it-lets-you-program-in-your-browser/|title=Repl.it lets you program in your browser|website=TechCrunch|date=March 15, 2018 |language=en-US|access-date=January 5, 2019}}</ref> Replit allows users to create online [[Computer programming|programming]] projects called repls.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Odeh |first=Haya |date=2017-05-29 |title=Check out my Repl! |url=https://blog.replit.com/sessions-repls |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027180235/https://blog.replit.com/sessions-repls |archive-date=2021-10-27 |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit}}</ref>

== History ==
Replit was co-founded by [[programmers]] Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in 2016.<ref name="cnbc">{{Cite web |last=Rodriguez |first=Salvador |date=October 22, 2018 |title=Former Facebook engineer quit to build the programming tool he always wanted |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-leads-4point5-million-seed-round-in-replit.html |website=CNBC}}</ref><ref name="vator">{{Cite web |date=2019-04-30 |title=Today's Entrepreneur: Faris Masad |url=https://vator.tv/news/2019-04-30-todays-entrepreneur-faris-masad |access-date=2021-01-12 |website=VatorNews}}</ref> It was incorporated in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |date=2021-01-27 |title=Replit — Going Global |url=https://blog.replit.com/global |access-date=2024-04-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Once listed as a co-founder alongside Masad, Max Shawabkeh left the venture early on.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Repl.it |url=http://repl.it/about |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824072203if_/http://repl.it/about |archive-date=24 August 2014 |access-date=8 June 2021 |website=repl.it/about}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenberg |first1=Bart |title=#42 Computer Science 2.0: Part 1―Amjad Masad: Engineer, Codecademy; Co-inventor, repl.it |date=October 22, 2012 |url=https://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/software_designers/0042 |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Spina |first1=Carli |date=May 5, 2014 |title=Practice Programming Languages In Your Browser With Repl.it |url=https://carlispina.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/repl-it/ |access-date=8 June 2021}}</ref> Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "[[Read–eval–print loop|read–evaluate–print loop]]". 

Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook]], where he built development tools. He also helped found [[Codecademy]]. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit over a decade before its creation.<ref name="VB">{{cite web |last1=Sawers |first1=Paul |date=18 February 2021 |title=Replit raises $20 million for collaborative browser-based coding |url=https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/ |access-date=13 March 2021 |website=VentureBeat}}</ref>

In 2009, having seen significant advancements in browser and web technologies, Masad imagined a development environment built on the same premise as [[Google Docs]]; that is, allowing the user to write and share code all in a web browser. In 2011, prior to Haya Odeh’s involvement, he produced an early [[open-source]] version of this concept, called “JSRepl”. After the name “Repl.it” was chosen, Odeh was recruited to design the logo and website.<ref name="dotcom">{{Cite web |last=Masad |first=Amjad |title=Replit Dotcom |url=https://blog.replit.com/dotcom |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=Replit |date=March 9, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> Because Masad then spent a few years working at various companies,<ref name="techcrunch" /> including [[Udacity]] and Codecademy, JSRepl was used to power Udacity and Codecademy's in-browser tutorials.<ref name="VB"/> Development was paused during this period. Masad and Odeh together resumed it afterward.

As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something emulated in the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards professional developers.<ref name="techcrunch" />

Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default [[domain name]] for the web service, replacing the older "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's name as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|l|ɪ|t}} instead of {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛ|p|əl}}.<ref name="dotcom"/> Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the "[[.it]]" top-level domain, such as renewal restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Masad |first=Amjad |title=what happened to repl.it??? |url=https://replit.com/talk/ask/Hi-this-was-by-mistake-We-will-be-movin/121581/449321 |access-date=2024-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415144204/https://replit.com/talk/ask/Hi-this-was-by-mistake-We-will-be-movin/121581/449321 |archive-date=2021-04-15 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref>

Replit originally was only a REPL. However, the [[Ace (editor)|Ace]] editor was eventually implemented, allowing for editing of programs as well. In 2017, Replit switched to the Monaco code editor, the same editor used in [[Visual Studio Code]]. Due to issues with mobile support, the code editor was switched to [[CodeMirror]] over 2021 - 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Masad |first1=Faris |title=Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You Use in the Browser |url=https://blog.replit.com/code-editors |access-date=2 March 2022 |website=Replit Blog|date=December 13, 2021 }}</ref> This decision was met with backlash and criticism from the Replit community, which eventually calmed down after bugs and major issues were addressed.

From 2022 to 2024, Replit offered Teams for Education as a free product to assist [[computer science]] teachers in the classroom. In November 2023, it was announced to users that it would be discontinued. In a post on [[Twitter]], Masad explained that the service was uneconomical for the business to maintain.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mann |first=Tobias |title=CompSci teachers panic as Replit pulls the plug on educational IDE |url=https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/comp_sci_panic/ |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=The Register |language=en}}</ref> The following month, an official blog post on the Replit site confirmed the decision, and identified August 2024 as when Teams for Education would be entirely "removed from the Replit product".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Update on Teams for Education |url=https://blog.replit.com/update-on-teams-for-education |access-date=2024-09-06 |website=Replit |date=December 6, 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2024, it was announced that Replit would be moving from its [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] headquarters in [[San Francisco]] to a new location in [[Foster City, California|Foster City]].<ref>https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1785125298398446016 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Camila Thomsen on LinkedIn: Exciting times at Replit, we are moving HQ to a larger office space in… |url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/camila-thomsen-8839891b_exciting-times-at-replit-we-are-moving-hq-activity-7186435597564063744-WykG |access-date=2024-04-30 |website=www.linkedin.com |language=en}}</ref>

In August 2024, the site's [[Freemium|free]] or "Starter" [[Subscription business model|plan]] was changed, limiting users to creating a maximum of three public projects.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pricing |url=https://replit.com/pricing |access-date=2024-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240905132833/https://replit.com/pricing |archive-date=2024-09-05 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref> Users are allowed to keep any projects they created prior to the change.

== Features ==
Replit is an [[online integrated development environment]] ([[integrated development environment|IDE]]) that can be used with a variety of programming languages.

Replit originally supported over 50 programming language but as of February 23, 2022, Replit uses the [[Nix (package manager)|Nix package manager]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=All New Repls are Powered By Nix |url=https://blog.replit.com/powered-by-nix |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog|date=February 23, 2022 }}</ref> which allows users access to the entire Nixpkgs package database. New Repls can be created through official language templates or through a user's custom Nix configuration. Users can configure anything from the [[Language Server Protocol]] to debugger support for a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Nix with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/nix-on-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref>

It uses the [[CodeMirror|CodeMirror 6]] editor component,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Betting on CodeMirror |url=https://blog.replit.com/codemirror |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog|date=March 9, 2022 }}</ref> the same editor component employed by other major websites such as [[CodePen]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=CodeMirror: Real-world uses |url=https://codemirror.net/2/doc/realworld.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=codemirror.net}}</ref>

Replit supports collaborative coding with the ability for multiple users to edit a shared repl, real-time edits across files, and instant messaging.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Collaboratively code in realtime with Replit Multiplayer |url=https://replit.com/site/multiplayer |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit |language=en}}</ref> Using a shared compute engine, code can be run and displayed the same to multiple users in a Repl.<ref name=":1" />

Repl environments have built-in [[source control]] via [[Git]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Using Git with Replit {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/git-with-replit |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> on all Repls and users can switch branches, push files, and revert code. Replit allows for the pulling of code from a [[GitHub]] repository and linking Repls to GitHub repositories.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=GitHub and the Run button {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/github-and-run-button |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Docs |language=en}}</ref> Some Repls also have [[debugger]] and [[unit testing]] support. Replit uses the Debugger Adapter Protocol to provide debugging services in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Node.js]], and [[C++]] for all users connected to a Repl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Multiplayer Debugging Experience for Python, Node.js, Java, and C/C++ |url=https://blog.replit.com/multiplayer-debugging |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog|date=July 2, 2021 }}</ref> Replit has zero-setup unit testing in several languages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=No-setup Unit Testing |url=https://blog.replit.com/unit-tests |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog}}</ref> Repls also have [[Environment variable|secrets management]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Replit |title=Announcing Secrets Management |url=https://blog.replit.com/secrets |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Replit Blog|date=April 18, 2021 }}</ref> allowing users to hide values from others who see the Repl publicly. Repls also have databases with key-value data supported in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Node.js]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]]. Databases still can be accessed in other languages by using system calls.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-05-03 |title=Replit Key-Value Database {{!}} Replit Docs |url=https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/replit-database |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=docs.replit.com |language=en}}</ref>

Users could also import projects from [[Glitch (application)|Glitch]], which provides a similar service to Replit, though it is unknown if this feature is still officially supported; as of July 2022 it is functional.

In October 2023, Replit made new features powered by machine learning available to all users. These features include suggestions for code completion and chat software development. The announcement of Replit AI's public release states, "Replit will become a synonym of AI for software creators -- only then we will have accomplished our mission."<ref name="Replit - Announcing Replit AI for All">{{cite web | url=https://blog.replit.com/ai4all | title=Replit — Announcing Replit AI for All | date=October 9, 2023 }}</ref> Replit's FAQ states the algorithms were trained on public code. All public code hosted on Replit is subject to the [[MIT License|MIT license]] and may be used to train [[Machine learning|machine learning models]]. User settings are available to disable suggestions from machine learning. In order to prevent code from being used to train Replit algorithms, users must make their Repl private.<ref name="Replit Docs: Replit AI FAQ">{{cite web | url=https://docs.replit.com/power-ups/replitai/faq | title=FAQ &#124; Replit Docs | date=August 30, 2024 }}</ref>
