'''Android Things''' (codenamed '''Brillo''') is an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[embedded operating system]] platform by Google, announced at [[Google I/O]] 2015. It is aimed to be used with low-power and memory constrained [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) devices, which are usually built from different [[Microcontroller|MCU]] platforms.<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/google-developing-brillo-internet-of-things-os-based-on-android/ Google developing “Brillo” Internet of Things OS based on Android]</ref><ref>[http://www.androidauthority.com/project-brillo-google-io-612159/ Project Brillo is Google’s new Internet of Things OS]</ref> As an [[Internet_of_things|IoT]] OS it is designed to work as low as 32–64 MB of RAM.<ref>[http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/05/23/google-brillo-internet-of-things-operating-system/ Google Brillo – An Internet Of Things OS That Runs on 32 MB RAM]</ref> It will support [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] and [[Wi-Fi]].<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8677119/google-project-brillo-iot-google-io-2015 Google announces Brillo, an operating system for the Internet of Things]</ref> Along with Brillo, Google also introduced the [[Weave (protocol)|Weave]] protocol, which these devices can use to communicate with other compatible devices.<ref name="ars-androidthings">{{cite web|title=Google’s new "Android Things" OS hopes to solve awful IoT security|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/google-brillo-rebrands-as-android-things-googles-internet-of-things-os/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref>
