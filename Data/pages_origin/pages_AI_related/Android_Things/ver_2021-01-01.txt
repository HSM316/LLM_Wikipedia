== History ==

=== Pre-release ===
During [[Google I/O 2015]], Google announced an upcoming [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[embedded operating system]] platform, codenamed '''Brillo'''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=King|first=Rachel|title=Google I/O 2015: Google unveils Brillo as operating system for Internet of Things|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-io-2015-android-chrome-cloud-announcement-keynote/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=ZDNet|language=en}}</ref> At the time, project aimed to support low-memory devices with as little as 32-64 MB of RAM.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-23|title=Google Brillo - An Internet Of Things OS That Runs on 32 MB RAM|url=https://trak.in/tags/business/2015/05/23/google-brillo-internet-of-things-operating-system/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=Trak.in - Indian Business of Tech, Mobile & Startups|language=en-US}}</ref> Brillo platform was not just an OS for IoT devices, but instead a complete software stack with cloud component which included management console for device provisioning and update delivery. Brillo supported [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] and [[Weave (protocol)|Weave protocol]] for communicating with cloud (including update delivery), communication with Android phones, and other compatible devices (including [[Google Nest]] products).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2016-12-13|title=Google’s new “Android Things” OS hopes to solve awful IoT security|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/google-brillo-rebrands-as-android-things-googles-internet-of-things-os/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Miller|first=Ross|date=2015-05-28|title=Google announces Brillo, an operating system for the Internet of Things|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8677119/google-project-brillo-iot-google-io-2015|access-date=2020-12-22|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

In 2016, Google revamped Brillo under the new name '''Android Things'''.

Originally, Android Things was aimed for low-power and memory constrained [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) devices, which are usually built from different [[Microcontroller|MCU]] platforms.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> 

=== Release ===
In 2018, Android Things was officially released, with version number 1.0. At the same time, multiple OEMs (including [[JBL (company)|JBL]], [[Lenovo]], and [[LG Electronics]])<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|title=Google Home Hub—Under the hood, it’s nothing like other Google smart displays|language=en-us|work=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-home-hub-under-the-hood-its-nothing-like-other-google-smart-displays/|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref> released smart home devices powered by Android Things.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2018-05-07|title=Android Things 1.0 launches, Google promises 3 years of updates for every device|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/android-things-hits-version-1-0-with-centralized-google-update-system/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref> These devices were based on two [[Qualcomm]] "Home Hub" systems-on-chip solutions and Google-provided implementations of Android Things tailored for [[Google Assistant]]-powered [[smart speaker]]s and displays.<ref name=":5" />

In February 2019, Android Things refocused on smart speakers and displays. The project dropped support for resource-constrained IoT devices and changed focus to smartphone-class devices.<ref name=":1" />

=== Shutdown ===
In December 2020, Android Things Dashboard FAQ page was quietly updated with a notice about upcoming Android Things shut down. Android Things Dashboard will stop accepting new device registrations and projects on January 5, 2021, and will stop distributing updates on January 5, 2022 (at which point "the console will be turned down completely and all project data will be permanently deleted — including build configurations and factory images.")<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=2020-12-17|title=Google kills Android Things, its IoT OS, in January|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/google-kills-android-things-its-iot-os-in-january/|access-date=2020-12-20|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us}}</ref>
