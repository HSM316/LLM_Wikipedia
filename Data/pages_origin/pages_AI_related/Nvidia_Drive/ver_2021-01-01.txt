{{short description|Computer platform by Nvidia}}
'''Nvidia Drive''' is a computer platform by [[Nvidia]], aimed at providing [[autonomous car]] and [[driver assistance]] functionality powered by [[deep learning]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Umar Zakir Abdul |first=Hamid |title=Current Collision Mitigation Technologies for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems–A Survey |journal=PERINTIS eJournal |date=2016 |volume=6 |issue=2 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311981545 |display-authors=etal|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/ NVIDIA DRIVE]</ref> The platform was introduced at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/cars-drive-autonomously-with-nvidia-x1-based-computer/ |title=Cars drive autonomously with Nvidia X1-based computer|accessdate=29 March 2016|agency=Cnet|publisher=Cnet|date=5 January 2015}}</ref> An enhanced version, the Drive PX 2 was introduced at CES a year later, in January 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/01/04/nvidia-announces-another-car-supercomputer-at-ces/ |title=Nvidia Announces Another Car 'Supercomputer' at CES|accessdate=29 March 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>

== Maxwell based ==
The first of Nvidia's autonomous chips was announced at CES 2015, based on the [[Maxwell (microarchitecture)|Maxwell GPU microarchitecture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.anandtech.com/show/8811/nvidia-tegra-x1-preview/4 |title=NVIDIA Tegra X1 Preview & Architecture Analysis|last=Smith|first=Joshua Ho, Ryan|access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref> The line-up consisted of two platforms: 

=== Drive CX ===
The Drive CX was based on a single [[Tegra#Tegra X1|Tegra X1]] [[System on a chip|SoC]] (System on a Chip) and was marketed as a [[digital cockpit computer]], providing a rich dashboard, navigation and multimedia experience.
Early Nvidia press releases reported that the Drive CX board will be capable of carrying either a Tegra K1 or a Tegra X1.<ref>[http://www.nvidia.de/object/nvidia-drive-tegra-X1-jan4-2015-de.html NVIDIA ebnet den Weg für die Autos von Morgen mit den NVIDIA-DRIVE-Automotive-Computern]</ref>

=== Drive PX ===
[[File:NVIDIA Drive PX, Computex Taipei 20150601.jpg|thumb|Drive PX]]
The first version of Drive PX is based on two Tegra X1 SoCs, and was an initial development platform targeted at (semi-)autonomous driving cars.

== Pascal based ==
Drive PX platforms based on the [[Pascal (microarchitecture)|Pascal GPU microarchitecture]] were first announced at CES 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.anandtech.com/show/9903/nvidia-announces-drive-px-2-pascal-power-for-selfdriving-cars |title=NVIDIA Announces DRIVE PX 2 – Pascal Power For Self-Driving Cars|last=Smith|first=Ryan |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref> This time only a new version of Drive PX was announced, but in multiple configurations.

=== Drive PX 2 ===
The Nvidia Drive PX 2 is based on one or two [[Tegra#Tegra X2|Tegra X2]] SoCs where each SoC contains 2 Denver cores, 4 ARM A57 cores and a GPU from the [[Pascal (microarchitecture)|Pascal generation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-px.html |title=Autonomous Car Development Platform from NVIDIA DRIVE PX2|website=www.nvidia.com |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref> There are two real world board configurations:
* for AutoCruise: 1× Tegra X2 + 1 Pascal GPU
* for AutoChauffeur: 2× Tegra X2 + 2 Pascal GPU's
There is further the proposal from Nvidia for fully autonomous driving by means of combining multiple items of the AutoChauffeur board variant and connecting these boards using e.g. UART, CAN, LIN, FlexRay, USB, 1 Gbit Ethernet or 10 Gbit Ethernet. For any derived custom PCB design the option of linking the Tegra X2 Processors via some PCIe bus bridge is further available, according to board block diagrams that can be found on the web.

All [[Tesla Motors]] vehicles manufactured from mid-October 2016 include a Drive PX 2, which will be used for neural net processing to enable [[Tesla Autopilot|Enhanced Autopilot]] and full self-driving functionality.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lambert|first1=Fred |title=All new Teslas are equipped with NVIDIA's new Drive PX 2 AI platform for self-driving|url= https://electrek.co/2016/10/21/all-new-teslas-are-equipped-with-nvidias-new-drive-px-2-ai-platform-for-self-driving/ |accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Electrek |date=21 October 2016}}</ref> Other applications are [[Roborace]].<ref name="el2017-05">{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2017/05/20/roborace-debuts-their-driverless-robocar-on-track-at-the-paris-eprix/ |title=Roborace debuts their driverless "Robocar" on track at the Paris ePrix |last1=Dow|first1=Jameson |date=20 May 2017|publisher=Electrek |accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref> Disassembling the Nvidia-based control unit from a recent Tesla car showed that a Tesla was using a modified single-chip Drive PX 2 AutoCruise, with a GP106 GPU added as a [[Mobile PCI Express Module|MXM Module]].

== Volta based ==
Systems based on the [[Volta (microarchitecture)|Volta GPU microarchitecture]] were first announced at CES 2017<ref name="anand_keynote">{{cite news|last1=Cutress|first1=Ian|last2=Tallis|first2=Billy|title=CES 2017: Nvidia Keynote Liveblog|url= http://www.anandtech.com/show/10999/ces-2017-nvidia-keynote-live-blog |accessdate=9 January 2017|publisher=Anandtech.com |date=4 January 2016}}</ref>

=== Drive PX Xavier ===
The first Volta based Drive PX system was announced at CES 2017 as the Xavier AI Car Supercomputer.<ref name="anand_keynote" /> It was re-presented at CES 2018 as Drive PX Xavier.<ref name="ces_2018">{{cite news|last1=Baldwin|first1=Roberto|title=NVIDIA unveils its powerful Xavier SOC for self-driving cars|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/07/nvidia-xavier-soc-self-driving-cars/|accessdate=8 January 2018|publisher=Engadget|date=8 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="nvidia_drive_px">[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-px/ Autonomous Car Development Platform from NVIDIA DRIVE PX2]</ref> Initial reports of the [[Tegra#Xavier|Xavier]] SoC suggested a single chip with similar processing power to the Drive PX 2 Autochauffeur system.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan |title=Nvidia Teases Xavier, A High Performance SoC for Drive PX & AI|url= http://www.anandtech.com/show/10714/nvidia-teases-xavier-a-highperformance-arm-soc |accessdate=22 June 2017|publisher=Anandtech |date=28 September 2016}}</ref> However, in 2017 the performance of the Xavier-based system was later revised upward, to 50% greater than Drive PX 2 Autochauffeur system.<ref name="anand_keynote" /> Drive PX Xavier is supposed to deliver 30 INT8 TOPS of performance while consuming only 30 watts of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/drive-px/|title=Autonomous Car Development Platform from NVIDIA DRIVE PX2|website=NVIDIA|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> This spreads across two distinct units, the iGPU with 20 INT8 TOPS as published early and the somewhat later on announced, newly introduced DLA that provided an additional 10 INT8 TOPS.

=== Drive PX Pegasus ===
In October 2017 Nvidia and partner development companies announced the Drive PX Pegasus system, based upon two Xavier CPU/GPU devices and two post-Volta ([[Turing_(microarchitecture)|Turing]]) generation GPUs. The companies stated the third generation Drive PX system would be capable of [[Autonomous car#Levels of driving automation|Level 5]] autonomous driving, with a total of 320 INT8 TOPS of AI computational power and a 500 Watts [[thermal design power|TDP]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11913/nvidia-announces-drive-px-pegasus-at-gtc-europe-2017-feat-nextgen-gpus|title=NVIDIA Announces Drive PX Pegasus at GTC Europe 2017: Level 5 Self-Driving Hardware, Feat.
