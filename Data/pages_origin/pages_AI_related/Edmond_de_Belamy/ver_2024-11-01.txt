'''''Edmond de Belamy''''', sometimes referred to as '''''Portrait of Edmond de Belamy''''', is a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) [[portrait painting]] constructed by Paris-based arts collective '''Obvious''' in 2018 from [[WikiArt]]{{'s}} artwork database.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alleyne |first=Allyssia |date=2018-10-25 |title=AI-produced artwork sells for $433K, smashing expectations |url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/obvious-ai-art-christies-auction-smart-creativity/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240127010425/https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/obvious-ai-art-christies-auction-smart-creativity/index.html |archive-date=January 27, 2024 |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> Printed on canvas, the work belongs to a series of [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative images]] called '''''La Famille de Belamy'''''. The print is known for being sold for {{Currency|432,500|USD}} during a [[Christie's]]{{'s}} auction.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Todorovic |first1=Milos |title=AI and Heritage: A Discussion on Rethinking Heritage in a Digital World |journal=International Journal of Cultural and Social Studies |date=2024 |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=6|doi=10.46442/intjcss.1397403 |url=https://www.academia.edu/121596389/AI_and_Heritage_A_Discussion_on_Rethinking_Heritage_in_a_Digital_World |access-date=4 July 2024}}</ref>

The name ''Belamy'' is a [[pun]] based on [[Ian Goodfellow]], inventor of GANs. In [[French language|French]], "bel ami" means "good friend", which is an allude to Goodfellow's name.

The work has been criticized as having been created with another AI artist's uncredited code.

== Auction ==
It gained media attention after [[Christie's]] announced its intention to auction the piece as the first artwork created using [[artificial intelligence]] to be featured in the "Prints & Multiples" sale at the Christie's Images [[New York City|New York]] auction.

== Reception ==
The piece has been criticized because it was created using a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) [[Software package (installation)|software package]] that was implemented by Robbie Barrat, a then-19-year-old AI artist who was not affiliated with Obvious. Although they did not originally publicize that they were using Barrat's code, Caselles-Dupré later admitted that they had used the code from Barrat with little modification. "If you’re just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified," Caselles-Dupré said. "But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there." Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that Barrat provide them with support and custom features.<ref name=":0" /> 

On the same day that ''Edmond de Belamy'' was sold, Barrat posted two images of comparison between ''Edmond de Belamy'' and his "outputs from a [[Neural network (machine learning)|neural network]] [he] trained and put online *over a year ago*<!-- Keep the asterisks -->" on [[Twitter]], writing that they used his code only to later sell the results.<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=1055285640420483073 |user=videodrome |title=Does anyone else care about this? Am I crazy for thinking that they really just used my network and are selling the results? |first=Robbie |last=Barrat |date=October 25, 2018 |access-date=May 31, 2024}}</ref> [[Mario Klingemann]] wrote that "You could argue that probably 90 percent of the actual 'work' was done by [Barrat]."<ref name=":0" />
