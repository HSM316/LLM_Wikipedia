However, [[biological computing|biological computers]], even if both highly artificial and intelligent, are typically distinguished from synthetic, often silicon-based, computers – they could however be combined or used for the design of either. Moreover, many tasks may be carried out inadequately by artificial intelligence even if its algorithms were transparent, understood, bias-free, apparently effective, and goal-aligned and its trained data sufficiently large and [[data cleansing|cleansed]] – such as in cases were the underlying or available metrics, [[value (ethics)|values]] or data are inappropriate. [[Computer-aided]] is a phrase used to describe human activities that make use of computing as tool in more comprehensive activities and systems such as AI for narrow tasks or making use of such without substantially relying on its results (see also: [[human-in-the-loop]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} A study described the biological as a limitation of AI with "as long as the biological system cannot be understood, formalized, and imitated, we will not be able to develop technologies that can mimic it" and that if it was understood this does not mean there being "a technological solution to imitate natural intelligence".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tugui |first1=Alexandru |last2=Danciulescu |first2=Daniela |last3=Subtirelu |first3=Mihaela-Simona |title=The Biological as a Double Limit for Artificial Intelligence: Review and Futuristic Debate |journal=International Journal of Computers Communications & Control |date=14 April 2019 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=253–271 |doi=10.15837/ijccc.2019.2.3536 |s2cid=146091906 |url=http://www.univagora.ro/jour/index.php/ijccc/article/view/3536 |language=en |issn=1841-9844|doi-access=free }}</ref> Technologies that integrate biology and are often AI-based include [[biorobotics]].

In November 2023, researchers at [[Google DeepMind]] and [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to [[materials science]] by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic [[Crystal structure|crystal structures]]. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the [[Materials Project]] database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nuñez |first=Michael |date=2023-11-29 |title=Google DeepMind’s materials AI has already discovered 2.2 million new crystals |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-deepminds-materials-ai-has-already-discovered-2-2-million-new-crystals/ |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Merchant |first=Amil |last2=Batzner |first2=Simon |last3=Schoenholz |first3=Samuel S. |last4=Aykol |first4=Muratahan |last5=Cheon |first5=Gowoon |last6=Cubuk |first6=Ekin Dogus |date=December 2023 |title=Scaling deep learning for materials discovery |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9 |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=624 |issue=7990 |pages=80–85 |doi=10.1038/s41586-023-06735-9 |issn=1476-4687|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Peplow |first=Mark |date=2023-11-29 |title=Google AI and robots join forces to build new materials |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5 |journal=Nature |language=en |doi=10.1038/d41586-023-03745-5}}</ref>

[[File:Restoration using Artificial intelligence.jpg|thumb|Image restoration]]
AI applications analyze media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos or [[user-generated content]]. The solutions often involve [[computer vision]].

Typical scenarios include the analysis of images using [[object recognition]] or face recognition techniques, or the [[video content analysis|analysis of video]] for scene recognizing scenes, objects or faces. AI-based media analysis can facilitate media search, the creation of descriptive keywords for content, content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time), [[speech recognition|speech to text]] for archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for ad placement.

==== Art analysis ====
In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. Although the main goal of the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal |last1=Cetinic |first1=Eva |last2=She |first2=James |date=2022-02-16 |title=Understanding and Creating Art with AI: Review and Outlook |journal=ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=66:1–66:22 |doi=10.1145/3475799 |arxiv=2102.09109 |s2cid=231951381 |issn=1551-6857}}</ref>

The [[Royal Australian Air Force|Royal Australian Air]] Force (RAAF) [[Air and Space Operations Center|Air Operations Division]] (AOD) uses AI for [[expert systems]]. AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.<ref>{{Cite news|date=29 June 2016|title=AI bests Air Force combat tactics experts in simulated dogfights|work=[[Ars Technica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/ai-bests-air-force-combat-tactics-experts-in-simulated-dogfights/}}</ref>

Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated.

AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or in [[Swarm robotics|swarms]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Randolph M. |last2=Laird |first2=John E. |last3=Nielsen |first3=Paul E. |last4=Coulter |first4=Karen J. |last5=Kenny |first5=Patrick |last6=Koss |first6=Frank V. |title=Automated Intelligent Pilots for Combat Flight Simulation |journal=AI Magazine |date=15 March 1999 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v20i1.1438 }}</ref>

AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information from [[TF-30]] documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the [[F-111C]]. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.

[[Speech recognition]] allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones.

Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,<ref>[http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Research/Projects/AIDA/ AIDA Homepage]. Kbs.twi.tudelft.nl (17 April 1997). Retrieved 21 July 2013.</ref> or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.
