{{Artificial intelligence}}
[[Artificial intelligence]], defined as intelligence exhibited by machines, has many applications in today's society. More specifically, it is [[Weak AI]], the form of AI where programs are developed to perform specific tasks, that is being utilized for a wide range of activities including [[medical diagnosis]], [[electronic trading platform]]s, [[robot control]], and [[remote sensing]]. AI has been used to develop and advance numerous fields and industries, including finance, healthcare, education, transportation, and more.

== AI for Good ==
[[AI for Good]] is an ITU initiative supporting institutions employing AI to tackle some of the world's greatest economic and social challenges. For example, the University of Southern California launched the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address socially relevant problems such as homelessness. At Stanford, researchers are using AI to analyze satellite images to identify which areas have the highest poverty levels.<ref name=":03">United States, National Science and Technology Council – Committee on Technology. Executive Office of the President. (2016). Preparing for the future of artificial intelligence.</ref>

In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and development of growing crops. New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/big-data/article/agriculture-harvests-big-data.html|title=The Future of AI in Agriculture|website=Intel|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> These advances go on including Crop and Soil Monitoring, [[Agricultural robot|Agricultural Robots]], and [[Predictive analytics|Predictive Analytics]]. Crop and soil monitoring uses new algorithms and data collected on the field to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/ai-agriculture-present-applications-impact/|title=AI in Agriculture – Present Applications and Impact {{!}} Emerj - Artificial Intelligence Research and Insight|last=Sennaar|first=Kumba|website=Emerj|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>

More specializations of AI in agriculture is one such as greenhouse [[automation]], [[simulation]], [[Modeling and simulation|modeling]], and optimization techniques.

Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future there will need to be at least a 70% increase in yield from agriculture to sustain this new demand. More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help reach that goal.<ref>Bulletin of the University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca. Agriculture . 2011, Vol. 68 Issue 1, p284-293. 10p.</ref>

== Aviation ==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}
The [[Air and Space Operations Center|Air Operations Division]] (AOD) uses AI for the rule based [[expert systems]]. The AOD has use for [[artificial intelligence]] for surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/ai-bests-air-force-combat-tactics-experts-in-simulated-dogfights/|title=AI bests Air Force combat tactics experts in simulated dogfights | work=[[Ars Technica]] | date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>

The use of artificial intelligence in simulators is proving to be very useful for the AOD. Airplane simulators are using artificial intelligence in order to process the data taken from simulated flights. Other than simulated flying, there is also simulated aircraft warfare. The computers are able to come up with the best success scenarios in these situations. The computers can also create strategies based on the placement, size, speed and strength of the forces and counter forces. Pilots may be given assistance in the air during combat by computers. The artificial intelligent programs can sort the information and provide the pilot with the best possible maneuvers, not to mention getting rid of certain maneuvers that would be impossible for a human being to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations so computer simulated pilots are used to gather data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Randolph M.|last2=Laird|first2=John E.|last3=Nielsen|first3=Paul E.|last4=Coulter|first4=Karen J.|last5=Kenny|first5=Patrick|last6=Koss|first6=Frank V.|date=1999-03-15|title=Automated Intelligent Pilots for Combat Flight Simulation|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1438|journal=AI Magazine|volume=20|issue=1|pages=27|issn=0738-4602}}</ref> These computer simulated pilots are also used to train future [[air traffic controllers]].

The system used by the AOD in order to measure performance was the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS. It is a rule based expert system put together by collecting information from [[TF-30]] documents and the expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the RAAF F-111C. The performance system was also used to replace specialized workers. The system allowed the regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.

The AOD also uses artificial intelligence in [[speech recognition]] software. The air traffic controllers are giving directions to the artificial pilots and the AOD wants to the pilots to respond to the ATC's with simple responses. The programs that incorporate the speech software must be trained, which means they use [[neural networks]]. The program used, the Verbex 7000, is still a very early program that has plenty of room for improvement. The improvements are imperative because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.

The Artificial Intelligence supported Design of Aircraft,<ref>[http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Research/Projects/AIDA/ AIDA Homepage]. Kbs.twi.tudelft.nl (April 17, 1997). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.

In 2003, [[NASA]]'s [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], and many other companies, created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing zone can be reached.<ref>[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/c/c9/88798main_srfcs.pdf The Story of Self-Repairing Flight Control Systems.] NASA Dryden. (April 2003). Retrieved on 2016-08-25.</ref> The software compensates for all the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. The neural network used in the software proved to be effective and marked a triumph for artificial intelligence.

The Integrated Vehicle Health Management system, also used by NASA, on board an aircraft must process and interpret data taken from the various sensors on the aircraft. The system needs to be able to determine the structural integrity of the aircraft. The system also needs to implement protocols in case of any damage taken the vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010055588.pdf|title=Flight Demonstration Of X-33 Vehicle Health Management System Components On The F/A-18 Systems Research Aircraft|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

Haitham Baomar and Peter Bentley are leading a team from the University College of London to develop an artificial intelligence based Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS) designed to teach an autopilot system to behave like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation such as severe weather, turbulence, or system failure.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/ai-wields-power-make-flying-safer-maybe-even-pleasant/|title=AI Wields the Power to Make Flying Safer—and Maybe Even Pleasant|last=Adams|first=Eric|date=March 28, 2017|journal=Wired|access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> Educating the autopilot relies on the concept of supervised [[machine learning]] “which treats the young autopilot as a human apprentice going to a flying school”.<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot records the actions of the human pilot generating learning models using [[artificial neural network]]s.<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot is then given full control and observed by the pilot as it executes the training exercise.<ref name=":0" />

== Computer science ==
AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI. (See [[AI effect]].) According to {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=15}}, all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:
[[time sharing]],
[[Interpreted language|interactive interpreters]],
[[graphical user interface]]s and the [[computer mouse]],
[[Rapid application development]] environments,
the [[linked list]] data structure,
[[automatic storage management]],
[[Third-generation programming language|symbolic programming]],
[[functional programming]],
[[dynamic programming]] and
[[object-oriented programming]].

AI can be used to potentially determine the developer of anonymous binaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

AI can be used to create other AI. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created [[NASNet]], a system optimized for [[ImageNet]] and COCO. According to Google, NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Google AI creates its own 'child' bot|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-child-ai-bot-nasnet-automl-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-a8093201.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=The Independent|date=5 December 2017}}</ref>

== Deepfake ==

In June 2016, a research team from the visual computing group of the [[Technical University of Munich]] and from [[Stanford University]] developed Face2Face,<ref name = face>{{Cite web | url=http://www.niessnerlab.org/projects/thies2016face.html | title=TUM Visual Computing: Prof. Matthias Nießner}}</ref> a program which animates the face of a target person, transposing the facial expressions of an exterior source. The technology has been demonstrated animating the lips of people including [[Barack Obama]] and [[Vladimir Putin]]. Since then, other methods have been demonstrated based on [[deep neural network]], from which the name "[[deepfake]]" was taken.

Hollywood film studios had already used the technique in animated films,{{which|date=April 2019}} but it took time and efforts from professionals. The main difference is that today anyone can use a deep fake software and rig videos.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In September 2018, the U.S. Senator [[Mark Warner]] proposed to penalize [[social media]] companies that allow sharing of deepfake documents on their platform.<ref name = wpdp>{{Cite journal | url=https://www.wired.com/story/will-deepfakes-disrupt-the-midterm-election/ | title=Will 'Deepfakes' Disrupt the Midterm Election?| journal=Wired| date=November 2018}}</ref>

Vincent Nozick, a researcher from the [[Institut Gaspard Monge]], found a way to detect rigged documents by analyzing the movements of the [[eyelid]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The [[DARPA]] (a research group associated with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]) has given 68 million dollars to work on deepfake detection.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In Europe, the [[Horizon 2020]] program financed InVid, software designed to help journalists to detect fake documents.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

== Education ==
AI tutors could allow for students to get extra, one-on-one help. They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students, that may be caused by tutor labs or human tutors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/artificial-intelligence-in-the-classroom-role|title=The Role Of Artificial Intelligence In The Classroom|date=14 April 2018|website=eLearning Industry|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> In future classrooms, ambient informatics can play a beneficial role. Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences.<ref name="auto">Smith, Lawrence. “Everyware.” Prezi.com, 10 Jan. 2019, https://www.prezi.com/ai2kkqkeolus/everyware-technopoly/</ref> Study devices could be able to create lessons, problems, and games to tailor to the specific student's needs, and give immediate feedback.

But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects, if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative, unintended effects on society.<ref>Quan-Haase, Anabel. Technology and Society: Social Networks, Power, and Inequality. 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2016. Pg. 43-44.</ref> An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder students’ ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html|title=Growing Up Digital, Wired for Distraction|first=Matt|last=Richtel|date=November 21, 2010|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Also, AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity.<ref name="auto" />

== Finance ==

=== Algorithmic trading ===
[[Algorithmic trading]] involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitudes greater than any human is capable of, often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention. Such trading is called [[High-frequency Trading]], and it represents one of the fastest growing sectors in financial trading. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios which are managed purely by AI systems. [[Automated trading system]]s are typically used by large institutional investors, but recent years have also seen an influx of smaller, proprietary firms trading with their own AI systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithmictrading.asp|title=Algorithmic Trading|last=|first=|date=2005-05-18|website=Investopedia|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Market analysis and data mining ===
Several large financial institutions have invested in AI engines to assist with their investment practices. [[BlackRock]]’s AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and to clients to help with investment decisions. Its wide range of functionalities includes the use of natural language processing to read text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use an AI engine called Sqreem (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) which can mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with the wealth management products they’d most likely want.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/beyond-robo-advisers-how-ai-could-rewire-wealth-management|title=Beyond Robo-Advisers: How AI Could Rewire Wealth Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Goldman Sachs uses [https://www.kensho.com/#/ Kensho], a market analytics platform that combines statistical computing with big data and natural language processing.

=== Personal finance ===
Several products are emerging that utilize AI to assist people with their personal finances. For example, Digit is an app powered by artificial intelligence that automatically helps consumers optimize their spending and savings based on their own personal habits and goals. The app can analyze factors such as monthly income, current balance, and spending habits, then make its own decisions and transfer money to the savings account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalantis.com/blog/five-best-ai-powered-chatbot-apps/|title=Five Best AI-Powered Chatbot Apps|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Wallet.AI, an upcoming startup in San Francisco, builds agents that analyze data that a consumer would leave behind, from Smartphone check-ins to tweets, to inform the consumer about their spending behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/02/artificial-intelligence-way-forward-personal-finance/|title=Is Artificial Intelligence the Way Forward for Personal Finance?|journal=Wired|last=|first=|date=2014-02-03|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Portfolio management ===
[[Robo-advisor]]s are becoming more widely used in the investment management industry. Robo-advisors provide financial advice and portfolio management with minimal human intervention. This class of financial advisers work based on algorithms built to automatically develop a financial portfolio according to the investment goals and risk tolerance of the clients. It can adjust to real-time changes in the market and accordingly calibrate the portfolio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-finance-applications/|title=Machine learning in finance applications|last=|first=|date=2016-08-15|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Underwriting ===
An online lender, Upstart, analyze vast amounts of consumer data and utilizes machine learning algorithms to develop credit risk models that predict a consumer's likelihood of default. Their technology will be licensed to banks for them to leverage for their underwriting processes as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bankinnovation.net/2017/04/machine-learning-is-the-future-of-underwriting-but-startups-wont-be-driving-it/|title=Machine Learning Is the Future of Underwriting, But Startups Won't be Driving It|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

ZestFinance developed their Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) Platform specifically for credit underwriting as well. This platform utilizes machine learning to analyze tens of thousands traditional and nontraditional variables (from purchase transactions to how a customer fills out a form) used in the credit industry to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories, such as millennials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170214005357/en/ZestFinance-Introduces-Machine-Learning-Platform-Underwrite-Millennials|title=ZestFinance Introduces Machine Learning Platform to Underwrite Millennials and Other Consumers with Limited Credit History|last=|first=|date=2017-02-14|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== History ===
The 1980s is really when AI started to become prominent in the finance world. This is when expert systems became more of a commercial product in the financial field. “For example, Dupont had built 100 expert systems which helped them save close to $10 million a year.”<ref>{{cite book|url=|title=History and applications|date=1 January 2002|journal=Expert Systems|volume=1|pages=1–22|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/B978-012443880-4/50045-4|last1=Durkin|first1=J.|isbn=978-0-12-443880-4}}</ref> One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system designed by K.C. Chen and Ting-peng Lian that was able to predict the 87-point drop in DOW Jones Industrial Average in 1986. “The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=K.C.|last2=Liang|first2=Ting-peng|date=1989|title=PROTRADER: An Expert System for Program Trading|url=http://www.ecrc.nsysu.edu.tw/liang/paper/3/PROTRADER%20An%20Expert%20System%20for%20Program%20Trading.pdf|journal=Managerial Finance|volume=15|issue=5|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the first expert systems that helped with financial plans was created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX) called the PlanPower. It was first commercially shipped in 1986. Its function was to help give financial plans for people with incomes over $75,000 a year. That then led to the Client Profiling System that was used for incomes between $25,000 and $200,000 a year.<ref>[https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=eds&scope=site&jrnl=10403981&AN=5560302&h=RWiKgQS2d%2fxcTfEjKLsBbkQ%2busFvJr90vu%2fRD0b05cxxv94ZMN1ylDkaz3hVwq42P8MOkiBJ10%2bH1T1w%2b6T2NQ%3d%3d&crl=f&resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&resultNs=Ehost&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d10403981%26AN%3d5560302 Expert Systems For Personal Financial Planning]</ref> The 1990s was a lot more about fraud detection. One of the systems that was started in 1993 was the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence system (FAIS).

== Hospitals and medicine ==
[[File:X-ray of a hand with automatic bone age calculation.jpg|thumb|[[Projectional radiography|X-ray]] of a hand, with automatic calculation of [[bone age]] by a computer software]]
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in healthcare}}

[[Artificial neural networks]] are used as [[clinical decision support system]]s for [[medical diagnosis]], such as in [[Concept Processing]] technology in [[electronic medical record|EMR]] software.

Other tasks in medicine that can potentially be performed by artificial intelligence and are beginning to be developed include:

*[[Computer-aided radiologic interpretation|Computer-aided interpretation of medical images]]. Such systems help scan digital images, ''e.g.'' from [[computed tomography]], for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases. A typical application is the detection of a tumor.

== Human resources and recruiting ==
Another application of AI is in the human resources and recruiting space. There are three ways AI is being used by human resources and recruiting professionals: to screen resumes and rank candidates according to their level of qualification, to predict candidate success in given roles through job matching platforms, and rolling out recruiting chat bots that can automate repetitive communication tasks.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Typically, resume screening involves a recruiter or other HR professional scanning through a database of resumes.

== Job search ==
The job market has seen a notable change due to artificial intelligence implementation. It has simplified the process for both recruiters and job seekers (i.e., Google for Jobs and applying online). According to [[Raj Mukherjee]] from Indeed.com, 65% of people launch a job search again within 91 days of being hired. AI-powered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by operating information on job skills, salaries, and user tendencies, matching people to the most relevant positions. Machine intelligence calculates what wages would be appropriate for a particular job, pulls and highlights resume information for recruiters using natural language processing, which extracts relevant words and phrases from text using specialized software. Another application is an AI resume builder which requires 5 minutes to compile a CV as opposed to spending hours doing the same job.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
In the AI age [[chatbots]] assist website visitors and solve daily workflows. Revolutionary AI tools complement people's skills and allow HR managers to focus on tasks of higher priority. However, Artificial Intelligence impact on jobs research suggests that by 2030 intelligent agents and robots can eliminate 30% of the world's human labor. Moreover, the research proves automation will displace between 400 and 800 million employees. [[Glassdoor|Glassdoor's]] research report states that recruiting and HR are expected to see much broader adoption of AI in job market 2018 and beyond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/02/02/the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-future-of-job-search|title=Raj Mukherjee|last=|first=|date=|website=Forbes|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Final_GD_ResearchReport_5Disruptions2018.pdf|title=Glassdoor's|last=|first=|date=|website=Glassdoor|access-date=}}</ref>

== Media and e-commerce ==
Some AI applications are geared towards the analysis of audiovisual media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos or [[user-generated content]]. The solutions often involve [[computer vision]], which is a major application area of AI.

Typical use case scenarios include the analysis of images using [[object recognition]] or [[face recognition]] techniques, or the [[video content analysis|analysis of video]] for recognizing relevant scenes, objects or faces. The motivation for using AI-based media analysis can be — among other things — the facilitation of media search, the creation of a set of descriptive keywords for a media item, media content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time), [[speech recognition|speech to text]] for archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for the placement of relevant advertisements.

Media analysis AI companies often provide their services over a [[REST API]] that enables machine-based automatic access to the technology and allows machine-reading of the results. For example, [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the video AI company Valossa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://valossa.com/|title=Video Recognition API of Valossa|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-02-08}}</ref> allow access to their media recognition technology by using RESTful APIs.

AI is also widely used in [[E-commerce]] applications like visual search, chatbots, and automated product tagging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Another generic application is to increase search discoverability and making social media content shoppable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Music ==
{{main|Music and artificial intelligence}}
While the evolution of music has always been affected by technology, artificial intelligence has enabled, through scientific advances, to emulate, at some extent, human-like composition.

Among notable early efforts, [[David Cope]] created an AI called [[Emily Howell]] that managed to become well known in the field of Algorithmic Computer Music.<ref name="ARS">{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/09/virtual-composer-makes-beautiful-musicand-stirs-controversy/|title=Virtual composer makes beautiful music—and stirs controversy|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|publisher=Ars Technica|date=30 September 2009}}</ref> The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.<ref>US Patent #7696426 https://www.google.com/patents/US7696426</ref>

The AI [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] created 2012 the first complete classical album fully composed by a computer.

Other endeavours, like [[AIVA]] (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), focus on composing symphonic music, mainly [[classical music]] for [[film scores]].<ref name="LWO">{{cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/de/kultur/aiva-une-jeune-start-up-qui-ne-manque-pas-d-ambitions-la-musique-classique-recomposee-57fbba6b5061e01abe83a1c2|title=La musique classique recomposée|last=Hick|first=Thierry|publisher=Luxemburger Wort|date=11 October 2016}}</ref> It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|professional association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://repertoire.sacem.fr/resultats?filters=parties&query=aiva&nbWorks=20|title=Résultats de recherche - La Sacem|website=repertoire.sacem.fr}}</ref>

Artificial intelligences can even produce music usable in a medical setting, with [[Melomics]]’s effort to use computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.<ref name="alergy">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/pai.12263 |pmid=25115240 |title=Melomics music medicine (M3) to lessen pain perception during pediatric prick test procedure |journal=Pediatric Allergy and Immunology |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=721–724 |year=2014 |last1=Requena |first1=Gloria |last2=Sánchez |first2=Carlos |last3=Corzo-Higueras |first3=José Luis |last4=Reyes-Alvarado |first4=Sirenia |last5=Rivas-Ruiz |first5=Francisco |last6=Vico |first6=Francisco |last7=Raglio |first7=Alfredo }}</ref>

Moreover, initiatives such as [[Google Magenta]], conducted by the [[Google Brain]] team, want to find out if an artificial intelligence can be capable of creating compelling art.<ref name="ENG">{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/23/google-magenta-machine-learning-music-art/|title=Google's 'Magenta' project will see if AIs can truly make art|last=Souppouris|first=Aaron|publisher=Engadget|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>

At Sony CSL Research Laboratory, their Flow Machines software has created pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. By analyzing unique combinations of styles and optimizing techniques, it can compose in any style.

Another artificial intelligence musical composition project, [[The Watson Beat]], written by [[IBM Research]], doesn't need a huge database of music like the Google Magenta and Flow Machines projects, since it uses [[Reinforcement Learning]] and [[Deep Belief Networks]] to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style. Since the software has been open sourced<ref name="twb">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/watson-beat |title= Watson Beat on GitHub|date= 2018-10-10}}</ref> musicians, such as [[Taryn Southern]]<ref name=taryn>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/music-written-by-artificial-intelligence/|title=Songs in the Key of AI|publisher=Wired|date=17 May 2018}}</ref> have been collaborating with the project to create music.

== News, publishing and writing ==
The company [[Narrative Science]] makes [[computer generated journalism|computer-generated news]] and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game in English. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.<ref>[http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html business intelligence solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103192105/http://www.narrativescience.com/solutions.html|date=November 3, 2011}}.

Another company, called Yseop, uses artificial intelligence to turn structured data into intelligent comments and recommendations in natural language. [[Yseop]] is able to write financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more at a speed of thousands of pages per second and in multiple languages including English, Spanish, French & German.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://yseop.com/EN/solutions.html |title=Artificial Intelligence Software that Writes like a Human Being |access-date=2013-03-11 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412055015/http://yseop.com/EN/solutions.html |archive-date=2013-04-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Boomtrain's is another example of AI that is designed to learn how to best engage each individual reader with the exact articles—sent through the right channel at the right time—that will be most relevant to the reader. It's like hiring a personal editor for each individual reader to curate the perfect reading experience.

IRIS.TV is helping media companies with its AI-powered video personalization and programming platform. It allows publishers and content owners to surface contextually relevant content to audiences based on consumer viewing patterns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanwolk/2018/09/12/user-data-is-so-2018-here-comes-content-data/#639af2722116/|title=User Data Is So 2018.

Beyond automation of writing tasks given data input, AI has shown significant potential for computers to engage in higher-level creative work. AI Storytelling has been an active field of research since James Meehan's development of TALESPIN, which made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program would start with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals, with the story as a narration of the characters’ attempts at executing plans to satisfy these goals.<ref>James R. Meehan. Tale-spin, an interactive program that writes stories. In ''Proceedings of the 5th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 1, IJCAI’77'', pages 91–98, San Francisco, CA, USA, 1977.Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.</ref> Since Meehan, other researchers have worked on AI Storytelling using similar or different approaches. Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko argued that the essence of storytelling was an experience management problem, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which are often at odds."<ref>“Interactive Narrative: An Intelligent Systems Approach” by Mark Owen Riedl, Vadim Bulitko in ''AI Magazine, Vol. 34'', No. 1, 2013 https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2449</ref>

While most research on AI storytelling has focused on story generation (e.g. character and plot), there has also been significant investigation in story communication. In 2002, researchers at North Carolina State University developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. Their particular implementation was able faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity of a number of stories, such as red riding hood, with human-like adroitness.<ref>Callaway, Charles B., & James C. Lester (2002). “Narrative prose generation.” ''Artificial Intelligence 139.2'': 213–52. http://www.intellimedia.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/npg-ijcai01.pdf</ref> This particular field continues to gain interest. In 2016, a Japanese AI co-wrote a short story and almost won a literary prize.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/japanese-ai-writes-novel-passes-first-round-nationanl-literary-prize/|title=A Japanese AI program just wrote a short novel, and it almost won a literary prize|date=2016-03-23|access-date=2016-11-18|language=en-US|newspaper=Digital Trends}}</ref>

== Power electronics ==
[[Power electronics]] converters are an enabling technology for [[renewable energy]], [[energy storage]], [[electric vehicle]]s and [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission systems within the [[electrical grid]]. These converters are prone to failures and such failures can cause downtimes that may require costly maintenance or even have catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Researchers are using AI to do the automated design process for reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure desired lifetime of the converter under specified mission profile.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dragicevic |first1=Tomislav |title=Artificial Intelligence Aided Automated Design for Reliability of Power Electronic Systems |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8584133}}</ref>

Many telecommunications companies make use of
[[Search algorithm|heuristic search]] in the management of their workforces, for example [[BT Group]] has deployed heuristic search<ref name="TheorSoc">[http://www.theorsociety.com/Science_of_Better/htdocs/prospect/can_do/success_stories/dwsbt.htm Success Stories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194517/http://www.theorsociety.com/Science_of_Better/htdocs/prospect/can_do/success_stories/dwsbt.htm|date=October 4, 2011}}.</ref> in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules of 20,000 engineers.

== Toys and games ==
The 1990s saw some of the first attempts to mass-produce domestically aimed types of basic Artificial Intelligence for education, or leisure. This prospered greatly with the [[Digital Revolution]], and helped introduce people, especially children, to a life of dealing with various types of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in the form of [[Tamagotchi]]s and [[Giga Pet]]s, [[iPod Touch]], the [[Internet]], and the first widely released robot, [[Furby]]. A mere year later an improved type of [[domestic robot]] was released in the form of [[Aibo]], a robotic dog with intelligent features and [[autonomy]].

Companies like Mattel have been creating an assortment of AI-enabled toys for kids as young as age three. Using proprietary AI engines and speech recognition tools, they are able to understand conversations, give intelligent responses and learn quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/10/15/how-artificial-intelligence-is-moving-from-the-lab-to-your-kids-playroom/|title=How artificial intelligence is moving from the lab to your kid's playroom|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

AI has also been [[Game artificial intelligence|applied to video games]], for example [[video game bot]]s, which are designed to stand in as opponents where humans aren't available or desired.

== Transportation ==
[[Fuzzy logic]] controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles. For example, the 2006 [[Audi TT]], [[Volkswagen Touareg|VW Touareg]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|VW Caravell]] feature the DSP transmission which utilizes Fuzzy Logic. A number of Škoda variants ([[Škoda Fabia]]) also currently include a Fuzzy Logic-based controller.

Today's cars now have AI-based driver assist features such as [[Automatic parking|self-parking]] and advanced cruise controls. AI has been used to optimize traffic management applications, which in turn reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.<ref name=":03" /> In the future, fully [[autonomous cars]] will be developed. AI in transportation is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major challenge to developing this AI is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex systems involving a very large number of components and different parties, each having different and often conflicting objectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Michael D.|year=January 2007|title=Artificial Intelligence in Transportation Information for Application|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/circulars/ec113.pdf|journal=Transportation Research Circular|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Due to this high degree of complexity of the transportation, and in particular the automotive, application, it is in most cases not possible to train an AI algorithm in a real-world driving environment.
