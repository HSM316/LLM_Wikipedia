=== Trading and investment ===
[[Algorithmic trading]] involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention. Such trading, called [[High-frequency Trading|high-frequency trading]], represents one of the fastest-growing sectors in financial trading. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios that are managed purely by AI systems. [[Automated trading system]]s are typically used by large institutional investors, but recent years{{Which|date=December 2021}} have also seen an influx of smaller, proprietary firms trading with their own AI systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithmictrading.asp|title=Algorithmic Trading|date=2005-05-18|website=Investopedia}}</ref>

Several large financial institutions have invested in AI engines to assist with their investment practices. [[BlackRock]]’s AI engine, [[Aladdin (BlackRock)|Aladdin]], is used both within the company and to clients to help with investment decisions. Its wide range of functionalities includes the use of natural language processing to read text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use an AI engine called Sqreem (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) which can mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with the wealth management products they’d most likely want.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/beyond-robo-advisers-how-ai-could-rewire-wealth-management|title=Beyond Robo-Advisers: How AI Could Rewire Wealth Management|date=5 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Underwriting ===
An online lender, Upstart, analyzes vast amounts of consumer data and uses machine learning algorithms to develop credit risk models that predict a consumer's likelihood of default. Their technology will be licensed to banks for them to leverage for their underwriting processes as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bankinnovation.net/2017/04/machine-learning-is-the-future-of-underwriting-but-startups-wont-be-driving-it/|title=Machine Learning Is the Future of Underwriting, But Startups Won't be Driving It|date=3 April 2017}}</ref>

ZestFinance developed its Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) Platform specifically for credit underwriting as well. This platform uses machine learning to analyze tens of thousands of traditional and nontraditional variables{{Which|date=December 2021}} (from purchase transactions to how a customer fills out a form) used in the credit industry to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories, such as millennials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170214005357/en/ZestFinance-Introduces-Machine-Learning-Platform-Underwrite-Millennials|title=ZestFinance Introduces Machine Learning Platform to Underwrite Millennials and Other Consumers with Limited Credit History|date=2017-02-14}}</ref>

=== History ===
In the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in the finance world as expert systems became more of a commercial product in the financial field. For example, Dupont had created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-012443880-4/50045-4 |chapter=History and applications |title=Expert Systems |year=2002 |last1=Durkin |first1=J. |volume=1 |pages=1–22 |isbn=978-0-12-443880-4 }}</ref> One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system designed by K.C. Chen and Ting-peng Lian that was able to predict the 87-point drop in DOW Jones Industrial Average in 1986. "The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=K.C. |last2=Liang |first2=Ting‐peng |title=PROTRADER: An Expert System for Program Trading |journal=Managerial Finance |date=1 May 1989 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=1–6 |doi=10.1108/eb013623 }}</ref>

One of the first expert systems that helped with financial plans was created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX) called the PlanPower. It was first commercially shipped in 1986. Its function was to help give financial plans for people with incomes over $75,000 a year. That then led to the Client Profiling System that was used for incomes between $25,000 and $200,000 a year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nielson |first1=Norma |last2=Brown |first2=Carol E. |last3=Phillips |first3=Mary Ellen |title=Expert Systems for Personal Financial Planning |journal=Journal of Financial Planning |date=July 1990 |pages=137–143 |doi=10.11575/PRISM/33995 |hdl=1880/48295 }}</ref>

The 1990s was a lot more about fraud detection. One of the systems that was started in 1993 was the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS). It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering which would have been equal to $1 billion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Senator|first1=Ted E.|last2=Goldberg|first2=Henry G.|last3=Wooton|first3=Jerry|last4=Cottini|first4=Matthew A.|last5=Khan|first5=A.F.

== Law ==
{{Main|Legal informatics#Artificial intelligence}}

=== Legal analysis ===
Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a mainstay component of law-related professions. In some circumstances, this analytics-crunching technology is using algorithms and machine learning to do work that was previously done by entry-level lawyers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ashley|first=Kevin D.|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9781316761380|title=Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics: New Tools for Law Practice in the Digital Age|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-76138-0|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/9781316761380}}{{page needed|date=July 2021}}</ref>

In [[Electronic discovery|Electronic Discovery (eDiscovery)]], the industry{{Which|date=December 2021}} has been focused on machine learning (predictive coding/technology assisted review), which is a subset of AI. To add to the soup of applications{{Weasel inline|date=December 2021}}, natural language processing and [[automated speech recognition]] are also in vogue in the industry.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Croft|first=Jane|date=2019-05-02|title=AI learns to read Korean, so you don't have to|url=https://www.ft.com/content/fef40df0-4a6a-11e9-bde6-79eaea5acb64|access-date=2019-12-19|website=[[Financial Times]]|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Law enforcement and legal proceedings ===
Algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems. An example of this is [[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]], a commercial program widely used by [[U.S. court]]s to assess the likelihood of a [[defendant]] becoming a [[recidivist]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Jeff Larson|first=Julia Angwin|date=2016-05-23|title=How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429190950/https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm|archive-date=29 April 2019|access-date=2020-06-19|website=ProPublica|language=en}}</ref>

=== Human resources and recruiting ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in hiring}}
Another application of AI is in the human resources and recruiting space. AI is being used by human resources and recruiting professionals to screen resumes and rank candidates based on their level of qualification, to predict candidate success in given roles through job matching platforms, and rolling out recruiting chatbots that can automate repetitive communication tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nawaz |first1=Nishad |last2=Gomes |first2=Anjali Mary |title=Artificial Intelligence Chatbots are New Recruiters |journal=International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications |date=2020 |volume=10 |issue=9 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3521915 |ssrn=3521915 |s2cid=233762238 }}</ref> Typically, resume screening involves a recruiter or other HR professional scanning through a database of resumes.

=== Job search ===
The job market has seen a notable change due to implementation of artificial intelligence. It has simplified the process for both recruiters and job seekers (i.e., Google for Jobs and applying online). According to [[Raj Mukherjee]] from Indeed.com, 65% of people launch a job search again within 91 days of being hired. An AI-powered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by operating information on job skills, salaries, and user tendencies and matching people to the most relevant positions. Machine intelligence calculates what wages would be appropriate for a particular job and pulls and highlights resume information for recruiters using natural language processing, which extracts relevant words and phrases from text using specialized software. Another application is an AI resume builder which requires 5 minutes to compile a CV as opposed to spending hours doing the same job.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kafre|first=Sumit|date=2018-04-15|title=Automatic Curriculum Vitae using Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence|url=http://asianssr.org/index.php/ajct/article/view/479|journal=Asian Journal for Convergence in Technology (AJCT)|volume=4}}</ref>
In the AI age [[chatbots]] assist website visitors and solve daily workflows. Revolutionary AI tools complement people's skills and allow HR managers to focus on tasks of higher priority. However, artificial intelligence's impact on jobs research suggests that by 2030 intelligent agents and robots can eliminate 30% of the world's human labor. Moreover, the research proves automation will displace between 400 and 800 million employees. [[Glassdoor|Glassdoor's]] research report states that recruiting and HR are expected to see much broader adoption of AI in job market 2018 and beyond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/02/02/the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-future-of-job-search|title=Raj Mukherjee|website=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Final_GD_ResearchReport_5Disruptions2018.pdf|title=Glassdoor's|website=Glassdoor}}</ref>

== Media  ==
[[File:Restoration using Artificial intelligence.jpg|thumb|Image restoration using [[artificial intelligence]]]]
Some AI applications are geared towards the analysis of audiovisual media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos or [[user-generated content]]. The solutions often involve [[computer vision]], which is a major application area of AI.

Typical use case scenarios include the analysis of images using [[object recognition]] or [[face recognition]] techniques, or the [[video content analysis|analysis of video]] for recognizing relevant scenes, objects or faces. The motivation for using AI-based media analysis can be — among other things — the facilitation of media search, the creation of a set of descriptive keywords for a media item, media content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time), [[speech recognition|speech to text]] for archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for the placement of relevant advertisements.

Media analysis AI companies often provide their services over a [[REST API]] that enables machine-based automatic access to the technology and allows machine-reading of the results. For example, [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] allow access to their media recognition technology by using RESTful APIs.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music and artificial intelligence}}
While the evolution of music has always been affected by technology, artificial intelligence has enabled, through scientific advances, to emulate, at some extent, human-like composition.

Among notable early efforts, [[David Cope]] created an AI called [[Emily Howell]] that managed to become well known in the field of algorithmic computer music.<ref name="ARS">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/09/virtual-composer-makes-beautiful-musicand-stirs-controversy/|title=Virtual composer makes beautiful music—and stirs controversy|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|website=Ars Technica|date=30 September 2009}}</ref> The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.<ref>{{cite patent |country=US|status=patent|number=7696426|url= https://www.google.com/patents/US7696426}}</ref>

In 2012, the artificial intelligence [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] created the first complete classical album composed entirely by a computer.<ref>{{Cite web|date=4 July 2012|title=Computer composer honours Turing's centenary|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724-300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary/|url-status=live|access-date=27 December 2021|website=New Scientist|language=en-US}}</ref>

Other endeavours, like [[AIVA]] (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), focus on composing symphonic music, mainly [[classical music]] for [[film scores]].<ref name="LWO">{{cite news|url=http://www.wort.lu/de/kultur/aiva-une-jeune-start-up-qui-ne-manque-pas-d-ambitions-la-musique-classique-recomposee-57fbba6b5061e01abe83a1c2|title=La musique classique recomposée|last=Hick|first=Thierry|newspaper=Luxemburger Wort|date=11 October 2016}}</ref> It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|professional association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://repertoire.sacem.fr/resultats?filters=parties&query=aiva&nbWorks=20|title=Résultats de recherche - La Sacem|website=repertoire.sacem.fr}}</ref>

Artificial intelligences can even produce music usable in a medical setting: [[Melomics]] creates computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.<ref name="alergy">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/pai.12263 |pmid=25115240 |title=Melomics music medicine (M3) to lessen pain perception during pediatric prick test procedure |journal=Pediatric Allergy and Immunology |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=721–724 |year=2014 |last1=Requena |first1=Gloria |last2=Sánchez |first2=Carlos |last3=Corzo-Higueras |first3=José Luis |last4=Reyes-Alvarado |first4=Sirenia |last5=Rivas-Ruiz |first5=Francisco |last6=Vico |first6=Francisco |last7=Raglio |first7=Alfredo |s2cid=43273958 }}</ref>

Beyond automation of writing tasks given data input, AI has shown significant potential for computers to engage in higher-level creative work. AI Storytelling has been an active field of research since James Meehan's development of TALESPIN, which made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program would start with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals, with the story as a narration of the characters’ attempts at executing plans to satisfy these goals.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Since Meehan, other researchers have worked on AI storytelling using similar or different approaches. Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko argued that the essence of storytelling was an experience management problem, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which is often at odds."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Riedl |first1=Mark Owen |last2=Bulitko |first2=Vadim |title=Interactive Narrative: An Intelligent Systems Approach |journal=[[AI Magazine]] |date=6 December 2012 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=67 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v34i1.2449 }}</ref>

While most research on AI storytelling focuses on story generation (e.g. character and plot), there has also been significant investigation in story communication. In 2002, researchers at North Carolina State University developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. Their particular implementation was able faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity of a number of stories, such as Little Red Riding Hood, with humanlike adroitness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Callaway |first1=Charles B. |last2=Lester |first2=James C. |title=Narrative prose generation |journal=Artificial Intelligence |date=August 2002 |volume=139 |issue=2 |pages=213–252 |doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(02)00230-8 }}</ref> This particular field continues to gain interest.

=== Video games ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in video games}}
In video games, artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in [[non-player character]]s (NPCs). In addition, well-understood AI techniques are routinely used for [[pathfinding]]. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production tasks. Games with more atypical AI include the AI director of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in ''[[Supreme Commander 2]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite news|title=Why AI researchers like video games|newspaper=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21721890-games-help-them-understand-reality-why-ai-researchers-video-games|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051028/https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21721890-games-help-them-understand-reality-why-ai-researchers-video-games|archive-date=5 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1145/2212908.2212954 |chapter=Game AI revisited |title=Proceedings of the 9th conference on Computing Frontiers - CF '12 |year=2012 |last1=Yannakakis |first1=Geogios N. |page=285 |isbn=978-1-4503-1215-8 |s2cid=4335529 }}</ref> AI is also used in [[Alien: Isolation|Alien Isolation]] (2014) as a way to control what actions the Alien will perform next.

Artificial intelligence has been combined with many [[sensor]] technologies{{Which|date=December 2021}}, such as digital spectrometry by IdeaCuria Inc.,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-08|title=Digital Spectrometry|url=https://www.ideacuria.com/ic/technology.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite patent|title=Digital Spectrometry Patent |country=US|number=9967696B2|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US9967696B2/en?assignee=ideacuria&oq=ideacuria|pubdate=2018-10-08}}</ref> which enables many applications{{Which|date=December 2021}} such as at-home water quality monitoring.

=== Toys and games ===
The 1990s saw some of the first attempts to mass-produce domestically aimed types of basic artificial intelligence for education or leisure. This prospered greatly with the [[Digital Revolution]], and helped introduce people, especially children, to a life of dealing with various types of artificial intelligence, specifically in the form of [[Tamagotchi]]s and [[Giga Pet]]s, [[iPod Touch]], the [[Internet]], and the first widely released robot, [[Furby]]. A mere year later an improved type of [[domestic robot]] was released in the form of [[Aibo]], a robotic dog with intelligent features and [[autonomy]].

Companies like Mattel have been creating an assortment of AI-enabled toys for kids as young as age three. Using proprietary AI engines and speech recognition tools, they are able to understand conversations, give intelligent responses, and learn quickly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/10/15/how-artificial-intelligence-is-moving-from-the-lab-to-your-kids-playroom/|title=How artificial intelligence is moving from the lab to your kid's playroom|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>

AI has also been [[Artificial intelligence in video games|applied to video games]]. For example [[video game bot]]s are designed to stand in as opponents where humans aren't available or desired.

== Transportation ==
[[Fuzzy logic]] controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles. For example, the 2006 [[Audi TT]], [[Volkswagen Touareg|VW Touareg]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and [[Volkswagen Transporter (T5)|VW Caravell]] feature the DSP transmission which utilizes fuzzy logic. A number of Škoda variants ([[Škoda Fabia]]) also currently include a fuzzy logic-based controller.

Today's cars now have AI-based driver-assist features such as [[Automatic parking|self-parking]] and advanced cruise controls. AI has been used to optimize traffic management applications, which in turn reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.<ref name=":03" /> AI in transportation is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major challenge to developing this AI is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex systems involving a very large number of components and different parties, each having different and often conflicting objectives.<ref>{{cite book |title=Artificial Intelligence in Transportation: Information for Application |date=29 January 2007 |doi=10.17226/23208 |isbn=978-0-309-42929-0 |url=http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/158428.aspx }}{{page needed|date=July 2021}}</ref> Due to this high degree of complexity of the transportation, and in particular the automotive, application, it is in most cases not possible to train an AI algorithm in a real-world driving environment. To overcome the challenge of training neural networks for automated driving, methodologies based on virtual development resp. testing toolchains<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hallerbach |first1=Sven |last2=Xia |first2=Yiqun |last3=Eberle |first3=Ulrich |last4=Koester |first4=Frank |title=Simulation-Based Identification of Critical Scenarios for Cooperative and Automated Vehicles |journal=SAE International Journal of Connected and Automated Vehicles |date=3 April 2018 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=93–106 |doi=10.4271/2018-01-1066 }}</ref> have been proposed.

=== Automotive ===
{{Main|Self-driving car}}
Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. {{as of|2016}}{{Update needed|date=December 2021}}, there are over 30 companies using AI to create [[self-driving car]]s. A few companies involved with AI include [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]], [[Google]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref>"33 Corporations Working On Autonomous Vehicles". CB Insights. N.p., 11 August 2016. 12 November 2016.</ref>

Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high-performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.<ref>{{cite news |last1=West |first1=Darrell M. |title=Moving forward: Self-driving vehicles in China, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States |url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/moving-forward-self-driving-vehicles-in-china-europe-japan-korea-and-the-united-states/ |work=Brookings |date=20 September 2016 }}</ref>

Recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though they are still in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Burgess|first1=Matt|date=2017-08-24|title=The UK is about to Start Testing Self-Driving Truck Platoons|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads|url-status=live|magazine=Wired UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922055917/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-trial-self-driving-trucks-platoons-roads|archive-date=22 September 2017|access-date=20 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Davies|first1=Alex|date=2015-05-05|title=World's First Self-Driving Semi-Truck Hits the Road|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/|url-status=live|magazine=Wired|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028222802/https://www.wired.com/2015/05/worlds-first-self-driving-semi-truck-hits-road/|archive-date=28 October 2017|access-date=20 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

One main factor that influences the ability for a driverless automobile to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McFarland |first1=Matt |title=Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/02/25/googles-artificial-intelligence-breakthrough-may-have-a-huge-impact-on-self-driving-cars-and-much-more/ |work=Washington Post |date=25 February 2015 }}</ref> Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Programming safety into self-driving cars |url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134033 |work=National Science Foundation |date=2 February 2015 }}</ref>

Another factor that is influencing the ability of a driverless automobile is the safety of the passenger. To make a driverless automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians. The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car. But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/10/22/165469/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/ |work=MIT Technology Review |date=22 October 2015 }}</ref> The programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driverless automobile.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=JafariNaimi |first1=Nassim |title=Our Bodies in the Trolley's Path, or Why Self-driving Cars Must *Not* Be Programmed to Kill |journal=Science, Technology, & Human Values |date=March 2018 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=302–323 |doi=10.1177/0162243917718942 |s2cid=148793137 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johansson |first1=Rolf |last2=Nilsson |first2=Jonas |title=Disarming the Trolley Problem –Why Self-driving Cars do not Need to Choose Whom to Kill |journal=Workshop CARS 2016 - Critical Automotive Applications : Robustness & Safety |series=CARS 2016 - Critical Automotive applications : Robustness & Safety |date=September 2016 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01375606/ }}</ref>

=== Aviation ===
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}
The [[Air and Space Operations Center|Air Operations Division]] (AOD) uses AI for the rule based [[expert systems]]. The AOD has use for [[artificial intelligence]] for surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 29, 2016|title=AI bests Air Force combat tactics experts in simulated dogfights|work=[[Ars Technica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/ai-bests-air-force-combat-tactics-experts-in-simulated-dogfights/}}</ref>

The use of artificial intelligence in simulators is proving to be very useful for the AOD. Airplane simulators are using artificial intelligence in order to process the data taken from simulated flights. Other than simulated flying, there is also simulated aircraft warfare. The computers are able to come up with the best success scenarios in these situations. The computers can also create strategies based on the placement, size, speed, and strength of the forces and counter forces. Pilots may be given assistance in the air during combat by computers. The artificial intelligent programs can sort the information and provide the pilot with the best possible maneuvers, not to mention getting rid of certain maneuvers that would be impossible for a human being to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations so computer-simulated pilots are used to gather data.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Randolph M. |last2=Laird |first2=John E. |last3=Nielsen |first3=Paul E. |last4=Coulter |first4=Karen J. |last5=Kenny |first5=Patrick |last6=Koss |first6=Frank V. |title=Automated Intelligent Pilots for Combat Flight Simulation |journal=AI Magazine |date=15 March 1999 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=27 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v20i1.1438 }}</ref> These computer simulated pilots are also used to train future [[air traffic controllers]].

The system used by the AOD in order to measure performance was the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS. It is a rule based expert system put together by collecting information from [[TF-30]] documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the RAAF F-111C. The performance system was also used to replace specialized workers. The system allowed the regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.

The AOD also uses artificial intelligence in [[speech recognition]] software. The air traffic controllers are giving directions to the artificial pilots and the AOD wants to the pilots to respond to the ATC's with simple responses. The programs that incorporate the speech software must be trained, which means they use [[neural networks]]. The program used, the Verbex 7000, is still a very early program that has plenty of room for improvement. The improvements are imperative because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.

The artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,<ref>[http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Research/Projects/AIDA/ AIDA Homepage]. Kbs.twi.tudelft.nl (April 17, 1997). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.

In 2003, [[NASA]]'s [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], and many other companies, created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing zone can be reached.<ref>[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/crgis/images/c/c9/88798main_srfcs.pdf The Story of Self-Repairing Flight Control Systems.] NASA Dryden. (April 2003). Retrieved on 2016-08-25.</ref> The software compensates for all the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. The neural network used in the software proved to be effective and marked a triumph for artificial intelligence.

The Integrated Vehicle Health Management system, also used by NASA, on board an aircraft must process and interpret data taken from the various sensors on the aircraft. The system needs to be able to determine the structural integrity of the aircraft. The system also needs to implement protocols in case of any damage taken the vehicle.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Flight Demonstration Of X-33 Vehicle Health Management System Components On The F/A-18 Systems Research Aircraft|date=January 1998|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20010055588.pdf}}</ref>

Haitham Baomar and Peter Bentley are leading a team from the University College of London to develop an artificial intelligence based Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS) designed to teach an autopilot system to behave like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation such as severe weather, turbulence, or system failure.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|last=Adams|first=Eric|date=March 28, 2017|title=AI Wields the Power to Make Flying Safer—and Maybe Even Pleasant|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/ai-wields-power-make-flying-safer-maybe-even-pleasant/|magazine=Wired|access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> Educating the autopilot relies on the concept of supervised [[machine learning]] "which treats the young autopilot as a human apprentice going to a flying school".<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot records the actions of the human pilot generating learning models using [[artificial neural network]]s.<ref name=":0" /> The autopilot is then given full control and observed by the pilot as it executes the training exercise.<ref name=":0" />

AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created [[NASNet]], a system optimized for [[ImageNet]] and POCO F1. NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 December 2017|title=Google AI creates its own 'child' bot|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-child-ai-bot-nasnet-automl-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-a8093201.html|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>
