[[File:Cognitive.System.Scheme.png|thumb|right|Basic scheme of a cognitive system. With sensors, such as [[Keyboard technology|keyboards]], [[Touchscreen|touchscreens]], [[Camera|cameras]], [[Microphone|microphones]] or [[Thermometer|temperature sensors]], signals from the real world environment can be detected. For [[Perception|perception]], these signals are recognised by the [[Cognition|cognition]] of the cognitive system and converted into digital information. This information can be [[Documentation|documented]] and is processed. The result of [[Deliberation|deliberation]] can also be documented and is used to control and execute an action in the real world environment with the help of [[Actuator|actuators]], such as [[Engine|engines]], [[Loudspeaker|loudspeakers]], [[Electronic visual display|displays]] or [[Air conditioning|air conditioners]] for example.]]

The term "cognitive system" also applies to any artificial construct able to perform a cognitive process where a cognitive process is the transformation of data, information, knowledge, or wisdom to a new level in the [[DIKW Pyramid]]. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Fulbright |first1=Ron |title=Democratization of Expertise: How Cognitive Systems Will Revolutionize Your Life |date=2020 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0367859459 |edition=1st}}</ref> While many cognitive systems employ techniques having their origination in [[artificial intelligence]] research, cognitive systems, themselves, may not be artificially intelligent. For example, a  [[neural network]] trained to recognize cancer on an [[MRI]] scan may achieve a higher success rate than a human doctor. This system is certainly a cognitive system but is not artificially intelligent. 

Cognitive systems may be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real-time, or near real-time,<ref name="Ferrucci">{{cite journal |last1=Ferrucci |first1=David |last2=Brown |first2=Eric |last3=Chu-Carroll |first3=Jennifer |last4=Fan |first4=James |last5=Gondek |first5=David |last6=Kalyanpur |first6=Aditya A. |last7=Lally |first7=Adam |last8=Murdock |first8=J.

== Cognitive analytics ==
Cognitive computing-branded technology platforms typically specialize in the processing and analysis of large, [[Unstructured data|unstructured datasets]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://public.deloitte.com/media/analytics/pdfs/us_da_3min_guide_cognitive_analytics.pdf|title=Cognitive analytics - The three-minute guide|date=2014|access-date=2017-08-18}}</ref>

== Applications ==
;Education: Even if cognitive computing can not take the place of teachers, it can still be a heavy driving force in the education of students. Cognitive computing being used in the classroom is applied by essentially having an assistant that is personalized for each individual student. This cognitive assistant can relieve the stress that teachers face while teaching students, while also enhancing the student’s learning experience over all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/artificial-intelligence-in-the-classroom-role|title=The Role Of Artificial Intelligence In The Classroom|last=Sears|first=Alec|date=April 14, 2018|website=ElearningIndustry|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref> Teachers may not be able to pay each and every student individual attention, this being the place that cognitive computers fill the gap. Some students may need a little more help with a particular subject. For many students, Human interaction between student and teacher can cause [[anxiety]] and can be uncomfortable. With the help of Cognitive Computer [[Tutor|tutors]], students will not have to face their uneasiness and can gain the confidence to learn and do well in the classroom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coccoli |first1=Mauro |last2=Maresca |first2=Paolo |last3=Stanganelli |first3=Lidia |title=Cognitive computing in education |journal=Journal of e-Learning and Knowledge Society |date=21 May 2016 |volume=12 |issue=2 |url=https://www.learntechlib.org/p/173468/ }}</ref> While a student is in class with their personalized assistant, this assistant can develop various techniques, like creating lesson plans, to tailor and aid the student and their needs.
;Healthcare: Numerous tech companies are in the process of developing technology that involves cognitive computing that can be used in the medical field. The ability to classify and identify is one of the main goals of these cognitive devices.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dobrescu |first1=Edith Mihaela |last2=Dobrescu |first2=Emilian M. |title=Artificial Intelligence (Ai) - The Technology That Shapes The World |journal=Global Economic Observer |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=71–81 |id={{ProQuest|2176184267}} |url=http://www.globeco.ro/wp-content/uploads/vol/split/vol_6_no_2/geo_2018_vol6_no2_art_006.pdf }}</ref> This trait can be very helpful in the study of identifying [[Carcinogen|carcinogens]]. This cognitive system that can detect would be able to assist the examiner in interpreting countless numbers of documents in a lesser amount of time than if they did not use Cognitive Computer technology. This technology can also evaluate information about the patient, looking through every medical record in depth, searching for indications that can be the source of their problems.
;Commerce: Together with Artificial Intelligence, it has been used in warehouse management systems  to collect, store, organize and analyze all related supplier data. All these aims at improving efficiency, enabling faster decision-making, monitoring inventory and fraud detection<ref>{{Cite web |title=Smart Procurement Technologies for the Construction Sector |url=https://publication.sipmm.edu.sg/smart-procurement-technologies-construction-sector/ |access-date=2022-03-02 |website=publication.sipmm.edu.sg |language=en-US}}</ref>
;Human Cognitive Augmentation: In situations where humans are using or working collaboratively with cognitive systems, called a human/cog ensemble, results achieved by the ensemble are superior to results obtainable by the human working alone. Therefore, the human is cognitively augmented.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fulbright |first1=Ron |title=Democratization of Expertise: How Cognitive Systems Will Revolutionize Your Life |date=2020 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0367859459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fulbright |first1=Ron |title=Calculating Cognitive Augmentation – A Case Study |journal=Augmented Cognition.

Lecture Notes in Computer Science |date=2018 |volume=10905 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92046-7_41}}</ref>In cases where the human/cog ensemble achieves results at, or superior to, the level of a human expert then the ensemble has achieved synthetic expertise. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fulbright |first1=Ron |title=Synthetic Expertise |journal=Augmented Cognition. Human Cognition and Behavior. Lecture Notes in Computer Science |date=2020 |volume=12197 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50439-7_3}}</ref> In a human/cog ensemble, the "cog" is a cognitive system employing virtually any kind of cognitive computing technology.

== Industry work ==
Cognitive computing in conjunction with [[big data]] and [[algorithm]]s that comprehend [[customer needs]], can be a major advantage in economic [[decision making]].

The powers of cognitive computing and [[artificial intelligence]] hold the potential to affect almost every task that humans are capable of performing. This can negatively affect employment for humans, as there would be no such need for human labor anymore. It would also increase the [[inequality of wealth]]; the people at the head of the cognitive computing industry would grow significantly richer, while workers without ongoing, reliable employment would become less well off.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Makridakis |first1=Spyros |title=The forthcoming Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution: Its impact on society and firms |journal=Futures |date=June 2017 |volume=90 |pages=46–60 |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2017.03.006 }}</ref>

The more industries start to utilize cognitive computing, the more difficult it will be for humans to compete.<ref name=":0" /> Increased use of the technology will also increase the amount of work that AI-driven [[robot]]s and machines can perform. Only extraordinarily talented, capable and motivated humans would be able to keep up with the machines. The influence of competitive individuals in conjunction with AI/CC with has the potential to change the course of humankind.<ref>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Darrell M. |title=The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation |date=2018 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |jstor=10.7864/j.ctt1vjqp2g |isbn=978-0-8157-3293-8 }}{{pn|date=August 2020}}</ref>
