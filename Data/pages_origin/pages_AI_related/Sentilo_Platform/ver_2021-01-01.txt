'''Sentilo''' (“Sensor” in [[Esperanto]])  is an [[open-source software]] sensor and actuator project.

==Description==
Sentilo is designed to be [[cross-platform]] with the objective of sharing information between heterogeneous systems and to easily integrate legacy applications. 
Sentilo was started in November 2012 by the [[Barcelona]] City Council, through the Municipal Institute of Informatics (IMI), for its [[smart city]] project called City OS.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Inside the City OS |publisher= City of Barcelona |author= Pere Comas Guerri |date= December 3, 2013 |url= http://ibarcelona.bcn.cat/sites/default/files/city_os_-_inside.pdf |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160325185623/http://ibarcelona.bcn.cat/sites/default/files/city_os_-_inside.pdf |archivedate= March 25, 2016 |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>
Since then, the city of [[Terrassa]] joined the project, as well as the [[Cellnex|Cellnex Telecom]].<ref>{{Cite web |title= Sentilo Sponsors |work= Project web site |url= http://www.sentilo.io/xwiki/bin/view/Sentilo.About.Project/Sponsors  |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>

Sentilo could be used for other [[Internet of things]] applications. [[Cisco Systems]] promoted the CityOS project and Sentilo in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |title= IoE-Driven Smart City Barcelona Initiative Cuts Water Bills, Boosts Parking Revenues, Creates Jobs & More |publisher= Cisco Systems |date= January 2014 |url= http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/ZA/tomorrow-starts-here/pdf/barcelona_jurisdiction_profile_za.pdf |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>
Also in 2014, Spanish company Libelium announced they would use it with their sensors.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Barcelona's Sentilo smart city the first built by a municipality |publisher= Rethink Research |author= Alex Davies |url= http://rethinkresearch.biz/articles/barcelonas-sentilo-smart-city-the-first-built-by-a-municipality/ |date= June 27, 2014 |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>
In 2016, some initial tests were discussed.<ref>{{Cite news |title= IoT beneath the city streets: Barcelona tests out open platform for smart services |work= ZD Net |author= Anna Solana |date= January 21, 2016 |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/iot-beneath-the-city-streets-barcelona-tests-out-open-platform-for-smart-services/ |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>
It can be [[on-premises software]] or a [[platform as a service]] using [[cloud computing]] from OpenTrends called Thingtia, announced in January 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |title= About Us |work= Thingtia Cloud web site |url= http://www.thingtia.cloud/en/about-us/ |access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>

Sentilo can be downloaded direct from the web or viewed in [[GitHub]]. Data such as the number of sensors and transaction rate are available at a web site.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://connecta.bcn.cat |title=Sentilo BCN:Platform Sensors and Actuators Barcelona |date=|website=|publisher=|access-date= March 26, 2017 }}</ref>
