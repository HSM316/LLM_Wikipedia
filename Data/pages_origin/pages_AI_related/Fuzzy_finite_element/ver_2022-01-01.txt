The '''fuzzy finite element''' method combines the well-established [[finite element method]] with the concept of [[fuzzy number]]s, the latter being a special case of a [[fuzzy set]].<ref>[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}</ref> The advantage of using [[fuzzy number]]s instead of [[real numbers]] lies in the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] (on material properties, parameters, geometry, initial conditions, etc.) in the finite element analysis. 

One way to establish a fuzzy finite element (FE) analysis is to use existing FE software (in-house or commercial) as an inner-level module to compute a [[deterministic]] result, and to add an outer-level loop to handle the fuzziness (uncertainty). This outer-level loop comes down to solving an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem. If the inner-level deterministic module produces [[monotonic]] behavior with respect to the input variables, then the outer-level optimization problem is greatly simplified, since in this case the [[Maxima and minima|extrema]] will be located at the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[domain of a function|domain]].
