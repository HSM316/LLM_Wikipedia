The '''Air Quality Egg''' ('''AQE''') is an [[Internet of Things]] platform and hobbyist device for [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] citizen monitoring of airborne pollutants. The device won widespread recognition when it was named one of the best projects on Kickstarter in 2012,<ref name=nprkick>{{cite web|title=Kickstarter Pledges Topped $320 Million In 2012; Site Names Year's Top Projects|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/01/09/168959800/kickstarter-pledges-topped-320-million-in-2012-site-names-years-top-projects|website=npr.org|date=9 January 2013|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2019-12-11|last1=Chappell|first1=Bill}}</ref> and has been featured in a variety of media outlets.<ref name=wired>{{cite magazine|last1=Finley|first1=Klint|title=The Internet of Things Could Drown Our Environment in Gadgets|magazine=Wired|date=June 2014|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/green-iot/|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> Data from each device is uploaded to [[Xively]] and published on the Air Quality Egg website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Quality Egg|url=http://airqualityegg.com/|website=Air Quality Egg|publisher=Wicked Device|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The device can be used with 3rd-party mobile apps such as Acculation's AQCalc.<ref name=acculation>{{cite web|title=AQcalc mobile app|url=https://www.acculation.com/blog/2014/01/20/acculation-inc-and-aqcalc-in-the-news/|website=Acculation|publisher=Acculation|accessdate=2019-12-11}}</ref>

== Current version ==
Version 2 of the AQE is a single unit, Wi-Fi connected device which can be configured using a cell phone. It has two variants; indoor and outdoor. The device can be fitted with sensors for [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO<sub>2</sub>]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]], [[ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic compounds]] and [[particulates]] (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0). The particulate sensors can detect particles as small as 0.3 Î¼m (microns), using two Plantower PMS5003 sensors. The PM2.5 measurements of the AQE version 2 had an R<sup>2</sup> correlation factor of 0.79 to 0.85 with a professional reference sensor, in a field test run by the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]]. (An R<sup>2</sup> of 1 indicates perfect correlation, whereas 0 indicates a complete lack of correlation).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/summary-pm|title=air quality sensor summary reports|website=www.aqmd.gov|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Air Quality Egg.png|thumb|alt=Air Quality Egg air pollution monitor showing the sensor and circuit board|An early version of the Air Quality Egg.]]

The AQE grew out of [[Internet of Things]] meetup groups in [[New York City]] and [[Amsterdam]], led by Pachube evangelist Ed Borden. The concept was conceived at a Parsons/New School hackathon. It is manufactured and sold by the start-up company WickedDevice LLC in Ithaca, NY.<ref name="wd">{{cite web|url=http://shop.wickeddevice.com/product/air-quality-egg/|title=AQE Store|website=wickeddevices shop|publisher=wickeddevice llc|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/2018/03/22/air-quality-egg-earns-ithaca-startup-742-000-grant-national-science-foundation/448556002/|title=Air Quality Egg earns Ithaca startup a $742,000 grant from National Science Foundation|work=Ithaca Journal|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}</ref> The name "Air Quality Egg" was created by company co-founder Dirk Swart.<ref name="kickstarter">{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edborden/air-quality-egg|title=#AirQualityEgg by #SenseMakers|website=kickstarter.com|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>

Originally, there were two versions of the device: an [[Arduino]] shield for use by hobbyists, and a more consumer-ready "hobbyist kit" device. The latter consists of two identical-looking plastic enclosures resembling white eggs. The base unit is connected to the user's Ethernet LAN connection. A second unit monitors NO<sub>2</sub> and CO levels and reports these readings every few minutes to the base unit via a custom wireless protocol. The base unit reports these readings to [[Xively]] and the AQE website. Add-ons are available for purchase on the website, that add [[Particulates|PM2.5 dust]], [[Ozone]], and [[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] sensors.<ref name="wd" />

== Competition ==
Despite being labelled a not-consumer-ready "hobbyist" device by the manufacturer,<ref name="wd" /> the AQE is one of the few de facto commercially available, comprehensive Internet of Things pollution monitors on the US market.<ref name="acculation" /> 

A number of competing devices have been announced, such as Chemisense [[Wearable technology|Wearable]]<ref name="chemisense">{{cite web|last1=Pai|first1=Aditi|title=ChemiSense developing wristworn air quality sensor for people with asthma|url=http://mobihealthnews.com/35846/chemisense-developing-wristworn-air-quality-sensor-for-people-with-asthma/|website=MobiHealthNews|date=18 August 2014|publisher=MobiHealthNews|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> and Foobot<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://foobot.io|title=Foobot - it's all about Indoor Air Quality Monitoring|website=Foobot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> (formerly Alima).

Another US crowdsourced air quality monitoring device is CitizenSensor, but it is listed an outgoing project, DIY, and not available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citizen Sensor: DIY Pollution Monitoring|url=http://www.citizensensor.cc/|website=CitizenSensor|publisher=CitizenSensor|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> 

A comprehensive Internet of Things air pollution monitoring device is China's iKair (pronounced "I Care"), but it has a closed, proprietary platform rather than the AQE's open source hardware and open data design.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liao|first1=Rita|title=Smart Sensor iKair Tells You How To Improve Your Home Environment|url=http://technode.com/2014/07/07/smart-sensor-ikair-tells-improve-home-environment/|website=TechNode|date=7 July 2014|publisher=TechNode|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IKair chinese pollution-monitoring startup|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/airqualityegg/ZiSIlKCtmwQ|website=#AirQualityEgg Google Group|publisher=Google/Internet community|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> 

In 2014, [[IBM]] announced a partnership with the government of China for analytics software to process data from pollution sensors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greengard|first1=Samuel|title=Analytics Tools Help China Deal With Air Pollution|url=http://www.baselinemag.com/analytics-big-data/analytics-tools-help-china-deal-with-air-pollution.html|website=Basline|date=16 August 2014|publisher=Baseline|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>
