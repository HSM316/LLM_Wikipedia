The '''Air Quality Egg''' ('''AQE''') is an [[open source hardware]] [[Internet of Things]] platform and hobbyist device for [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] citizen monitoring of airborne pollutants. The device won widespread recognition when it was named one of the best projects on Kickstarter<ref name=nprkick>{{cite web|title=Kickstarter Pledges Topped $320 Million In 2012; Site Names Year's Top Projects|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/01/09/168959800/kickstarter-pledges-topped-320-million-in-2012-site-names-years-top-projects|website=npr.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2019-12-11}}</ref>, and has been featured in a variety of media outlets<ref name=wired>{{cite journal|last1=Finley|first1=Klint|title=Follow Wired     Twitter     Facebook     RSS  The Internet of Things Could Drown Our Environment in Gadgets|journal=Wired|date=June 2014|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/green-iot/|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>. Crowdsourced data from citizen owners of the devices is uploaded to [[Xively]] where it becomes publicly accessibly on the Air Quality Egg website<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Quality Egg|url=http://airqualityegg.com/|website=Air Quality Egg|publisher=Wicked Device|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>. The device is supported by 3rd party mobile apps such as Acculation's AQCalc<ref name=acculation>{{cite web|title=AQcalc mobile app|url=https://www.acculation.com/blog/2014/01/20/acculation-inc-and-aqcalc-in-the-news/|website=Acculation|publisher=Acculation|accessdate=2019-12-11}}</ref>.

The Air Quality Egg version 2 comes in different versions; an indoor base or an outdoor base. The egg is customizable from that point by the user, with sensors available for [[Particulates]] (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0), [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]], [[Nitrogen dioxide|NO2]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO2]], [[ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]] and/or [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Compounds]]. The Particulate version detects particles as small as 0.3 μm (microns), using two Plantower PMS5003 sensors. The PM2.5 measurements of the Air Quality Egg version 2 had an R<sup>2</sup> correlation factor of 0.79 to 0.85 with a professional reference sensor, in a field test run by the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District|Sout Coast Air Quality Management District]] (an R<sup>2</sup> approaching the value of 1 reflects a near perfect correlation, whereas a value of 0 indicates a complete lack of correlation.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/summary-pm|title=air quality sensor summary reports|website=www.aqmd.gov|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>.

The AQE grew out of Internet of Things meetup groups in [[New York City]] and [[Amsterdam]], led by Pachube evangelist Ed Borden, and the name "Air Quality Egg" was created by Wicked Device co-founder Dirk Swart.<ref name=kickstarter>{{cite web|title=#AirQualityEgg by #SenseMakers|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edborden/air-quality-egg|website=kickstarter.com|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> WickedDevice LLC, the company that manufacturers and sells the AQE off its website, is a tech start-up headquartered in Ithaca, NY.<ref name=wd>{{cite web|title=AQE Store|url=http://shop.wickeddevice.com/product/air-quality-egg/|website=wickeddevices shop|publisher=wickeddevice llc|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/2018/03/22/air-quality-egg-earns-ithaca-startup-742-000-grant-national-science-foundation/448556002/|title=Air Quality Egg earns Ithaca startup a $742,000 grant from National Science Foundation|work=Ithaca Journal|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}</ref> Originally there were two versions of the device: an [[Arduino]] shield for use by hobbyists, and a more consumer-ready "hobbyist kit" device. The latter consists of two identical-looking plastic enclosures resembling white eggs. One unit, the base unit, is connected to the user's ethernet LAN connection. The second unit monitors NO2 and CO levels and reports these readings every few minutes back to the base unit via a custom wireless protocol. The base unit, in term, reports these readings to [[Xively]] and the AQE website. Add-ons are available for purchase off the website that add [[Particulates|PM2.5 dust]], [[Ozone]], and [[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] sensors.<ref name="wd"/> The second version of the AQE is a single unit, Wi-Fi connected device which can be configured using a cell phone.

Despite being labelled a not-consumer-ready "hobbyist" device by the manufacturer,<ref name="wd"/> the AQE is one of the few de facto commercially available, comprehensive Internet of Things pollution monitors on the US market.<ref name="acculation"/> A number of competing devices have been announced, such as the Chemisense [[Wearable technology|Wearable]] in the US<ref name=chemisense>{{cite web|last1=Pai|first1=Aditi|title=ChemiSense developing wristworn air quality sensor for people with asthma|url=http://mobihealthnews.com/35846/chemisense-developing-wristworn-air-quality-sensor-for-people-with-asthma/|website=MobiHealthNews|publisher=MobiHealthNews|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> or the Foobot<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://foobot.io|title=Foobot - it's all about Indoor Air Quality Monitoring|website=Foobot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> (formerly Alima). CitizenSensor is another US crowdsourced air quality monitoring device, but it is listed an "outgoing project", "DIY", and apparently not available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citizen Sensor: DIY Pollution Monitoring|url=http://www.citizensensor.cc/|website=CitizenSensor|publisher=CitizenSensor|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> In terms of a comprehensive Internet of Things air pollution monitoring solution, the most direct competitor may be China's iKair (pronounced "I Care"), although this uses a closed, proprietary platform rather than the AQE's open source hardware and open data design.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liao|first1=Rita|title=Smart Sensor iKair Tells You How To Improve Your Home Environment|url=http://technode.com/2014/07/07/smart-sensor-ikair-tells-improve-home-environment/|website=TechNode|publisher=TechNode|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IKair chinese pollution-monitoring startup|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/airqualityegg/ZiSIlKCtmwQ|website=#AirQualityEgg Google Group|publisher=Google/Internet community|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> [[IBM]] recently announced a partnership with the government of China for analytics software to process data from pollution sensors, so both the software and hardware aspects of this market may be heating up.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greengard|first1=Samuel|title=Analytics Tools Help China Deal With Air Pollution|url=http://www.baselinemag.com/analytics-big-data/analytics-tools-help-china-deal-with-air-pollution.html|website=Basline|publisher=Baseline|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> A major potential criticism of the AQE is that it is still a hobbyist device despite the appearance of consumer-ready packaging. In an effort to get these devices to end-users more quickly, the original version one sensors were not fully calibrated by the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ Wicked Device Shop|url=http://shop.wickeddevice.com/resources/air-quality-egg/faq|website=FAQ Wicked Device Shop|publisher=WickedDevice|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Calibration of Air Quality Egg using NO2 gas diffusion tubes|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/airqualityegg/H8UDLMfQPTA|website=AirQualityEgg Google Group|publisher=Googe/internet Community|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>

In 2017 The Air Quality Egg version 2 was included in the permanent collection of [[Museum_of_Applied_Arts,_Vienna|MAK]], the Österreichisches Museum für angewandte Kunst / Gegenwartskunst in Vienna.
