'''Oxa''' (formerly Oxbotica) is an [[autonomous vehicle]] software company, headquartered in [[Oxfordshire|Oxfordshire, England]], and founded by [[Paul Newman (engineer)|Paul Newman]] and Ingmar Posner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/paul-newman/|title=Paul Newman|last=Newman|first=Paul|website=Oxford Robotics Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>

== History ==

In 2013, Newman and Posner led the RobotCar UK project as part of [[Oxford University]]'s [[Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford|Department of Engineering Science]] Mobile Robotics Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/research/research-in-conversation/making-sense-numbers/paul-newman |title=Professor Paul Newman {{!}} University of Oxford |website=www.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> RobotCar became the first [[Vehicular automation|autonomous vehicle]] on UK roads.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ori.ox.ac.uk/application/robotcar/ |title=RobotCar |website=Oxford Robotics Institute |access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>

In 2014, the pair used the newly developed technology to found Oxbotica.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.oxbotica.com/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=Oxbotica |access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>
