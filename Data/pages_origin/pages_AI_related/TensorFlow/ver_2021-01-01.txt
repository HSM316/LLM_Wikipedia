=== TensorFlow ===
TensorFlow is Google Brain's second-generation system. Version 1.0.0 was released on February 11, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/07bb8ea2379bd459832b23951fb20ec47f3fdbd4/RELEASE.md|title=Tensorflow Release 1.0.0}}</ref>  While the [[reference implementation]] runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run on multiple [[central processing unit|CPUs]] and [[GPU]]s (with optional [[CUDA]] and [[SYCL]] extensions for [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]]).<ref name=Metz-Nov10>{{cite news |last1 = Metz |first1 = Cade |title = TensorFlow, Google's Open Source AI, Points to a Fast-Changing Hardware World |url = https://www.wired.com/2015/11/googles-open-source-ai-tensorflow-signals-fast-changing-hardware-world/ |access-date = November 11, 2015 |website = Wired |date = November 10, 2015 }}</ref> TensorFlow is available on 64-bit [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Windows]], and mobile computing platforms including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].

Its flexible architecture allows for the easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, [[Tensor processing unit|TPU]]s), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.

TensorFlow computations are expressed as [[State (computer science)|stateful]] [[dataflow programming|dataflow]] [[directed graph|graphs]]. The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays, which are referred to as ''[[tensor]]s''. During the [[Google I/O|Google I/O Conference]] in June 2016, Jeff Dean stated that 1,500 repositories on [[GitHub]] mentioned TensorFlow, of which only 5 were from Google.<ref name="1500repo's">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnm83GqgqPE  Machine Learning: Google I/O 2016 Minute 07:30/44:44 ] accessdate=2016-06-05</ref>

In December 2017, developers from Google, Cisco, RedHat, CoreOS, and CaiCloud introduced [[Kubeflow]] at a conference. Kubeflow allows operation and deployment of TensorFlow on [[Kubernetes]].

In March 2018, Google announced TensorFlow.js version 1.0 for machine learning in [[JavaScript]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-js-machine-learning-in-javascript-bf3eab376db|title=Introducing TensorFlow.js: Machine Learning in Javascript|last=TensorFlow|date=2018-03-30|website=Medium|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

=== Tensor processing unit (TPU) ===
{{main|Tensor processing unit}}
In May 2016, Google announced its [[Tensor processing unit]] (TPU), an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC, a hardware chip) built specifically for [[machine learning]] and tailored for TensorFlow. A TPU is a programmable [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|AI accelerator]] designed to provide high [[throughput]] of low-precision [[arithmetic]] (e.g., [[8-bit]]), and oriented toward using or running models rather than [[Supervised learning|training]] them. Google announced they had been running TPUs inside their data centers for more than a year, and had found them to deliver an [[order of magnitude]] better-optimized [[performance per watt]] for machine learning.<ref>{{cite web |author-link1=Norman Jouppi |last1 = Jouppi |first1 = Norm |title = Google supercharges machine learning tasks with TPU custom chip |url = https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html |website = Google Cloud Platform Blog |access-date = May 19, 2016 }}</ref>

In May 2017, Google announced the second-generation, as well as the availability of the TPUs in [[Google Compute Engine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/|title=Build and train machine learning models on our new Google Cloud TPUs|date=May 17, 2017|work=Google|access-date=May 18, 2017}}</ref> The second-generation TPUs deliver up to 180 teraflops of performance, and when organized into clusters of 64 TPUs, provide up to 11.5 petaflops.

In May 2018, Google announced the third-generation TPUs delivering up to 420 teraflops of performance and 128 GB high [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] memory (HBM). Cloud TPU v3 Pods offer 100+ petaflops of performance and 32 TB HBM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cloud.google.com/tpu/|title=Cloud TPU|website=Google Cloud|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

In February 2018, Google announced that they were making TPUs available in beta on the [[Google Cloud Platform]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/Cloud-TPU-machine-learning-accelerators-now-available-in-beta.html|title=Cloud TPU machine learning accelerators now available in beta|work=Google Cloud Platform Blog|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>

=== Edge TPU ===
In July 2018, the Edge TPU was announced. Edge TPU is Google's purpose-built [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] chip designed to run TensorFlow Lite machine learning (ML) models on small client computing devices such as smartphones<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beebom.com/google-announces-edge-tpu-cloud-iot-edge-at-cloud-next-2018/|title=Google Announces Edge TPU, Cloud IoT Edge at Cloud Next 2018|last=Kundu|first=Kishalaya|date=2018-07-26|website=Beebom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref> known as [[edge computing]].

=== TensorFlow Lite ===
In May 2017, Google announced a software stack specifically for mobile development, TensorFlow Lite.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15645908/google-ai-tensorflowlite-machine-learning-announcement-io-2017|title=Google's new machine learning framework is going to put more AI on your phone}}</ref> In January 2019, TensorFlow team released a developer preview of the mobile GPU inference engine with OpenGL ES 3.1 Compute Shaders on Android devices and Metal Compute Shaders on iOS devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/tensorflow/tensorflow-lite-now-faster-with-mobile-gpus-developer-preview-e15797e6dee7|title=TensorFlow Lite Now Faster with Mobile GPUs (Developer Preview)|last=TensorFlow|date=2019-01-16|website=Medium|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> In May 2019, Google announced that their TensorFlow Lite Micro (also known as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers) and [[Arm Holdings|ARM's]] uTensor would be merging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/uTensor-and-Tensor-Flow-Announcement/|title=uTensor and Tensor Flow Announcement {{!}} Mbed|website=os.mbed.com|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>

TensorFlow Lite uses [[FlatBuffers]] as the data serialization format for network models, eschewing the [[Protocol Buffers]] format used by standard TensorFlow models.

=== Pixel Visual Core (PVC) ===
In October 2017, Google released the [[Google Pixel 2]] which featured their [[Pixel Visual Core]] (PVC), a fully programmable [[image processor|image]], [[vision processing unit|vision]] and [[AI accelerator|AI]] processor for mobile devices. The PVC supports TensorFlow for machine learning (and [[Halide (programming language)|Halide]] for image processing).

=== Applications ===
[[Google]] officially released [[RankBrain]] on October 26, 2015, backed by TensorFlow.

Google also released {{not a typo|Co|laboratory}}, which is a TensorFlow Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html|title=Colaboratory â€“ Google|website=research.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref>

=== Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) ===
On March 1, 2018, Google released its Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC). Originally designed to help equip Google employees with practical [[artificial intelligence]] and machine learning fundamentals, Google rolled out its free TensorFlow workshops in several cities around the world before finally releasing the course to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/|title=Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs|language=en}}</ref>
