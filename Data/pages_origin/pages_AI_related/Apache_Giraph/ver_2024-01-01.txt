'''Apache Giraph''' is an [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]] project to perform [[Graph (computer science)|graph processing]] on [[big data]]. Giraph utilizes [[Apache Hadoop]]'s MapReduce implementation to process graphs. [[Facebook]] used Giraph with some performance improvements to analyze one trillion edges using 200 machines in 4 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ching|first=Avery|title=Scaling Apache Giraph to a trillion edges|url=http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/scaling-apache-giraph-to-a-trillion-edges/10151617006153920|publisher=Facebook|access-date=8 February 2014|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref> Giraph is based on a paper published by Google about its own graph processing system called Pregel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Joab|title=Facebook's Graph Search puts Apache Giraph on the map|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046680/facebooks-graph-search-puts-apache-giraph-on-the-map.html|access-date=8 February 2014|newspaper=[[PC World]]|date=Aug 14, 2013}}</ref> It can be compared to other Big Graph processing libraries such as Cassovary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Derrick|title=Facebook's trillion-edge, Hadoop-based and open source graph-processing engine|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/08/14/facebooks-trillion-edge-hadoop-based-graph-processing-engine/|publisher=[[Gigaom]]|access-date=8 February 2014|date=Aug 14, 2013}}</ref>
