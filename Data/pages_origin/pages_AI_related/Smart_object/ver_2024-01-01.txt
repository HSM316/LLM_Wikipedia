{{Short description|Product able to gather and exchange data}}
A '''smart object''' is an object that enhances the interaction with not only people but also with other smart objects. Also known as '''smart connected products''' or '''smart connected things''' ('''SCoT'''), they are products, assets and other things embedded with processors, sensors, software and connectivity that allow data to be exchanged between the product and its environment, manufacturer, operator/user, and other products and systems. Connectivity also enables some capabilities of the product to exist outside the physical device, in what is known as the product cloud.  The data collected from these products can be then analyzed to inform decision-making, enable operational efficiencies and continuously improve the performance of the product.

It can not only refer to interaction with physical world objects but also to interaction with virtual (computing environment) objects. A smart physical object may be created either as an artifact or manufactured product or by embedding electronic tags such as [[RFID tag]]s or sensors into non-smart physical objects. Smart virtual objects are created as software objects that are intrinsic when creating and operating a virtual or cyber world simulation or game. The concept of a smart object has several origins and uses, see History. There are also several overlapping terms, see also [[smart device]], tangible object or [[tangible user interface]] and Thing as in the [[Internet of things]].

==History==
In the early 1990s, Mark Weiser, from whom the term [[ubiquitous computing]] originated, referred to a vision "When almost every object either contains a computer or can have a tab attached to it, obtaining information will be trivial",<ref name="Weiser">{{cite journal|last=Weiser|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Weiser

Although Weiser did not specifically refer to an object as being smart, his early work did imply that smart physical objects are smart in the sense that they act as digital information sources. Hiroshi  Ishii and Brygg Ullmer<ref>{{cite conference|first=Hiroshi|last=Ishii|author2=Brygg Ullmer|title=Tangible Bits: Towards Seamless Interfaces between People, Bits and Atoms|conference=Proceedings of Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (CHI '97)| year= 1997|publisher=ACM Press|pages=234–241|url=http://gtubicomp2013.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/65131525/ishii-tangible-bits-chi1997.pdf}}</ref> refer to tangible objects in terms of tangibles bits or tangible user interfaces that enable users to "grasp & manipulate" bits in the center of users' attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces.

The smart object concept was introduced by Marcelo Kallman and [[Daniel Thalmann]]<ref name="Kallman">{{cite conference |first=Marcelo|last=Kallman|author2=Daniel Thalmann|title=Modeling Objects for Interaction Tasks|conference=Proc. Eurographics Workshop on Animation and Simulation|publisher=Springer|year=1998|pages=73–86}}</ref> as an object that can describe its own possible interactions. The main focus here is to model interactions of smart virtual objects with virtual humans, agents, in virtual worlds. The opposite approach to smart objects is 'plain' objects that do not provide this information. The additional information provided by this concept enables far more general interaction schemes, and can greatly simplify the [[AI planning|planner]] of an [[Intelligent agent|artificial intelligence agent]].<ref name="Kallman"/>
 
In contrast to smart virtual objects used in virtual worlds, Lev Manovich focuses on physical space filled with electronic and visual information. Here,  "smart objects" are described as "objects connected to the Net; objects that can sense their users and display smart behaviour".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manovich|first=Lev|title=The poetics of urban media surfaces|journal=First Monday|issue= Special Issue #4: Urban Screens: Discovering the potential of outdoor screens for urban society|year=2006|url=http://www.firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1545/1460|doi=10.5210/fm.v0i0.1545 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

More recently in the early 2010s, smart objects are being proposed as a key enabler for the vision of the Internet of things.<ref name="Kortuem">{{cite journal|first=Gerd|last=Kortuem|author2=Fahim Kawsar |author3=Daniel Fitton |author4=Vasughi Sundramoor |title=Smart Objects as Building Blocks for the Internet of Things|year=2010|journal= IEEE Internet Computing| volume=14|issue=1|pages=44–51 |doi=10.1109/mic.2009.143|s2cid=1007932|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/5401/3/5401_Fitton.pdf}}</ref> The combination of the Internet and emerging technologies such as [[near field communications]], [[Real-time data|real-time]] localization, and embedded [[sensors]] enables everyday objects to be transformed into smart objects that can understand and react to their environment. Such objects are building blocks for the Internet of things and enable novel computing applications.<ref name="Kortuem"/> In 2018, one of the world's first [[smart building|smart houses]] was built in [[Klaukkala]], Finland in the form of a five-floor apartment block, using the Kone Residential Flow solution created by [[KONE]], allowing even a [[smartphone]] to act as a home key.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kone.se/berattelser-och-referenser/referenser/forst-i-varden-klovskog-finland.aspx|title=FÖRST I VÄRLDEN – Klövskog, Finland|publisher=KONE|access-date=October 13, 2019|language=sv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.byggematerialer.dk/klovskog-i-nurmijarvi/projekt.html|title=Nurmijärven Kreivi – Den første i verden|publisher=Byggematerialer|access-date=October 13, 2019|language=da}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Although we can view interaction with physical smart object in the physical world as distinct from interaction with virtual smart objects in a virtual simulated world, these can be related. Poslad<ref name="Poslad"/> considers the progression of: how
* humans use models of smart objects situated in the physical world to enhance human to physical world interaction; versus how
* smart physical objects situated in the physical world can model human interaction in order to lessen the need for human to physical world interaction; versus how 
* virtual smart objects by modelling both physical world objects and modelling humans as objects and their subsequent interactions can form a predominantly smart virtual object environment.

===Smart physical objects===
The concept smart for a smart physical object simply means that it is active, digital, networked, can operate to some extent autonomously, is reconfigurable and has local control of the resources it needs such as energy, data storage, etc.<ref name="Poslad"/> Note, a smart object does not necessarily need to be intelligent as in exhibiting a strong essence of [[artificial intelligence]]—although it can be designed to also be intelligent.

Physical world smart objects can be described in terms of three properties:<ref name="Kortuem"/>
* ''Awareness'': is a smart object's ability to understand (that is, sense, interpret, and react to) events and human activities occurring in the physical world.
* ''Representation'': refers to a smart object's application and programming model—in particular, programming abstractions.
* ''Interaction'': denotes the object's ability to converse with the user in terms of input, output, control, and feedback.

Based upon these properties, these have been classified into three types:<ref name="Kortuem"/>
* ''Activity-Aware Smart Objects'': Are objects that can record information about work activities and its own use.
* ''Policy-Aware Smart Objects'': Are objects that are activity-aware  Objects can interpret events and activities with respect to predefined organizational policies.
* ''Process-Aware Smart Objects'': Processes play a fundamental role in industrial work management and operation. A process is a collection of related activities or tasks that are ordered according to their position in time and space.

===Smart virtual objects===
For the [[virtual object]] in a virtual world case, an object is called smart when it has the ability to describe its possible interactions.<ref name="Kallman"/> This focuses on constructing a virtual world using only virtual objects that contain their own interaction information. There are four basic elements to constructing such a smart virtual object framework.<ref name="Kallman"/>
* ''Object properties'': physical properties and a text description
* ''Interaction information'': position of handles, buttons, grips, and the like
* ''Object behavior'': different behaviors based on state variables
* ''Agent behaviors'': description of the behavior an agent should follow when using the object

Some versions of smart objects also include animation information in the object information, but this is not considered to be an efficient approach, since this can make objects inappropriately oversized.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Pieter| last=Jorissen|author2=Maarten Wijnants |author3=Wim Lamotte |title=Dynamic Interactions in Physically Realistic Collaborative Virtual Environments|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|year=2005|volume=11|issue=6|pages=649–660|doi=10.1109/tvcg.2005.100| pmid=16270858| s2cid=12182396}}</ref>

The term smart products can be confusing as it is used to cover a broad range of different products, ranging from smart home appliances (e.g., smart bathroom scales or smart light bulbs) to smart cars (e.g., Tesla). While these products share certain similarities, they often differ substantially in their capabilities. Raff et al. developed a conceptual framework that distinguishes different smart products based on their capabilities, which features 4 types of smart product archetypes (in ascending order of "smartness")[2]

While these products share certain similarities, they often differ substantially in their capabilities.

==Advantages==
Smart, connected products have three primary components:<ref name=HBR>{{cite magazine|url=https://hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition/ar/1/|title=How Smart, Connected Products are Transforming Competition|magazine= Harvard Business Review|date=November 2014|author1=Porter, M. E. |author2=Heppelmann, J. E. }}</ref>{{rp|67}}
* Physical – made up of the product's mechanical and electrical parts.
* Smart – made up of [[sensor]]s, microprocessors, data storage, controls, software, and an embedded operating system with enhanced user interface.
* Connectivity – made up of ports, antennae, and protocols enabling wired/[[wireless]] connections that serve two purposes, it allows data to be exchanged with the product and enables some functions of the product to exist outside the physical device.

Each component expands the capabilities of one another resulting in "a virtuous cycle of value improvement".<ref name=HBR/> First, the smart components of a product amplify the value and capabilities of the physical components. Then, connectivity amplifies the value and capabilities of the smart components. These improvements include:
* Monitoring of the product's conditions, its external environment, and its operations and usage.
* Control of various product functions to better respond to changes in its environment, as well as to personalize the user experience.
* Optimization of the product's overall operations based on actual performance data, and reduction of downtimes through [[predictive maintenance]] and remote service.
* Autonomous product operation, including learning from their environment, adapting to users' preferences and self-diagnosing and service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/11/28/the-new-era-of-smart-connected-products-is-changing-how-businesses-compete/|date=November 28, 2014|title=The New Era of Smart, Connected Products Is Changing How Businesses Compete|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

===The Internet of things (IoT)===
{{main|Internet of things}}
The [[Internet of things]] is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216034912/http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 16, 2013|title=Gartner Says the Internet of Things Installed Base Will Grow to 26 Billion Units by 2020|work=Gartner|date=December 12, 2013}}</ref>  The phrase "Internet of things" reflects the growing number of smart, connected products and highlights the new opportunities they can represent. The Internet, whether involving people or things, is a mechanism for transmitting information. What makes smart, connected products fundamentally different is not the Internet, but the changing nature of the 'things'.<ref name=HBR/>{{rp|66}} Once a product is smart and connected to the cloud, the products and services will become part of an interconnected management solution. Companies can evolve from making products to offering more complex, higher-value offerings within a "system of systems".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/smart-connected-products/|title=Smart Connected Products: Killing Industries, Boosting Innovation|magazine=Wired Magazine|author=Dan Ostrower|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref name="SmartIoT16">{{cite web|url=http://www.wiomax.com/the-internet-of-smart-things-brings-us-the-greatest-value/|title=The Smart IoT Brings Us the Greatest Value|author=Z.
