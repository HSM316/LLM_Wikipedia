A '''vision processing unit''' ('''VPU''') is (as of 2018) an emerging class of [[microprocessor]]; it is a specific type of [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|AI accelerator]],{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} designed to [[hardware acceleration|accelerate]] [[machine vision]] tasks.<ref>{{cite web|title= A third type of processor for AR/VR: Movidius' Myriad 2 VPU|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/movidiud-myriad2-vpu-vision-processing-vr,30850.html|author=Seth Colaner|author2=Matthew Humrick|date=January 3, 2016|work=Tom's Hardware}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The rise of VPUs: Giving Eyes to Machines|url=http://www.digit.in/general/the-rise-of-vpus-giving-eyes-to-machines-29561.html|work=Digit.in|author=Prasid Banerje|date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

== Overview ==

Vision processing units are distinct from [[video processing unit]]s (which are specialised for [[Video codec|video encoding and decoding]]) in their suitability for running [[machine vision|machine vision algorithms]] such as CNN ([[convolutional neural network]]s), [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] ([[Scale-invariant feature transform]]) and similar.

They may include [[Interface (computing)|direct interfaces]] to take data from [[Digital cameras|cameras]] (bypassing any off chip buffers), and have a greater emphasis on on-chip [[dataflow]] between many [[parallel execution units]] with [[scratchpad memory]], like a [[manycore]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]]. But, like video processing units, they may have a focus on [[low precision]] [[fixed point arithmetic]] for [[image processing]].

== Contrast with GPUs ==

They are distinct from [[GPU]]s, which contain specialised hardware for [[rasterization]] and [[texture mapping]] (for [[3D graphics]]), and whose [[memory architecture]] is optimised for manipulating [[bitmap images]] in [[off-chip memory]] (reading [[Texture map|textures]], and modifying [[frame buffers]], with [[Locality of reference|random access patterns]]).

Target markets are [[robotics]], the [[internet of things]], new classes of [[digital cameras]] for [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]], [[smart camera]]s, and integrating machine vision acceleration into [[smartphone]]s and other [[mobile devices]].

== Similar processors ==

Some processors are not described as VPUs, but are equally applicable to machine vision tasks.  These may form a broader category of ''[[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|AI accelerator]]s'' (to which VPUs may also belong), however as of 2016 there is no consensus on the name:

* [[IBM]] [[TrueNorth]], a [[neuromorphic]] processor aimed at similar sensor data [[pattern recognition]] and intelligence tasks, including video/audio.
* [[Qualcomm Zeroth Neural processing unit]], another entry in the emerging class of sensor/AI oriented chips.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing Qualcomm Zeroth Processors: Brain-Inspired Computing|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2013/10/10/introducing-qualcomm-zeroth-processors-brain-inspired-computing|date=October 10, 2013|work=Qualcomm}}</ref>
