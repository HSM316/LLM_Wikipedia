'''CuckooChess''' is an advanced [[free and open-source]] [[chess engine]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] by Peter Österlund. CuckooChess provides an own [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], and optionally supports the [[Universal Chess Interface]] protocol for the use with external GUIs such as Arena. An Android port is available, where its GUI is also based on Peter Österlund's [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] port dubbed DroidFish.<ref name="cpw">{{cite web |title=CuckooChess |url=https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/CuckooChess |website=Chess Programming Wiki |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>

The program uses the Chess Cases chess font, created by Matthieu Leschemelle. The name CuckooChess comes due that the transposition table is based on [[Cuckoo hashing]].<ref name="web">{{cite web |title=CuckooChess |url=http://hem.bredband.net/petero2b/javachess/index.html |website=Bredband |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>
