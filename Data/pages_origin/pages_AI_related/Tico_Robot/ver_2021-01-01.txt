Its head and neck access 6 [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. It moves using [[differential steering]] with two high-[[torque]] [[EC motor|EC gear-motors]], and runs [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 9.10 on a 1.6Ghz [[Intel Core Duo]]. It stands {{convert|1.5|m}} tall and weighs {{convert|85|kg}}. A new, fresh battery allows it to run freely for eight hours.
