'''Artificial intuition''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] capacity of an [[artificial]] software to function similarly to human [[consciousness]], specifically in the capacity of human consciousness known as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].

Intuition is the function of the mind, the experience of which, is described as knowledge based on "a hunch", resulting (as the word itself does) from "contemplation" or "insight".<ref>Eugene Sadler-Smith - [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC&q=intuition Inside Intuition] - [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC p.3] Routledge, 6 Aug 2012 {{ISBN|1134121830}} Accessed 17 September 2018</ref><ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/intuition etymonline] Accessed 17 September 2018</ref>

Psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] showed that intuitive functioning within the normally developing human child at the ''Intuitive Thought Substage''  of the [[preoperational stage]] occurred at from four to seven years of age.<ref>Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour, Richard Gross  {{ISBN|978-1-4441-0831-6}}  see: [[Jean Piaget]]</ref><ref>Santrock, John W.

Artificial intuition is theoretically (or otherwise) a sophisticated function of an artifice that is able to interpret data with depth and locate hidden factors functioning in  [[Gestalt psychology]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Frantz |first=Roger |date=2003 |title=Herbert Simon.
