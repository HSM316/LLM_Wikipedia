'''Integrated Operations in the High North''' ('''IOHN''', '''IO High North or IO in the High North''') is a unique collaboration project that during a four-year period starting May 2008 is working on designing, implementing and testing a Digital Platform for what in the [[Upstream (oil industry)|upstream oil and gas industry]] is called the next or second generation of [[Integrated Operations]].<ref>

The work on the Digital platform is focussed on capture, transfer and integration of [[real-time data]] from the remote production installations to the decision makers. A risk evaluation across the whole chain is also included. The platform is based on [[open standards]] and enables a higher degree of [[interoperability]]. Requirements for the digital platform come from use cases defined within the [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Drilling|Drilling]] and [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Completion|Completion]], Reservoir and Production and Operations and Maintenance domains. The platform will subsequently be demonstrated through pilots within these three domains.<ref name="IOHNsite">
