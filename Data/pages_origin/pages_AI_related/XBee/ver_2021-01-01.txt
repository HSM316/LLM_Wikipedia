'''Digi XBee''' is the brand name of a popular family of [[Computer form factor|form factor]] compatible wireless connectivity modules from [[Digi International]]. The first XBee modules were introduced under the '''MaxStream''' brand in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/abstract/press_release/MAXSTREAM_ZIGBEE_PR.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316101443/http://www.freescale.com/files/abstract/press_release/MAXSTREAM_ZIGBEE_PR.html |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}</ref> and were based on the [[IEEE 802.15.4]]-2003 standard designed for point-to-point and star communications.  Since the initial introduction, the XBee family has grown and a complete [https://www.digi.com/lp/xbee ecosystem] of wireless modules, gateways, adapters and software has evolved.

The XBee radios can all be used with the minimum number of connections&nbsp;â€” power (3.3&nbsp;V), ground, data in and data out ([[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]]), with other recommended lines being Reset and Sleep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digi.com/support/kbase/kbaseresultdetl.jsp?id%3D2176 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722014704/http://www.digi.com/support/kbase/kbaseresultdetl.jsp?id=2176 |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref> Additionally, most XBee families have some other [[flow control (data)|flow control]], [[input/output]] (I/O), [[analog-to-digital converter]] (A/D) and indicator lines built in.

The latest XBee 3 family introduces new capabilities like MicroPython, Digi's TrustFence security framework and Bluetooth low energy for local commissioning, configuration, diagnostics or beaconing

== Supported Technologies ==
Short Range (2.4 GHz)

* [[Zigbee]], [[IEEE 802.15.4]], [[DigiMesh]], [[Bluetooth Low Energy]]

Long Range (868/900 MHz)

* Point-to-Point, Star topology, DigiMesh

Cellular / LPWAN

* LTE Cat-1, [[LTE-M]] / [[NB-IoT]], 3G

==Form-Factors, Antennas and Data Modes==
XBee modules are available in three form-factors.  All XBees, with the exception of the XBee 868LP, are available in the popular 20-pin through-hole form-factor.  The latest XBee modules are also available in surface-mount and micro-mount form-factors, which are popular for high-volume applications due to the reduced manufacturing costs of SMT

* [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] (TH)
* surface mount (SMT)
* micro-mount (MMT)

XBee modules typically come with several antenna options including [[Hirose U.FL|U.FL]], on-board chip, RF pad and integrated PCB

XBee modules can operate either in a transparent data mode or in a packet-based [[application programming interface]] (API) mode.<ref name="XBeeRefGuide">http://www.tunnelsup.com/tup/2012/11/30/xbee-s2-quick-reference-guide-cheat-sheet/</ref> 

* Transparent mode: data coming into the Data IN (DIN) pin is directly transmitted over-the-air to the intended receiving radios without any modification. Incoming packets can either be directly addressed to one target (point-to-point) or broadcast to multiple targets (star). This mode is primarily used in instances where an existing protocol cannot tolerate changes to the data format. [[Hayes command set#Description|AT commands]] are used to control the radio's setting
* API mode: data is wrapped in a packet structure that allows for addressing, parameter setting and packet delivery feedback,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digi.com/learningcenter/video/player.jsp?videoid%3Dzigbee-at-vs-api-commands |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722014817/http://www.digi.com/learningcenter/video/player.jsp?videoid=zigbee-at-vs-api-commands |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref> including remote sensing and control of digital I/O and analog input pins.<ref name="Faludi2010">{{cite book|author=Robert Faludi|title=Building Wireless Sensor Networks: With ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC69vQJLZIC|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=24 December 2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-80773-3}}</ref>
