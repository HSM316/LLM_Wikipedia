==Plot==
<!-- Note: as the light novel series is the PRIMARY work, the plot summary should be written for the light novels, not the anime or manga. -->
"Hundreds" are a kind of weapon that get their name from their ability to change into many different forms, and are the only thing that can counter the mysterious life forms called Savage that are attacking Earth. Those who can wield a Hundred are sought out to be made into Slayers, trained individuals who can use them in combat. To become a Slayer, Hayato Kisaragi successfully enrolls in the marine academy city ship Little Garden. However he feels a strange yet familiar sense of incongruity towards Emile Crossford, his roommate who somehow knows him from somewhere. On top of that, shortly after he enters the school, he ends up challenged to a duel by the "Queen" and the school's most powerful Slayer, Claire Harvey.

:Hayato is the male protagonist of ''Hundred''. Originally from Yamato, Hayato became a Slayer in order to obtain state-of-the-art medical treatment for his sister. His previous encounter with a Savage 10 years ago resulted in him becoming a Variant - one of a very small fraction of people (fewer than 10 in the world, according to Emile) who have survived exposure to the Savages and obtained a greatly increased affinity for Hundreds as a result. He has the highest known compatibility with a Hundred and his Hundred the Flying swallow is chevalier type that takes the form of a sword and a shoulder guard. When he first met Emilia he didn't realize that she was really a girl, but upon discovering the truth, he agreed to keep her secret. He is shown to be slightly uncomfortable whenever Emilia was showing him affection and would always blush when around her or other women who show their romantic feelings toward him.

;{{Nihongo|Emilia Hermit|エミリア・ハーミット|Emiria Hāmitto}}
:{{voiced by|[[Rumi Ōkubo]]|[[Mikaela Krantz]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:Emilia is the female protagonist of ''Hundred''. She is a silver-haired girl from the Britannia Empire and Hayato's roommate. She initially poses as a boy under the name {{nihongo|Emile Crossfode |エミール・クロスフォード|Emīru Kurosufōdo}} with only a few people aware of her secret until she eventually reveals the truth about herself. She and Hayato were survivors from the second Savage attack 10 years earlier, which resulted in her and Hayato becoming Variants. Hayato only has vague recollections of the prior event and it isn't until their encounter with the Savages at Zwei Island that Hayato realizes her true identity. She is a citizen of the Gudenburg Empire by birth and eventually reveals that she is {{nihongo|Emilia Gudenburg|エミリア・グーデンブルグ|Emiria Gūdenburugu}}, the Empire's third princess. Her Hundred is the Arms Shroud that is an innocence type able to change into any form of weapon, something no other Slayer's Hundred can do. Like Hayato, she too is a Variant. Ten years ago she and Hayato where fleeing from the Savages' onslaught when she was attacked by a one and almost died. The attack left a potent amount of virus in her gaping wound. Hayato, in an attempt to save her life sucked some of the fluids out, causing him to become a Variant as well. A substantial amount was still left in her system. She is in love with Hayato and is known to be very affectionate towards him and does not care about the rumors circulating about their relationship since everyone believes them to be gay. In the final episode, her status as a princess and girl are revealed to her peers, who were shocked at her heritage and finally understand her feelings to Hayato.

:The highest-ranked Slayer in Little Garden who is from the United States of Liberia, she is called the Queen. The newly-arrived Hayato is forced to duel her to prevent the expulsion of two students who arrived late to the entrance ceremony because they are looking for him at the airport when he arrived. During the duel Hayato accidentally gropes her and she goes all out and defeats him, but the duel is called a draw and the students are allowed to stay. After Hayato saves her from a Savage and, later, accidentally kisses her, she falls in love with him. Her Hundred is a Dragoon Type which utilizes multiple cannons or transforms into a large powerful rifle, in doing so it drains much of her energy. She is also one of the few people who are aware that Emilia is secretly a girl.

After that incident, she lives with her father whom she never meets. When she later falls ill from an unknown illness, her father sells her to the Warslran Research Facility, where subjects like her are injected with vaccines that are developed from the fluids recovered from defeated Savages. She is the only one of the test subjects to have survived and, like Hayato and Emilia, she is also a Variant and a Slayer.

| ShortSummary        = Hayato Kisaragi is a student going to the Little Garden to go to school, where he is training to become a Slayer, human beings who can defeat monsters known as Savages, which are endangering the lives of other fellow human beings. As he exits from the plane, two girls from the school rush to meet him but he hides from them out of embarrassment. However, he later attracts attention at the school campus due to his high scores. There, he meets fellow first-year students Fritz Granz, Latia Saint-Emilion and Emile Crossfode. As Hayato begins to feel welcomed at the school, the two girls become late to the entrance ceremony as they were looking for him, and they are expelled then and there by the Student Council President and the Captain of the Little Garden, Claire Harvey. At this, Emile speaks up and rebuffs Claire, much to the anger of the Student Council Vice-Presidents Liddy Steinberg and Erica Candle. However, Claire turns to Hayato instead, who musters his courage and says that he feels that the students should not be expelled. Claire then challenges him to a one-on-one duel to determine the students' fates. After the entrance ceremony, Emile takes Hayato to see her friend, the technician of the Little Garden, Charlotte Dimandias. At her lab, she reveals herself to also be the Chief Researcher on Hundreds, special gems that can grant powers to humans, turning them into Slayers. She gives Hayato his Hundred, which reacts to him almost immediately. Seeing this, Emile takes Hayato to the training grounds to train him for the upcoming duel. Later, he goes to put his luggage in his dormitory, and accidentally spots Emile wearing nothing but towel. He is then knocked out by him. He then learns that him and Emile are room-mates.

| ShortSummary        = The duel begins early next morning, and all of the students have gathered at the auditorium to watch. There, Liddy explains the rules. The duel will last 15 minutes and will end once one of them is knocked out, when one of their energy is used up or when one of them is disarmed. However, as the duel begins, Hayato accidentally falls over her and grabs Claire's breasts, angering her and firing shots at him. Hayato puts up an energy barrier on Emile's command and deals a heavy shot at Claire. However, this has no effect on her as she puts up her own shield with her numerous cannons, and deals the final blow. This causes Hayato to lose a lot of his energy and as he slowly rises, Claire prepares to use a Buster Cannon against him, shocking everyone and even the Student Council Vice-Presidents. As she shoots, Hayato feels that his body has turned hot, and manages to deflect Claire's blow, pushing her back with different movements and ends up using a full-body armament, the full release of his Hundred powers. In the end, he is still defeated by Claire using her full-body armament even though she said she would not at the start of the match, as he is unable to control his powers and collapses. The match is thus declared a tie as, Claire won officially, but lost to herself. Claire then cancels the expulsion of the girls. After Hayato recovers, Emile takes him to Central, the business district of the Little Garden, where Karen, Hayato's sister, comes to meet them to check on Hayato after the duel. She begins to suspect that Emile is a girl but leaves it at that, giving him a warning. They then have lunch but is interrupted by Claire, Liddy, Erica and Chris Steinbelt, Claire's assistant. Claire then recruits Hayato into The Selections, the special unit under the student council, much to Emile's objection. Emile then wishes to join Hayato, and transforms then and there, willing to prove himself. The duel between him and Liddy ends abruptly due to a Savage alert on Zwei Islands.

| ShortSummary        = Claire, Liddy and Erica then take Hayato and Emile to a special private room, where dozens of other people are working. The current situation shows that they are presently tracking three Savages on Zwei Islands. At first, Claire was comtemplating on deploying Emile and Hayato, but after receiving the shocking reports on just merely one of the Savages, she refuses as they have no experience just yet even though they have Charlotte's recommendation. However, Charlotte says that LIZA, the main machine and power source of the Little Garden agrees that Hayato and Emile should join them. At this, Claire reconsiders and finally gives her approval. They then prepare to deal with the Savages. Claire, Liddy and Erica finish off the first Savage first. Hayato and Emile then take on the next one and manage to defeat it by working together. However, the third Savage, the Trenton-class one and also the strongest one, proves to be more of a challenge, injuring Liddy and Erica badly. Hayato and Emile want to help, but Claire goes alone to beat it. She fires a strong blow at it, but it counters with its own. Claire prepares for another, but a beep from her wristband warns her that she does not have enough energy. As the Savage fires another deadly attack, she is saved by Hayato, and managed to deflect the third blow with his help. Emile then lunges in to break its core, but her clothes are ripped by its heavy claw, revealing a thin scar and large breasts. The sight of the scar then triggers a distant memory in Hayato, and he remembers a girl with long white hair like Emile's, wearing a dress and bleeding profusely from a wound in her chest, a wound that was leaking with yellowish-green poison, the poison of a Savage. And then there was him, crying, and trying to suck out the poison. With a start he then realises that Emile really wasn't a boy, or called Emile for that matter. With a cry, he rushes in to save his childhood friend, Emilia Hermit. Hayato releases his Variant powers in the process, and defeats the Savage, and collapses but his lifted up by Emilia. She is then confronted by Claire, who is shocked at finding out that Emilia was originally just posing as a boy but was really a girl. In the end, she reluctantly agrees to keep Emilia's true identity a secret, but requests that Hayato and Emilia change rooms. However, her warning falls on deaf ears as she stumbles into the room to find her and Hayato kissing. As Hayato gets up with a start, he trips over Emilia's foot and stumbles towards Claire, kissing her in the process. This angers Emilia and a kissing match begins.
