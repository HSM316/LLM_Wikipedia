==Plot==
<!-- Note: as the light novel series is the PRIMARY work, the plot summary should be written for the light novels, not the anime or manga. -->
"Hundreds" are a kind of weapon that get their name from their ability to change into many different forms, and are the only thing that can counter the mysterious life forms called Savage that are attacking Earth. Those who can wield a Hundred are sought out to be made into Slayers, trained individuals who can use them in combat. To become a Slayer, Hayato Kisaragi successfully enrolls in the marine academy city ship Little Garden. However he feels a strange yet familiar sense of incongruity towards Emile Crossford, his roommate who somehow knows him from somewhere. On top of that, shortly after he enters the school, he ends up getting challenged to a duel by the "Queen" and the school's most powerful Slayer, Claire Harvey.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|Hayato Kisaragi|如月 ハヤト|Kisaragi Hayato}}
:{{voiced by|Yoshiaki Hasegawa|[[Ricco Fajardo]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/09/16/december-2017-home-video-releases/#more-20077|title=December 2017 Home Video Releases|date=September 16, 2017|work=Funimation|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>}}
:Hayato is the male protagonist of ''Hundred''. Originally from Yamato, Hayato became a Slayer in order to obtain state-of-the-art medical treatment for his sister. His previous encounter with a Savage 10 years ago resulted in him becoming a Variant - one of a very small fraction of people (fewer than 10 in the world, according to Emile) who have survived exposure to the Savages and obtained a greatly increased affinity for Hundreds as a result. He has the highest known compatibility with a Hundred and his Hundred, the Flying Swallow, is a chevalier-type that takes the form of a sword and a shoulder guard. When he first met Emilia he didn't realize that she was really a girl, but upon discovering the truth, he agreed to keep her secret. He is shown to be slightly uncomfortable whenever Emilia was showing him affection and would always blush when around her or other women who show their romantic feelings toward him.

;{{Nihongo|Emilia Hermit|エミリア・ハーミット|Emiria Hāmitto}}
:{{voiced by|[[Rumi Ōkubo]]|[[Mikaela Krantz]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:Emilia is the female protagonist of ''Hundred''. She is a silver-haired girl from the Britannia Empire and Hayato's roommate. She initially poses as a boy under the name {{nihongo|Emile Crossfode |エミール・クロスフォード|Emīru Kurosufōdo}} with only a few people aware of her secret until she eventually reveals the truth about herself. She and Hayato were survivors from the second Savage attack 10 years earlier, which resulted in her and Hayato becoming Variants. Hayato only has vague recollections of the prior event and it isn't until their encounter with the Savages at Zwei Island that Hayato realizes her true identity. She is a citizen of the Gudenburg Empire by birth and eventually reveals that she is {{nihongo|Emilia Gudenburg|エミリア・グーデンブルグ|Emiria Gūdenburugu}}, the Empire's third princess. Her Hundred is the Arms Shroud that is an innocence type able to change into any form of weapon, something no other Slayer's Hundred can do. Like Hayato, she too is a Variant. Ten years ago she and Hayato where fleeing from the Savages' onslaught when she was attacked by one and almost died. The attack left a potent amount of virus in her gaping wound. Hayato, in an attempt to save her life sucked some of the fluids out, causing him to become a Variant as well. A substantial amount was still left in her system. She is in love with Hayato and is known to be very affectionate towards him and does not care about the rumors circulating about their relationship since everyone believes them to be gay. In the final episode, her status as a princess and girl are revealed to her peers, who were shocked at her heritage and finally understand her feelings to Hayato.

;{{Nihongo|Claire Harvey|クレア・ハーヴェイ|Kurea Hāvei}}
:{{voiced by|[[Mao Ichimichi|M.A.O]]|[[Caitlin Glass]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:The highest-ranked Slayer in Little Garden who is from the United States of Liberia, she is called the Queen. The newly-arrived Hayato is forced to duel her to prevent the expulsion of two students who arrived late to the entrance ceremony because they are looking for him at the airport when he arrived. During the duel Hayato accidentally gropes her and she goes all out and defeats him, but the duel is called a draw and the students are allowed to stay. After Hayato saves her from a Savage and, later, accidentally kisses her, she falls in love with him. Her Hundred is a Dragoon Type which utilizes multiple cannons or transforms into a large powerful rifle, in doing so it drains much of her energy. She is also one of the few people who are aware that Emilia is secretly a girl.

;{{Nihongo|Karen Kisaragi|如月 カレン|Kisaragi Karen}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kaya Okuno]]|[[Dawn M. Bennett]]<ref name=":0" />}}

While staying in the hospital she is often seen playing tarot cards, where she has become sort of a clairvoyant.

She originally met Hayato and Karen at a shelter in Gudenberg during the second Savage attack. She remembers Karen but wasn't able to get Hayato's name at the time. After that incident, she lives with her father whom she never meets. When she later falls ill from an unknown illness, her father sells her to the Warslran Research Facility, where subjects like her are injected with vaccines that are developed from the fluids recovered from defeated Savages. She is the only one of the test subjects to have survived and, like Hayato and Emilia, she is also a Variant and a Slayer.
