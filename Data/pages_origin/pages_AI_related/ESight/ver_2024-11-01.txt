'''eSight''' is a wearable medical device designed to improve the functional vision of those living with [[low vision]] or [[legal blindness]]. The device was developed by Canadian-based company eSight Corp.

== History ==
eSight was founded in 2006 by Conrad Lewis, a Canadian electrical engineer with two legally blind sisters. His motivation was to build a device that would enable his sisters to see, be able to work and independently perform virtually all [[activities of daily living]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Malika|title=Glasses from eSight help legally blind Colts fan see game for first time|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/01/05/esight-glasses-legally-blind-indianapolis-colts-fan|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=eSight: helping the legally blind see|url=https://www.investinontario.com/success-stories/esight-helping-legally-blind-see|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=InvestinOntario|date=20 June 2017|archive-date=25 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225163600/https://www.investinontario.com/success-stories/esight-helping-legally-blind-see|url-status=dead}}</ref>
