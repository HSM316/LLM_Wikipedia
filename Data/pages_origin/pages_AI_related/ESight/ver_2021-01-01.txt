'''eSight''' is a wearable medical device designed to improve the functional vision of those living with [[low vision]] or [[legal blindness]]. The device was developed by Canadian-based tech firm eSight Corp.

== History ==
eSight was founded in 2006 by Conrad Lewis, a Canadian electrical engineer with two legally blind sisters. His motivation was to build a device that would enable his sisters to see, be able to work and independently perform virtually all [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Malika|title=Glasses from eSight help legally blind Colts fan see game for first time|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/01/05/esight-glasses-legally-blind-indianapolis-colts-fan|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=5 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=eSight: helping the legally blind see|url=https://www.investinontario.com/success-stories/esight-helping-legally-blind-see|accessdate=2 September 2017|publisher=InvestinOntario|date=20 June 2017}}</ref> He spent seven years developing the breakthrough technology.<ref name="theglobeandmail.com">{{Cite news|title=Tech firm's powerful vision brings sight to the legally blind|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/tech-firms-powerful-vision-brings-sight-to-the-blind/article37605714/|access-date=2020-05-21}}</ref>
