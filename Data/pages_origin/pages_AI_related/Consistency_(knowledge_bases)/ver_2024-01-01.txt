A [[knowledge base]] KB is '''consistent''' ''[[iff]]'' its negation is not a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].

I.e., a knowledge base KB is inconsistent (not consistent) [[iff]] there is no [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] which [[entailment|entails]] KB.

Example of an inconsistent knowledge base:

KB := { a, Â¬a }

Consistency in terms of knowledge bases is mostly the same as the natural understanding of [[consistency]].
