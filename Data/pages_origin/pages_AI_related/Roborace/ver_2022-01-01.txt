The chassis itself is shaped like a teardrop, improving aerodynamic efficiency. The car weighs around 1350&nbsp;kg and is {{convert|4.8|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide. It has four electric motors, each with a power of 135&nbsp;kW producing over 500&nbsp;hp combined, and utilizes a 840V battery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/roborace-car-formyla-e-robocar-uk-autonomous-race-denis-sverdlov|title=Roborace is building a 300kph AI supercar – no driver required|last=Burgess|first=Matt|date=2018-03-03|work=Wired UK|access-date=2019-05-31|issn=1357-0978}}</ref> For navigation, it relies on a mixture of optical systems, [[radar]]s, [[lidar]]s and ultrasonic sensors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Driverless Car makes History on the Streets of Paris|url=http://roborace.com/static/docs/ROBORACE_PARIS_200517.pdf|publisher=Roborace|date=20 May 2017}}</ref> The vehicle has been demonstrated at speeds of almost {{convert|300|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/27/roborace-autonomous-cars-formula-e |title=Formula E announces 300kph 'RoboRace' championship|magazine=Wired UK|publisher=wired.co.uk |date=27 November 2015|last1=Nast|first1=Condé}}</ref>

===DevBot===
[[File:Roborace NYC ePrix.jpg|thumb|Another Robocar on display at the [[2017 New York City ePrix]]]]
Development of the Robocar started in early 2016, with a first outing of a test vehicle, the so-called DevBot, following in the summer of the same year. The test car consisted of the same internal units (battery, motor, electronics) used in the Robocar, but were placed in the chassis of a [[Ginetta Cars|Ginetta]] [[LMP3]] car<ref>{{cite web|url=http://current-e.com/chatter/roborace-devbot-to-make-public-debut-at-donington/|title=Roborace DevBot debuts at Donington|publisher=current-e.com|date=24 August 2016}}</ref> without an engine cover in order to provide better cooling and access.

DevBot saw its first public outing at the Formula E pre-season tests in [[Donington Park]] in August 2016. After battery issues in [[2016 Hong Kong ePrix|Hong Kong]] caused the development team to abandon their demonstration run, the DevBot successfully drove twelve laps around the [[Circuit International Automobile Moulay El Hassan|Moulay El Hassan]] Formula E circuit in [[Marrakesh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-formel.de/news/roborace-erfolgreicher-test-in-marrakesch-5567.html|title=Roborace: Erfolgreicher Test in Marrakesch|publisher=e-formel.de|date=12 November 2016}}</ref> Other test tracks included Michelin's testing ground in Ladoux and the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone Stowe Circuit]].

During testing ahead of the [[2017 Buenos Aires ePrix]], two DevBot cars raced against each other autonomously, resulting in one of the vehicles crashing on a corner.<ref name=BBC39027477>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39027477 |title=Driverless Roborace car crashes at speed in Buenos Aires |first=Leo |last=Kelion |publisher=BBC News Online |access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

During the 2017–18 Formula E season, Roborace pitched pro-drifter [[Ryan Tuerck]] against a DevBot at the Rome ePrix.<ref>https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/14/roborace-self-driving-car-versus-human/</ref> At the Berlin ePrix, Roborace held the Human + Machine Challenge, the first race for combined teams of human drivers and AIs using a pair of Devbots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/10/roborace-wants-the-future-of-racing-to-be-ai-plus-humans-working-together/|title=Roborace wants the future of racing to be AI plus humans, working together|last=Gitlin|first=Jonathan M.|date=2018-10-16|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>

=== DevBot 2.0 ===
[[File:2019-04-Roborace Monteblanco Day02 Monday-PM-29.jpg|thumb|DevBot 2.0 (racing as [[Technical University of Munich]]) competing in Season Alpha]]
An upgraded version of DevBot was announced in late 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/new-devbot-20-autonomous-racer-looks-wild|title=The new DevBot 2.0 autonomous racer looks wild|date=2018-11-09|website=Top Gear|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> and after private testing made its public debut in 2019 at the inaugural Season Alpha event. DevBot 2.0 uses the same technology as both Robocar and DevBot, with the main changes being a conversion to being driven on the rear axle only, a lower position for the driver for safety reasons and a bespoke composite bodywork.

==Seasons==
===Testing===
====2016–17 Formula E season====
Roborace appeared at a number of Formula E events during the [[2016–17 Formula E season]]. However, in this period only test drives with two different DevBots took place. Within the framework of the [[2017 Buenos Aires ePrix]] both DevBot vehicles drove against each other on a race track for the first time. There were also DevBot demonstrations at the [[2016 Marrakesh ePrix]], [[2017 Berlin ePrix]], [[2017 New York City ePrix]] and [[2017 Montreal ePrix]].

At the [[2017 Paris ePrix]], the developers also let a Robocar onto the track for the first time, even though the vehicle only drove the track at walking speed.

====2017–18 Formula E season====
At the start of the 2017/18 Formula E season, the Roborace developers once again tested the DevBot during a public time trial between the Roborace CI and the TV presenter [[Nicki Shields]] at the [[2017 Hong Kong ePrix]]. As part of a similar time trial at the [[2018 Rome ePrix]], drift professional [[Ryan Tuerck]] also tested the DevBot.

The Human + Machine Challenge was created for the Formula E race on the [[Berlin ePrix]]. A team of doctoral students from the [[Technical University Munich]]<ref>{{cite web|surname1=Institute of Automotive Technology|title=Research Group Vehicle Dynamics, Project Roborace: Autonomous Motorsport|language=de|url=https://www.ftm.mw.tum.de/en/main-research/vehicle-dynamics-and-control-systems/roborace-autonomous-motorsport/|access-date=2019-01-30
}}</ref> (TUM) and the [[University of Pisa]] programmed the software for the Devbot to drive autonomously around the circuit in Berlin. Afterwards both teams in combination with a human driver competed in a public time trial.<ref>{{cite web |author=Laura Goudkamp, Bayerischer Rundfunk |title=Roboter-Rennauto vs. Mensch: Mit einem Algorithmus beim Roborace 2018 zum Sieg? {{!}} BR.de |date=2018-06-06 |url=https://www.br.de/fernsehen/ard-alpha/sendungen/campusmagazin/robo-race-autonome-auto-roboter-rennen-berlin-challenge-100.html |access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref> The vehicle of the team of the Technical University Munich finished the Human + Machine Challenge with an average lap time of 91.59 seconds, almost four seconds faster than that of the University Pisa with 95.36 seconds and thus won the Challenge.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fast and Driverless: Munich Roborace Victory {{!}}} NVIDIA Blog |publisher=The Official NVIDIA Blog |date=2018-06-29 |url=https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/06/29/fast-and-driverless-munich-roborace-victory/ |access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref>

At the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]], Robocar became the first ever fully autonomous race car to complete the Goodwood Hill Climb. The vehicle completed the first official autonomous run on 13 July 2018 within the framework of the event.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/137394/roborace-car-completes-goodwood-hillclimb |publisher=Autosport.com |title=Roborace car completes autonomous Goodwood hillclimb run |author=Matt Kew, James Newbold |date=2018-07-13 |access-date=2018-08-13 |language=en}}</ref>

===Season Alpha (2019)===

Season Alpha took place at various locations in Europe and North America with the aim of testing several competition formats using the new DevBot 2.0.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techau.com.au/roboraces-season-alpha-video-will-make-you-want-to-be-a-programmer/|title=Roborace's season alpha video will make you want to be a programmer|last=jasoncartwright|date=2019-05-13|website=techAU|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> The first event was held at the [[Circuito Monteblanco]] in Spain, and featured the first race between two fully autonomous cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/news/sport-cars/first-roborace-driverless-car-race-held-spain|title=First Roborace driverless car race held in Spain|publisher=motorsportmagazine.com|date=2019-05-03}}</ref> The events were not broadcast live, instead short clips on [[YouTube]] were released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBd5FZqhUVk|title=Season Alpha: Autonomous Racing Begins Here|date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Two teams were competing: [[Arrival (company)|Arrival]] and [[Technical University of Munich]].

On 7 July 2019, the Roborace DevBot 2.0 car set the first ever autonomous official timed run at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]], with a time of 66.96&nbsp;s and a top speed of {{cvt|162.8|km/h}}. This is currently the record for autonomous vehicles.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Belton|first=Padraig|date=2019-08-27|title=The robo racing cars accelerating driverless tech|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49420570|access-date=2020-06-29}}</ref>

Roborace also set the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for having the fastest autonomous car in the world. The Robocar reached a speed of {{cvt|282.42|km/h}}.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-17|title=Robocar: Watch the world's fastest autonomous car reach its record-breaking 282 km/h|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/10/robocar-watch-the-worlds-fastest-autonomous-car-reach-its-record-breaking-282-k|access-date=2020-06-29|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Season Beta (2020–21)===
The second testing season took place at various locations between September 2020 and October 2021, featuring 16 races and involving [[mixed reality]] elements dubbed "Roborace Metaverse",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prunderground.com/roborace-returns-to-the-track-with-revised-season-beta-competition-calendar/00196695/|title=Roborace Returns To The Track With Revised Season Beta Competition Calendar|publisher=prunderground.com|date=2020-07-22}}</ref> which is based on Roborace's patented technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020229841A1|title=A metaverse data fusion system|date=2019-05-15}}</ref> The program of Season Beta competitions has gradually complicating rules arranged in a progression of so-called ''missions''. Each mission consists of two racing rounds — one round per day. A ''mission plan'' issued by Roborace for each mission defines its objectives, rules, and point-scoring system. The key objective of Season Beta is to come to the point when the majority of competing teams have developed sufficient capability for wheel-to-wheel racing in Season 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/roborace/what-is-season-beta-eeefa1421c09|title=What is Season Beta?|publisher=medium.com|date=2021-05-10}}</ref>

There were 7 teams competing in Season Beta: [[Arrival (company)|Arrival Racing]] ([[UK]]/[[Russia]]), [[Graz University of Technology|Autonomous Racing Graz]] ([[Austria]]), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Driverless]] ([[USA]]), [[Schaffhausen Institute of Technology|Acronis SIT]] ([[Switzerland]]), [[University of Pisa]] ([[Italy]]), [[Polytechnic University of Milan|PoliMOVE]] ([[Italy]]), [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] ([[USA]]).

Roborace broadcast Season Beta as live streams on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], supporting the competition with intermediate weekly streams on different topics.

===Season 1 (2022)===
As announced by Roborace, Season 1 will start in 2022 by introducing a wheel-to-wheel racing format involving multiple cars on the track along with dynamic [[Metaverse]] elements.
