{{distinguish|Marketing and artificial intelligence}}'''Artificial intelligence marketing''' ('''AIM''') is a form of [[marketing]] that leverages [[artificial intelligence]] concepts and models such as [[machine learning]] and [[Bayesian networks|Bayesian Networks]] to achieve marketing goals. The main difference between AIM and traditional forms of marketing resides in the [[Artificial intelligence#Reasoning, problem-solving|reasoning]], which is performed by a computer algorithm rather than a human.

Artificial Intelligence is used in various [[digital marketing]] spaces, such as [[content marketing]], [[email marketing]], [[Online advertising|online advertisement]] (in combination with [[machine learning]]), [[social media marketing]], [[affiliate marketing]], and beyond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=YEĞİN|first=TUĞBA|date=2020-01-01|title=Pazarlama Stratejilerinde Yapay Zekanin|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17753/ekev1340|journal=Ekev Akademi Dergisi|issue=81|pages=489–506|doi=10.17753/ekev1340|s2cid=216545054 |issn=2148-0710}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=How AI is already being used for online advertising |url=https://www.storeya.com/ppc/HowAIisusedonlineadvertising |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=www.storeya.com}}</ref>

==Behavioral targeting==
[[Behavioral targeting]] refers to the act of reaching out to a prospect or customer with communication based on implicit or explicit behavior shown by the customer's past.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Opinion 2/2010 on online behavioural advertising |url=https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp171_en.pdf |journal=Article 29 Data Protection Working Party}}</ref> Understanding of behaviors is facilitated by marketing technology platforms such as [[web analytics]], mobile analytics, [[social media analytics]], and [[trigger-based marketing]] platforms. Artificial Intelligence Marketing provides a set of tools and techniques that enable behavioral targeting.

Machine learning is used to improve the efficiency of behavioral targeting. Additionally, to prevent human bias in behavioral targeting at scale, artificial intelligence technologies are used. The most advanced form of behavioral targeting aided by artificial intelligence is called algorithmic marketing.

==Collect, reason, act==
Artificial intelligence marketing principles are based on the [[perception]]-[[reasoning]]-action cycle found in [[cognitive science]]. In the context of marketing, this cycle is adapted to form the '''collect''', '''reason''' and '''act''' cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Animesh Kumar|last2=Sharma|first2=Rahul|title=Considerations in artificial intelligence-based marketing: An ethical perspective|journal=Applied Marketing Analytics|volume=9|issue=2|pages=162–172|url=https://hstalks.com/article/7947/considerations-in-artificial-intelligence-based-ma/|year=2023}}</ref>
===Collect===
This term relates to all activities which aim to capture [[customer]] or [[Prospect (marketing)|prospect]] data; for example on social media platforms, where the platform will measure the duration of time a post was viewed. Whether taken [[online]] or [[offline]], this data is then saved into customer or prospect databases.

===Reason===
This is the stage where [[data]] is transformed into information and, eventually, [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] or [[insight]]. This is the phase where artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular play a key role.

===Act===
With the intelligence gathered in the ''reason'' stage, one can then ''act''. In the context of marketing, an act would be an attempt to influence a prospect or customer purchase decision using an [[incentive]] driven message.

In an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] model, the machine in question would take the decision and act according to the information it received in the ''collect'' stage.
