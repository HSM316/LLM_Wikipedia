'''Artificial intelligence marketing''' ('''AIM''') is a form of [[marketing]] leveraging [[artificial intelligence]]  concept and model such as [[machine learning]] and [[Bayesian Network]] to achieve marketing goals. The main difference resides in the [[Artificial intelligence#Deduction.2C reasoning.2C problem solving|reasoning]] part which suggests it is performed by computer and algorithm instead of human.

==Behavioral targeting==
Artificial intelligence marketing provides a set of tools and techniques that enable [[behavioral targeting]].

==Collect, reason, act==
Artificial intelligence marketing principle is based on the [[perception]]-[[reasoning]]-action cycle you find in [[cognitive science]]. In marketing context this cycle is adapted to form the '''collect''', '''reason''' and '''act''' cycle.

===Collect===
This term relates to all activities which aims at capturing [[customer]] or [[Prospect (marketing)|prospect]] data. Whether taken [[online]] or [[offline]] these data are then saved into customer or prospect databases.

===Reason===
This is the part where data is transformed into information and eventually [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] or [[insight]]. This is the section where artificial intelligence and [[machine learning]] in particular have a key role to play.

===Act===
With the intelligence gathered from the ''reason'' step above you can then ''act''. In marketing context act would be some sort of communications that would attempt to influence a prospect or customer purchase decision using [[incentive]] driven message

Again artificial intelligence has a role to play in this stage as well. Ultimately in an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] model the machine would take the decision and act accordingly to the information it receives at the ''collect'' stage.

==Machine learning==
''[[Machine learning]] is concerned with the design and development of [[algorithm]]s and techniques that allow computers to "learn".''

As defined above machine learning is one of the techniques that can be employed to enable more effective '''behavioral targeting'''

==Concerns==
As mentioned in the [[behavioral targeting]] article :

<blockquote>
''"Many online users & advocacy groups are concerned about [[privacy]] issues around doing this type of targeting. This is an area that the behavioral targeting industry is trying to minimize through education, advocacy & product constraints to keep all information non-personally identifiable or to use opt-in and permission from end-users (permission marketing)."''
