'''Artificial intelligence marketing''' ('''AIM''') is a form of [[marketing]] leveraging [[artificial intelligence]]  concept and model such as [[machine learning]] and [[Bayesian Network]] to achieve marketing goals. The main difference resides in the [[Artificial intelligence#Deduction.2C reasoning.2C problem solving|reasoning]] part which suggests it is performed by computer and algorithm instead of a human.

Artificial intelligence is being applied in various [[digital marketing]] spaces, such as content marketing, email marketing, social media marketing, [[affiliate marketing]], and beyond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=YEĞİN|first=TUĞBA|date=2020-01-01|title=Pazarlama Stratejilerinde Yapay Zekanin|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.17753/ekev1340|journal=Ekev Akademi Dergisi|issue=81|pages=489–506|doi=10.17753/ekev1340|issn=2148-0710}}</ref>

==Behavioral targeting==
Behavioral targeting refers to reaching out to a prospect or customer with communication-based on implicit or explicit behavior shown. Understanding of behaviors is facilitated by marketing technology platforms such as [[web analytics]], mobile analytics, [[social media analytics]] and [[trigger-based marketing]] platforms. Artificial intelligence marketing provides a set of tools and techniques that enable [[behavioral targeting]].

To improve the efficiency of behavioral targeting, [[machine learning]] is used. Also, to prevent human bias in targeting customers based on behaviors and do this at scale, [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are used. The most advanced form of behavioral targeting with the help of artificial intelligence is called Algorithmic Marketing.

==Collect, reason, act==
Artificial intelligence marketing principle is based on the [[perception]]-[[reasoning]]-action cycle you find in [[cognitive science]]. In marketing context this cycle is adapted to form the '''collect''', '''reason''' and '''act''' cycle.

===Collect===
This term relates to all activities which aim at capturing [[customer]] or [[Prospect (marketing)|prospect]] data. Whether taken [[online]] or [[offline]] these data are then saved into customer or prospect databases.

===Reason===
This is the part where data is transformed into information and eventually [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] or [[insight]]. This is the section where artificial intelligence and [[machine learning]] in particular have a key role to play.

===Act===
With the intelligence gathered from the ''reason'' step above you can then ''act''. In marketing context act would be some sort of communications that would attempt to influence a prospect or customer purchase decision using [[incentive]] driven message

Again artificial intelligence has a role to play in this stage as well. Ultimately in an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] model the machine would take the decision and act accordingly to the information it receives at the ''collect'' stage.
