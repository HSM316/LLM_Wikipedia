The '''Culture series''' is a [[science fiction]] [[book series|series]] written by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] author [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]]. The stories centre on [[the Culture]], a [[utopia]]n, [[Post-scarcity economy|post-scarcity]] space society of [[humanoid]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, and very advanced [[artificial intelligence]]s living in [[socialism|socialist]] habitats spread across the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. The main theme of the novels is the dilemmas that an idealistic [[hyperpower]] faces in dealing with civilizations that do not share its [[Ideal_(ethics)|ideals]], and whose behaviour it sometimes finds repulsive. In some of the stories action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the [[galaxy]].

==The Culture==
{{main|The Culture}}
The Culture is a society formed by various [[humanoid]] races and [[artificial intelligence]]s about 9,000&nbsp;years before the events of novels in the series. Since the majority of its biological population can have virtually anything they want without the need to work, there is little need for [[laws]] or [[law enforcement|enforcement]], and the culture is described by Banks as space [[socialism]].<ref name="BanksAFewNotes" /><ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/> It features a [[post-scarcity economy]]<!-- the Banks source [which source? -- another editor] is explicit that it is material scarcity being represented in the series, not ordinary "scarcity" as the term is used in economics, which includes scarcity of time, or having even abundant resources always available in large amounts at every point where the humans (or humanoids) might want them. --><ref>{{Citation|last=Parsons |first=Michael |last2=Banks |first2=Iain M |title=Interview: Iain M Banks talks 'The Hydrogen Sonata' with Wired.co.uk |publisher=[[Wired UK]] |date=16 November 2012 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d1slP9vx?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archivedate=2015-11-14 |quote=It is my vision of what you do when you are in that post-scarcity society, you can completely indulge myself.

Although the Culture has more advanced technology and a more powerful economy than the vast majority of known civilizations, it is just one of the "Involved" civilizations that take an active part in galactic affairs. The much older Homomda are slightly more advanced at the time of ''Consider Phlebas'' (this is, however, set several centuries before the other books, and Culture technology and martial power continues to advance in the interim);<ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebasIdiranWar"/> the Morthanveld have a much larger population and economy, but are hampered by a more restrictive attitude to the role of AI in their society.<ref name="Banks2008Matter"/> The capabilities of all such societies are vastly exceeded by those of the Elder civilisations (semi-retired from Galactic politics but who remain supremely potent) and the Sublimed, entities which have abandoned their material form for a non-corporeal, multi-dimensional existence, but these generally refrain from intervention in the material world.<ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems"/>

Some other civilizations hold less favourable views of the Culture.<ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/> At the time of their war with the Culture, the Idirans and some of their allies regarded the control that the Minds exercised over the Culture as a form of [[idolatry]].<ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/><ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebas"/> The Homomda regard the Culture as idealistic and hyper-active.<ref name="Banks2000LTW"/> Some members of the Culture have seceded to form related civilizations, known collectively as the Ulterior. These include the Peace Faction, the AhForgetIt Tendency and the [[Zetetic Elench]]. Others simply drop out temporarily or permanently.<ref name="Banks1996Excession"/>

In subsequent novels, the Cultureâ€”particularly SC and, to a lesser degree, Contactâ€”continue to employ subterfuge, [[espionage]], and even [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] (collectively called "dirty tricks") in order to protect itself and spread the Culture's "good works" and ideals. These dirty tricks include blackmailing persons, employing mercenaries, recruiting [[double agent]]s, attempting to effect [[regime change]], and even engaging in [[false flag]] operations against the Culture itself (potentially resulting in the death of billions).<ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias" /><ref name="Banks1996Excession" /><ref name="Banks1988PlayerOfGames" /> Though each of these individual actions would horrify the average Culture citizen, the Culture's Minds tend to justify these actions in terms of lives saved in the long-term, perhaps over the course of several hundred years. The Culture is willing to use not only preemptive, but also retaliatory actions in order to deter future hostile actions against itself. Banks commented that in order to prevent atrocities, "even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book."<ref name="GravitasShipNames" /> Andrew M.

Much of ''Look to Windward'' is a commentary on the Idiran-Culture war, from a viewpoint 800&nbsp;years later, mainly reflecting grief over both personal and large-scale losses and guilt over actions taken in the war. It combines these with similar reflections on the catastrophic miscarriage of the Culture's attempt to dissolve the Chelgrians' oppressive caste system. In neither case, however, does distress over the consequences of Culture policy lead its representatives to reject that policy. The book illustrates the limitations of power, and also points out that Minds and other AIs are as vulnerable as biological persons to grief, guilt and regrets.<ref name="Duggan2007BanksPostmodernismAndGulfWar"/>

==Place within science fiction==
{{main|Science fiction|Space opera}}
When the first Culture stories appeared, science fiction was dominated by [[cyberpunk]], a pessimistic subgenre that worried about, but offered no solutions for, the [[offshoring]] of jobs to countries with lower costs or less strict regulations, the increasing power of corporations and the threats to privacy posed by computer networks. The Culture stories are [[space opera]], with certain elements that are free from scientific realism, and Banks uses this freedom extravagantly in order to focus on the human and political aspects of his universe; he rejects the dystopian direction of present day [[capitalism]], which both cyberpunk and earlier space operas assume, in creating a post-scarcity society as the primary civilization of focus.<ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession">{{cite book |last=Mendelsohn |first=F. |title=A Companion to Science Fiction |editor=Seed, D. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |pages=559â€“566 |chapter=Iain M.Banks: ''Excession'' |isbn=1-4051-1218-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO_z5WFKwpoC&pg=PP12&dq=culture+%22iain+m+banks%22+ |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> Space opera had peaked in the 1930s, but started to decline as magazine editors such as [[John W. Campbell]] demanded more realistic approaches. By the 1960s many space operas were satires on earlier styles, such as [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s [[Stainless Steel Rat]] and [[Bill, the Galactic Hero]] stories,<ref>{{cite book |last=Westfahl |first=G. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |editor=James, E. |editor2=Mendelsohn, F. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |pages=197â€“208 |chapter=Space opera |isbn=0-521-01657-6}}</ref> while televised and film space operas such as ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were thought to have dumbed down the subgenre.<ref>http://whatculture.com/film/15-blunders-that-ruined-j-j-abrams-star-trek-and-destroyed-the-franchise.php</ref><ref>http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/documents/introduction72.htm</ref><ref>http://macha.itc.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/31808/59792_1.pdf?sequence=1</ref> The Culture stories did much to revive space opera.<ref name="Johnson1998ExcessionReview"/><ref name="Butler2003British Boom"/>

==Literary techniques==
Banks has been described as "an incorrigible player of games" with both style and structure&nbsp;â€“ and with the reader.<ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/> In both the Culture stories and his work outside science fiction, there are two sides to Banks, the "merry chatterer" who brings scenes to life and "the altogether less amiable character" who "engineers the often savage structure of his stories".<ref name="Sleight2008Matter">{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2008/03/locus-magazines-graham-sleight-reviews.html |title=Locus Magazine's Graham Sleight reviews Iain M. Banks |last=Sleight |first=G. |date=March 2008 |publisher=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> Banks uses a wide range of styles. ''[[The Player of Games]]'' opens in a leisurely manner as it presents the main character's sense of boredom and inertia,<ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer">{{cite web |url=http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-06-105356-2.html |title=Review: ''The Player of Games'' by Iain M. Banks |date=18 November 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> and adopts for the main storyline a "spare, functional" style that contrasts with the "linguistic fireworks" of later stories.<ref name="HoltSFX2007Player">{{cite journal|last=Holt |first=T. |date=November 2007 |title=Must-read Classic of SF Literature: ''The Player of Games'' |journal=SFX Magazine |pages=114 |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010093702/http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}</ref> Sometimes the styles used in ''[[Excession]]'' relate to the function and focal character of the scene: slow-paced and detailed for Dajeil, who is still mourning over traumatic events that happened decades earlier; a parody of huntin', shootin', and fishin' country gentlemen, sometimes reminiscent of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], when describing the viewpoint of the Affront; the ship ''Serious Callers Only'', afraid of becoming involved in the conflict between factions of [[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]], speaks in cryptic verse, while the ''Sleeper Service'', acting as a freelance detective, adopts a [[hardboiled]] style. On the other hand, Banks often wrong-foots readers by using prosaic descriptions for the grandest scenery, self-deprecation and humour for the most heroic actions, and a poetic style in describing one of the Affront's killings.<ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/>

He delights in building up expectations and then surprising the reader.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Even in ''The Player of Games'', which has the simplest style and structure of the series, the last line of the epilogue reveals who was really pulling the strings all along.<ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/> In all the Culture stories, Banks subverts many clichÃ©s of [[space opera]]. The Minds are not plotting to take over the universe, and no-one is following a grand plan.<ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/> The darkly comic double-act of Ferbin and Holse in ''[[Matter (novel)|Matter]]'' is not something most writers would place in "the normally po-faced context of space opera".<ref name="Sleight2008Matter"/> Even the names of Culture spaceships are jokes&nbsp;â€“ for example ''Lightly Seared on the Reality Grill'', ''Experiencing a Significant Gravitas Shortfall'' (part of a [[running gag]] in the series<ref name="GravitasShipNames">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124054925/http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archivedate=24 November 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15 |title=Iain Banks&nbsp;â€“ Interview}} Originally published in [[The Guardian]], 2000</ref>) and ''Liveware Problem'' (see [[liveware]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/fiction.iainbanks |accessdate=2009-02-15 |last=Poole. |first=S. |title=Review&nbsp;â€“ "Matter" by Iain M. Banks |date=9 February 2008 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Banks often uses "outsiders" as viewpoint characters,<ref name="Vint2007Bodies">{{cite book |last=Vint |first=S. |title=Bodies of tomorrow |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |pages=79â€“101 |chapter=3&nbsp;â€“ Iain M.

The focal character of ''The Player of Games'' is bored with the lack of real challenges in his life,<ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/> is blackmailed into becoming a Culture agent, admires the vibrancy of the Azad Empire but is then disgusted by its brutality,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and wins the final of the tournament by playing in a style that reflects the Culture's values.<ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/>

''Use of Weapons'' features a non-Culture mercenary who accepts the benefits of association with the Culture, including immortality as the fee for his first assignment, and completes several dangerous missions as a Culture agent, but complains that he is kept in the dark about the aims of his missions and that in some of the wars he has fought maybe the Culture was backing both sides, with good reason.<ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/>

''Look to Windward'' uses three commentators on the Culture, a near-immortal Behemothaur, a member of the race plunged into civil war by a Culture intervention that went wrong, and the ambassador of a race at similar technological level to the Culture's.<ref name="Gevers2000LTWReview"/>

The action scenes of the Culture stories are comparable to those of blockbuster films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=C. |date=March 1999 |title=Galactic Empires and the Contemporary Extravaganza: Dan Simmons and Iain M. Banks |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/77/palmer77.htm |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> In an interview, Banks said he would like ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' to be filmed "with a very, very, very big budget indeed" and would not mind if the story were given a [[happy ending]], provided the biggest action scenes were kept.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/2p1.html |title=Interview with Iain M. Banks |year=2002 |publisher=SFF World |accessdate=2009-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715133026/http://www.sffworld.com/interview/2p1.html |archive-date=2009-07-15 |url-status=dead }} (page 2 of the interview; page 1 is [http://www.sffworld.com/interview/2p0.html here])</ref> On the other hand, ''The Player of Games'' relies mainly on the psychological tension of the games by which the ruler of the Azad Empire is selected.<ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"/>

Banks is unspecific about many of the background details in the stories, such as the rules of the game that is the centrepiece of ''The Player of Games'',<ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"/> and cheerfully makes no attempt at scientific credibility.<ref>"I know it's all nonsense, but you've got to admit it's impressive nonsense." {{cite web|url=http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |title=A Few Notes on the Culture |last=Banks |first=I.M. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322183158/http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref>

==Genesis of the series==
Banks says he conceived the Culture in the 1960s, and that it is a combination of wish fulfilment and a reaction against the predominantly right-wing science fiction produced in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/iain-banks-interview.php |title=Iain Banks&nbsp;â€“ Interview |last=Lowe |first=G. |date=24 March 2008 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> In his opinion, the Culture might be a "great place to live", with no exploitation of people or AIs, and whose people could create beings greater than themselves.<ref name="Gevers2002CulturedFuturist">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |title=Cultured futurist Iain M. Banks creates an ornate utopia |last=Gevers |first=N. |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002115448/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Before his first published novel, ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' (1984; not science fiction), was accepted in 1983, Banks wrote five books that were rejected, of which three were science fiction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0996bank.php |title=Iain Banks : ''Whit'' and ''Excession'': Getting Used To Being God |last=Mitchell |first=C. |date=3 September 1996 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> In Banks' first draft of ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' in 1974, his third attempt at a novel, the Culture was just a backdrop intended to show that the mercenary agent was working for the "good guys" and was responsible for his own misdeeds. At the time he persuaded his friend [[Ken MacLeod]] to read it and MacLeod tried to suggest improvements, but the book had too much [[purple prose]] and a very convoluted structure. In 1984, shortly after ''The Wasp Factory'' was published, MacLeod was asked to read ''Use of Weapons'' again, and said there was "a good novel in there struggling to get out", and suggested the interleaved forwards and backwards narratives that appeared in the published version in 1990. The novella ''[[The State of the Art]]'', which provides the title of the 1991 collection, dates from 1979, the first draft of ''[[The Player of Games]]'' from 1980 and that of ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' from 1982.<ref name="Wilson1994BanksInterview">{{cite web |url=http://textualities.net/tag/iain-m-banks/ |title=Iain Banks Interview |last=Wilson |first=A. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Inversions (novel)|Inversions]]'' won the 2004 Italia Science Fiction Award for the Best International Novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/columns/news0403.htm |title=SF Site: News (March 2004) |last=Silver |first=S.H. |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517073827/http://www.sfsite.com/columns/news0403.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}</ref>

The American edition of ''[[Look to Windward]]'' was listed by the editors of SF Site as one of the "Best SF and Fantasy Books of 2001" after the UK edition had missed out by just one place the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/columns/best02.htm |title=Best SF and Fantasy Books of 2001: Editors' Choice |last=Walsh |first=N. |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>
