'''Fog robotics''' can be defined as an architecture which consists of storage, networking functions, control with [[fog computing]] closer to [[robot]]s.<ref name=fogintro>[https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/120748 Fog Robotics: An Introduction.

==Concept==
Fog robotics mainly consists of a fog robot server and the cloud.<ref name=ecn>[https://www.ecnmag.com/news/2018/11/fog-robotics-new-approach-achieve-efficient-and-fluent-human-robot-interaction Fog Robotics: A New Approach to Achieve Efficient and Fluent Human-Robot Interaction.

Moreover, these servers are adaptable, consists of processing power for [[computation]], network capability, and secured by sharing the outcomes to other robots for advanced performance with the lowest possible [[Network latency|latency]].<ref name=gudi/>

As [[cloud robotics]] is facing issues such as bandwidth limitations, [[Network latency|latency]] issues, [[quality of service]], [[privacy]] and [[security]] - Fog robotics can be seen as a viable option for the future robotic systems.<ref name=tc>[https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/watch-every-panel-from-tc-sessions-robotics/ Getting a Grip on Reality: Deep Learning and Robot Grasping Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, 2018]</ref> It is also considered as distributed robot systems of the next generation because robots require much brain power for processing billions of [[computation]]s while performing its task.<ref name=nature>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0008-x?WT.feed_name=subjects_mechanical-engineering Robots and the return to collaborative intelligence.

'''{{visible anchor|Social robots}}'''

A [[social robot]] can either connect to the cloud or fog robot server depending upon the availability of information. For instance, it can make a [[robot]] working at an airport to communicate with other robots for effective communication with the help of fog robotics.<ref name=ingrid>[https://techxplore.com/news/2018-11-fog-robotics-approach-efficient-fluent.html Fog robotics: A new approach to achieve efficient and fluent human-robot interaction.

'''Node-level systems: FogROS<ref name=":0">{{cite arXiv |last1=Kaiyuan |last2=Chen |last3=Liang |first3=Yafei |last4=Jha |first4=Nikhil |last5=Ichnowski |first5=Jeffrey |last6=Danielczuk |first6=Michael |last7=Gonzalez |first7=Joseph |last8=Kubiatowicz |first8=John |last9=Goldberg |first9=Ken |date=2021-08-25 |title=FogROS: An Adaptive Framework for Automating Fog Robotics Deployment |class=cs.RO |eprint=2108.11355 }}</ref>'''

FogROS is proposed by UCB'''<ref name=":0" />'''. FogROS is a framework that allows existing ROS automation applications to gain access to additional computing resources from commercial cloud-based services. This framework is built on the Robot Operating System (ROS), the de-facto standard for creating robot automation applications and components. With minimal porting effort, FogROS allows researchers to deploy components of their software to the cloud with high transparency.

'''Algorithm-level system: ElasticROS'''<ref name=":1">{{cite arXiv |last1=Liu |first1=Boyi |last2=Wang |first2=Lujia |last3=Liu |first3=Ming |date=2022-09-05 |title=ElasticROS: An Elastically Collaborative Robot Operation System for Fog and Cloud Robotics |class=cs.RO |eprint=2209.01774 }}</ref>

ElasticROS is proposed by HKUST.<ref name=":1" /> The present node-level systems are not flexible enough to dynamically adapt to changing conditions. To address this, the authors present ElasticROS, which evolves the present node-level systems into an algorithm-level one. ElasticROS is based on ROS and ROS2. For fog and cloud robotics, it is the first robot operating system with algorithm-level collaborative computing. ElasticROS develops elastic collaborative computing to achieve adaptability to dynamic conditions. The collaborative computing algorithm is the core and challenge of ElasticROS. The authors abstract the problem and then propose an algorithm named ElasAction to address. It is a dynamic action decision algorithm based on online learning, which determines how robots and servers cooperate. The algorithm dynamically updates parameters to adapt to changes of conditions where the robot is currently in. It achieves elastically distributing of computing tasks to robots and servers according to configurations. In addition, the authors prove that the regret upper bound of the ElasAction is sublinear, which guarantees its convergence and thus enables ElasticROS to be stable in its elasticity.

This project focusses on designing novel programming models for Fog applications both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[operating system]] (OS) mechanisms including communication [[Communication protocol|protocol]]s of ''fog nodes''. These fog nodes will be further tested real time on robots and other [[automation]] devices. Furthermore, an [[open-source architecture]] will be built on open standards, e.g., 5G, OPC Unified Architecture (UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
