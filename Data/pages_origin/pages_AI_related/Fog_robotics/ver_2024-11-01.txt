==Concept==
Fog robotics mainly consists of a fog robot server and the cloud.<ref name=ecn>[https://www.ecnmag.com/news/2018/11/fog-robotics-new-approach-achieve-efficient-and-fluent-human-robot-interaction Fog Robotics: A New Approach to Achieve Efficient and Fluent Human-Robot Interaction.

Moreover, these servers are adaptable, consists of processing power for [[computation]], network capability, and secured by sharing the outcomes to other robots for advanced performance with the lowest possible [[Network latency|latency]].<ref name=gudi/>

As [[cloud robotics]] is facing issues such as bandwidth limitations, [[Network latency|latency]] issues, [[quality of service]], [[privacy]] and [[security]] - Fog robotics can be seen as a viable option for the future robotic systems.<ref name=tc>[https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/watch-every-panel-from-tc-sessions-robotics/ Getting a Grip on Reality: Deep Learning and Robot Grasping Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, 2018]</ref> It is also considered as distributed robot systems of the next generation because robots require much brain power for processing billions of [[computation]]s while performing its task.<ref name=nature>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0008-x?WT.feed_name=subjects_mechanical-engineering Robots and the return to collaborative intelligence.

==Applications==

'''{{visible anchor|Social robots}}'''

A [[social robot]] can either connect to the cloud or fog robot server depending upon the availability of information. For instance, it can make a [[robot]] working at an airport to communicate with other robots for effective communication with the help of fog robotics.<ref name=ingrid>[https://techxplore.com/news/2018-11-fog-robotics-approach-efficient-fluent.html Fog robotics: A new approach to achieve efficient and fluent human-robot interaction.

==Fog robotic systems==

'''Node-level systems: FogROS<ref name=":0">{{cite arXiv |last1=Kaiyuan |last2=Chen |last3=Liang |first3=Yafei |last4=Jha |first4=Nikhil |last5=Ichnowski |first5=Jeffrey |last6=Danielczuk |first6=Michael |last7=Gonzalez |first7=Joseph |last8=Kubiatowicz |first8=John |last9=Goldberg |first9=Ken |date=2021-08-25 |title=FogROS: An Adaptive Framework for Automating Fog Robotics Deployment |class=cs.RO |eprint=2108.11355 }}</ref>'''

FogROS is a framework that allows existing Robot Operating System (ROS) automation applications to gain access to additional computing resources from commercial cloud-based services. With minimal porting effort, FogROS allows researchers to deploy components of their software to the cloud with high transparency.

'''Algorithm-level system: ElasticROS'''<ref name=":1">{{cite arXiv |last1=Liu |first1=Boyi |last2=Wang |first2=Lujia |last3=Liu |first3=Ming |date=2022-09-05 |title=ElasticROS: An Elastically Collaborative Robot Operation System for Fog and Cloud Robotics |class=cs.RO |eprint=2209.01774 }}</ref>

ElasticROS enhances robot systems by advancing from node to algorithm-level adaptability. It's the robot operating system integrating algorithm-level collaboration for fog and cloud robotics, deploying Elastic Collaborative Computing for real-time adjustments.

This project focusses on designing novel programming models for Fog applications both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[operating system]] (OS) mechanisms including communication [[Communication protocol|protocol]]s of ''fog nodes''. These fog nodes will be further tested real time on robots and other [[automation]] devices. Furthermore, an [[open-source architecture]] will be built on open standards, e.g., 5G, OPC Unified Architecture (UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
