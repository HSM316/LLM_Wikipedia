'''Fog robotics''' can be defined as an architecture which consists of storage, networking functions, control with [[fog computing]] closer to [[robot]]s.<ref name=fogintro>[https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/120748 Fog Robotics: An Introduction.

==Concept==
Fog robotics mainly consists of a fog robot server and the cloud.<ref name=ecn>[https://www.ecnmag.com/news/2018/11/fog-robotics-new-approach-achieve-efficient-and-fluent-human-robot-interaction Fog Robotics: A New Approach to Achieve Efficient and Fluent Human-Robot Interaction.

Moreover, these servers are adaptable, consists of processing power for [[computation]], network capability, and secured by sharing the outcomes to other robots for advanced performance with the lowest possible [[Network latency|latency]].<ref name=gudi/> 

As [[cloud robotics]] is facing issues such as bandwidth limitations, [[Network latency|latency]] issues, [[quality of service]], [[privacy]] and [[security]] - Fog robotics can be seen as a viable option for the future robotic systems.<ref name=tc>[https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/watch-every-panel-from-tc-sessions-robotics/ Getting a Grip on Reality: Deep Learning and Robot Grasping Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, 2018]</ref> It is also considered as distributed robot systems of the next generation because robots require much brain power for processing billions of [[computation]]s while performing its task.<ref name=nature>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0008-x?WT.feed_name=subjects_mechanical-engineering Robots and the return to collaborative intelligence.

==Applications==

'''{{visible anchor|Social robots}}'''

A [[social robot]] can either connect to the cloud or fog robot server depending upon the availability of information. For instance, it can make a [[robot]] working at an airport to communicate with other robots for effective communication with the help of fog robotics.<ref name=ingrid>[https://techxplore.com/news/2018-11-fog-robotics-approach-efficient-fluent.html Fog robotics: A new approach to achieve efficient and fluent human-robot interaction.

'''Fog Robotics'''<br>
This project promotes the applicability of fog robotics with regards to [[human-robot interaction]] scenarios. It utilises fog robot servers, cloud, and the robots for evaluation of fog robotics architecture.<ref name=gudi>{{cite conference |last1=Gudi |first1=S. L.

To improve the [[security]] and performance of robotic/machine-learning applications operating in [[edge computing]] environments, this project investigates the use of data capsules. As one of the applications, it also examines the fog robot system to preserve the privacy and security of the data.

This project particularly targets the field of [[radio access network]] at the edge. As part of this project, a real-time application of fog-assisted robotics is explored. Also, remote monitoring of robots and fleet formation for coordinated movement is being investigated.<ref name=FAR>{{cite web|title=Fog Assisted Robotics|url=http://5g-coral.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5G-Coral-robot-EUCNC-Demo9785.pdf|website=|accessdate=29 January 2019}}</ref>

This project focusses on designing novel programming models for Fog applications both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[operating system]] (OS) mechanisms including communication [[Communication protocol|protocol]]s of ''fog nodes''. These fog nodes will be further tested real time on robots and other [[automation]] devices. Furthermore, an [[open-source architecture]] will be built on open standards, e.g., 5G, OPC Unified Architecture (UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).
