'''OpenL Tablets''' is a [[business rule management system]] (BRMS) and a [[business rules engine]] (BRE) based on table representation of rules. Engine implements optimized sequential algorithm. OpenL includes such table types as [[decision table]], [[decision tree]], [[spreadsheet]]-like calculator.

== History ==
The OpenL Tablets project was started as an in-house development project in 2003 and later in 2006 was uploaded to [[SourceForge]].<ref name="SFRegistration">[http://sourceforge.net/projects/openl-tablets/#more Project Details]</ref>
Initially it was an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[business rule]] engine for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Starting from version 5 it became a [[BRMS]].

== Technology ==
OpenL Tablets engine is specially designed for [[business rule]]s and uses table rules presentation. Table format enforces rules to be structured and format itself is close to tables found in various business documents.

OpenL Tablets is based on OpenL framework for creating custom languages running on Java VM. The engine is designed to allow pluggable language implementations. Currently, it uses 2 languages: table structure for rules format and java-like for code snippets in rules. Java-like language is [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 5.0 implementation with Business User Extensions.

OpenL Tablets rules are mixture of [[declarative programming]] for rules logic and [[imperative programming]] for workflow control. Table formats are flexible enough to match the semantics of the problem domain.

Tests, traces, benchmarks are integral part of the engine. It also provides powerful type definition capabilities to handle rules domain model inside rules files.

The project is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], but can be used at any platform using [[Service-oriented architecture]] approach, e.g. via [[web service]].

=== Patents ===

The OpenL Tablets engine has patent pending validation feature.<ref name="RulesAndConstraintPatent">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F6856980 Hybrid use of rule and constraint engines]</ref>

== BRMS ==

OpenL Tablets includes several productivity tools and applications addressing BRMS related capabilities. They include web application to edit rules called OpenL WebStudio, web application to deploy rules as web services, Rules Repository to store and manage rules, Eclipse plug-ins to work with rules projects.
