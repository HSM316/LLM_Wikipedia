== Background ==
Dominic Harris was born in London on 16 November 1976, and grew up in London, [[Brussels]], and Michigan before returning to London in 1995.  Harris attended the [[Cranbrook Kingswood|Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School]], and then trained as an architect at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]], and has been [[Architects Registration Board|ARB]] registered since 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311151320/http://www.priveekollektie.com/portfolio-item/dominic-harris/|title=Dominic Harris|work=www.priveekollektie.com|accessdate=2014-03-11}}</ref>

Harris designs and fabricates his artworks at Dominic Harris Studio, a multi-disciplinary practice he founded in 2007. This studio consists of 30 people with diverse backgrounds including architecture, product design, electronics, programming, graphic design, and workshop skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominicharris.com/biography/|title=Biography - Dominic Harris – Artist & Designer|website=dominicharris.com|accessdate=March 5, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828053629/http://dominicharris.com/biography/|archivedate=August 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Harris uses the resources of his studio for the ongoing development, prototyping and production of his artworks.
