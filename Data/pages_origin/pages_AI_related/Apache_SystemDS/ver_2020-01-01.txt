'''Apache SystemML''' is a flexible machine learning system that automatically scales to [[Apache Spark|Spark]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] clusters. SystemML's
distinguishing characteristics are:

# Algorithm customizability via R-like and Python-like languages.
# Multiple execution modes, including Standalone, [[Apache Spark|Spark]] Batch, [[Apache Spark|Spark]] MLContext, [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] Batch, and JMLC.
# Automatic optimization based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability.

==History==
SystemML was created in 2010 by researchers at the [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] led by IBM Fellow Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. It was observed that data scientists would write machine learning algorithms in languages such as [[R (programming language)|R]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] for small data. When it came time to scale to big data, a systems programmer would be needed to scale the algorithm in a language such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]. This process typically involved days or weeks per iteration, and errors would occur translating the algorithms to operate on big data. SystemML seeks to simplify this process. A primary goal of SystemML is to automatically scale an algorithm written in an R-like or Python-like language to operate on big data, generating the same answer without the error-prone, multi-iterative translation approach.

On June 15, 2015, at the Spark Summit in San Francisco, Beth Smith, General Manager of IBM Analytics, announced that IBM was open-sourcing SystemML as part of IBM's major commitment to [[Apache Spark]] and Spark-related projects. SystemML became publicly available on [[GitHub]] on August 27, 2015 and became an [[Apache Incubator]] project on November 2, 2015. On May 17, 2017, the Apache Software Foundation Board approved the graduation of Apache SystemML as an Apache Top Level Project.
