==History==
The history of the IIoT begins with the invention of the [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) by [[Dick Morley]] in 1968, which was used by [[General Motors]] in their automatic transmission manufacturing division.<ref name="Morley">{{cite web|title=The father of invention: Dick Morley looks back on the 40th anniversary of the PLC|url=http://www.automationmag.com/features/the-father-of-invention-dick-morley-looks-back-on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the-plc.html|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609030841/https://www.automationmag.com/features/the-father-of-invention-dick-morley-looks-back-on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the-plc.html|archive-date=9 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> These PLCs allowed for fine control of individual elements in the manufacturing chain. In 1975, [[Honeywell]] and [[Yokogawa]] introduced the world's first DCSs, the TDC 2000 and the CENTUM system, respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McMahon |first1=Terrence K. |title=Three decades of DCS technology |url=https://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2005/227/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=Control Global |date=18 April 2005 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Evolution of industrial control systems |url=https://pacetoday.com.au/evolution-of-industrial-control-systems/ |website=PACE |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=4 December 2013}}</ref> These DCSs were the next step in allowing flexible process control throughout a plant, with the added benefit of backup redundancies by distributing control across the entire system, eliminating a singular point of failure in a central control room.

With the introduction of [[Ethernet]] in 1980, people began to explore the concept of a network of smart devices as early as 1982, when a modified [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] machine at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] became the first internet-connected appliance,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coke/history_long.txt |title=The "Only" Coke Machine on the Internet |website=[[Carnegie Mellon University]] |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/executive-insights-and-innovation/internet-of-things-done-wrong-stifles-innovation/a/d-id/1279157 |title=Internet of Things Done Wrong Stifles Innovation |journal=[[InformationWeek]] |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> As early as in 1994, greater industrial applications were envisioned, as Reza Raji described the concept in [[IEEE Spectrum]] as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories".<ref>{{cite news |last=Raji |first=RS |title=Smart networks for control |newspaper=IEEE Spectrum |date=June 1994|doi=10.1109/6.284793 }}</ref>

The concept of the internet of things first became popular in 1999, through the Auto-ID Center at MIT and related market-analysis publications.<ref>Analyst Anish Gaddam interviewed by Sue Bushell in ''Computerworld'', on 24 July 2000 ("M-commerce key to ubiquitous internet")</ref> Radio-frequency identification ([[RFID]]) was seen by Kevin Ashton (one of the founders of the original Auto-ID Center) as a prerequisite for the internet of things at that point.<ref name="gartner.com">{{cite web |first=P. |last=Magrassi |author-link=Paolo Magrassi |title=Why a Universal RFID Infrastructure Would Be a Good Thing |work=Gartner research report G00106518 |date=2 May 2002 |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/356347/universal-rfid-infrastructure-good-thing}}</ref> If all objects and people in daily life were equipped with identifiers, computers could manage and inventory them.<ref name="gartner">{{cite web |first1=P. |last1=Magrassi |first2=T |last2=Berg |title=A World of Smart Objects |work=Gartner research report R-17-2243 |date=12 August 2002 |url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=366151}}</ref><ref name="EC, Action plan for Europe">{{cite web|title=Internet of Things — An action plan for Europe |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/rfid/documents/commiot2009.pdf |date=18 June 2009 |id=COM(2009) 278 final |author=Commission of the European Communities }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wood |first1=Alex |title=The internet of things is revolutionizing our lives, but standards are a must |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/31/the-internet-of-things-is-revolutionising-our-lives-but-standards-are-a-must |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 March 2015}}</ref> Besides using RFID, the tagging of things may be achieved through such technologies as [[near field communication]], [[barcodes]], [[QR codes]] and [[digital watermarking]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Techvibes |url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/from-m2m-to-the-internet-of-things-viewpoints-from-europe-2011-07-07 |title=From M2M to The Internet of Things: Viewpoints From Europe |date=7 July 2011 |access-date=11 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003031/http://www.techvibes.com/blog/from-m2m-to-the-internet-of-things-viewpoints-from-europe-2011-07-07 |archive-date=24 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Lara |last=Sristava |publisher=European Commission Internet of Things Conference in Budapest |date=16 May 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJdNq7uSddM |title=The Internet of Things – Back to the Future (Presentation) |via=YouTube}}</ref>

The current conception of the IIoT arose after the emergence of cloud technology in 2002, which allows for the storage of data to examine for historical trends, and the development of the [[OPC Unified Architecture]] protocol in 2006, which enabled secure, remote communications between devices, programs, and data sources without the need for human intervention or interfaces.

One of the first consequences of implementing the industrial internet of things (by equipping objects with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers) would be to create instant and ceaseless inventory control.<ref>{{cite web |first1=P. |last1=Magrassi |first2=A. |last2=Panarella |first3=N. |last3=Deighton |first4=G. |last4=Johnson |title=Computers to Acquire Control of the Physical World |work=Gartner research report T-14-0301 |date=28 September 2001 |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/341674/computers-acquire-control-physical-world}}</ref><ref name=casal>{{cite web |work=Casaleggio Associati |url=http://www.slideshare.net/casaleggioassociati/the-evolution-of-internet-of-things |title=The Evolution of Internet of Things |date=February 2011}}{{Request quote |date=August 2014}}</ref> Another benefit of implementing an IIoT system is the ability to create a [[digital twin]] of the system. Using this digital twin allows for further optimization of the system by allowing for experimentation with new data from the cloud without having to halt production or sacrifice safety, as the new processes can be refined virtually until they are ready to be implemented. A digital twin can also serve as a training ground for new employees who won't have to worry about real impacts on the live system.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bacidore |first1=Mike |title=The Connected Plant enables the digital twin |url=https://www.controlglobal.com/industrynews/2017/hug-7/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=Control Global |date=20 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref>

==Standards and Frameworks==
IoT frameworks help support the interaction between "things" and allow for more complex structures like [[distributed computing]] and the development of [[distributed applications]].

* [[IBM]] has announced cognitive IoT, which combines traditional IoT with machine intelligence and learning, contextual information, industry-specific models and natural language processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigabitmagazine.com/company/ibm-and-cognitive-computing-revolution|title=IBM and the cognitive computing revolution|website=www.gigabitmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>

==Application and Industries==
The term industrial internet of things is often encountered in the manufacturing industries, referring to the industrial subset of the IoT. Potential benefits of the industrial internet of things include improved productivity, analytics and the transformation of the workplace. <ref name="auto">{{cite web |last1=Daugherty |first1=Paul |last2=Negm |first2=Walid |last3=Banerjee |first3=Prith |last4=Alter |first4=Allan |title=Driving Unconventional Growth through the Industrial Internet of Things |url=https://www.accenture.com/mz-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen/reassembling-industry/pdf/Accenture-Driving-Unconventional-Growth-through-IIoT.pdf |website=Accenture |accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref> The potential of growth by implementing IIoT is predicted to generate $15 trillion of global GDP by 2030.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Zurier">{{cite web|last1=Zurier|first1=Steve|title=Five IIoT companies prove value of internet-connected manufacturing|url=http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/feature/Five-IIoT-companies-prove-value-of-internet-connected-manufacturing|website=IoT Agenda|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>

While connectivity and data acquisition are imperative for IIoT, they are not the end goals, but rather the foundation and path to something bigger. Of all the technologies, [[predictive maintenance]] is an "easier” application, as it is applicable to existing assets and management systems. Intelligent maintenance systems can reduce unexpected downtime and increase productivity, which is projected to save up to 12% over scheduled repairs, reduce overall maintenance costs up to 30%, and eliminate breakdowns up to 70%, according to some studies.<ref name="auto"/> <ref>{{cite web |work=Accenture |title=Industrial Internet Insights Report |url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen/reassembling-industry/pdf/Accenture-Industrial-Internet-Changing-Competitive-Landscape-Industries.pdf |accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref> [[Cyber-physical system]]s (CPS) are the core technology of industrial big data and they will be an interface between human and the cyber world.

Integration of [[Sensor|sensing]] and [[Actuator|actuation]] systems connected to the Internet can optimize energy consumption as a whole.<ref name="CoMAN">{{cite IETF |last1=Ersue |first1=M. |last2=Romascanu |first2=D. |last3=Schoenwaelder |first3=J. |last4=Sehgal |first4=A. |title=Management of Networks with Constrained Devices: Use Cases |rfc=7548 |date=May 2015}}</ref> It is expected that IoT devices will be integrated into all forms of energy consuming devices (switches, power outlets, bulbs, televisions, etc.) and be able to communicate with the utility supply company in order to effectively balance [[Electricity generation|power generation]] and energy usage.<ref name="EMAN">{{cite IETF |last1=Parello |first1=J. |last2=Claise |first2=B. |last3=Schoening |first3=B. |last4=Quittek |first4=J. |title=Energy Management Framework |rfc=7326 |date=September 2014 }}</ref> Besides home based energy management, the IIoT is especially relevant to the [[Smart Grid]] since it provides systems to gather and act on energy and power-related information in an automated fashion with the goal to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity.<ref name=EMAN /> Using [[advanced metering infrastructure]] (AMI) devices connected to the Internet backbone, electric utilities can not only collect data from end-user connections, but also manage other distribution automation devices like transformers and reclosers.<ref name=CoMAN />

As of 2016, other real-world applications include incorporating smart LEDs to direct shoppers to empty parking spaces or highlight shifting traffic patterns, using of sensors on water purifiers to alert managers via computer or smartphone when to replace parts, attaching RFID tags to safety gear to track personnel and ensure their safety, embedding computers into power tools to record and track the torque level of individual tightenings, and collecting data from multiple systems to enable the simulation of new processes.<ref name="Zurier" />

=== Automotive industry ===
Using IIoT in car manufacturing implies the digitalization of all elements of production. Software, machines and humans are interconnected, enabling suppliers and manufacturers to rapidly respond to changing standards.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://blog.flexis.com/the-impact-of-industry-4.0-on-the-automotive-industry|title=The Impact of Industry 4.0 on the Automotive Industry|last=Masters|first=Kristin|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-us}}</ref> IIoT enables efficient and cost-effective production by moving data from the customers to the company's systems, and then to individual sections of the production process. With IIoT, new tools and functionalities can be included in the manufacturing process. For example, 3D printers simplify the way of shaping pressing tools by printing the shape directly from steel granulate.<ref name=":6">{{Citation|last=Volkswagen Group|title=Industry 4.0 in the Volkswagen Group|date=2015-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTl8w6yAjds|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> These tools enable new possibilities for designing (with high precision). Customization of vehicles is also enabled by IIoT due to the modularity and connectivity of this technology.<ref name=":5" /> While in the past they worked separately, IIoT now enables humans and robots to cooperate.<ref name=":6" /> Robots take on the heavy and repetitive activities, so the manufacturing cycles are quicker and the vehicle comes to the market more rapidly. Factories can quickly identify potential maintenance issues before they lead to downtime and many of them are moving to a 24-hour production plant, due to higher security and efficiency.<ref name=":5" /> The majority of automotive manufacturers companies have production plants in different countries, where different components of the same vehicle are built. IIoT makes possible to connect these production plants to each other, creating the possibility to move within facilities. Big data can be visually monitored which enables companies to respond faster to fluctuations in production and demand.

=== Oil and gas industry ===
With IIoT support, large amounts of raw data can be stored and sent by the drilling gear and research stations for cloud storage and analysis.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Gilchrist|first=Alasdair|date=2016|title=Industry 4.0 - the industrial internet of things|doi=10.1007/978-1-4842-2047-4|journal=Apress Media|isbn=978-1-4842-2046-7}}</ref> With IIoT technologies, the oil and gas industry has the capability to connect machines, devices, sensors, and people through interconnectivity, which can help companies better address fluctuations in demand and pricing, address cybersecurity, and minimize environmental impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fm.sap.com/campaigns/CRM-US17-1LE-LSMACTLI/index.html#OG|title=SAP|website=fm.sap.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>

Across the supply chain, IIoT can improve the maintenance process, the overall safety, and connectivity.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bdo.com/insights/industries/natural-resources/how-industry-4-0-is-transforming-the-oil-gas-sup|title=How Industry 4.0 Is Transforming the Oil & Gas Supply Chain|website=www.bdo.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> Drones can be used to detect possible oil and gas leaks at an early stage and at locations that are difficult to reach (e.g. offshore). They can also be used to identify weak spots in complex networks of pipelines with built-in thermal imaging systems. Increased connectivity (data integration and communication) can help companies with adjusting the production levels based on real-time data of inventory, storage, distribution pace, and forecasted demand. For example, a Deloitte report states that by implementing an IIoT solution integrating data from multiple internal and external sources (such as work management system, control centre, pipeline attributes, risk scores, inline inspection findings, planned assessments, and leak history), thousands of miles of pipes can be monitored in real-time. This allows monitoring of pipeline threats, improving risk management, and providing situational awareness.<ref>{{cite web |title=2018 Tech Trends for the oil and gas industry |date=2018 |access-date=2018-10-08 |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-tech-trends-oil-and-gas-industry.pdf |author=Deloitte Insights}}</ref>

Benefits also apply to specific processes of the oil and gas industry.<ref name=":7" /> The exploration process of oil and gas can be done more precisely with 4D models built by seismic imaging. These models map fluctuations in oil reserves and gas levels, they strive to point out the exact quantity of resources needed, and they forecast the lifespan of wells. The application of smart sensors and automated drillers gives companies the opportunity to monitor and produce more efficiently. Further, the storing process can also be improved with the implementation of IIoT by collecting and analyzing real-time data to monitor inventory levels and temperature control. IIoT can enhance the transportation process of oil and gas by implementing smart sensors and thermal detectors to give real-time geolocation data and monitor the products for safety reasons. These smart sensors can monitor the refinery processes, and enhance safety. The demand for products can be forecasted more precisely and automatically be communicated to the refineries and production plants to adjust production levels.

=== Agriculture industry ===
In the agricultury industry, IIoT helps farmers to make decisions about when to harvest. Sensors collect data about soil and weather conditions and propose schedules for fertilizing and irrigating.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is IIoT? Definition and Details|url=https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/iiot|access-date=2020-10-06|website=www.paessler.com|language=en}}</ref> Some livestock farms implant microschips into animals. This allows the farmers not only to trace their animals, but also pull up information about the lineage, weight, or health.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Adrianne|date=2013-05-10|title=Internet of cows: technology could help track disease, but ranchers are resistant|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/10/4316658/internet-of-cows-technology-offers-ways-to-track-livestock-but|access-date=2020-10-06|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>

Additionally, IIoT-enabled devices can allow for more “traditional” forms of cybercrime, as in the case of the 2013 [[Target Corporation|Target]] data breach, where information was stolen after hackers gained access to Target's networks via credentials stolen from a third party HVAC vendor.<ref name="Target">{{cite web|title=Target Hackers Broke in Via HVAC Company — Krebs on Security|url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/|website=krebsonsecurity.com|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry has been slow to adopt IIoT advances because of security concerns such as these.<ref name="Mullin">{{cite news |last1=Mullin |first1=Rick |title=The drug plant of the future |url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i21/drug-plant-future.html?h=-1739916665 |volume=95 |issue=21 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Chemical & Engineering News |date=22 May 2017}}</ref> One of the difficulties in providing security solutions in IIoT applications is the fragmented nature of the hardware.<ref name="Fogarty">{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Kevin |title=Why IIoT Security Is So Difficult |url=https://semiengineering.com/why-iiot-security-is-so-difficult/ |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=Semiconductor Engineering |date=29 May 2018}}</ref> Consequently, security architectures are turning towards designs that are software-based or device-agnostic.<ref name="Dahad">{{cite news |last1=Dahad |first1=Nitin |title=Designer's Guide to IIoT Security |url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1333674 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=EETimes}}</ref>

Hardware-based approaches, like the use of [[data diodes]], are often used when connecting critical infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tactical Data Diodes in Industrial Automation and Control Systems|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/firewalls/tactical-data-diodes-industrial-automation-control-systems-36057}}</ref>
