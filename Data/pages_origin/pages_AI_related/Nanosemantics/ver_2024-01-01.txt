'''Nanosemantics Lab''' is a Russian [[IT company]] specializing in [[natural language processing]] (NLP), [[computer vision]] (CV), speech technologies ([[automatic speech recognition|ASR]]/[[text-to-speech|TTS]]) and creation of interactive dialog interfaces, particularly [[chat bots|chatbots]] and [[virtual assistant]]s, based on [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). The company uses [[neural network]] platforms, including its own-made platform ''PuzzleLib'' which works on Russian-made [[Elbrus (computer)|microprocessor architecture Elbrus]] and Russia-based [[Astra Linux]] operating system. The company was founded in 2005 by [[Igor Ashmanov]] and [[Natalya Kaspersky]].

== Profile ==
[[File:Igor Ashmanov.jpg|thumb|	伊戈尔·阿什马诺夫 (Igor Ashmanov)]]
The company was one of the first on Russian market to develop dialog interfaces for different branches of businesses, as well as to support community of AI developers. The company's most demanded product, as for beginning of the 2020s, is the automated "online advisers", functioning as [[chat bots]], made for helping customers with usage of commercial products. In 2009 the company released an [[online service]] called ''iii.ru'', where visitors were able to create their own AI-based virtual personalities entitles "infs" (for free). A visitor was able to train its own "inf" and let them chat to other "live" visitors as well with other "infs". More than 2.3 million of "infs" were created and trained by visitors over several years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osp.ru/cw/2009/21/9492442/|title=Internet-роботы наступают|website=Издательство «Открытые системы»|access-date=2022-06-28|archive-date=2010-12-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224163512/https://www.osp.ru/cw/2009/21/9492442/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/nanosemantika_zapustila_vebservis|title="Наносемантика" запустила веб-сервис по созданию виртуальных альтер-эго|website=CNews.ru|access-date=2022-06-28|archive-date=2021-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230221515/https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/nanosemantika_zapustila_vebservis|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nanosemantics Lab maintains its own linguistic [[programming language]] for AI development called ''Dialog Language'' (DL). Popular [[social networks]] and [[instant messaging]] services may be used as base platforms.

Nanosemantics' AI bots support different types of businesses: banks and [[financial services]], [[telecommunications]], retail, travel and automobile industry, [[home appliances]] production, etc. Among its solutions, Nanosemantics lists projects for various companies and institutions, among them [[VTB]], [[Beeline (brand)|Beeline]], [[MTS (network provider)|MTS]], [[Sberbank]], [[Higher School of Economics]], [[Webmoney]], [[Gazpromneft]], [[Rostelecom]], [[Ford Motors]], [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation]] and others.<ref>Nanosemantics Lab English corporate website: [https://nanosemantics.ai/en/our-projects/ Project list] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922222244/https://nanosemantics.ai/en/our-projects/ |date=2019-09-22 }}; [https://nanosemantics.ai/en/blog-eng/ Blog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922222245/https://nanosemantics.ai/en/blog-eng/ |date=2019-09-22 }}</ref>

The company uses the term "inf" for naming its numerous types of chat bots. The term was coined by co-founder [[Igor Ashmanov]], head of [[Ashmanov & Partners]]. A 2014 scholarly research at Higher School of Economics, called "Basics of Business Informatics",<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [https://www.hse.ru/data/2014/11/23/1099682770/Зараменских_БИ.pdf Зараменских Е. П. «Основы бизнес-информатики»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401195058/https://www.hse.ru/data/2014/11/23/1099682770/%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%91%D0%98.pdf |date=2022-04-01 }}, ВШЭ, 2014, {{ISBN|978-5-00068-152-7}}</ref> states that such "infs", when used at business, may lower load on employees, collect statistics useful for understanding market demand and also may increase customer loyalty by providing fast and informative answers due to usage of large databases. The same research describes Nanosemantics' project for Russian branch of Ford Motors company, when AI capabilities were used for promoting the car model [[Ford Kuga]]. The research pointed out that within 2 months since beginning, the promo-website conducted 47774 talks of visitors with the specialized "inf", which indicated several hundred thousand of questions and the longest chat lasted for 3 hours 10 minutes. One-year promo campaign showed that 28.6% of people who made pre-orders talked to an "inf".

In 2016 Nanosemantics launched a [[SaaS]] platform aimed at creating customized virtual assistants by users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-06-24_nanosemantika_zapustila_servis_po_sozdaniyu|title="Наносемантика" запустила сервис по созданию "умных" чат-ботов для e-commerce|website=CNews.ru|access-date=2022-06-28|archive-date=2021-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230221518/https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-06-24_nanosemantika_zapustila_servis_po_sozdaniyu|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-06-23_rezident_skolkovo_vypustil_instrument_samostoyatelnogo | title=В "Сколково" разработали конструктор для создания интеллектуальных чат-ботов | access-date=2022-06-28 | archive-date=2021-12-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230221516/https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-06-23_rezident_skolkovo_vypustil_instrument_samostoyatelnogo | url-status=live }}</ref>

The company's flagship product is considered to be ''Dialog Operating System'' (DialogOS), a professional corporate platform for creating intellectual voice and textual bots. It has its own linguistic [[programming language]] for creation of flexible scenarios and ready-studied neural [[natural language processing]] modules that are able to understand human interlocutors.

In 2021 the company presented technology called ''NLab Speech ASR'' which contains a set of neural-networking algorithms for processing audio signals and analysis of texts that were trained and calibrated using speech-based [[big data]] marked up manually. The technology allows speed of processing of data up to "6 real-time factor" and precision values in noisy audio data may exceed 82%.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2021-03-15_nanosemantika_prezentovala|title="Наносемантика" презентовала голосовую технологию NLab Speech|website=CNews.ru|access-date=2022-06-28|archive-date=2021-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230212950/https://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2021-03-15_nanosemantika_prezentovala|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2022 the technology was included<ref>{{cite web | url=https://reestr.digital.gov.ru/request/443587/?sphrase_id=1626067 | title=Заявление о включении сведений о программном обеспечении в реестр российского программного обеспечения }}</ref> in Russia's ''Joint Registry for Russian Programs for Computers and Databases''.
