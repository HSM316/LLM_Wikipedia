'''Naive semantics''' is an approach used in [[computer science]] for [[knowledge representation|representing basic knowledge]] about a specific domain, and has been used in applications such as the representation of the meaning of natural language sentences in [[artificial intelligence]] applications. In a general setting the term has been used to refer to the use of a limited store of generally understood knowledge about a specific domain in the world, and has been applied to fields such as the knowledge based design of data schemas.<ref>Naive Semantics to Support Automated Database Design]'', IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Volume 14, issue 1  (January 2002) by V.

In [[natural language understanding]], naive semantics involves the use of a [[lexicon|lexical theory]] which maps each word sense to a simple theory (or set of assertions) about the objects or events of reference. In this sense, naive semantic theory is based upon a particular language, its syntax and its word senses. For instance the word "water" and the assertion water(X) may be associated with the three [[predicate logic|predicates]] clear(X), liquid(X) and tasteless(X).
