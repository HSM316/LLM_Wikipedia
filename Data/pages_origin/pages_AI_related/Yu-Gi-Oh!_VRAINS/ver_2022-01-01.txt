The term 'VRAINS' derives from 'Virtual Reality' (VR), 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI), 'Network System' (NS). The series revolves around the exploits of the protagonist Yusaku within the virtual world named VRAINS. It also introduces the game mechanic of "Link Summon", but like its predecessor ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V]]'', attempts to provide shared spotlight with other game-relevant types of summoning mechanics as well.

==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS characters}}
In a place known as Den City, thousands of duelists take part in a [[virtual reality]] space known as LINK VRAINS, created by SOL Technologies, where users can create unique avatars and participate in games of [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Duel Monsters]] with each other. As a mysterious hacker organization known as the Knights of Hanoi, led by Varis, threatens this world, a high-school student and hacking genius named Yusaku Fujiki battles against them under the guise of Playmaker.<ref>{{Cite web |first= Crystalyn|last=Hodgkins|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-16/new-yu-gi-oh-tv-anime-reveals-title-plot-details/.112302|title=New Yu-Gi-Oh! TV Anime Reveals Title, Plot Details|date=February 16, 2017|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref> Both the Knights and SOL Technologies are also after a peculiar self-aware [[artificial intelligence]] program, who holds the key to a secret area inside the network named the Cyberse World, which the Knights of Hanoi seek to destroy. As the series begins, Yusaku sees the chance to capture this AI, which he names Ai, who sets off a digital maelstrom in LINK VRAINS known as the Data Storm.<ref>{{Cite web |first= Rafael Antonio|last=Pineda |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-19/yu-gi-oh-vrains-tv-anime-visual-designs-revealed/.112441|title=Yu-Gi-Oh!

Three months after Hanoi's fall, Ai discovers the Cyberse World destroyed and his friends nowhere to be found, prompting him to return to Yusaku. Meanwhile, Yusaku once again fights as Playmaker after the consciousness of the younger brother of his friend, Cal Kolter, is stolen by a mysterious enemy named Bohman. In pursuit of Bohman, Yusaku and Ai are joined by Theodore Hamilton, a victim of the Lost Incident like Yusaku who uses the alias of Soulburner online and Ai's Fire Ignis friend based on Theodore, Flame. Aqua, the Water Ignis, follows soon after by becoming Skye's partner. At the same time, Varis revives Knights of Hanoi to fight against the new enemies. It's revealed that Bohman is a sentient AI created by the Light Ignis, Lightning, who reveals that he's the one who destroyed the Cyberse World and steals Cal's brother's consciousness. Deeming Ignis superior, he decides to destroy humanity. The Wind Ignis, Windy, also assists Lightning after his program was forcefully rewritten. To defeat Lightning's team, Yusaku and his friends join forces with Hanoi and enters Lightning's stronghold. Both sides fights until only Playmaker, Ai, and Bohman are left with the latter having absorbed all other Ignis. Before perishing, Flame and Aqua gives Ai the last of their powers, allowing him and Playmaker to defeat Bohman.

After the fight against Bohman, LINK VRAINS is shut down and Ai disappear together with Yusaku's robot, Roboppi. Replacing LINK VRAINS, SOL Technology develops a humanoid robot SOLtis, which Ai and Roboppi uses to infiltrate SOL Technology and attack its high executive, Queen. Knowing he'll be the next target, Skye's older brother, Akira, enlists the help of Playmaker and his friends as well as Hanoi once more to protect him. Ai and Roboppi manage to defeat everyone except Playmaker, Soulburner, and Varis, who are forced to fight decoys. After defeating Akira and taking over SOL Technology, Ai reopens LINK VRAINS and delivers a message for Playmaker that tells the whereabout of his location. Yusaku confronts Ai alone, leading the two of them to duel. Ai explains that Lightning left behind a simulation that shows the world will be destroyed if Ai is the only Ignis left. Fearing that he'll become like Lightning and Bohman, Ai decides to end his life by either by Playmaker's hand if he lose or by scattering his data into the SOLtis if he win. Despite Playmaker's attempt to dissuade Ai, he still refuses to back down, forcing Playmaker to defeat him. In his last moment, Ai reveals that within the simulations, Yusaku always ends up dying protecting him, which is a future that he wishes to avoid. Months after the final battle, everyone moves on with their lives and Yusaku goes on a journey. Somewhere within the network, Ai is revealed to be alive.

==Trading Card Game==
{{see also|Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}}
''Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS'' introduces new gameplay elements to the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game''. With the release of the "Link Strike Starter Deck", it introduced the New Master Rules (also known as Master Rule 4 in some countries) to the competitive field of play. Now, only one monster can be summoned directly from each player's Extra Deck at a time, which is placed in one of the two new zones in the middle of the field called the "Extra Monster Zone". Complementing this new gameplay element are the new Link Monsters, honey-comb blue colored monsters that go into your Extra Deck. They do not have "Levels" or "Ranks", but instead have a "Link Rating", which indicates the number of arrows on the card and the required number of monsters required to summon them. A Link Monster's Link Rating can also be used as a number of materials for a Link Summon depending on their rating, subtracted from the Link Monster the player wishes to summon. Link Monsters have a number of Link Arrows equal to their Link Rating that point either vertically, horizontally, and/or diagonally. These Link Arrows that point to an empty Main Monster Zone allow the player to summon monsters from the Extra Deck. The two Pendulum Zones have been moved to the far ends of the Spell & Trap Zones.

In 2019, a new format exclusive to the TCG was introduced separate from the main game, known as Speed Duels. The rules are similar to the main game and parallel the formatting used in the mobile game Duel Links. A format meant as a beginner's introduction to the basics, both the field and each player's decks have been drastically simplified to reflect that. Decks contain only 20-30 cards, each player gets only three Main Monster zones, and a turn will immediately end following the Battle Phase. Exclusive to Speed Duels, each player is allowed one Skill Card, which a player places face down during the beginning of a duel and can use anytime.

==Reception==
The series ranked 52 in Tokyo Anime Award Festival in Best 100 TV Anime 2017 category.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://best100.animefestival.jp/finish.html|title= みんなが選ぶベスト100{{sic|nolink=y|Animes}} of 2017}}</ref>
