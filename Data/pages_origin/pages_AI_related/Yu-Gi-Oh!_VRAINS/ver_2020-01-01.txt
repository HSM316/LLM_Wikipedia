==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS characters}}
In a place known as Den City, thousands of duelists take part in a [[virtual reality]] space known as LINK VRAINS, created by SOL Technologies, where users can create unique avatars and participate in games of [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Duel Monsters]] with each other. As a mysterious hacker organization known as the Knights of Hanoi threatens this world, a high-school student and hacking genius named Yusaku Fujiki battles against them under the guise of Playmaker. Both the Knights and SOL Technologies are also after a peculiar self-aware [[artificial intelligence]] program, who holds the key to a secret area inside the network named the Cyberse World, which the Knights of Hanoi seek to destroy. As the series begins, Yusaku sees the chance to capture this AI, which he names Ai, who sets off a digital maelstrom in LINK VRAINS known as the Data Storm. As the appearance of this storm gives birth to Speed Duels, in which duelists surf the wind as they duel, Yusaku battles against Hanoi in order to uncover the truth concerning an incident that happened to him many years ago.<ref name="「遊☆戯☆王ＶＲＡＩＮＳ」">{{Cite web |url=http://ascii.jp/elem/000/001/464/1464051/index-5.html|title=「遊☆戯☆王ＶＲＡＩＮＳ」|date=April 6, 2017 |publisher=ASCII.jp|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref>

==Trading Card Game==
{{see also|Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}}
''Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS'' introduces new gameplay elements to the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game''. As of the Link Strike Starter Deck, a new format was introduced to the competitive field of play. Now, only one monster can be summoned directly from each player's Extra Deck at a time, which will be placed in one of the two new zones in the middle of the field called the "Extra Monster Zone". Complementing the new gameplay element are the new Link Monsters, honey-comb blue colored monsters that go into your Extra Deck. They do not have "Levels" or "Ranks", but instead have a "Link Rating", which indicates the number of arrows on the card and the required number of monsters required for tribute to summon them. A Link Monster's Link Rating can also be used as a number of tributes for a Link Summon depending on their rating, subtracted from the Link Monster the player wishes to summon. Link Monsters have a number of Link Arrows equal to their Link Rating that point either vertically, horizontally, and/or diagonally. These Link Arrows that point to an empty Main Monster Zone allow the player to summon another monster from the Extra Deck. The two Pendulum Zones have been moved to the far ends of the Spell & Trap Zones.
