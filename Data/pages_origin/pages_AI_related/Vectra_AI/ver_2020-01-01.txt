'''Vectra AI, Inc.''' applies [[artificial intelligence]] that detects and responds to hidden cyberattackers inside cloud, data center and enterprise networks. 

The company’s Cognito platform is designed to detect cyberattacker behaviors in these infrastructures and allow security analysts to conduct incident investigations and hunt for hidden threats using security-enriched metadata. 

To augment the Cognito platform, Vectra threat researchers identify and investigate cyberattacks, vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors that are unknown to the world. With data sets from this research, data scientists develop the machine learning algorithms and behavioral analysis that drive the Cognito platform.

Investors in Vectra include [[Khosla Ventures]], TCV, [[Accel Partners]], IA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures, Wipro Ventures, Atlantic Bridge, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics, and Silver Lake.

The Cognito platform from Vectra provides continuous, automated threat surveillance to expose hidden and unknown cyberattackers that actively spread inside networks.

Cognito analyzes network traffic<ref>{{cite web|title=The road rises up to meet Vectra Networks with $36 million in funding|url=https://vectra.ai/assets/451_reprint_vectra_22feb2018.pdf|website=451 Research|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> in private data centers, public clouds and enterprise environments to detect hidden cyberattacker behaviors. The Cognito platform identifies and prioritizes all threat detections based on severity and certainty scores, which empowers IT security teams to prevent data loss by quickly mitigating the most serious attacks first.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vectra Networks|url=https://www.sdxcentral.com/listings/vectra-networks/|publisher=SDX Central|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>

Threat behaviors and cyberattack techniques detected by Cognito include [[botnet]] command-and-control communications, [[botnet]] monetization, internal reconnaissance, lateral movement, and [[data theft]], or exfiltration.

Vectra offers three applications on the Cognito platform to address use cases:
* Cognito Stream delivers enterprise-scale network metadata enriched with security insights in Zeek format to data lakes and security information and event management (SIEM) applications without the complexity, constant tuning and scale limitation of open-source Zeek. <ref>{{cite web|title=Vectra Recall overview|url=https://assets.website-files.com/5bc662b786ecfc12c8d29e0b/5cae82a490434c84422d5317_BR-Cognito-Stream-Overview-041019.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2019|publisher=Vectra}}</ref>

* Cognito Recall gives security analysts a logical starting point to perform AI-assisted threat hunting and conclusive incident investigations. <ref>{{cite web|title=Vectra Recall overview|url=https://assets.website-files.com/5bc662b786ecfc12c8d29e0b/5ca7a779c6d18ff3ccf94d55_BR-Cognito-Recall-Overview-040519.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2019|publisher=Vectra}}</ref>

* Cognito Detect automates the real-time detection of hidden attackers in cloud and data center workloads and user and internet-of-things devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vectra Detect overview|url=https://assets.website-files.com/5bc662b786ecfc12c8d29e0b/5ca7a811c6d18f56cdf96582_HO-Cognito-Platform-Overview-040519.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2019|publisher=Vectra}}</ref>

Using AI for incident detection and triage in its security operations center has helped one Vectra customer – Texas A&M University System – resolve an incident in 10 to 20 minutes, rather than hours or days.<ref>{{cite news|title=AI is changing SecOps: What security analysts need to know|url=https://techbeacon.com/ai-changing-secops-what-security-analysts-need-know|accessdate=16 April 2018|publisher=TechBeacon}}</ref>

== Technology ==

Vectra AI combines data science, machine learning and network behavioral analysis technologies<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maiwald|first1=Eric|title=Network Behavior Analysis: Moving Beyond Signatures|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/1405498/network-behavior-analysis-moving-signatures|website=Gartner|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> to identify patterns that characterize malicious behavior within a network.

Cognito uses [[artificial intelligence]], including [[supervised learning]], [[unsupervised machine learning]], and [[Deep learning|deep learning]] techniques, to detect and respond to advanced cyberattacks. Remediation actions are taken with [[security information and event management]] (SIEMs), [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[endpoint security]] enforcement, [[network access control]], and orchestration, which are integrated with Cognito via an [[application programming interface]].
