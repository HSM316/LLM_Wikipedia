'''OntoCAPE''' is a large-scale [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] for the [[domain knowledge|domain]] of [[Computer-Aided Process Engineering]] (CAPE). It can be downloaded free of charge via the [https://www.avt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/AVT/Wirtschaft/SoftwareSimulation/~ipts/OntoCape/?lidx=1 OntoCAPE Homepage].

OntoCAPE is partitioned into 62 sub-ontologies, which can be used individually or as an integrated suite. The sub-ontologies are organized across different [[abstraction layer]]s, which separate general knowledge from knowledge about particular domains and applications.

* The upper layers have the character of an [[upper ontology]], covering general topics such  as mereotopology, systems theory, quantities and units.
* The lower layers conceptualize the domain of chemical process engineering, covering domain-specific topics such as materials, chemical reactions, or unit operations.
