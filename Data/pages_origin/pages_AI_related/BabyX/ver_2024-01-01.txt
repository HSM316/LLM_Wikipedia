'''BabyX''' is an interactive lifelike virtual infant created through the use of [[artificial intelligence]] by Mark Sagar, Creator and Director of the Laboratory for Animate Technologies located at the University of Auckland's Bioengineering Institute.

Created in 2013, BabyXÂ is a virtual animated baby that learns and reacts like a human baby and was designed after the likeness of Sagar's own daughter when she was 18 months old.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |author-link=Ashlee Vance|date=2017-09-07 |title=Mark Sagar Made a Baby in His Lab.

BabyX is a project of [[Auckland]]'s Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/animate-technologies.html|title=Laboratory for Animate Technologies|publisher=Abi.auckland.ac.nz|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> to make a virtual animated baby that learns and reacts like a human baby. It uses the computer's cameras for "[[Visual perception|seeing]]" and microphones to "[[Listening behaviour types|listen]]" as the inputs. The computer uses [[artificial intelligence]] algorithms for BabyX's "learning" and interpretation of the inputs (voice and image) to understand the situation. The result is a virtual toddler that can learn to read, [[Pattern recognition|recognize objects]] and "understand." The output is the baby's face that can "speak" and express its mood by facial expressions (such as smiling).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lant |first=Karla |date=2017-09-10 |title=An artificially intelligent baby could unlock the secrets of human nature |url=https://futurism.com/an-artificially-intelligent-baby-could-unlock-the-secrets-of-human-nature |access-date=2022-09-08 |website=Futurism}}</ref>

Previously, Sagar worked in computer-generated imagery ([[Computer animation|CGI]]) working on movies such as [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]], [[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]], and others. In 2016, Sagar built upon BabyX's technology to launch [https://www.soulmachines.com/ Soul Machines], human-like avatars that use artificial intelligence to respond to human emotion.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rotherham |first=Fiona |date=2016-11-22 |title=Baby X tech spin-out gains $7.5m funding |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/mark-sagars-baby-x-technology-spin-out-gains-us75-million-in-venture-capital-funding/6IN6X3QXNVIQ2P3IYT5TC4GAME/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=NZ Herald |language=en-NZ}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Khari |date=2017-05-26 |title=Why Soul Machines made an AI baby |url=https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-soul-machines-made-an-ai-baby/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=VentureBeat |language=en-US}}</ref>
