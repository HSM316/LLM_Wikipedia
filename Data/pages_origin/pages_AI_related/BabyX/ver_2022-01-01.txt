'''BabyX''' is a project of [[Auckland]]'s Bioengineering Institute Laboratory for Animate Technologies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/animate-technologies.html|title=Laboratory for Animate Technologies|publisher=Abi.auckland.ac.nz|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> to make a virtual animated baby that learns and reacts like a human baby. It uses the computer's cameras for "[[Visual perception|seeing]]" and microphones to "[[Listening behaviour types|listen]]" as the inputs. The computer uses [[Artificial intelligence]] algorithms for BabyX's "learning" and interpretation of the inputs (voice and image) to understand the situation. The result is a virtual toddler that can learn to read, [[Pattern recognition|recognize objects]] and "understand." The output is the baby's face that can "speak" and express its mood by facial expressions (such as smiling).{{cn|date=May 2020}}
