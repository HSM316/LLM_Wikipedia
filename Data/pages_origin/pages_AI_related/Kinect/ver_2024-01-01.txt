'''Kinect''' is a line of [[motion sensing]] [[input device]]s produced by [[Microsoft]] and first released in 2010. The devices generally contain [[RGB color model|RGB]] cameras, and [[Thermographic camera|infrared]] projectors and detectors that map depth through either [[structured light]] or [[time of flight]] calculations, which can in turn be used to perform real-time [[gesture recognition]] and body skeletal detection, among other capabilities. They also contain microphones that can be used for [[speech recognition]] and [[voice control]].

Kinect was originally developed as a [[motion controller]] peripheral for [[Xbox]] [[Video game console|video game consoles]], distinguished from competitors (such as Nintendo's [[Wii remote|Wii Remote]] and Sony's [[PlayStation Move]]) by not requiring physical controllers. The first-generation Kinect was based on technology from Israeli company [[PrimeSense]], and unveiled at [[E3]] 2009 as a peripheral for [[Xbox 360]] codenamed "'''Project Natal'''". It was first released on November 4, 2010, and would go on to sell eight million units in its first 60 days of availability. The majority of the games developed for Kinect were [[Casual game|casual]], family-oriented titles, which helped to attract new audiences to Xbox 360, but did not result in wide adoption by the console's existing, overall userbase.

As part of the 2013 unveiling of Xbox 360's successor, [[Xbox One]], Microsoft unveiled a second-generation version of Kinect with improved tracking capabilities. Microsoft also announced that Kinect would be a required component of the console, and that it would not function unless the peripheral is connected. The requirement proved controversial among users and critics due to privacy concerns, prompting Microsoft to backtrack on the decision. However, Microsoft still bundled the new Kinect with Xbox One consoles upon their launch in November 2013. A market for Kinect-based games still did not emerge after the Xbox One's launch; Microsoft would later offer Xbox One hardware bundles without Kinect included, and later revisions of the console removed the dedicated ports used to connect it (requiring a powered USB adapter instead). Microsoft ended production of Kinect for Xbox One in October 2017.

Kinect has also been used as part of non-game applications in academic and commercial environments, as it was cheaper and more robust compared to other depth-sensing technologies at the time. While Microsoft initially objected to such applications, it later released [[Software development kit|software development kits]] (SDKs) for the development of [[Microsoft Windows]] applications that use Kinect. In 2020, Microsoft released [[Azure Kinect]] as a continuation of the technology integrated with the [[Microsoft Azure]] cloud computing platform. Part of the Kinect technology was also used within Microsoft's [[HoloLens]] project. Microsoft discontinued the Azure Kinect developer kits in October 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Microsoft’s Azure Kinect Developer Kit Technology Transfers to Partner Ecosystem |url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/microsoft-s-azure-kinect-developer-kit-technology-transfers-to/ba-p/3899122 |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Jay |date=2023-08-21 |title=Microsoft kills Kinect again |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/21/23840327/microsoft-azure-kinect-developer-kit-discontinued |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=The Verge |language=en}}</ref>

===Development===
The origins of the Kinect started around 2005, at a point where technology vendors were starting to develop [[Range imaging|depth-sensing cameras]]. Microsoft had been interested in a 3D camera for the Xbox line earlier but because the technology had not been refined, had placed it in the "Boneyard", a collection of possible technology they could not immediately work on.<ref name="poly rise fall">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/14/21064608/microsoft-kinect-history-rise-and-fall | title = All the money in the world couldn't make Kinect happen | first = Blake | last = Hester | date = January 14, 2020 | access-date = January 16, 2020 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-date = January 15, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200115234540/https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/14/21064608/microsoft-kinect-history-rise-and-fall | url-status = live }}</ref>

In 2005, [[PrimeSense]] was founded by tech-savvy mathematicians and engineers from Israel to develop the "next big thing" for video games, incorporating cameras that were capable of mapping a human body in front of them and sensing hand motions. They showed off their system at the 2006 [[Game Developers Conference]], where Microsoft's [[Alex Kipman]], the general manager of hardware incubation, saw the potential in PrimeSense's technology for the Xbox system. Microsoft began discussions with PrimeSense about what would need to be done to make their product more consumer-friendly: not only improvements in the capabilities of depth-sensing cameras, but a reduction in size and cost, and a means to manufacturer the units at scale was required. PrimeSense spent the next few years working at these improvements.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

[[Nintendo]] released the [[Wii]] in November 2006. The Wii's central feature was the [[Wii Remote]], a handheld device that was detected by the Wii through a motion sensor bar mounted onto a television screen to enable [[motion control|motion controlled games]]. Microsoft felt pressure from the Wii, and began looking into depth-sensing in more detail with PrimeSense's hardware, but could not get to the level of motion tracking they desired. While they could determine hand gestures, and sense the general shape of a body, they could not do skeletal tracking. A separate path within Microsoft looked to create an equivalent of the Wii Remote, considering that this type of unit may become standardized similar to how two-thumbstick controllers became a standard feature.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> However, it was still ultimately Microsoft's goal to remove any device between the player and the Xbox.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

Kudo Tsunoda and Darren Bennett joined Microsoft in 2008, and began working with Kipman on a new approach to depth-sensing aided by [[machine learning]] to improve skeletal tracking. They internally demonstrated this and established where they believed the technology could be in a few years, which led to the strong interest to fund further development of the technology; this has also occurred at a time that Microsoft executives wanted to abandon the Wii-like motion tracking approach, and favored the depth-sensing solution to present a product that went beyond the Wii's capabilities. The project was greenlit by late 2008 with work started in 2009.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

The project was codenamed "'''Project Natal'''" after the Brazilian city [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], Kipman's birthplace. Additionally, Kipman recognized the [[Latin]] origins of the word "natal" to mean "to be born", reflecting the new types of audiences they hoped to draw with the technology.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/why-xbox-360-new-controller-is-called-natal-5274544 | title = Why Xbox 360 New Controller Is Called 'Natal' | first = Stephan | last = Tolito | date = June 1, 2009 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-date = August 2, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200802235728/https://kotaku.com/why-xbox-360-new-controller-is-called-natal-5274544 | url-status = live }}</ref> Much of the initial work was related to [[ethnographic]] research to see how video game players' home environments were laid out, lit, and how those with Wiis used the system to plan how Kinect units would be used. The Microsoft team discovered from this research that the up-and-down angle of the depth-sensing camera would either need to be adjusted manually, or would require an expensive motor to move automatically. Upper management at Microsoft opted to include the motor despite the increased cost to avoid breaking game immersion. Kinect project work also involved packaging the system for mass production and optimizing its performance. Hardware development took around 22 months.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

During hardware development, Microsoft engaged with software developers to use Kinect. Microsoft wanted to make games that would be playable by families since Kinect could sense multiple bodies in front of it. One of the first internal titles developed for the device was the pack-in game ''[[Kinect Adventures]]'' developed by Good Science Studio that was part of [[Microsoft Studios]]. One of the game modes of ''Kinect Adventures'' was "Reflex Ridge", based on the Japanese [[Brain Wall]] game where players attempt to contort their bodies in a short time to match cutouts of a wall moving at them. This type of game was a key example of the type of interactivity they wanted with Kinect, and its development helped feed into the hardware improvements.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

Nearing the planned release, there was a problem of widespread testing of Kinect in various room types and different bodies accounting for age, gender, and race among other factors, while keeping the details of the unit confidential. Microsoft engaged in a company-wide program offering employees to take home Kinect units to test them. Microsoft also brought other non-gaming divisions, including its [[Microsoft Research]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] teams to help complete the system. Microsoft established its own large-scale manufacturing facility to bulk product Kinect units and test them.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

===Kinect for Xbox One and decline===
The Kinect release for the Xbox 360 was estimated to have sold eight million units in the first sixty days of release, earning the hardware the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the "Fastest-Selling Consumer Electronics Device".<ref name="poly rise fall"/> Over 10 million had been sold by March 2011.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> While seemingly successful, its launch titles were primarily family-oriented games (which could be designed around Kinect's functionality and limitations), which may have drawn new audiences, but did not have the selling power of major franchises like ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty]]''—which were primarily designed around the [[Xbox 360 controller]]. Only an estimated 20% of the 55 million Xbox 360 owners had purchased the Kinect.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> The Kinect team recognized some of the downsides with more traditional games and Kinect, and continued ongoing development of the unit to be released as a second-generation unit, such as reducing the latency of motion detection and improving speech recognition. Microsoft provided news of these changes to the third-party developers to help them anticipate how the improvements can be integrated into the games.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

Concurrent with the Kinect improvements, Microsoft's Xbox hardware team had started planning for the [[Xbox One]] around mid-2011. Part of early Xbox One specifications was that the new Kinect hardware would be automatically included with the console, so that developers would know that Kinect hardware would be available for any Xbox One, and hoping to encourage developers to take advantage of that.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> The Xbox One was first formally announced on May 23, 2013, and shown in more detail at [[E3 2013]] in June. Microsoft stated at these events that the Xbox One would include the updated Kinect hardware and it would be required to be plugged in at all times for the Xbox One to function. This raised concerns across the video game media: privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data could be used for [[targeted advertising]], and to perform unauthorized [[surveillance]] on users. In response to these claims, Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users, that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its [[privacy policy]], and that the console would not redistribute user-generated content without permission.<ref name=polygon-xbox1privacy>{{cite web|title=Privacy concerns threaten to overshadow Microsoft's new console|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/5/4398440/privacy-microsoft-xbox-one|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=June 5, 2013|access-date=June 10, 2013|archive-date=October 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006000213/https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/5/4398440/privacy-microsoft-xbox-one|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="verge-kinectads">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/27/4370676/microsoft-kinect-tv-monitoring-achievements-ads|title=Microsoft may award achievements for watching TV and ads by monitoring you with Kinect|first=T.C.|last=Sottek|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge]]|date=May 27, 2013|access-date=June 10, 2013|archive-date=June 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607084939/http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/27/4370676/microsoft-kinect-tv-monitoring-achievements-ads|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="polygon-privacyresponse">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/6/4403926/kinect-on-xbox-one-will-not-record-or-upload-your-conversations|title=Kinect on Xbox One will not record or upload your conversations, Microsoft says|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 6, 2013|access-date=June 10, 2013|archive-date=June 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609055453/http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/6/4403926/kinect-on-xbox-one-will-not-record-or-upload-your-conversations|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=XboxOneReceptionInternetMay2013Pcmag>{{cite news |title=Hello Xbox One, Goodbye Freedom |first=Will |last=Greenwald |work=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2419320,00.asp |date=May 22, 2013 |access-date=May 23, 2013 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522154107/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2419320,00.asp |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="kotaku.com">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-wont-actually-need-kinect-plugged-in-microso-1113142909|title=Kinect No Longer Mandatory For Xbox One (But Will Still Come With It) [UPDATE]|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|date=August 12, 2013|access-date=August 23, 2013|archive-date=September 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906231830/http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-wont-actually-need-kinect-plugged-in-microso-1113142909|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ext-onekinect">{{cite news|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/163796-xbox-one-no-longer-requires-kinect-but-itll-still-come-in-the-box-and-youll-still-pay-500|title=Xbox One no longer requires Kinect, but it'll still come in the box, and you'll still pay $500|first=Sebastian|last=Anthony|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|work=[[ExtremeTech]]|date=August 13, 2013|access-date=September 5, 2013|archive-date=September 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910080625/http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/163796-xbox-one-no-longer-requires-kinect-but-itll-still-come-in-the-box-and-youll-still-pay-500|url-status=live}}</ref> Several other issues with the Xbox One's original feature set had also come up, such as the requirement to be always connected to the Internet, and created a wave of consumer backlash against Microsoft.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

Microsoft announced in August 2013 that they had made several changes to the planned Xbox One release in response to the backlash. Among these was that the system would no longer require a Kinect unit to be plugged in to work, though it was still planned to package the Kinect with all Xbox One systems. However, this also required Microsoft to establish a {{USD|500}} price-point for the Xbox One/Kinect system at its November 2013 launch, {{USD|100}} more than the competing [[PlayStation 4]] launched in the same time frame, which did not include any motion-sensing hardware.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> In the months after the Xbox One release, Microsoft decided to launch a Kinect-less Xbox One system in March 2014 at the same price as the PlayStation 4, after considering that the Kinect for Xbox One had not gotten the developer support, and sales of the Xbox One were lagging due to the higher price tag of the Kinect-bundled system. Richard Irving, a program group manager that oversaw Kinect, said that Microsoft had felt that it was more important to give developers and consumers the option of developing for or purchasing the Kinect rather than forcing the unit on them.<ref name="poly rise fall"/>

The removal of Kinect from the Xbox One retail package was the start of the rapid decline and phase-out of the unit within Microsoft. Developers like Harmonix that had been originally targeting games to use the Xbox One had put these games on hold until they knew there was enough of a Kinect install base to justify release, which resulted in a lack of games for the Kinect and reducing any consumer drive to buy the separate unit.<ref name="poly rise fall"/> Microsoft became bearish on the Kinect, making no mention of the unit at [[E3 2015]] and announcing at [[E3 2016]] that the upcoming Xbox One hardware revision, the [[Xbox One S]], would not have a dedicated Kinect port; Microsoft offered a USB adapter for the Kinect, provided free during an initial promotional period after the console's launch.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11927140/xbox-one-s-console-kinect-adapter | title = Xbox One S console has no Kinect port, requires USB adapter | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = June 13, 2016 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-date = January 15, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200115144744/https://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11927140/xbox-one-s-console-kinect-adapter | url-status = live }}</ref> The more powerful [[Xbox One X]] also lacked the Kinect port and required this adapter.<ref name="kinect adapter terminated"/> Even though developers still released Kinect-enabled games for the Xbox One, Microsoft's lack of statements related to the Kinect during this period led to claims that the Kinect was a dead project at Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8796721/kinect-unannounced-games-xbox-one-microsoft-windows-10 | title = Kinect isn't dead: Microsoft has unannounced Kinect games in development | first = Chris | last = Plante | date = June 17, 2015 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = April 1, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200401073508/https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8796721/kinect-unannounced-games-xbox-one-microsoft-windows-10 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12173190/fru-game-review-xbox-one-kinect | title = Kinect is almost dead, but it finally has a killer app | first = Andrew | last = Webster | date = July 13, 2016 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = April 1, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200401070452/https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12173190/fru-game-review-xbox-one-kinect | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Non-gaming applications and Kinect for Windows===
While the Kinect unit for the Xbox platform had petered out, the Kinect was being used in academia and other applications since around 2011. The functionality of the unit along with its low {{USD|150}} cost was seen to be an inexpensive means to add depth-sensing to existing applications, offsetting the high cost and unreliability of other 3D camera options at the time. In [[robotics]], Kinect's depth-sensing would enable robots to determine the shape and approximate distances to obstacles and maneuver around them.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.wired.com/2011/06/mf_kinect/ | title = Kinect Hackers Are Changing the Future of Robotics | issue = 7 | first = Jason | last = Tanz | date = June 28, 2011 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | volume = 19 | archive-date = February 6, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200206080735/https://www.wired.com/2011/06/mf_kinect/ | url-status = live }}</ref> Within the medical field, the Kinect could be used to monitor the shape and posture of a body in a quantifiable manner to enable improved health-care decisions.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Evaluation of Kinect 3D Sensor for Healthcare Imaging | first1 = Stefanie | last1= Pöhlmann | first2 = Elaine | last2= Harkness | first3 = Christopher | last3= Taylor | first4 = Susan | last4 = Astley | journal = [[Journal of Medical and Biological Engineering]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 857–870 | doi = 10.1007/s40846-016-0184-2| pmid = 28111534 | pmc = 5216096 | date = December 9, 2016 }}</ref>

Around November 2010, after the Kinect's launch, scientists, engineers, and hobbyists had been able to [[Security hacker|hack]] into the Kinect to determine what hardware and internal software it had used, leading to users finding how to connect and operate the Kinect with [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS X]] over USB, which has unsecured data from the various camera elements that could be read.

{{Cquote|The first thing to talk about is, Kinect was not actually hacked. Hacking would mean that someone got to our algorithms that sit inside of the Xbox and was able to actually use them, which hasn't happened. Or, it means that you put a device between the sensor and the Xbox for means of cheating, which also has not happened. That's what we call hacking, and that's what we have put a ton of work and effort to make sure doesn't actually occur. What has happened is someone wrote an open-source driver for PCs that essentially opens the USB connection, which we didn't protect, by design, and reads the inputs from the sensor. The sensor, again, as I talked earlier, has eyes and ears, and that's a whole bunch of noise that someone needs to take and turn into signal.

Though Kinect had been cancelled, the ideas of it helped to spur Microsoft into looking more into [[accessibility]] for Xbox and its games. According to [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]], the head of Xbox at Microsoft, they received positive comments from parents of disabled and impaired children who were happy that Kinect allowed their children to play video games. These efforts led to the development of the [[Xbox Adaptive Controller]], released in 2018, as one of Microsoft's efforts in this area.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.axios.com/xbox-chief-phil-spencer-interview-20-years-f1a13231-b5b5-4a9f-aaa8-41580b5389b2.html | title = Xbox chief Phil Spencer reflects on 20 years of Xbox | first = Stephen | last = Tolito | date = November 16, 2021 | accessdate = November 16, 2021 | work = [[Axios (website)|Axios]] | archive-date = November 15, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211115225654/https://www.axios.com/xbox-chief-phil-spencer-interview-20-years-f1a13231-b5b5-4a9f-aaa8-41580b5389b2.html | url-status = live }}</ref>

Microsoft announced that it was working on a new version of a hardware Kinect model for non-game applications that would integrate with their [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] cloud computing services in May 2018. The use of cloud computing to offload some of the computational work from Kinect, as well as more powerful features enable by Azure such as [[artificial intelligence]] would improve the accuracy of the depth-sensing and reduce the power demand and would lead to more compact units, Microsoft had envisioned.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17318690/microsoft-kinect-cloud-announced-build-2018 | title = Microsoft is moving Kinect to the cloud | first = Shannon | last = Liao | date = May 7, 2018 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = January 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200113164022/https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17318690/microsoft-kinect-cloud-announced-build-2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> The Azure Kinect device was released on June 27, 2019, at a price of {{USD|400}}, while the SDK for the unit had been released in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-microsofts-azure-kinect-dk/ | title = What is Microsoft's Azure Kinect DK? | first = Steve | last = Ranger | date = February 27, 2019 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[ZDNet]] | archive-date = March 7, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200307144113/https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-microsofts-azure-kinect-dk/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

The depth and motion sensing technology at the core of the Kinect is enabled through its depth-sensing. The original Kinect for Xbox 360 used [[structured light]] for this: the unit used a near-[[infrared]] pattern projected across the space in front of the Kinect, while an infrared sensor captured the reflected light pattern. The light pattern is deformed by the relative depth of the objects in front it, and mathematics can be used to estimate that depth based on several factors related to the hardware layout of the Kinect. While other structure light depth-sensing technologies used multiple light patterns, Kinect used as few as one as to achieve a high rate of 30 frames per second of depth sensing. Kinect for Xbox One switched over to using [[time of flight]] measurements. The infrared projector on the Kinect sends out modulated infrared light which is then captured by the sensor. Infrared light reflecting off closer objects will have a shorter time of flight than those more distant, so the infrared sensor captures how much the modulation pattern had been deformed from the time of flight, pixel-by-pixel. Time of flight measurements of depth can be more accurate and calculated in a shorter amount of time, allowing for more frames-per-second to be detected.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Kinect Range Sensing: Structured-Light versus Time-of-Flight Kinect | first1 = Hamed | last1 = Sarbolandi | first2 = Damien | last2= Lefloch | first3= Andreas | last3= Kolb | s2cid = 4588438 | journal = Computer Vision and Image Understanding | volume = 139 | pages = 1–20 | date = May 21, 2015  | doi = 10.1016/j.cviu.2015.05.006 | arxiv = 1505.05459 | bibcode = 2015arXiv150505459S }}</ref>

Once Kinect has a pixel-by-pixel depth image, Kinect uses a type of [[edge detection]] here to delineate closer objects from the background of the shot, incorporating input from the regular visible light camera. The unit then attempts to track any moving objects from this, with the assumption that only people will be moving around in the image, and isolates the human shapes from the image. The unit's software, aided by artificial intelligence, performs segmentation of the shapes to try to identify specific body parts, like the head, arms, and hands, and track those segments individually. Those segments are used to construct a 20-point skeleton of the human body, which then can be used by game or other software to determine what actions the person has performed.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/EngineeringBlog/122910-HowYouBecometheController | title = How You Become the Controller | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | first1 = Ron | last1 = Forbes | first2 = Arjun | last2 = Dayal | date = December 29, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110111115024/https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/EngineeringBlog/122910-HowYouBecometheController | archive-date =  January 11, 2011 }}</ref>

The default RGB video stream uses 8-bit VGA resolution (640&nbsp;×&nbsp;480 [[pixel]]s) with a [[Bayer filter|Bayer color filter]], but the hardware is capable of resolutions up to 1280x1024 (at a lower frame rate) and other colour formats such as [[YUV|UYVY]]. The monochrome depth sensing video stream is in VGA resolution (640&nbsp;×&nbsp;480 pixels) with [[color depth|11-bit depth]], which provides 2,048 levels of sensitivity. The Kinect can also stream the view from its IR camera directly (i.e.: before it has been converted into a depth map) as 640x480 video, or 1280x1024 at a lower frame rate. The Kinect sensor has a practical [[ranging]] limit of {{convert|1.2|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} distance when used with the Xbox software.

The SDK included [[Windows 7]] compatible [[Personal computer|PC]] drivers for Kinect device. It provided Kinect capabilities to developers to build applications with [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], or [[Visual Basic]] by using [[Microsoft Visual Studio 2010]] and included the following features:

# Raw sensor streams: Access to low-level streams from the depth sensor, color camera sensor, and four-element microphone array.
# Skeletal tracking: The capability to track the skeleton image of one or two people moving within Kinect's field of view for gesture-driven applications.
# Advanced audio capabilities: Audio processing capabilities include sophisticated [[acoustic noise]] suppression and [[echo cancellation]], beam formation to identify the current sound source, and integration with [[Windows speech recognition]] API.

=== Kinect for Xbox One (2013) ===
An upgraded iteration of Kinect was released on November 22, 2013, for [[Xbox One]]. It uses a wide-angle [[time-of-flight camera]], and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active [[Infrared|IR]] sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's [[heart rate]], facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from [[sleep mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/microsofts-new-kinect-is-official/|title=Microsoft's new Kinect is official: larger field of view, HD camera, wake with voice|access-date=February 24, 2018|archive-date=June 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607192016/http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/microsofts-new-kinect-is-official/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=XboxOneKinectListeningMay2013Polygon>{{cite news |title=Kinect is always listening on Xbox One, but privacy is a 'top priority' for Microsoft |author=Dave Tach |work=Polygon |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/21/4353580/kinect-always-listening-on-xbox-one-privacy-is-a-top-priority |date=May 21, 2013 |access-date=May 22, 2013 |archive-date=June 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607181357/http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/21/4353580/kinect-always-listening-on-xbox-one-privacy-is-a-top-priority |url-status=live }}</ref> The recommended player's height is at least 40 inches, which roughly corresponds to children of {{frac|4|1|2}} years old and up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/coolstuff/The-Kid-Friendly-Guide-to-Kinect|title=The Kid-Friendly Guide to Kinect|website=Channel 9|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13|archive-date=November 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113165643/https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/coolstuff/The-Kid-Friendly-Guide-to-Kinect|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40097124/ns/technology_and_science-digital_home/t/kinect-your-kids-what-works-what-wont/|title=Kinect and your kids: What works, what won't|date=2010-11-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en|archive-date=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115215104/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40097124/ns/technology_and_science-digital_home/t/kinect-your-kids-what-works-what-wont/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Xbox One originally shipped in bundles with the Kinect; the original [[Xbox One system software|Xbox One user interface software]] had similar support for Kinect features as the Xbox 360 software, such as voice commands, user identification via skeletal or vocal recognition, and gesture-driven commands, though these features could be fully disabled due to privacy concerns.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/hands-on-with-the-xbox-one-kinect-interface-and-os-impressions/ | title = Hands-on with the Xbox One: Kinect, interface, and OS impressions | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = November 8, 2013 | access-date = January 17, 2020 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | archive-date = August 3, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200803084919/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/hands-on-with-the-xbox-one-kinect-interface-and-os-impressions/ | url-status = live }}</ref> However, this had left the more traditional navigation using a controller haphazard.

In human motion tracking, Kinect might suffer from occlusion which is when some human body joints are occluded and cannot be tracked accurately by Kinect's skeletal model.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Real-Time Posture Reconstruction for Microsoft Kinect | year= 2013|journal = [[IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics]] | last1 = Shum | first1 = Hubert|last2=Ho|first2=Edmond|last3=Jiang|first3=Yang|last4=Takagi|first4=Shu|doi=10.1109/TCYB.2013.2275945|volume=43|issue=5|pages=1357–1369| pmid= 23981562| s2cid= 14124193}}</ref> Therefore, fusing its data with other sensors can provide a more robust tracking of the skeletal model. For instance, in a study, an [[Unscented Kalman filter]] (UKF) was used to fuse Kinect 3D position data of shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints to those obtained from two [[inertial measurement unit]]s (IMUs) placed on the upper and lower arm of a person.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Human arm motion tracking by orientation-based fusion of inertial sensors and Kinect using unscented Kalman filter | year= 2016|journal = Journal of Biomechanical Engineering | last1 = Atrsaei | first1 = Arash|last2=Salarieh|first2=Hassan|last3=Alasty|first3=Aria|doi=10.1115/1.4034170|volume=138|issue=9| pmid= 27428461}}</ref> The results showed an improvement of up to 50% in the accuracy of the position tracking of the joints. In addition to solving the occlusion problem, as the sampling frequency of the IMUs was 100&nbsp;Hz (compared to ~30&nbsp;Hz for Kinect), the improvement of skeletal position was more evident during fast and dynamic movements.

Kinect also shows compelling potential for use in medicine. Researchers at the [[University of Minnesota]] have used Kinect to measure a range of disorder symptoms in children, creating new ways of objective evaluation to detect such conditions as autism, attention-deficit disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Minnesota-University-Team-Adapts-Kinect-for-Medical-Use-189553.shtml|title=Minnesota University Team Adapts Kinect for Medical Use|publisher=Softpedia|date=March 15, 2011|access-date=May 23, 2011|archive-date=March 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317115729/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Minnesota-University-Team-Adapts-Kinect-for-Medical-Use-189553.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Several groups have reported using Kinect for intraoperative, review of medical imaging, allowing the surgeon to access the information without contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qj.net/qjnet/xbox-360/medical-practice-finds-use-for-kinect-hack.html|title=Medical practice finds use for Kinect hack|publisher=QuickJump Gaming Network|date=December 27, 2010|access-date=May 23, 2011|archive-date=December 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230143408/http://www.qj.net/qjnet/xbox-360/medical-practice-finds-use-for-kinect-hack.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=radRounds|url=http://www.radrounds.com/video/xbox-kinect-based-radiology-medical-image-exploration|work=Xbox Kinect-based radiology & medical image exploration|access-date=December 4, 2011|archive-date=August 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805232814/http://www.radrounds.com/video/xbox-kinect-based-radiology-medical-image-exploration|url-status=live}}</ref> This technique is already in use at [[Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre]] in [[Toronto]], where doctors use it to guide imaging during cancer surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chealth.canoe.ca/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=31715&news_channel_id=12&channel_id=12|title=Doctors use Xbox Kinect in cancer surgery|publisher=CHealth|date=March 22, 2011|access-date=May 23, 2011|archive-date=July 8, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708154106/http://chealth.canoe.ca/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=31715&news_channel_id=12&channel_id=12|url-status=live}}</ref> At least one company, GestSure Technologies, is pursuing the commercialization of such a system.<ref>{{cite web|title=GestSure Technologies|url=http://www.gestsure.com/|access-date=December 4, 2011|archive-date=April 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402225838/http://gestsure.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Upon its release, the Kinect garnered generally positive opinions from reviewers and critics. [[IGN]] gave the device 7.5 out of 10, saying that "Kinect can be a tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for Xbox 360 is a tough sell, especially considering that the entry level variation of Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99".<ref name="IGN Review">{{cite web |url=http://gear.ign.com/articles/113/1132213p1.html |title=Microsoft Kinect Review |first=Scott |last=Lowe |date=November 4, 2010 |website=IGN |access-date=November 4, 2010 |archive-date=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107045500/http://gear.ign.com/articles/113/1132213p1.html |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'' rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier.<ref name="GI Review">{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/11/03/kinect-hardware-review.aspx |title=Kinect Hardware Review: Wave Of The Future |first=Annette |last=Gonzalez |date=November 4, 2010 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |access-date=November 4, 2010 |archive-date=November 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106142058/http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/11/03/kinect-hardware-review.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.<ref name="CVG Review">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=273523 |title=Kinect Review |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=November 4, 2010 |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |access-date=November 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106023322/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=273523 |archive-date=November 6, 2010 }}</ref>

===Kinect for Xbox One===
Although featuring improved performance over the original Kinect, its successor has been subject to mixed responses. In its Xbox One review, ''[[Engadget]]'' praised Xbox One's Kinect functionality, such as face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but said that while the device was "magical", "every false positive or unrecognized [voice] command had us reaching for the controller."<ref name=engadget-2013review>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ben|title=Xbox One review: a fast and powerful work in progress|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|website=Engadget|access-date=December 16, 2014|archive-date=December 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210081203/http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|url-status=live}}</ref> The Kinect's inability to understand some accents in English was criticized.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U_QcJtK5-g | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/3U_QcJtK5-g| archive-date=2021-11-14 | url-status=live|title=The Point : Can Kinect Understand Weird Accents?| website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Matt Peckham described the device as being "chunky" in appearance, but that the facial recognition login feature was "creepy but equally sci-fi-future cool", and that the new voice recognition system was a "powerful, addictive way to navigate the console, and save for a few exceptions that seem to be smoothing out with use". However, its accuracy was found to be affected by background noise, and Peckham further noted that launching games using voice recognition required that the full title of the game be given rather than an abbreviated name that the console "ought to semantically understand", such as ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'' rather than "Forza 5".<ref name=time-xb1review>{{cite magazine|last1=Peckham|first1=Matt|title=Xbox One Review: Microsoft's Ambitious One-Stop Shop|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/11/20/xbox-one-review-microsofts-ambitious-one-stop-shop/|magazine=Time|access-date=April 5, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402014253/http://techland.time.com/2013/11/20/xbox-one-review-microsofts-ambitious-one-stop-shop/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Prior to Xbox One's launch, [[Digital privacy|privacy]] concerns were raised over the new Kinect; critics showed concerns the device could be used for [[surveillance]], stemming from the originally announced requirements that Xbox One's Kinect be plugged in at all times, plus the initial [[always-on DRM]] system that required the console to be connected to the internet to ensure continued functionality. Privacy advocates contended that the increased amount of data which could be collected with the new Kinect (such as a person's eye movements, heart rate, and mood) could be used for [[targeted advertising]]. Reports also surfaced regarding recent Microsoft [[patent]]s involving Kinect, such as a DRM system based on detecting the number of viewers in a room, and tracking viewing habits by awarding [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] for watching television programs and [[Television commercial|advertising]]. While Microsoft stated that its [[privacy policy]] "prohibit[s] the collection, storage, or use of Kinect data for the purpose of advertising", critics did not rule out the possibility that these policies could be changed prior to the release of the console. Concerns were also raised that the device could also record conversations, as its microphone remains active at all times. In response to the criticism, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that users are "in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused", will be provided with key privacy information and settings during the console's initial setup, and that user-generated content such as photos and videos "will not leave your Xbox One without your explicit permission."<ref name=polygon-xbox1privacy /><ref name="verge-kinectads" /><ref name="polygon-privacyresponse" /><ref name=XboxOneReceptionInternetMay2013Pcmag /> Microsoft ultimately decided to reverse its decision to require Kinect usage on Xbox One, but the console still shipped with the device upon its launch in November 2013.<ref name=ext-onekinect/>

==Other motion controllers==
{{Main|Motion controller#Gaming}}
Kinect competes with several [[motion controller]]s on other home consoles, such as [[Wii Remote]], [[Wii Remote Plus]] and [[Wii Balance Board]] for the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation Move]] and [[PlayStation Eye]] for the [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation Camera]] for the [[PlayStation 4]].

While the Xbox 360 Kinect's controller-less nature enabled it to offer a motion-controlled experience different from the wand-based controls of the Wii and PlayStation Move, this has occasionally hindered developers from developing certain motion-controlled games that could target all three seventh-generation consoles and still provide the same experience regardless of console.  Examples of seventh-generation motion-controlled games that were released on Wii and PlayStation 3, but had a version for Xbox 360 cancelled or ruled out from the start, due to issues with translating wand controls to the camera-based movement of the Kinect, include ''[[Dead Space: Extraction]]'',<ref name="EuroViceral">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-28-critics-validated-wii-dead-space|title=Critics "validated" Wii Dead Space|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2010-09-28|access-date=June 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001133609/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-28-critics-validated-wii-dead-space|archive-date=2010-10-01|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]''<ref name="interview">{{cite web | title=The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Interview: Steve Pritchard | url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-aragorns-quest-interview-ste/2300-6266627/ | date=17 June 2010 | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | access-date=28 February 2015 | archive-date=January 16, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230116040923/https://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-lord-of-the-rings-aragorns-quest-interview-ste/2300-6266627/ | url-status=live }}</ref> and ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension (video game)|Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5816583/ |title=Thank ''Ratchet and Clank for This Wonderful Disney Game |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=June 29, 2011 |author=Crecente, Brian |access-date=January 16, 2023 |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018025304/http://kotaku.com/5816583/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
