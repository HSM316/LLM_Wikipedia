''Kinect for Xbox 360'' was a combination of [[Microsoft]] built software and hardware. The hardware included a [[range imaging|range chipset]] technology by [[Israel]]i developer [[PrimeSense]], which developed a system consisting of an [[infrared]] projector and camera and a special [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] that generates a grid from which the location of a nearby object in 3 dimensions can be ascertained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr50/primesense/|title="MIT" The 50 most innovative companies 2011, MIT technological review|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref><ref name="VentureBeat">{{citation|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=September 5, 2009|title=How many vendors does it take to make Microsoft’s Project Natal game control system?|periodical=Venture Beat|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/09/05/how-many-vendors-does-it-take-to-make-microsofts-project-natal-game-control-system/|accessdate=January 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="MsPress">{{Cite news|last=Press |first=MS |date=March 31, 2010 |title=PrimeSense Supplies 3-D-Sensing Technology to Project Natal for Xbox 360 |periodical=MsPress |page=MsPress |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/mar10/03-31PrimeSensePR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases |accessdate=March 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620012436/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/mar10/03-31PrimeSensePR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases |archivedate=June 20, 2010 }}</ref> This [[3D scanner]] system called ''Light Coding''<ref name="PrimeSense">{{cite web|url=http://www.primesense.com/?p=535 |title=© 2010 PrimeSense Ltd. &#124; FAQ |publisher=Primesense.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> employs a variant of image-based [[3D reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite web|author=mirror2image | url=http://mirror2image.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/how-kinect-works-stereo-triangulation/ |title=How Kinect depth sensor works – stereo triangulation? |publisher=Mirror2image.wordpress.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Structured pattern">{{cite web|url=http://www.futurepicture.org/?p=116 |title=» Kinect Hacking 103: Looking at Kinect IR Patterns. |publisher=Futurepicture |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

The Kinect sensor<ref name="Natal 101" /> is a horizontal bar connected to a small base with a motorized pivot and is designed to be positioned lengthwise above or below the video display. The device features an "[[RGB color space|RGB]] camera, [[Structured-light 3D scanner|depth sensor]] and [[microphone array]] running proprietary software",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5442775/natal-recognizes-31-body-parts-uses-tenth-of-xbox-360-computing-resources | title = Natal Recognizes 31 Body Parts, Uses Tenth of Xbox 360 "Computing Resources" |date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=November 25, 2010|publisher=[[Kotaku]], [[Gawker Media]]|first=Stephen|last=Totilo}}</ref> which provide full-body 3D [[motion capture]], [[three-dimensional face recognition|facial recognition]] and [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] capabilities. At launch, voice recognition was only made available in Japan, United Kingdom, Canada and United States.

The Kinect sensor's microphone array enables Xbox 360 to conduct [[acoustic source localization]] and [[active noise control|ambient noise suppression]], allowing for things such as headset-free party chat over [[Xbox Live]].<ref name="Natal 101" />

The depth sensor consists of an [[infrared]] [[laser]] projector combined with a monochrome [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS sensor]], which captures video data in 3D under any [[Available light|ambient light]] conditions.<ref name="Natal 101"/><ref name="Totilo" /> The sensing range of the depth sensor is adjustable, and Kinect software is capable of automatically calibrating the sensor based on gameplay and the player's physical environment, accommodating for the presence of furniture or other obstacles.<ref name="Gizmodo E3 2009" />

Reverse engineering<ref name="OpenKinect">{{cite web |url=http://openkinect.org/wiki/Protocol_Documentation#Control_Commands;a=summary |title=OpenKinect Protocol Documentation}}</ref> has determined that the Kinect's various sensors output video at a [[frame rate]] of ≈9&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] to 30&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] depending on resolution. The default RGB video stream uses 8-bit VGA resolution (640&nbsp;×&nbsp;480 [[pixel]]s) with a [[Bayer filter|Bayer color filter]], but the hardware is capable of resolutions up to 1280x1024 (at a lower frame rate) and other colour formats such as [[YUV|UYVY]]. The monochrome depth sensing video stream is in VGA resolution (640&nbsp;×&nbsp;480 pixels) with [[color depth|11-bit depth]], which provides 2,048 levels of sensitivity. The Kinect can also stream the view from its IR camera directly (i.e.: before it has been converted into a depth map) as 640x480 video, or 1280x1024 at a lower frame rate. The Kinect sensor has a practical [[ranging]] limit of {{convert|1.2|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} distance when used with the Xbox software. The area required to play Kinect is roughly 6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, although the sensor can maintain tracking through an extended range of approximately {{convert|0.7|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sensor has an [[angle of view|angular field of view]] of 57[[degree (angle)|°]] horizontally and 43° vertically, while the motorized pivot is capable of [[tilt (camera)|tilting]] the sensor up to 27° either up or down. The horizontal field of the Kinect sensor at the minimum viewing distance of ≈{{convert|0.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} is therefore ≈{{convert|87|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and the vertical field is ≈{{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}}, resulting in a resolution of just over {{convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} per pixel.

=== Kinect for Windows (2012) ===
On February 21, 2011, Microsoft announced that in spring 2011 it would release a preliminary [[software development kit]] ([[Software development kit|SDK]]) enabling researchers and enthusiasts to develop applications running on Microsoft Windows PCs. The beta version initially supported the Kinect for Xbox 360 hardware, connected to a PC, and only non-commercial applications were allowed. The first beta was released for Windows 7 on June 16, 2011.<ref name="SDK1"/><ref name="SDK2"/><ref name="SDK3"/> Beta 2 was released on the 1 year anniversary of Kinect for Xbox 360, on November 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/kinectforwindows/2011/11/03/its-official-kinect-for-windows-is-coming-soon/|title=It’s Official: Kinect for Windows is Coming Soon|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>

On February 1, 2012, a new hardware version of the device called ''Kinect for Windows'' was released at a suggested price of US$249. It was similar to the existing Xbox 360 device but tested and supported under warranty for commercial Windows applications. At the same time, version 1.0 of the SDK was released, allowing commercial use, with licence terms requiring the use of the Kinect for Windows hardware even for non-commercial use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/kinectforwindows/2012/01/09/starting-february-1-2012-use-the-power-of-kinect-for-windows-to-change-the-world/|title=Starting February 1, 2012: Use the Power of Kinect for Windows to Change the World|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref>

The SDK included [[Windows 7]] compatible [[Personal computer|PC]] drivers for Kinect device. It provided Kinect capabilities to developers to build applications with [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], or [[Visual Basic]] by using [[Microsoft Visual Studio 2010]] and included the following features:

# Raw sensor streams: Access to low-level streams from the depth sensor, color camera sensor, and four-element microphone array.
# Skeletal tracking: The capability to track the skeleton image of one or two people moving within Kinect's field of view for gesture-driven applications.
# Advanced audio capabilities: Audio processing capabilities include sophisticated [[acoustic noise]] suppression and [[echo cancellation]], beam formation to identify the current sound source, and integration with [[Windows speech recognition]] API.
# Sample code and Documentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/kinectsdk/about.aspx |title=About the Kinect for Windows SDK - Microsoft Research |publisher= |date= |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>

=== Kinect for Xbox One (2013) ===
An upgraded iteration of Kinect was released on November 22, 2013 for [[Xbox One]]. It uses a wide-angle [[time-of-flight camera]], and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active [[Infrared|IR]] sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's [[heart rate]], facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from [[sleep mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/microsofts-new-kinect-is-official/|title=Microsoft's new Kinect is official: larger field of view, HD camera, wake with voice|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}</ref><ref name=XboxOneKinectListeningMay2013Polygon>{{cite news |title=Kinect is always listening on Xbox One, but privacy is a 'top priority' for Microsoft |author=Dave Tach |work=Polygon |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/21/4353580/kinect-always-listening-on-xbox-one-privacy-is-a-top-priority |date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The recommended player's height is at least 40 inches, which roughly corresponds to children of 4 and a half years old and up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/coolstuff/The-Kid-Friendly-Guide-to-Kinect|title=The Kid-Friendly Guide to Kinect|website=Channel 9|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40097124/ns/technology_and_science-digital_home/t/kinect-your-kids-what-works-what-wont/|title=Kinect and your kids: What works, what won't|date=2010-11-10|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}</ref>

Kinect for Xbox One was considered a market failure, with critics crediting privacy concerns (held over from controversies that affected Xbox One's launch), how its inclusion affected the console's launch price (which affected sales in comparison to [[PlayStation 4]]), and the smaller number of Kinect-specific titles developed for Xbox One. By mid-2015, Microsoft had begun to heavily downplay Kinect as part of its overall strategy for the platform. With the release of the refreshed [[Xbox One S]] SKU in 2016, the proprietary port used to attach Kinect was removed from this and future revisions of the console, necessitating the use of a USB 3.0/AC adapter cord. This was offered for free to Xbox One S owners with Kinect until March 2017. On October 25, 2017, Microsoft officially announced the discontinuation of Kinect for Xbox One and end of production. Production of the adapter cord also ended by January 2018.<ref name="eg kinect eol">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-25-kinect-officially-dead | title = Kinect officially dead | first = Wesley | last =Yin-Poole | date = October 25, 2017 | accessdate = October 25, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref><ref name="polygon-nomoresensor">{{cite web|title=Microsoft ends free Kinect adapter promotion for Xbox One S owners|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/5/15192792/xbox-one-s-kinect-adapter-free-microsoft|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/2/16842072/xbox-one-kinect-adapter-out-of-stock-production-ended|title=Microsoft discontinues Xbox One Kinect adapter|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|date=January 2, 2018|website=Polygon|access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>

==== Open source drivers ====
In November 2010, Adafruit Industries offered a bounty for an open-source driver for Kinect. Microsoft initially voiced its disapproval of the bounty, stating that it "does not condone the modification of its products" and that it had "built in numerous hardware and software safeguards designed to reduce the chances of product tampering".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techeye.net/software/microsoft-furious-at-2000-bounty-for-open-source-kinect-drivers|title=Microsoft furious at 2000 bounty for open source Kinect drivers|date=November 5, 2010|publisher=TechEye}}</ref> This reaction, however, was caused by a misunderstanding within Microsoft,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/02/microsoft-plans-kinect-sdk.html |title=Microsoft plans Kinect SDK |first=Todd |last=Bishop |publisher=TechFlash.com |date=February 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> and the company later clarified its position, claiming that while it does not condone hacking of either the physical device or the console, the USB connection was left open by design.

{{Cquote|The first thing to talk about is, Kinect was not actually hacked. Hacking would mean that someone got to our algorithms that sit inside of the Xbox and was able to actually use them, which hasn't happened. Or, it means that you put a device between the sensor and the Xbox for means of cheating, which also has not happened. That's what we call hacking, and that's what we have put a ton of work and effort to make sure doesn't actually occur. What has happened is someone wrote an open-source driver for PCs that essentially opens the USB connection, which we didn't protect, by design, and reads the inputs from the sensor. The sensor, again, as I talked earlier, has eyes and ears, and that's a whole bunch of noise that someone needs to take and turn into signal.|4=Microsoft's Alex Kipman speaking formally on NPR's ''Science Friday''<ref name="NPR">{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/11/microsoft-kinect-not-hacked-left.html|title=Microsoft: Kinect wasn't hacked, USB port left open 'by design'|date=November 20, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010|publisher=techflash.com}}</ref>}}

Upon its release, the Kinect garnered generally positive opinions from reviewers and critics. [[IGN]] gave the device 7.5 out of 10, saying that "Kinect can be a tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for Xbox 360 is a tough sell, especially considering that the entry level variation of Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99".<ref name="IGN Review">{{cite web |url=http://gear.ign.com/articles/113/1132213p1.html? |title=Microsoft Kinect Review |first=Scott |last=Lowe |date=November 4, 2010 |website=IGN |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Game Informer]]'' rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier.<ref name="GI Review">{{cite magazine |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/11/03/kinect-hardware-review.aspx |title=Kinect Hardware Review: Wave Of The Future |first=Annette |last=Gonzalez |date=November 4, 2010 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.<ref name="CVG Review">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=273523 |title=Kinect Review |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=November 4, 2010 |magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]] |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106023322/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=273523 |archivedate=November 6, 2010 }}</ref>

[[CNET.com|CNET]]'s review pointed out how Kinect keeps players active with its full-body motion sensing but criticized the learning curve, the additional power supply needed for older Xbox 360 consoles and the space requirements.<ref name="CNET Review">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/xbox-360-accessories/xbox-360-kinect/4505-9994_7-34182443.html?tag=cnetRiver#reviewPage1 |title=Xbox 360 Kinect Review |first=Jeff |last=Bakalar |date=November 4, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[CNET.com|CNET]] |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Engadget]], too, listed the large space requirements as a negative, along with Kinect's launch lineup and the slowness of the hand gesture UI.

The mainstream press also reviewed Kinect. ''[[USA Today]]'' compared it to the futuristic control scheme seen in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', stating that "playing games feels great" and giving the device 3.5 out of 4 stars.<ref name="USA Today Review">{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2010/11/review-microsoft-kinect-marks-big-leap-for-motion-gaming/1 |title=We play Kinect... |first=Brett |last=Molina |date=November 4, 2010 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> [[David Pogue]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted players will feel a "crazy, magical, omigosh rush the first time you try the Kinect."

===Kinect for Xbox One===
Although featuring improved performance over the original Kinect, its successor has been subject to mixed responses. In its Xbox One review, ''[[Engadget]]'' praised Xbox One's Kinect functionality, such as face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst "magical", "every false positive or unrecognized [voice] command had us reaching for the controller."<ref name=engadget-2013review>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ben|title=Xbox One review: a fast and powerful work in progress|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|website=Engadget|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref> The Kinect's inability to understand some accents in English was criticized.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U_QcJtK5-g |title=The Point : Can Kinect Understand Weird Accents?}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Matt Peckham described the device as being "chunky" in appearance, but that the facial recognition login feature was "creepy but equally sci-fi-future cool", and that the new voice recognition system was a "powerful, addictive way to navigate the console, and save for a few exceptions that seem to be smoothing out with use". However, its accuracy was found to be affected by background noise, and Peckham further noted that launching games using voice recognition required that the full title of the game be given rather than an abbreviated name that the console "ought to semantically understand", such as ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]'' rather than "Forza 5".<ref name=time-xb1review>{{cite web|last1=Peckham|first1=Matt|title=Xbox One Review: Microsoft’s Ambitious One-Stop Shop|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/11/20/xbox-one-review-microsofts-ambitious-one-stop-shop/|website=Time|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}</ref>

Prior to Xbox One's launch, [[Digital privacy|privacy]] concerns were raised over the new Kinect; critics showed concerns the device could be used for [[surveillance]], stemming from the originally announced requirements that Xbox One's Kinect be plugged in at all times, plus the initial [[always-on DRM]] system that required the console to be connected to the internet to ensure continued functionality. Privacy advocates contended that the increased amount of data which could be collected with the new Kinect (such as a person's eye movements, heart rate, and mood) could be used for [[targeted advertising]]. Reports also surfaced regarding recent Microsoft [[patent]]s involving Kinect, such as a DRM system based on detecting the number of viewers in a room, and tracking viewing habits by awarding [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]] for watching television programs and [[Television commercial|advertising]]. While Microsoft stated that its [[privacy policy]] "prohibit[s] the collection, storage, or use of Kinect data for the purpose of advertising", critics did not rule out the possibility that these policies could be changed prior to the release of the console. Concerns were also raised that the device could also record conversations, as its microphone remains active at all times. In response to the criticism, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that users are "in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused", will be provided with key privacy information and settings during the console's initial setup, and that user-generated content such as photos and videos "will not leave your Xbox One without your explicit permission."<ref name=polygon-xbox1privacy>{{cite web|title=Privacy concerns threaten to overshadow Microsoft's new console|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/5/4398440/privacy-microsoft-xbox-one|work=Polygon|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="verge-kinectads">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/27/4370676/microsoft-kinect-tv-monitoring-achievements-ads | title=Microsoft may award achievements for watching TV and ads by monitoring you with Kinect | publisher=Vox Media | work=The Verge | accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="polygon-privacyresponse">{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/6/4403926/kinect-on-xbox-one-will-not-record-or-upload-your-conversations | title=Kinect on Xbox One will not record or upload your conversations, Microsoft says | publisher=Vox Media | work=Polygon | accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name=XboxOneReceptionInternetMay2013Pcmag>{{cite news |title=Hello Xbox One, Goodbye Freedom |author=Will Greenwald |work=[[PC Magazine]] |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2419320,00.asp |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> Microsoft ultimately decided to reverse its decision to require Kinect usage on Xbox One, but the console still shipped with the device upon its launch in November 2013.<ref name=ext-onekinect/>
