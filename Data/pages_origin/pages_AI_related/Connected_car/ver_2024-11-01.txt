== History of connected cars, 1996–present ==

[[General Motors]] was the first automaker to bring the first connected car features to market with [[OnStar]] in 1996 in Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado. OnStar was created by GM working with [[Motorola]] Automotive (that was later bought by [[Continental AG|Continental]]). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a [[Call centre|call center]] where the agent sent help.<ref name="autoaproprose">{{cite web |url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/definition-of-connected-car-what-is-the-connected-car-defined/ |title=Definition of Connected Car – What is the connected car?

At first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over.

[[Remote diagnostics]] were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, [[Turn-by-turn navigation|turn-by-turn directions]] and a network access device. Data-only [[telematics]] were first offered in 2007.

In the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] Wi-Fi [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors.

By 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2015/07/onstar-celebrates-1-billion-requeste-with-free-premium-service-for-loyal-users/|title = OnStar celebrates 1 billion requests with free premium service for loyal users|date = 29 July 2015|access-date = 28 April 2017|archive-date = 3 September 2023|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230903042105/https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2015/07/onstar-celebrates-1-billion-requeste-with-free-premium-service-for-loyal-users/|url-status = live}}</ref>

== Categories of applications ==

Applications can be separated into two categories:
# Single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice.
# Cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation.

Examples include, amongst others: 
# Single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or [[Filling station|gas stations]].<ref name="AUTO Connected Car News">{{cite web|url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2016/03/bmw-connected-na-available-for-iphone-apple-watch-calculates-departure-time-texts-friends-finds-gasparking/|title=BMW Connected NA available for iPhone / Apple Watch – calculates departure time, texts friends & finds gas/parking|date=31 March 2016|access-date=10 April 2016|archive-date=6 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406045303/http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2016/03/bmw-connected-na-available-for-iphone-apple-watch-calculates-departure-time-texts-friends-finds-gasparking/|url-status=live}}</ref> The European [[eCall]] would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the [[European Union|EU]].<ref>EU eCall (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307001741/https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ecall-all-new-cars-april-2018 |date=2020-03-07 }})</ref>

* Well-being: functions involving the driver's comfort and ability and fitness to drive (e.g., fatigue detection, automatic environment adjustments to keep drivers alert, medical assistance)

== Single-vehicle applications ==

Current automobiles entail embedded [[Automotive navigation system|navigation system]]s, smartphone integration and multimedia packages.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar/> Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, [[in car entertainment]] unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis.<ref name="autoaproprose"/>

On January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the [[Open Automotive Alliance]] (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia.<ref name="oaamem">{{cite web | url=http://www.openautoalliance.net/#members | title=Open Automotive Alliance | publisher=[[Open Automotive Alliance]] | access-date=22 July 2014 | archive-date=2 May 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220502190513/http://www.openautoalliance.net/#members | url-status=live }}</ref>

On March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called [[CarPlay]].

[[Android Auto]] was announced on June 25, 2014, to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems.

Increasingly, connected cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system.

Innovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car's windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar/> In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver's perspective.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar>{{cite web|last1=McKinsey & Company|title=Connected car, automotive value chain unbound|url=https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|access-date=20 April 2017|date=September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421101141/https://www.mckinsey.de/files/mck_connected_car_report.pdf|archive-date=21 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Near-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar/>

Despite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.<ref name="everisReport">{{cite web | url=http://www.everis.com/global/WCRepositoryFiles/everis%20connected%20car%20report.pdf | title=everis Connected Car Report | publisher=[[everis]] | access-date=7 May 2015 | archive-date=18 May 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075603/http://www.everis.com/global/WCRepositoryFiles/everis%20connected%20car%20report.pdf | url-status=live }}</ref>

== Hardware ==
The necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary Internet connection via a [[GSM]] module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator [[AT&T]] with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo,<ref name="attpr2014">{{cite press release | url=http://about.att.com/story/volvo_cars_and_att_enter_multi_year_agreement_to_connect_future_models_in_us_and_canada.html | title=Volvo Cars and AT&T Enter Multi-Year Agreement to Connect Future Models in U.S. and Canada | publisher=[[AT&T Corporation]] | date=16 April 2014 }}</ref> some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes [[Verizon Enterprise Solutions|Verizon Wireless Enterprise]], a non-GSM CDMA operator.<ref name="walford2014">{{cite web | url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/01/hyuandai-blue-link-goes-red-verizon-wireless-use-it-google-glass-pandora-or-soundhound/ | title=Hyundai Blue Link Goes Red (Verizon Wireless) Using Google Glass, Pandora or SoundHound | publisher=Aproprose | work=AUTO Connected Car | date=21 January 2014 | access-date=22 July 2014 | author=Walford, Lynn | archive-date=25 July 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725010717/http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/01/hyuandai-blue-link-goes-red-verizon-wireless-use-it-google-glass-pandora-or-soundhound/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Most brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD ([[on-board diagnostics]]) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection:
* Hardware relies on customers smartphone for the Internet connection or
* Hardware establishes proprietary internet connection via GSM module.

All forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. [[eCall]]). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://obd2.autoscout24.com/en/studie-ueber-connected-car-geschaeftsmodelle-sowie-herausforderungen-und-chancen-des-marktes/ | title=Connected Car Business Models – State of the Art and Practical Opportunities | publisher=Scout24 | work=AutoScout24 | access-date=22 July 2014 | location=Munich, Germany | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726040114/http://obd2.autoscout24.com/en/studie-ueber-connected-car-geschaeftsmodelle-sowie-herausforderungen-und-chancen-des-marktes/ | archive-date=26 July 2014 }}</ref>

== Insurance ==

The data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar/> Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers' doing-of-business.<ref name=McKinseyConnectedCar/><ref name=ShiftingGears/> Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance-service hybrids.<ref name=ShiftingGears/>

Progressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based-insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an [[Onboard diagnostics|onboard diagnostics device]] allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments.<ref name=ShiftingGears>{{cite web|last1=Löffler|first1=Markus|last2=Mokwa|first2=Christopher|last3=Münstermann|first3=Björn|last4=Wojciak|first4=Johannes|title=Shifting gears: Insurers adjust for connected-car ecosystems|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|publisher=McKinsey & Company|access-date=20 April 2017|date=May 2016|archive-date=22 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422033354/http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/shifting-gears-insurers-adjust-for-connected-car-ecosystems|url-status=live}}</ref> 
Another innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards [[telematics]] devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through [[Wide area network|wide-area networks]] and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation.<ref name=ShiftingGears/>
Future services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advice to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.<ref name=ShiftingGears/>

== Trends ==

The following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions.

Technological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's driving the connected car?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|publisher=McKinsey|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-date=2017-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501065748/http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|url-status=live}}</ref> High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Obstacles for Connected Cars|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkk45ihlk/10-obstacles-for-connected-cars/#117b562612b8|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-date=2016-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124083128/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkk45ihlk/10-obstacles-for-connected-cars/#117b562612b8|url-status=live}}</ref>

There are initiatives to use [[Ethernet]] technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the Ethernet, network speed inside the vehicle can increase from one [[Megabyte|megabit]] to [[gigabit]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/02/the-top-five-trends-for-the-connected-car-in-2016/|title=The Top Five Trends For The Connected Car In 2016|last=Alam|first=Mahbubul|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en|archive-date=2017-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221193107/https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/02/the-top-five-trends-for-the-connected-car-in-2016/|url-status=live}}</ref> Further, Ethernet uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/from-your-dorm-room-to-your-car-ethernet-is-back/|title=From your dorm room to your car: ethernet is back|last=Hall-Geisler|first=Kristen|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en|archive-date=2017-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109023608/https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/from-your-dorm-room-to-your-car-ethernet-is-back/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/how-carmakers-can-compete-for-the-connected-consumer|title=How carmakers can compete for the connected consumer|website=McKinsey & Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09|archive-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061745/https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/how-carmakers-can-compete-for-the-connected-consumer|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Internet of Things]] will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed Internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Eun-Kyu|last2=Gerla|first2=Mario|last3=Pau|first3=Giovanni|last4=Lee|first4=Uichin|last5=Lim|first5=Jae-Han|title=Internet of Vehicles: From intelligent grid to autonomous cars and vehicular fogs|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|date=6 September 2016|volume=12|issue=9|pages=155014771666550|doi=10.1177/1550147716665500|doi-access=free|hdl=11585/617668|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

=== Drawbacks and Challenges ===
Although the connected car offers both benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges;
* A major issue with the connected cars is hackability. The more it is connected to the Internet and to the system, it becomes more exposed to being penetrated from the outside. If the service and help can be provided from distance by [[Automotive industry|car-makers]], through that channel, [[hacker]]s can access and control the car as well. In [[Germany]] and [[Brazil]], 59% of car drivers are afraid to be hacked into their car if it is connected to the Internet. In the [[United States|U.S]] there are 43% and in [[China]] 53% whereas the average lies at 54%.<ref name="McKinsey">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|title=What's driving the connected car|website=McKinsey & Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09|archive-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061729/https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car|url-status=live}}</ref> 
* [[Reliability engineering|Reliability]] is also a major concern. Cars, [[sensor]], and network hardware will malfunction. The system has to deal with incorrect data, as well as faulty communications, such as denial of service attacks.
* Privacy is another dimension, both with hacking and with other uses. Sensitive data gathered from the car such as the location, driver's daily route, apps that are used, etc. are all susceptible to be hacked and used for unauthorised purposes,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/car-hacking-markey-report,news-20424.html | title=How Hackers Could Take over Your Car | date=9 February 2015 | access-date=26 June 2017 | archive-date=20 October 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020135339/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/car-hacking-markey-report,news-20424.html | url-status=live }}</ref> as well as being used by businesses and government. In Germany for example 51% of car drivers do not want to use car-related connected services because they want to keep their privacy. In the U.S. it is 45%, in Brazil 37% and in China 21% of the car drivers that think so. The average lies at 37%.<ref name="McKinsey" />
* A simple failure in the system, whether in the connected car, or elsewhere in the network, while on the [[Autonomous car|autonomous drive]] can cause fatal consequences.

=== Fighting the challenges  ===
* Changing the [[design]] of products: the way that the product is developed and the "maintenance-respond-architecture" play a crucial role. Companies have to focus on long-term solutions in terms of design security because quick changes are costly and easy to circumvent. Integrating this sphere at the earliest stage possible when developing the product can be the right approach for the companies. 
* Internal cooperation between departments of the company: product-security teams and corporate IT-security teams will have to work closely together in order to prevent the hackability of their devices. To do so, companies may create guidelines that minimize probabilities of bugs, and security gaps (software). Making modifying and patching systems easier can be another effect driven from that.
* Over-the-air updates: As short-term solutions are also easy to solve problems a technology called OTA (over-the-air) becomes more and more important to OEMs. These OTA updates allow companies to quickly detect problems/attacks and prevent the malefactors to become active and attack the system. However, this is a very costly approach and companies have to know the architecture of their systems in detail to directly attack the issue not to lose money on inefficiency.
* [[Value chain]] security: As companies are the final integrators of security systems they also have to control security all along the value chain. Also suppliers have to make sure that security plays the most important role for the mobile device. Taking the example of the procurement department, it has to make sure that the cybersecurity features of the final product are negotiated and available. The whole security issue starts at the beginning of the value chain. This approach can be used to actually define and shape future security standards in the industry and make sure that every player in the industry has the same understanding of the importance of security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shifting-gears-in-cybersecurity-for-connected-cars|title=Shifting gears in cybersecurity for connected cars|website=McKinsey & Company|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09|archive-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061743/https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shifting-gears-in-cybersecurity-for-connected-cars|url-status=live}}</ref>
