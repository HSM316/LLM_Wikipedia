'''High-performance fuzzy computing''' ('''HPFC''') is those technologies able to exploit [[supercomputers]] and [[computer clusters]] to perform high performance [[fuzzy logic]] computations. Thus HPFC is just a special case of the much more general [[high-performance computing]]. In the specific case of fuzzy logic, however, there exist more traditional ways to achieve high performance, that could be considered HPFC but in a broader sense, like the hardware implementations on [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] or [[FPGA]]. More recently, another alternative has emerged: fuzzy computing on [[GPU]].
