'''Pebble''' is a discontinued [[smartwatch]] developed by Pebble Technology Corporation. Funding was conducted through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign running from April 11, 2012, to May 18, 2012, which raised $10.3 million; it was the most funded project in Kickstarter history, at the time. Pebble began shipping watches to Kickstarter backers in January 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/23/pebble-smartwatch-shipping/|title=Pebble smartwatch now shipping, but expect to wait a while for yours|last=Hardawar|first=Devindraw|date=January 23, 2013|work=VentureBeat|access-date=May 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Pebble watches can be connected to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices to show notifications and messages. An online [[app store]] distributed Pebble-compatible apps from many developers including [[ESPN]], [[Uber]], [[Runkeeper]], and [[GoPro]].

A steel-bodied variant to the original Pebble, the '''Pebble Steel''', was announced at [[CES 2014]] and released in February 2014. It has a thinner body, tactile metal buttons, and a [[Corning Gorilla Glass]] screen. It comes in 2 variations: a black matte finish and a brushed stainless steel finish, with both a black leather band and a matching steel band.

In 2015, Pebble launched its second generation of smartwatches: the [[Pebble Time]] and Time Steel. The devices were similarly funded through Kickstarter, raising $20.3 million from over 75,000 backers and breaking records for the site. In 2016, Pebble shut down their subsequent Time 2 series watches and refunded Kickstarter backers, citing financial issues.<ref name="Pebble – Pebble’s Next Step" />

On December 7, 2016, Pebble officially announced that the company would be shut down and would no longer manufacture or continue support for any devices, nor honor any existing warranties.<ref name="Pebble – Pebble’s Next Step" /> Pebble's intellectual property was purchased by [[Fitbit]], a [[wearable technology]] company specializing in fitness tracking, who also hired some of the Pebble staff. Further clarification on the transition timeline and efforts to render Pebble OS and its watchfaces/apps more self-sufficient was posted to the Pebble Dev Blog on December 14, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/12/14/first-steps-forward-with-fitbit/ |title=First Steps Forward with Fitbit |access-date=April 28, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014240/https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/12/14/first-steps-forward-with-fitbit/ |archive-date=February 2, 2017 }}</ref> Support for the Pebble app store, online forum, cloud development tool, voice recognition, and voice replies ceased in June 2018,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16928792/fitbit-smartwatch-pebble-end-support-date-june|title=Fitbit will end support for Pebble smartwatches in June|last=Goode|first=Lauren|date=24 January 2018|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=24 January 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124230148/https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16928792/fitbit-smartwatch-pebble-end-support-date-june|archive-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> although support for some online services was restored by the unofficial "Rebble" community.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The original Pebble Smartwatch was designed based on a concept by Eric Migicovsky describing a watch that could display messages from a smartphone and select Android devices. Migicovsky successfully took his idea through the [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] business incubator program, and unusually for a [[startup company]] at Y Combinator, Migicovsky's business actually generated revenue during the program.<ref name="bloomberg1">{{cite news |url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-04-17-rejected-by-vcs-pebble-watch-raises-3-8m-on-kickstarter/ |title=Rejected By VCs, Pebble Watch Raises $3.8M on Kickstarter |publisher=Go.bloomberg.com |date=April 17, 2012 |access-date=2012-04-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421201209/http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-04-17-rejected-by-vcs-pebble-watch-raises-3-8m-on-kickstarter/ |archive-date=April 21, 2012 }}</ref> Migicovsky was able to raise US$375,000 from angel investors such as Tim Draper of [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]], but was unable to raise additional funds.<ref name="bloomberg1"/> Discussing his inability to raise further funds, Migicovsky told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I wasn't extremely surprised... hardware is much harder to raise money for. We were hoping we could convince some people to our vision, but it didn't work out."<ref name="latimes1">{{cite news |last=Netburn |first=Deborah |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter-20120418,0,1769291.story |title=Pebble smartwatch raises $4.7 million on Kickstarter funding site |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 18, 2012 |access-date=2012-04-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422024033/http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter-20120418,0,1769291.story |archive-date=April 22, 2012 }}</ref>

===Funding===
After raising [[venture capital]] for the product under their former name, Allerta (which had already developed and sold the ''inPulse'' smartwatch for BlackBerry devices), the company failed to attract traditional investors under their new Pebble brand name,<ref name="bloomberg1"/> so the company pursued crowd funding in April 2012.

Migicovsky's company, Pebble Technology, launched a Kickstarter campaign on {{dts|2012|04|11}}, with an initial fundraising target of $100,000. Backers spending $115 would receive a Pebble when they became available ($99 for the first 200),<ref name="Vancouver">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/04/16/vancouver-born-entrepreneurs-pebble-smartphone-breaks-kickstarter-record/ |title=Vancouver-born entrepreneur's Pebble smartphone breaks Kickstarter record |publisher=Vancouver Sun |access-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529054619/http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/04/16/vancouver-born-entrepreneurs-pebble-smartphone-breaks-kickstarter-record/ |archive-date=2012-05-29 }}</ref> effectively pre-ordering the $150 Pebble at a discounted price.<ref name="latimes1"/> Within two hours of going live, the project had met its $100,000 goal, and within six days, the project had become the most funded project in the history of Kickstarter to that point, raising over $4.7&nbsp;million with 30 days left in the campaign.<ref name="latimes1"/><ref name="Forbes">{{cite news |author=Anthony Wing Kosner |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/04/15/pebble-watch-for-iphone-and-android-the-most-successful-kickstarter-project-ever/ |title=Pebble Watch for iPhone and Android, The Most Successful Kickstarter Project Ever |work=Forbes |date=April 15, 2012 |access-date=2012-04-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419191314/http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/04/15/pebble-watch-for-iphone-and-android-the-most-successful-kickstarter-project-ever/ |archive-date=April 19, 2012 }}</ref>

=== Production ===
Pebble worked with consulting firm Dragon Innovation to identify suppliers and manufacturers.<ref name="Bloomberg2"/> After overcoming manufacturability difficulties with the prototype design, Pebble started mass production with manufacturer Foxlink Group in January 2013 with an initial production of 15,000 watches per week.

== Later generations ==

=== Pebble Time ===
{{main|Pebble Time}}
[[File:Pebble Time front.jpg|thumb|right|Pebble Time]]
On February 24, 2015, Pebble announced the '''Pebble Time''', their second-generation Pebble smartwatch via its [[Kickstarter]] campaign.

The '''Pebble Time Steel''' is a [[stainless steel]] variant of the Pebble Time smartwatch, available in multiple finishes: silver, black or gold with either a leather or steel band.<ref>[https://gigaom.com/2015/03/03/pebble-time-steel-launches-alongside-new-smartwatch-straps/ Pebble Time Steel launches alongside new smart watch straps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010659/https://gigaom.com/2015/03/03/pebble-time-steel-launches-alongside-new-smartwatch-straps/ |date=2015-03-10 }}. [[Gigaom]]. Retrieved March 3, 2015.</ref> Pebble claims it has a 10-day battery life.

The '''Pebble Time Round''' is also made of [[stainless steel]] and 2.5d [[gorilla glass]] with five finishes. Pebble claims it has a 2-day battery life, dramatically decreased because of the shape and size but still significantly longer-lasting than the [[Apple Watch]]'s 16-hour life.

==== Hardware ====
Pebble's second generation comes with various improvements over its predecessors, such as a 64-colour e-paper display with Gorilla Glass<ref>{{cite news |url=https://getpebble.com/pebble_time/ |title=Official webpage says it is "1.25-inch, color e-paper display" |date=April 16, 2015 |last=Hoffelder |first=Nate |access-date=April 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416213925/https://getpebble.com/pebble_time/ |archive-date=April 16, 2015 }}</ref><!-- provide sources if you're gonna claim otherwise! --> a thinner and more ergonomic chassis, plastic casing and a microphone. The Pebble Time retains the seven-day battery life and water resistance found on the previous two Pebble watches. It has a 150mAh battery.

Alongside the Pebble Time Steel, Pebble announced its open hardware platform called "Smartstraps". This lets developers develop new third-party straps that connects to a special port at the back of the watch and can add new features like GPS, heart rate monitors, extended battery life and other things to the watch. This new platform prevents smartwatch bloat and making the watch bulky like most of its competitors' smartwatches.

==== Software ====
The Pebble Time also included a new interface designed around a timeline,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartwatchcrunch.com/pebble-time-the-new-pebble-baby-after-pebble-and-pebble-steel/|title=Pebble Time: The new Pebble color baby|date=14 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104917/http://smartwatchcrunch.com/pebble-time-the-new-pebble-baby-after-pebble-and-pebble-steel/|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref> which is similar to what is found in [[Google Now]] on [[Android Wear]]. In December 2015, all remaining Pebbles got a firmware update, enabling support for the timeline and removing the maximum of 8 apps-restriction, letting additional apps load directly from the connected phone. It is backwards compatible with all previous apps and watch faces.

Third parties have created apps for Pebble Time, such as [[contactless payment]] (tap to pay).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/08/pagare-payment-strap-for-pebble-smartwatch/|title=Smart strap brings payments to your Pebble smartwatch|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104100652/https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/08/pagare-payment-strap-for-pebble-smartwatch/|archive-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>

Kickstarter backers who have not received the product were expected to receive refunds in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/pebble-is-dead-and-its-customers-are-completely-screwe-1789775408|title=Pebble Is Dead, and Its Customers Are Completely Screwed|first=Alex|last=Cranz|date=December 7, 2016 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906050308/http://gizmodo.com/pebble-is-dead-and-its-customers-are-completely-screwe-1789775408|archive-date=2017-09-06}}</ref>

The remainder of Pebble's assets, including product inventory and server equipment, was set to be sold off separately. Following the acquisition, Pebble's offices were closed and Fitbit held control over the use of the Pebble brand. The former Pebble engineers were relocated to Fitbit's offices in San Francisco. As a result, Pebble was forced to cancel shipments for its Pebble 2, Time 2, and Pebble Core smartwatches, refunding Kickstarter backers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra/posts/1752929|title=Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core backers to be refunded|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217063629/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra/posts/1752929|archive-date=2017-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-07/pebble-said-to-discuss-selling-software-assets-to-fitbit|title=Fitbit Buys Software Assets From Smartwatch Startup Pebble|newspaper=Bloomberg.com |date=December 7, 2016 |via=www.bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208132806/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-07/pebble-said-to-discuss-selling-software-assets-to-fitbit|archive-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>
