'''Dlib''' is a general purpose [[cross-platform]] software [[Library (computing)|library]] written in the programming language [[C++]]. Its design is heavily influenced by ideas from [[design by contract]] and [[component-based software engineering]]. Thus it is, first and foremost, a set of independent software components. It is [[open-source software]] released under a [[Boost (C++ libraries)#License|Boost Software License]].

Since development began in 2002, Dlib has grown to include a wide variety of tools. As of 2016, it contains software components for dealing with [[Computer network|networking]], [[Thread (computing)|threads]], [[graphical user interface]]s, [[data structure]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[machine learning]], [[image processing]], [[data mining]], [[XML]] and text parsing, [[numerical optimization]], [[Bayesian network]]s, and many other tasks. In recent years, much of the development has been focused on creating a broad set of statistical machine learning tools and in 2009 Dlib was published in the ''[[Journal of Machine Learning Research]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=D.
