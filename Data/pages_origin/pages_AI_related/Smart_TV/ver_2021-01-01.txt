Smart TV should not be confused with Internet TV, [[IPTV]], or [[Web television]]. ''Internet TV'' refers to receiving television content over the Internet instead of traditional systems such as terrestrial, cable, and satellite, regardless of how the Internet is delivered. IPTV is one of the Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.

In smart TVs, the operating system is preloaded or is available through the set-top box. The [[software application]]s, or "apps", can be preloaded into the device or updated or installed on demand via an [[application store|app store or marketplace]], in a similar manner to how apps are integrated into modern [[smartphone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=13857 |title=Smart TV competition heats up market |publisher=Asianewsnet.net |access-date=January 17, 2012 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407111651/http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=13857 |archive-date=April 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/10855/smart-tv-shower-opens-smart-life |title=Smart TV Shower Opens Smart Life |publisher=Koreaittimes.com |date=October 7, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chacksfield |first=Marc |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/television/intel-smart-tv-revolution-biggest-since-move-to-colour--688832 |title=Intel: Smart TV revolution 'biggest since move to colour'&nbsp;– The wonders of widgets? |publisher=Techradar.com |date=May 12, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2010/tc20100520_211952.htm |title=Google, With Intel and Sony, Unveils Software for 'Smart' TVs |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=May 20, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Katzmaier |first=David |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20015791-1.html |title=Poll: Smart TV or dumb monitor? |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=September 8, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref>

==Definition==
[[File:SamsungSmartTV.JPG|thumb|Smart TVs on display]]
A ''Smart TV'' device is either a television set with integrated Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set. Smart TVs may be thought of as an [[information appliance]] or the [[computer system]] from a [[mobile device]] integrated within a television set unit. As such, a Smart TV often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins/addons]] based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete [[operating system]] or [[mobile operating system]] software providing a platform for application developers.<ref name="businessinsider1"/><ref name="wired1">{{cite news|author=<!--start post navigation--> Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/09/android-holds-the-key-to-samsungs-smart-tv-plans/ |title=Android Holds the Key to Samsung's Smart TV Plans |work=Wired |date=September 7, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="wired2">{{cite news|author=<!--start post navigation--> Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/google-introduces-google-tv/ |title=Google Introduces Google TV, New Android OS |work=Wired |date=May 20, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref>

Smart TV platforms or middleware have a public [[software development kit]] (SDK) and/or [[native development kit]] (NDK) for apps so that third-party developers can develop applications for it, and an [[Application store|app store]] so that the end-users can install and uninstall apps themselves. The public SDK enables third-party companies and other interactive application developers to "write" applications once and see them [[write once, run anywhere|run successfully on any device]] that supports the Smart TV platform or middleware architecture it was written for, regardless of the hardware manufacturer.

Smart TVs deliver content (such as photos, movies and music) from other computers or network attached storage devices on a network using either a [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] / [[Universal Plug and Play]] media server or similar service program like [[Windows Media Player]] or [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS), or via [[iTunes]]. It also provides access to Internet-based services including traditional broadcast TV channels, [[Catch-up tv|catch-up services]], [[video-on-demand]] (VOD), [[electronic program guide]], interactive advertising, personalisation, voting, games, [[social networking]], and other multimedia applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/google-tv-apps/ |title=A first look at Google TV's new apps |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=September 15, 2011 |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref> Smart TV enables access to movies, shows, video games, apps and more. Some of those apps include Netflix, [[Hulu]], [[Spotify]], YouTube, and Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/experience/smart-tv/|title=Samsung Smart TV - TV Has Never Been This Smart|website=Samsung Electronics America|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
In the early 1980s, "intelligent" television receivers were introduced in Japan. The addition of an [[Large-scale integration|LSI]] chip with memory and a character generator to a television receiver enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal.<ref>Gene Gregory (1985), ''Japanese Electronics Technology, Enterprise and Innovation'', page 351, [[Japan Times]]</ref> A patent was filed in 1994<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&date=19960510&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP&CC=FR&NR=2726670A1&KC=A1&ND=3 |title=espacenet&nbsp;– Original document |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref> (and extended the following year)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=US&NR=5905521A&KC=A&FT=D&ND=7&date=19990518&DB=EPODOC |title=espacenet&nbsp;– Bibliographic data |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |access-date=January 17, 2012}}</ref> for an "intelligent" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. 

The mass acceptance of digital television in the late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved Smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of Smart TVs only, for their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7497383/sony-new-smart-tv-run-android-tv-ces-2015|title=All of Sony's new smart TVs run on Android TV|author=Dieter Bohn|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/24117/20150103/ces-2015-new-samsung-smart-tvs-will-be-powered-by-tizen-os.htm|title=CES 2015: New Samsung Smart TVs Will Be Powered by Tizen OS|work=Tech Times|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-to-show-off-webos-2-0-smart-tv-at-ces-2015/|title=LG to show off webOS 2.0 smart TV at CES 2015|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Smart TVs became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.

==Sales==
According to a report from research group NPD In-Stat, in 2012 only about 12 million U.S. households had their Web-capable TVs connected to the Internet, although an estimated 25 million households owned a set with the built-in network capability. In-Stat predicted that by 2016, 100 million homes in North America and western Europe would be using television sets blending traditional programming with internet content.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/03/100-million-tvs-will-be-internet-connected-by-2016.html | title=100 Million TVs will have internet connections by 2016}}</ref>.

===Social networking===
{{See also|Social media and television}}
Some Smart TV platforms come prepackaged or can be optionally extended, with social networking technology capabilities. The addition of social networking synchronization to Smart TV and HTPC platforms may provide an interaction with both on-screen content and other viewers than is currently available to most televisions while simultaneously providing a much more cinematic experience of the content than is currently available with most computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/science_tech/tvs-get-smart-with-internet-access-in-2011 |title=TVs get smart with Internet access in 2011 |publisher=Abc15.com |date=August 23, 2010 |access-date=January 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072843/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/science_tech/tvs-get-smart-with-internet-access-in-2011 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Advertising===
Some Smart TV platforms also support [[interactive advertising]], [[addressable advertising]] with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/01/15/sky-adsmart-targeted-advertising/|title=Sky's AdSmart brings targeted advertising to your TV|author=Daniel Cooper|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> and other advanced advertising features such as [[ad telescoping]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iptvdictionary.com/IPTVDictionary-Ad-Telescoping-Definition.html|title=Ad Telescoping|access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> using [[video on demand|VOD]] and [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], enhanced TV for consumer [[Call to action (marketing)|call-to-action]], and [[audience measurement]] solutions for ad campaign effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nagra.com/dtv/company/newsroom/press-releases/article/?id=1195|title=Kudelski Group :: Notification|website=www.nagra.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nagra.com/media-center/press-releases/nagra-opentv-and-time-warner-cable-media-extend-advanced-advertising |title="NAGRA-OpenTV and Time Warner Cable Media Extend Advanced Advertising Partnership" March 5, 2012 - Cheseaux, Switzerland|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref> The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term [[t-commerce]]. Taken together, this [[Duplex (telecommunications)|bidirectional]] data flow means that Smart TVs can be and are used for [[surveillance|clandestine observation]] of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/02/samsung-smart-tv-hack/|title=Your Smart TV Could Be Hacked to Spy On You}}</ref>

2019 research, "Watching You Watch: The Tracking Ecosystem of Over-the-Top TV Streaming Devices", conducted at [[Princeton]] and [[University of Chicago]], demonstrated that a majority of streaming devices will covertly collect and transmit personal user data, including captured screen images, to a wide network of advertising and analytics companies, raising privacy concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://threatpost.com/smart-tvs-leak-data/148482/|title=Smart TVs, Subscription Services Leak Data to Facebook, Google|website=threatpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

===Security===
There is evidence that a Smart TV is vulnerable to attacks. Some serious [[internet security|security]] bugs have been discovered, and some successful attempts to run [[malware|malicious code]] to get unauthorized access were documented on video. There is evidence that it is possible to gain [[Superuser|root access]] to the device, install malicious software, access and modify configuration information for a [[remote control]], remotely access and modify files on TV and attached USB drives, access camera and microphone.<ref name=NotSoSmart>{{cite web|last1=Niemietz|title=Not so Smart: On Smart TV Apps|url=http://nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2015/08/31/SmartTvAttacks.pdf|publisher=International Workshop on Secure Internet of Things|access-date=September 15, 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref>.

There have also been concerns that [[hacker]]s may be able to remotely turn on the microphone or webcam on a smart TV, being able to eavesdrop on private conversations. A common [[loop antenna]] may be set for a ''bi''directional transmission channel, capable of uploading data rather than only receiving. Since 2012, security researchers discovered a similar vulnerability present in more [[mass production|series]] of Smart Tvs, which allows hackers to get an external [[root access]] on the device.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/444399/samsung_tv_vulnerability_could_let_hacker_change_channel/|title= Samsung TV vulnerability could let a hacker change the channel|date= Dec 12, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130306010836/https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/444399/samsung_tv_vulnerability_could_let_hacker_change_channel/|archive-date= March 6, 2013 }}</ref>

Anticipating growing demand for an [[antivirus]] for a Smart TV, some [[security software]] companies are already working with partners in the digital TV field on the solution. It seems like there is only one antivirus for Smart TVs available: 'Neptune', a cloud-based antimalware system developed by Ocean Blue Software in partnership with [[Sophos]]. However, antivirus company [[Avira]] has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise to work on software to protect against potential attacks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.pctechbootcamp.com/can-your-smart-tv-get-a-virus/ | title=CAN YOUR SMART TV GET A VIRUS?}}</ref> The privacy policy for [[Samsung|Samsung's]] Smart TVs has been called [[Orwellian]] (a reference to [[George Orwell]] and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''), and compared to [[Telescreen]]s because of eavesdropping concerns.<ref>{{Cite news | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/samsungs-new-smart-tv-policy-allows-company-to-listen-in-on-users-10033012.html | title = Samsung smart TV policy allows company to listen in on users | work= The Independent | date = February 9, 2015 | access-date = February 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31296188 Not in front of the telly: Warning over &#039;listening&#039; TV] BBC News, 2015</ref>

Hackers have misused Smart TV's abilities such as operating source codes for applications and its unsecured connection to the Internet. Passwords, IP address data, and credit card information can be accessed by hackers and even companies for advertisement. A company caught in the act is [[Vizio]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The confidential documents, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013–2016, include details on [[CIA]]'s software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise Smart TVs.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/europe/wikileaks-cia-hacking.html |title=WikiLeaks Releases Trove of Alleged C.I.A.
