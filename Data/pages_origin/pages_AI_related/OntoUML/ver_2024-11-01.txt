'''OntoUML''' is an [[Ontology|ontologically]] a language for [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]]-driven [[Conceptual model|Conceptual Modeling]]. '''OntoUML''' is built as a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] extension based on the [[Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)]]. The foundations of UFO and OntoUML can be traced back to [[Giancarlo Guizzardi]]'s Ph.D. thesis "''Ontological foundations for structural conceptual models''".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guizzardi|first1=Giancarlo|title=Ontological foundations for structural conceptual models|journal=University of Twente Research Information|date=2005|publisher=Enschede: Telematica Instituut Fundamental Research Series|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/50826/1/thesis_Guizzardi.pdf}}</ref> In his work, he proposed a novel foundational ontology for conceptual modeling ([[Upper ontology#UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology)|UFO]]) and employed it to evaluate and re-design a fragment of the UML 2.0 metamodel for the purposes of conceptual modeling and domain ontology engineering.

In 2006, Guizzardi co-founded the  [[Ontology & Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Ontology & Conceptual Modeling Research Group (NEMO)|url=http://nemo.inf.ufes.br/}}</ref> located at the [[Federal University of Espírito Santo|Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)]] in [[Vitória, Espírito Santo|Vitória]] city, state of [[Espírito Santo]], [[Brazil]]. Since then, NEMO has been responsible for most of the developments in OntoUML. 

Several papers about ontologies and OntoUML have been authored by members of the NEMO group.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEMO publications|url=http://nemo.inf.ufes.br/publications/}}</ref>
