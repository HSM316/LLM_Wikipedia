'''Cooperative Coevolution''' (CC) in the field of [[biological evolution]] is an [[evolutionary computation]] method. It divides a large [[Computational problem|problem]] into subcomponents, and solves them independently in order to solve the large problem.<ref>M. A. Potter and K. A. D. Jong, “[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/350e/0e980f86c604ba282037c70da9e19cd9c2b6.pdf A cooperative coevolutionary approach to function optimization],” in PPSN III: Proceedings of the International Conference on Evolutionary Computation. The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature. London, UK:Springer-Verlag, 1994, pp. 249–257.</ref> 

The subcomponents are also called [[species]]. The subcomponents are implemented as subpopulations and the only interaction between subpopulations is in the cooperative evaluation of each individual of the subpopulations. The general CC framework is nature inspired where the individuals of a particular group of species mate amongst themselves, however, [[mating]] in between different species is not feasible. The cooperative evaluation of each individual in a subpopulation is done by [[concatenating]] the current individual with the best individuals from the rest of the subpopulations as described by M. Potter.<ref name="Mitchell A. Potter 2000, p.1-29">Mitchell A. Potter, Kenneth A.

The cooperative [[coevolution]] framework has been applied to real world problems such as [[pedestrian]] detection systems,<ref>Cao, X., Qiao, H. and Keane, J., [http://www.paper.edu.cn/scholar/showpdf/MUj2gN5IMTT0MxeQh A low-cost pedestrian-detection system with a single optical camera].

It has also be further extended into another method, called [[Constructive cooperative coevolution]].

 ''i'' := 0
 
 '''for each''' subproblem ''S'' '''do'''
     Initialise a subpopulation ''Pop''<sub>''0''</sub>(''S'')
     calculate fitness of each member in ''Pop''<sub>''0''</sub>(''S'')
 
 '''while''' termination criteria not satisfied  '''do'''
     ''i'' := ''i'' + 1
     '''for each''' subproblem ''S'' '''do'''
         select ''Pop''<sub>''i''</sub>(''S'') from ''Pop''<sub>''i-1''</sub>(''S'')
         apply genetic operators to ''Pop''<sub>''i''</sub>(''S'')
         calculate fitness of each member in ''Pop''<sub>''i''</sub>(''S'')
