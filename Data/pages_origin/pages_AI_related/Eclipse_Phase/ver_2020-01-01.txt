==Setting==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}

''Eclipse Phase'' is a [[post-apocalyptic]] game of conspiracy and horror.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.eclipsephase.com/game|title = The Game <nowiki>|</nowiki> Eclipse Phase|author = Posthuman Studios|accessdate = 2009-09-09}}</ref> It takes place after a [[World War III]] project to create [[artificial intelligence]] known as TITANs has gone rogue, resulting in the deaths of over 90% of the inhabitants of Earth.

Earth is subsequently abandoned, and existing colonies throughout the Solar System are expanded to accommodate the refugees. The setting explores a spectrum of socioeconomic systems in each of these colonies:
*A [[capitalist]] / [[Republicanism|republican]] system exists in the Inner System (Mars, the Moon, and Mercury), under the Planetary Consortium, a corporate body which allows the election of representatives but whose shareholders are nominally most powerful.
*An [[Extropianism|Extropian]]/[[Propertarian]] system is established in the [[Asteroid Belt]]. The Extropians are split into two subfactions, an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] group, more closely related to the Hypercapitalists and a [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] group, related closely to the Anarchists.
*A military oligarchy rules the moons around Jupiter.
*An alliance of Scandinavia-style [[social democracy]] and [[Collectivist anarchism]] are dominant in the Outer System.

From there, the setting explores various scientific advances, extrapolated far into the future. [[Nanotechnology]], [[terraforming]], [[Weightlessness|Zero-G living]], [[uplift (science fiction)|upgrading animal sapience]], and [[reputation system]]s are all used as plot points and background.

With all of this, the game encourages players to confront existential threats like aliens, weapons of mass destruction, Exsurgent Virus outbreaks, and political unrest.

==Mechanics==
''Eclipse Phase'' uses a simple roll-under [[percentile die]] system for task resolution.<ref>{{citation|publisher = [[Posthuman Studios]]|title = Eclipse Phase Core Rulebook|page = 114|isbn= 978-0-9845835-0-8}}</ref> Players roll the percentile dice (by rolling two ten-sided dice with one of the dice representing a 10 value), and compare that roll to a target number with the goal being to match or go under that number with the roll. Unlike most similar systems, a roll of 00 does not count as a 100. In addition, any roll of a double (11, 22, 33 etc.) is a critical. If the double is under the target number it is a critical success, while being over the target number constitutes a critical failure.

For damage resolution (whether physical damage caused by [[injury]] or [[mental stress]] caused by [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] events), players roll a designated number of ten-sided dice and add the values together, along with any modifiers.<ref>{{citation|publisher = [[Posthuman Studios]]|title = Eclipse Phase Core Rulebook|page = 192|isbn= 978-0-9845835-0-8}}</ref>
