'''CeNSE''' or the Central Nervous System of the Earth is a project by [[Hewlett-Packard]], and others to place [[sensors]] everywhere. 

The idea is that sensors will transmit data at the speed of light (taking into account delay on [[Telecommunications network|networks]]). If an [[earthquake]] was to have its epicenter 20 miles away, you could know about it 10 seconds before you felt the ground shake. That’s the promise behind one of the newest products coming out of Hewlett-Packard’s labs.
