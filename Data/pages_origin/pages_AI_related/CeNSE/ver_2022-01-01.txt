'''CeNSE''' or the Central Nervous System of the Earth, is a project by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and others to place [[sensors]] everywhere.<ref>{{cite news |title=People Power releases SDK for wireless home energy sensors |first=Robert |last=Mullins |newspaper=VentureBeat.com |date=March 15, 2010 |url= https://venturebeat.com/2010/03/15/people-power-releases-sdk-for-wireless-home-energy-sensors/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=HP Invents a “Central Nervous System for Earth” and Joins the Smarter Planet Sweepstakes |first=Greg|last=Lindsay|newspaper=FastCompany.com |date=February 12, 2010 |url= https://www.fastcompany.com/1548674/hp-invents-central-nervous-system-earth-and-joins-smarter-planet-sweepstakes}}</ref>

Wireless [[accelerometers]] and other types of sensors transmit data at the speed of light (taking into account delay on [[Telecommunications network|networks]]). The technology could be used to build an [[earthquake warning system]]; in 2010, HP sold the technology to [[Royal_Dutch_Shell|Shell]] for [[hydrocarbon exploration]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sensor overload |first=Jessi |last=Hempl |newspaper=CNN Fortune Brainstorm Tech |date=April 9, 2010 |url=http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/04/09/sensors-sensors-everywhere/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412062230/http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/04/09/sensors-sensors-everywhere/ |archivedate=April 12, 2010 }}</ref>
