The '''Vicsek model''' is a mathematical model used to describe active matter. One motivation of the study of [[active matter]] by physicists is the rich phenomenology associated to this field. [[Collective motion]] and [[Swarm behaviour|swarming]] are among the most studied phenomena. Within the huge number of models that have been developed to catch such behavior from a microscopic description, the most famous is the model introduced by [[Tamás Vicsek]] et al. in 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles|journal = Physical Review Letters|date = 1995-08-07|pages = 1226–1229|volume = 75|issue = 6|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226|first1 = Tamás|last1 = Vicsek|first2 = András|last2 = Czirók|first3 = Eshel|last3 = Ben-Jacob|first4 = Inon|last4 = Cohen|first5 = Ofer|last5 = Shochet|pmid=10060237|arxiv = cond-mat/0611743|bibcode = 1995PhRvL..75.1226V| s2cid=15918052 }}</ref>

Physicists have a great interest in this model as it is minimal and describes a kind of [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]. It consists in point-like [[self-propelled particles]] that evolve at constant speed and align their velocity with their neighbours' one in presence of noise. Such a model shows collective motion at high density of particles or low noise on the alignment.

== Model (mathematical description) ==

As this model aims at being minimal, it assumes that flocking is due to the combination of any kind of self propulsion and of effective alignment.

An individual <math>i</math> is described by its position <math>\mathbf{r}_i(t)</math>  and the angle defining the direction of its velocity <math>\Theta_i(t)</math>  at time <math>t</math>. The discrete time evolution of one particle is set by two equations: 

# At each time step <math>\Delta t</math>, each agent aligns with its neighbours within a given distance <math>r</math> with an uncertainty due to a noise <math>\eta_i(t)</math>:
#* <math>\Theta_i(t+\Delta t) = \langle \Theta_j \rangle_{|r_i-r_j|<r} + \eta_i(t)</math>
# The particle then moves at constant speed  <math>v</math> in the new direction:
#* <math>\mathbf{r}_i(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf{r}_i(t) + v \Delta t \begin{pmatrix} \cos\Theta_i(t) \\ \sin\Theta_i(t) \end{pmatrix}</math>

In these equations, <math>\langle \Theta_j \rangle_{|r_i-r_j|<r}</math> denotes the average direction of the velocities of particles (including particle <math>i</math>) within a circle of radius <math>r</math> surrounding particle <math>i</math>.

The whole model is controlled by three parameters: the density of particles, the amplitude of the noise on the alignment and the ratio of the travel distance <math>v \Delta t</math> to the interaction range <math> r </math> . From these two simple iteration rules, various continuous theories<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Boltzmann and hydrodynamic description for self-propelled particles|journal = Physical Review E|date = 2006-08-02|pages = 022101|volume = 74|issue = 2|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.74.022101|pmid = 17025488|first1 = Eric|last1 = Bertin|first2 = Michel|last2 = Droz|first3 = Guillaume|last3 = Grégoire|arxiv = cond-mat/0601038|bibcode = 2006PhRvE..74b2101B| s2cid=19658705 }}</ref> have been elaborated such as the Toner Tu theory<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Long-Range Order in a Two-Dimensional Dynamical $\mathrm{XY}$ Model: How Birds Fly Together|journal = Physical Review Letters|date = 1995-12-04|pages = 4326–4329|volume = 75|issue = 23|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.4326|pmid = 10059876|first1 = John|last1 = Toner|first2 = Yuhai|last2 = Tu|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.4326T}}</ref> which describes the system at the hydrodynamic level.

== Phenomenology ==

This model shows a phase transition<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Onset of Collective and Cohesive Motion|journal = Physical Review Letters|date = 2004-01-15|pages = 025702|volume = 92|issue = 2|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.025702|pmid = 14753946|first1 = Guillaume|last1 = Grégoire|first2 = Hugues|last2 = Chaté|bibcode=2004PhRvL..92b5702G|arxiv = cond-mat/0401208| s2cid=37159324 }}</ref> from a disordered motion to large-scale ordered motion. At large noise or low density, particles are on average not aligned, and they can be described as a disordered gas. At low noise and large density, particles are globally aligned and move in the same direction ([[collective motion]]). This state is interpreted as an ordered liquid. The transition between these two phases is not continuous, indeed the [[phase diagram]] of the system exhibits a [[first order phase transition]] with a microphase separation. In the co-existence region, finite-size liquid bands<ref>{{Cite journal|title = From Phase to Microphase Separation in Flocking Models: The Essential Role of Nonequilibrium Fluctuations|journal = Physical Review Letters|date = 2015-02-12|pages = 068101|volume = 114|issue = 6|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.068101|first1 = Alexandre P.|last1 = Solon|first2 = Hugues|last2 = Chaté|first3 = Julien|last3 = Tailleur|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114f8101S|pmid=25723246|arxiv = 1406.6088| s2cid=43186543 }}</ref> emerge in a gas environment and move along their transverse direction.

== Extensions ==

Since its appearance in 1995 this model has been very popular within the physics community; many scientists have worked on and extended it. For example, one can extract several universality classes from simple symmetry arguments concerning the motion of the particles and their alignment.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Modeling collective motion: variations on the Vicsek model|journal = The European Physical Journal B|date = 2008-07-11|issn = 1434-6028|pages = 451–456|volume = 64|issue = 3–4|doi = 10.1140/epjb/e2008-00275-9|first1 = H.|last1 = Chaté|first2 = F.|last2 = Ginelli|first3 = G.|last3 = Grégoire|first4 = F.|last4 = Peruani|first5 = F.|last5 = Raynaud|bibcode = 2008EPJB...64..451C| s2cid=49363896 }}</ref>

Moreover, in real systems, many parameters can be included in order to give a more realistic description, for example attraction and repulsion between agents (finite-size particles), chemotaxis (biological systems), memory, non-identical particles, the surrounding liquid.
