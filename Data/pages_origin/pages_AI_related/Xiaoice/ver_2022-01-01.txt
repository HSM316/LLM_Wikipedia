== Community Feedback ==
[[Bill Gates]] mentioned Xiaoice during his speech at the [[Peking University]]:
:"Some of you may have had conversations with Xiaoice on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]], or seen her weather forecasts on TV, or read her column in the Qianjiang Evening News."
:'"Xiaoice has attracted 45 million followers and is quite skilled at multitasking. And I’ve heard she’s gotten good enough at sensing a user’s emotional state that she can even help with relationship breakups."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Peking-University-Speech|title=My advice for China's students|last=Gates|first=Bill|website=gatesnotes.com|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>


According to Mr Li Di, vice President of Microsoft (Asia) Internet Engineering School, Xiaoice started writing poems since last year. Based on the data base that includes works of 519 Chinese contemporary poets since 1920s, a 100 hour long training session was conducted to allow Xiaoice to acquire the ability to write poems. What is more impressive is that Xiaoice has never been spotted as a bot while publishing poems on various forums and traditional literary under an alias.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.163.com/17/0530/18/CLN18KPI00018AOR.html|title=机器人小冰写的诗到底怎么样？|last=网易|date=2017-05-30|website=news.163.com|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>
