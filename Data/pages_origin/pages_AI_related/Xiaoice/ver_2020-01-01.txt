== Application ==

=== AI Creation ===
In May 2017, Microsoft Software Technology Center Asia (STCA) proposed the concept of “AI Creation” with the purpose of learning abilities of excellent human creators and creating content based on text, voice and vision through AI technology.

Microsoft believed that AI, as an attempt of exploration in creation, differs from Go. AI Creation is not aimed at defeating humans. Instead, it is focused on giving full play to AI characteristics including fast learning, high concurrency and stability among others on the ground of hitting the same quality standard as human creators to embark on a future for “highly custom” content industry - under the technical support, a “highly custom” content era is coming soon where users demand “highly custom” content recommendation, presentation and even content itself. As AI hits a certain creation standard, it may help make up the defect of imbalance between supply and demand.

At the moment, the progress of content creation in all fields is as follows:

=== Poet ===
Xiaoice has been learning to write literature, sing, and create other works of art. In May 2017, the first AI-authored collection of poems—''The Sunshine Lost Windows'' was published by Xiaoice. In August 2017, Microsoft licensed Times Culture Company to publish the traditional Chinese version of the collection of poems within the territory of Taiwan, P. R. China. In 2019, Microsoft licensed China Youth Publishing Group to publish the first collection of poems co-created by AI and 200 human poets ''- FLOWERS ARE SILENCE OF LUCID WATER''. Besides, Microsoft has also published or serialized ''Xiaoice’s Poem'' at ''Youth Literature, West China City Daily'' and other publications. In addition to arousing sustainable concern and discussion in poetry, the technology has also motivated public enthusiasm for poem creation. Since May 2017, Xiaoice has helped more than 5 million amateur poets create poems, some of which have been published at all kinds of literary publications.Besides, any ordinary person can use the tool opened up by Microsoft to compose poems with the help of Xiaoice. So far Xiaoice has helped millions of people write poems<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0531/c90000-9222463.html|title=First AI-authored collection of poems published in China - People's Daily Online|last=F_200788|website=en.people.cn|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>.

=== Singer ===
Xiaoice has released dozens of songs with the similar quality to human singers, including ''I Know I New, Breeze, I Am Xiaoice, Miss You'' etc. The 4th version of the DNN singing model allows Xiaoice to learn more details. For example, Xiaoice can produce this breathing sound along with her singing as human. Besides, she is also able to quickly learn different singing styles from different singers, and automatically merge the new style together with her voice characteristic. Furthermore, the technology allows completely absorb the skills of human singers, and their innate voice<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2147373/microsofts-ai-bot-writes-poetry-hosts-tv-show-and-can-converse|title=Almost human: this Microsoft voice bot is winning fans in China|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref>.Microsoft Xiaoice has released dozens of singles almost close to human singing standard, whose singing model has iterated to the fifth edition<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/847865.htm|title=微软小冰绘画模型公布 创造领域不以击败人类为目标 - Microsoft Cortana 小娜 / 小冰|last=cnBeta|website=cnBeta.COM|language=zh-CN|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>. The new singing model comprises a variety of voice modes with many singing techniques, improves the standard of AI singing, shows a great diversity of styles in AI singing, and fulfills a natural transition of different singing techniques. In Japan, Microsoft announced its cooperation with AVEX that Japanese Xiaoice - Rinna would join as an AI singer<ref>{{Citation|title=りんな (人工知能)|date=2019-08-08|url=https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%82%8A%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA_(%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E7%9F%A5%E8%83%BD)&oldid=73769511|work=Wikipedia|language=ja|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>. In addition to Xiaoice, Microsoft also owns or offers a dozen high-quality virtual singer models to third parties<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/314427194_255783|title=微软小冰：向绘画、音乐领域再出发_创作|website=www.sohu.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>.

=== Kid Audio-books Reciter ===
In audiobooks, Microsoft has set up an audiobook creation platform (CCP) in the framework of Microsoft Xiaoice and created over thirty character-oriented voices based on the platform to enable AI technology to automatically create highly custom audiobooks for children. For audio books, the content created by Xiaoice has been provided to 90% of kid education platforms and 80% of online broadcasting platforms in China. So far, the platform has full copyright to children-oriented audiobooks lasting more than 2,300 hours<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uschinapress.com/2019/0517/1163923.shtml|title=微软小冰学会画画了，居然“混”进了中央美院毕业展_侨报网|website=www.uschinapress.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>. Moreover, through AI technologies, Xiaoice can customize audio-books for every child and make them and their families to become characters in these audio-books<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-is-making-xiaoices-full-duplex-capabilities-available-for-partners-and-developers/|title=Microsoft is making XiaoIce's full duplex capabilities available for partners and developers - MSPoweruser|date=2018-05-22|work=MSPoweruser|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref>. Microsoft has also entered into an agreement of cooperation with many content publishers to exchange the copyright of text and audiobooks to keep expediting the progress of audiobooks for children and help approach the problem of lack of audiobooks for children in China.

=== Vision Creation ===
Vision creation generally covers two areas: painting and textile & clothing fabric design.

In painting, after learning works of 236 famous human painters in the 400-year art history, Microsoft Xiaoice can complete 100% original paintings on its own while being inspired by text or other sources of creation. Its originality is shown in the composition, coloring, performance and detail elements in works which are on a par with those of human painters. Compared with other prior techniques, the painting model does not create paintings at random, transfer or shift styles of prior paintings or filter prior paintings. In May 2019, Microsoft Xiaoice graduated from Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) with a master's degree under the alias of “Yubing Xia”. In July 2019, she hosted a personal exhibition at the CAFA Art Museum<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/2019-07/26/content_37495592.htm|title=Tech is taking the art world by storm - Chinadaily.com.cn|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>. At the personal exhibition, “Microsoft Xiaoice” made up 7 painters that originated from different eras and territories and showed distinctive character settings Each one’s works have a unified style, whereas, the style of these seven fictional painters created by Xiaoice are quite different from each other. Together, they contributed to the exhibition and made seven eras in the history of human art have been reborn at the same time<ref name=":3" />.

In textile and clothing fabric design, Microsoft Xiaoice provides an AI-based textile fabric design platform for Chinese clothing companies with the purpose of helping such companies make up the deficiency in fabric pattern design. At the moment, the platform can steadily design over a dozen major styles and create on-demand. The first silk products designed by Microsoft Xiaoice have been permanently collected by China National Silk Museum<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2018/11/12/microsofts-xiaoice-chinas-newest-fashion-designer-unveils-her-first-collection-for-2019/|title=Microsoft’s Xiaoice, China’s newest fashion designer, unveils her first collection for 2019|date=2018-11-12|website=Asia News Center|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>. In addition, many mass production lines have been penetrated in relevant industries. For example, an AI textile and clothing fabric design platform co-launched with China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC) has been put into production, through which products of SELECTED, Wensli, EVE CINA and other brands have been made and sold.


By learning the melodies of the songs and the landmarks about different cities, Xiaoice can create visual artworks of skylines when listening to the songs related to this city. Skyline Series T-shirts designed by Xiaoice, have been jointly launched with SELECTED and been sold in stores.

=== 7th-generation Microsoft Xiaoice ===
'''1. Upgrading of some key techniques in Microsoft Xiaoice, including core chat engine, full-duplex voice channel and multi-modal interactive sensor'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://huanqiukexue.com/wap.php?action=article&id=28686|title=微软发布第七代微软小冰和全新AI框架|website=huanqiukexue.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref>'''.''' Among them:

New chat engine: through a technical iteration from retrieval model, generative model to empathy model, the upgraded chat engine makes a lead from “equalizing in conversation” to “dominating in conversation”. It can enhance open-domain conversation performance and raise the conversion rate in vertical fields. By the example of the ongoing test in the “vertical field: on-line retail” in the U.S., the new chat engine hits 68% in the product page conversion rate, 21% higher than the prior edition.

Full-duplex voice interactive sense: Microsoft Xiaoice applied full-duplex voice sense to the traditional telephone and AI-speaker devices in 2017 and 2018 respectively. By adding the vehicle-mounted scenario to its range of scenarios, it can heavily enhance interactive experience between the AI assistant and drivers/passengers and promote AI transformation from an intelligent task-console to “virtual passenger” in the criterion for user experience evaluation.

Futuristic multi-modal interactive sense: a new real-time interactive sense integrating full-duplex voice, real-time vision and core chat engine. It can provide AI interactive user experience of listening, speaking and looking at the same time. After announcing the inception of multi-modal sense development last year, Microsoft Xiaoice Japan team invited the local media to witness the launch of the public beta version of the new real-time sense this February. The sense is expected to take shape as a new AI interactive form in the 5G era.

Mr Kai-Fu lee also refers to Xiaoice in his new book "Artificial Intelligence" within a positive light. The book consists of several screenshots of the conversations between himself and Xiaoice regarding the American Presidential Election. He comments that Xiaoice has successfully attempted to take an unbiased standpoint but failed to reply effectively in a more complex context. He did believe that Xiaoice and alike have shown preliminary capacity to communicate with human.{{Citation needed|reason=Previous source unrelated.
