'''Consensus dynamics''' or '''agreement dynamics''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[systems theory]] and [[graph theory]]. A major topic of investigation is the agreement or consensus problem<ref>{{cite book|last=Ren|first=Wei|author2=Beard, R. W. |author3=Atkins, E. M. |title=A survey of consensus problems in multi-agent coordination|journal=2005 American Control Conference|date=8–10 June 2005|pages=1859–64|doi=10.1109/ACC.2005.1470239|isbn=978-0-7803-9098-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.6311}}</ref> in [[multi-agent system]]s that concerns processes by which a collection of interacting agents achieve a common goal. Networks of agents that exchange information to reach consensus include: physiological systems, gene networks, large-scale energy systems and fleets of vehicles on land, in the air or in space. The agreement protocol or consensus protocol is an unforced [[dynamical system]] that is governed by the interconnection topology and the initial condition for each agent. Other problems are the [[rendezvous problem]], [[synchronization]], flocking,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Olfati-Saber|first=R.|title=Flocking for multi-agent dynamic systems: Algorithms and theory|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|volume=51|issue=3|date=13 March 2006|pages=401–20|doi=10.1109/TAC.2005.864190|citeseerx=10.1.1.135.5931}}</ref> formation control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balch|first=T.|author2=Arkin, R.
