In [[artificial intelligence]], [[operations research]], and related fields, a '''Linguistic value''', (for some authors '''Linguistic variable''') is a [[natural language]] term which is derived using quantitative or qualitative reasoning such as with probability and statistics or [[fuzzy sets and systems]].<ref>''Fuzzy Logic for Business and Industry'' Earl Cox, Charles River Media, pp188,214,302,306,352  1995 {{ISBN|1-886801-01-0}}</ref><ref>''The Fuzzy Systems Handbook, Second Edition'' Earl Cox, Academic Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-12-194455-7}} Ch 6 Fuzzy Reasoning, ยง 1 The Role of Linguistic Variables</ref>

==Example of Linguistic Value==

For example, if a shuttle heat shield is deemed of having a linguistic value of a "very low" percentage of damage in re-entry, based upon knowledge from experts in the field, that probability would be given a value of say, 5%.  From there on out, if it were to be used in an equation, the variable of percentage of damage will be at 5% if it deemed very low percentage.
