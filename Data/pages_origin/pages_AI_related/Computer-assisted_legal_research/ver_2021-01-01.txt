Electronic databases make large bodies of case law easily available. Databases also have additional benefits, such as [[Boolean algebra#Boolean operations|Boolean searches]], evaluating case authority, organizing cases by topic, and providing links to cited material. Databases are available through paid subscription or for free.<ref>Kate Marquess, Caught in the Web: Survey Reveals Increasing Use of Internet in Law Practices, but Lawyers Are Making Transition Slowly, A.B.A. J., Dec. 2000, at 76.</ref>

Subscription-based services include [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], [[JustCite]], [[HeinOnline]], [[Bloomberg Law]], [[VLex]]  and [[LexEur]]. As of 2015 the commercial market grossed $8 billion.<ref name=NYT102815>{{cite news|author1=Erik Eckholm|title=Harvard Law Library Readies Trove of Decisions for Digital Age|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/harvard-law-library-sacrifices-a-trove-for-the-sake-of-a-free-database.html|accessdate=October 29, 2015 |work=The New York Times|date=October 28, 2015|quote=a commercial market surpassing $8 billion}}</ref> Free services include [[OpenJurist]], [[Google Scholar]], [[AltLaw]], [[Ravel Law]],<ref name=NYT102815/> [[WIPO Lex]], [[Law Delta]] and the databases of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

==Purposes==
Computer-assisted legal research is undertaken by a variety of actors. It is taught as a topic on many [[law degree]]s<ref>James Holland and Jullian Webb, ''Learning Legal Rules'' (7th edn., Oxford University Press, 2010)</ref> and is used extensively by undergraduate and postgraduate law students in meeting the work requirements of their degree courses. Professors of Law rely on the digitisation of primary and secondary sources of law when conducting their research and writing the material that they submit for publication. Professional lawyers rely on computer-assisted legal research in order to properly understand the status of the law and so to act effectively in the best interest of their client. They may also consult the text of case judgements and statutes specifically, as well as wider academic comment, in order to form the basis of (or response to) an appeal.

The availability of legal information online differs by type, jurisdiction and subject matter. The types of information available include:<ref>See e.g. http://legalresearch.westlaw.co.uk/; http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/en-uk/home.page; http://www.legislation.gov.uk; https://www.jstor.org</ref>

# Texts of statutes, statutory instruments, civil codes, etc.
# Explanatory notes and government publications relating to statutes and their operation
# Texts of governing documents such as constitutions and treaties
# Case judgements
# Journals on legal matters or legal theory
# Dictionaries and legal encyclopaediæ
# Legal texts and materials in the form of e-books
# Current affairs and market information
# Educational information on the law and its operation

==Before the Internet==

Prior to the advent and popularisation of the World Wide Web, access to digital legal information was largely through the use of CD-ROMs, designed and sold by commercial organisations.<ref name="India 2015">The "free access to law movement" in India: supporting legal education, research and practice Priya Rai and Akash Singh (2015) Legal Information Management 178</ref> Dial-up services were also available from the 1970s.<ref>Archived February 28, 2008, at the Wayback Machine</ref> As the use of the Internet spread in the early 1990s, companies such as LexisNexis and Westlaw incorporated Internet connectivity into their software packages. Browser-based legal information started to be published by Legal Information Institutes from 1992.<ref name="law.cornell.edu">LII/Legal Information Institute, Cornell University https://www.law.cornell.edu/</ref>

==Publicly available information==
The first effort to provide free computer access to legal information was made by two academics, Peter Martin and Tom Bruce, in 1992.<ref name="law.cornell.edu"/> Today, the [[Legal Information Institute]] freely publishes such resources as the text of the [[United States Constitution]], judgements of the [[United States Supreme Court]], and the text of the [[United States Code]].

The [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] (AusLII) was established soon after in 1995.<ref>"Electronic Law Journals – JILT 1997 (2) – AustLII's roles". University of Warwick. Retrieved 4 March 2010.</ref> Other legal information institutes, such as those of [[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|Great Britain and Ireland]] (BAILII), [[Canadian Legal Information Institute|Canada]] (CII) and South Africa (SAfLI) soon followed.<ref name="India 2015"/> LIIs were partially formalised in 2002 following the signing of the Declaration of Free Access to the Law, which has been signed by 54 countries.<ref>Sarah Glassmeyer and Pete Smith, 'Open Law: technology in service of the rule of law' (2014) Legal Information Management 181</ref> At the time of writing, the World Legal Information Institute contains in excess of 1800 databases from 123 jurisdictions.<ref>http://www.worldlii.org/ accessed: 16th June 2016</ref>

Many governments also publish legal information online. For example, UK legislation and statutory instruments have been publicly available online since 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk|title=Legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> Depending on the jurisdiction in question, the decisions of higher appellate courts may also be published online, either by the Legal Information Institute or by the court service directly.<ref>See e.g. https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/</ref> Sources of [[European Union Law]] are published for free by [[EUR-Lex]] in 23 languages, including judgements of the European Courts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About EUR-Lex - EUR-Lex|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/welcome/about.html|access-date=2020-06-02|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> Similarly, judgements of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] are published on its website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=caselaw&c=#n14597620384884950241259_pointer|title=Case-law of the ECHR-Judgments and Decisions, Case-law translations}}</ref>
