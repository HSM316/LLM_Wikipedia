'''Spark NLP''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] text processing library for advanced natural language processing for the [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] programming languages.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://insidebigdata.com/2018/09/03/use-nlp-extract-unstructured-medical-data-text/|title=The Use of NLP to Extract Unstructured Medical Data From Text|last=Team|first=Editorial|date=2018-09-04|website=insideBIGDATA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://startupbeat.com/john-snow-labs-natural-language-understanding-software-gets-state-of-the-art-recognition-in-three-industry-events/30699/|title=John Snow Labs' Natural Language Understanding Software Gets "State of the Art" Recognition in Three Industry Events|date=2018-07-19|website=StartUp Beat|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/comparing-production-grade-nlp-libraries-running-spark-nlp-and-spacy-pipelines|title=Comparing production-grade NLP libraries: Running Spark-NLP and spaCy pipelines|last=Ellafi|first=Saif Addin|date=2018-02-28|website=O'Reilly Media|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/comparing-production-grade-nlp-libraries-accuracy-performance-and-scalability|title=Comparing production-grade NLP libraries: Accuracy, performance, and scalability|last=Ellafi|first=Saif Addin|date=2018-02-28|website=O'Reilly Media|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.i-programmer.info/news/80-java/11251-spark-gets-nlp-library.html|title=Spark Gets NLP Library|last=Ewbank|first=Kay|website=www.i-programmer.info}}</ref> The library is built on top of [[Apache Spark]] and its Spark ML library for speed and scalability <ref name=":1" /> and on top of [[TensorFlow]] for deep learning training & inference functionality. Its goal is to provide an [[API]] for [[natural language processing]] annotations allowing a scalable approach within a distributed large scale environment. The library offers pre-trained neural network models, pipelines, and embeddings <ref name=":0" />, as well as support for training custom models.

'''Spark NLP''' is geared towards production use in software systems that outgrow older libraries such as [[spaCy]], [[Natural Language Toolkit|nltk]], and CoreNLP <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://startupbeat.com/john-snow-labs-natural-language-understanding-software-gets-state-of-the-art-recognition-in-three-industry-events/30699/|title=John Snow Labs' Natural Language Understanding Software Gets "State of the Art" Recognition in Three Industry Events|date=2018-07-19|website=StartUp Beat|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>. As of February 2019, the library is in use by 16% of enterprise companies and the most widely used NLP library by such companies <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nick|first=Heath|date=February 2019|title=Most popular programming language frameworks and tools for machine learning|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/most-popular-programming-language-frameworks-and-tools-for-machine-learning/|journal=TechRepublic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/5-reasons-why-spark-nlp-is-the-most-widely-used-library-in-enterprises/|title=5 Reasons Why Spark NLP Is The Most Widely Used Library In Enterprises|last=CHOUDHURY|first=Ambika|date=May 29, 2019|work=Analytics India|access-date=}}</ref>. On March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2019, Spark NLP was named a winner of the Strata Data Award in the open source category “for providing state-of-the-art natural language processing in Python, Java & Scala” <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb4YCb6gnyw&feature=youtu.be|title=Strata Data Awards: Winners Announced|last=|first=|date=May 22, 2019|work=O'Reilly|access-date=}}</ref>.

== Main features ==

The library’s design uses the concept of a pipeline: an ordered set of text annotators <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/19/introducing-natural-language-processing-library-apache-spark.html|title=Introducing the Natural Language Processing Library for Apache Spark - The Databricks Blog|last=Talby|first=David|date=2017-10-19|website=Databricks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>. Out of the box annotators include:

* [[Tokenizer]]: Word tokens
* Normalizer: Text cleaning
*[[Stemming|Stemmer]]: Hard stems
* [[Lemmatizer]]: Lemmas
* [[Regular expression|RegexMatcher]]: Rule matching
* TextMatcher: Phrase matching
* Chunker: Meaningful phrase matching
* DateMatcher: Date-time parsing
* SentenceDetector: Sentence Boundary Detector
* DeepSentenceDetector: Sentence Boundary Detector with Machine Learning
* [[POS tagger|POSTagger]]: Part of speech tagger
* ViveknSentimentDetector: Sentiment analysis
* [[Sentiment analysis|SentimentDetector]]: Sentiment analysis
* [[Named-entity recognition|Named Entity Recognition]] CRF annotator
* [[Named-entity recognition|Named Entity Recognition]] Deep Learning annotator
* [[Spell checker|SpellChecker]]: Norvig algorithm
* [[Spell checker|SpellChecker]]: Symmetric delete
* Dependency Parser: Unlabeled grammatical relation
* Typed Dependency Parser: Labeled grammatical relation

== Spark NLP for Healthcare ==
Spark NLP for Healthcare is a commercial extension of '''Spark NLP''' for biomedical text mining <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidebigdata.com/2018/09/03/use-nlp-extract-unstructured-medical-data-text/|title=The Use of NLP to Extract Unstructured Medical Data From Text|last=Team|first=Editorial|date=2018-09-04|website=insideBIGDATA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>. It provides healthcare-specific annotators, pipelines, models, and embeddings for:

* Biomedical named entity recognition
* Entity normalization
* Assertion Status Detection
* De-identification
* Part-of-Speech tagging
* Spell checking & correction
* Object character recognition (OCR)
