'''Data culture''' is the principle established in the process of social practice in both [[Public sector|public]] and [[Private sector]]s which requires all staffs and decision-makers to focus on the information conveyed by the existing data, and make decisions and changes according to these results instead of leading the development of the company based on experience in the particular field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/how-to-create-a-data-culture-codex1408.pdf|title=How to Create a Data Culture|last=Ramaswamy|first=Poornima|date=June 2015|website=Cognizant|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref> 

These data might include but are not limited to: general [[Economic system|economical]] or [[Social Trends]] in the market, sales volume of products, or even performance of staffs pointing to their [[efficiency]] and [[productivity]]. Despite the business field,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Powers|first1=Kristina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elldDwAAQBAJ&q=Data+culture&pg=PT15|title=Cultivating a Data Culture in Higher Education|last2=Henderson|first2=Angela E.|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-69451-3|language=en}}</ref> data culture is also applied in the social infrastructure system, such as [[Urban planning]] projects, to impact the process of data production and data practices of daily usage, such as [[Smart City]] programs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Data and the city|others=Kitchin, Rob,, Lauriault, Tracey P.,, McArdle, Gavin|isbn=978-1138222632|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=992119756|last1 = Kitchin|first1 = Rob|last2=Lauriault|first2=Tracey P.|last3=McArdle|first3=Gavin|date=8 May 2017}}</ref>

In general, to build data culture, the departments and organizations have to let the data talk itself, and trust the steering of statistics. Being successful as a data-driven entity requires the active participation of all staffs involved in an organization, therefore open access to data is significant in the process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/five-building-blocks-of-a-data-driven-culture/|title=Five building blocks of a data-driven&nbsp;culture|last=Anderson|first=Carl|work=TechCrunch|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The idea of data culture has been under the spotlight of business field since the beginning of the 21st century, and is gaining popularity in recent years. Although first introduced in a scientific approach, the idea is now associated with both the science field and social sectors.
* In 2000, [[Geoffrey C. Bowker]] conveyed the idea of "local data culture" in his academic paper in terms of [[biodiversity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Download Limit Exceeded|journal = Social Studies of Science|volume = 30|issue = 5|pages = 643–683|citeseerx = 10.1.1.26.6449|year = 2001|last1 = Bowker|first1 = Geoffrey|doi = 10.1177/030631200030005001|s2cid = 220879983}}</ref>
* In 2014, [[Microsoft]] made a series of announcements including their intention to build data culture into everyday life through their services including [[Office 365]], [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/a-data-culture-for-everyone/|title=A data culture for everyone – The Official Microsoft Blog|date=15 April 2014|work=The Official Microsoft Blog|access-date=16 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>
* In 2015, Microsoft organized a series of workshops about data culture in alliance with [[Hortonworks]] and [[KPMG]] UK, offering data analysts and other professional working in the field of [[Big data]] an opportunity to understand the data culture of the company and help them build their own data culture in private sectors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2015/02/18/microsoft-data-culture-series-for-developers-data-architects-data-scientists-database-administrators-events-in-edinburgh-leeds-birmingham-reading-and-london/|title=Microsoft Data Culture series for Developers, Data Architects, Data Scientists, Database Administrators events in Edinburgh, Leeds, Birmingham, Reading and London|work=Microsoft UK Faculty Connection|access-date=9 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>
* The Data Power Conference 2017 was held in Canada at [[Carleton University]], Ottawa, 22–23 June 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/datapower/|title=Data Power 2017 – Carleton University|website=carleton.ca|language=en-US|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

== Components and roles ==
=== Participants ===
Participants are both producers of data and people who can contribute to the data culture by making influential changes. In the building process of data culture in a particular entity, employees at different levels are all supposed to obtain the ability of illustrating their works with relative statistics. This includes but is not limited to the goal of their job, the purpose of a specific task, and solutions they could bring up according to problems pointed out by data. Also, participants are allowed to make decisions within the section they take charge of, and experience changes happened due to their innovations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Winning with data : transform your culture, empower your people, and shape the future|last=Tunguz|first=Tomasz|others=Bien, Frank, 1967–|isbn=9781119257394|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|oclc=951028197|date = 26 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Data scientists ===

Also, they are responsible for the analysis of information conveyed by the data. Having data scientists in each specific section of a company would be an ideal situation for a data-driven entity, therefore guaranteeing data access whenever needed.<ref name=":1" />

=== Decision-makers ===
Decision-makers are those who apply changes and determine the direction of development in a company. In this case, they would make important decisions according to the trends and information highlighted by the data produced either in their own companies internally or statistics of the [[target market]] they want their corporations to aim at. Also, to build a data culture, decision makers have to emphasize their intention of requiring data analyses, therefore driving the motivation of staffs to deal with raw materials.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Torbeck|first=Lynn|date=Autumn 2011|title=Data culture|url=http://link.galegroup.com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/apps/doc/A277000766/AONE?u=ocul_carleton&sid=AONE&xid=d5de2d5d.|journal=Journal of Validation Technology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=12+|via=Academic OneFile}}</ref>

The goal is to help controlling employees or board member to use the existing data more effective and efficient. The necessary tools are based on the business needs and not the other way around.

== Counter opinions ==
=== Data privacy ===
Some companies feel that it is important to keep the data private at the executive level. Although it is possible for all staff in a company to produce and process the data together, it is restricted for data to be free from the approach of participants at the elementary level. Some companies use the idea of [[Data warehouse]], a system that limits access to data. Only people in charge could access the data, and other people requiring access need to go through the assessment of warehouse staff.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Data driven : creating a data culture|first=DJ|last=Patil|last2=Mason|first2=Hilary|isbn=9781491921197|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=904285472|year = 2015}}</ref>

=== Efficiency ===
As long as data bureaucracy is convenient for open access to [[Database]]s, the large number of users might slow down the speed of processing in a particular system. Also, it might be difficult for users to search for what they want if the data bureaucracy system is not facilitated with proper tools. In this case, Data Warehouse would be more efficient for users who are not able to perform professionally when they seek for data.<ref name=":1" />

=== Rationalism ===
A rational method of building or expanding an enterprise is an opposite approach to an [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] one. The decisions of [[Rationalism|rationalists]] are often evaluated according to their personal spirit and their existing cognition of the world. In terms of this approach, decision-makers depend on logic rather than [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] and phenomena appearing at the front line of an industry to make changes. The fact that decision-making process is not limited to the executive team anymore lead to the hesitation of some people on the [[Management levels|management level]], therefore they refuse to develop data culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The culture of big data|first=Mike|last=Barlow|date=2013|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=9781491946725|location=Sebastopol, Calif.|oclc=867854355}}</ref>
