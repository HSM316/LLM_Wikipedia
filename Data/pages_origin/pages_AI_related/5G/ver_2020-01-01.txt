'''5G''' is the fifth generation wireless technology for [[Digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s that has begun wide deployment in 2019. Like previous standards the covered areas are divided into regions called cells, serviced by individual antennas. Virtually every major telecommunication service provider in the developed world is deploying antennas or intends to deploy them soon. The [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]].

5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1-2 gigabit. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above [[Extremely high frequency]]'s lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.

5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 20 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100-400 megabits. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Sprint and China Mobile are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz, a range which offers increased reach. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.

5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. T-Mobile and AT&T launched low-band services on the first week of December, 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on his 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov › file|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be much higher than good 4G in the same spectrum.

Verizon, AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25-35 milliseconds. The "air latency" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8-12 ms. The latency to the server, further back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25%-40% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding "Edge Servers" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10-20 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.

The industry association [[3GPP]] defines any system using "[[5G NR]]" (5G New Radio) software as, "5G", a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term for systems that deliver speeds of 20&nbsp;GHz shared called for by [[ITU]] [[IMT-2020]]. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|title=Preparing the ground for IMT-2020|publisher=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414233657/https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|archive-date=April 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] to critical communications.

==Overview==
5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''.  [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically "[[Handover|handed off]]" seamlessly to the new cell.

Verizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335–349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

In a technique called, ''[[beamforming]]'', the base station computer will continuously calculate the best route for radio waves to reach each wireless device, and will organize multiple antennas to work together as [[phased array]]s to create beams of millimeter waves to reach the device.<ref name="Nordrum" /><ref name="Hoffman">{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|title=What is 5G, and how fast will it be?|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|date=7 January 2019|work=How-To Geek website|publisher=How-To Geek LLC|format=|doi=|accessdate=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124041504/https://www.howtogeek.com/340002/what-is-5g-and-how-fast-will-it-be/|archive-date=January 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over 20 networks are deployed using mid-band spectrum, from 2.4 to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.

The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, created and revised by the 3GPP. The family is a full revision from GSM in terms of encoding methods and hardware, although some GSM sites can be retrofitted to broadcast in the UMTS/W-CDMA format. 

T-Mobile USA and AT&T are announcing low-band 5G in December 2019. The performance, reach, and cost will be similar to 4G in the same band when the 5G systems are fully developed and can access more carrier frequencies.

The new 5G wireless devices also have [[4G]] LTE capability, as the new networks use 4G for initially establishing the connection with the cell, as well as in locations where 5G access is not available.<ref name="Segan">{{cite web

===Usage scenario===
The [[ITU-R]] has defined three main uses for 5G. They are Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|title=5G—It's Not Here Yet, But Closer Than You Think|date=31 October 2017|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204238/https://www.electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Only eMBB is deployed in 2019; URLLC and mMTC is several years away in most locations.

Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) uses 5G as a progression from 4G LTE [[mobile broadband]] services, with faster connections, higher throughput, and more capacity

Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) refer to using the network for [[mission critical]] applications that requires uninterrupted and robust data exchange.

Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) would be used to connect to a large number of [[LPWAN|low power, low cost devices, which have high scalability and increased battery lifetime, in a wide area]]. 5G technology will connect some of the 50 billion connected IoT devices.<ref name="newsroom.intel.com">{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|title=Intel Accelerates the Future with World's First Global 5G Modem|website=Intel Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906234205/https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|archive-date=September 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Most will use the less expensive Wi-Fi.

== Performance ==
=== Speed ===
5G speeds will range from ~50 Mbit/s to over a gigabit. Mid-band 5G, by far the most common, will usually deliver between 100 & 400 Mbit/s. Low-band will be slower.

5G NR speed in sub-6&nbsp;GHz bands can be slightly higher than the 4G with a similar amount of spectrum and antennas,<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/10-r/1025-no-material-difference-between-5g-lte|title=No 'Material Difference Between 5G & LTE'|last=Dave|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2018-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620231953/http://wirelessone.news/10-r/1025-no-material-difference-between-5g-lte|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/10-r/1036-5g-nr-only-25-to-50-faster-not-truly-a-new-generation|title=5G NR Only 25% to 50% Faster, Not Truly a New Generation|last=Dave|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2018-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620231902/http://wirelessone.news/10-r/1036-5g-nr-only-25-to-50-faster-not-truly-a-new-generation|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> although some 3GPP 5G networks will be slower than some advanced [[4G|4G networks]], such as T-Mobile's [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]/LAA network, which achieves 500+ Mbit/s in [[Manhattan]]<ref name="PCMAG" /> and Chicago.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=https://smartmobtech.com/news/testing-the-first-ever-5g-network-phone-in-usa/|title=Testing the first ever 5G network phone in USA|website=smartmobtech.com|access-date=2019-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703080655/https://smartmobtech.com/news/testing-the-first-ever-5g-network-phone-in-usa/|archive-date=July 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The 5G specification allows LAA (License Assisted Access) as well, but LAA in 5G has not yet been demonstrated.

The similarity in terms of throughput between 4G and 5G in the existing bands is because 4G already approaches the [[Shannon limit]] on data communication rates. 5G speeds in the less common [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wave]] spectrum, with its much more abundant bandwidth and shorter range, and hence greater frequency reuseability, can be substantially higher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2017/05/17/taking-a-fresh-look-at-5g-technology-enablers/|title=Taking a fresh look at 5G – Technology enablers I|last=Saracco|first=Roberto|website=IEEE Future Directions|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105164116/https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2017/05/17/taking-a-fresh-look-at-5g-technology-enablers/|archive-date=November 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[IEEE]] covers several areas of 5G with a core focus in wireline sections between the Remote Radio Head (RRH) and Base Band Unit (BBU). The 1914.1 standards focus on network architecture and dividing the connection between the RRU and BBU into two key sections. Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized. This is based on the [[3GPP]] definition of functional splits. Multiple network synchronization standards within the IEEE groups are being updated to ensure network timing accuracy at the RU is maintained to a level required for the traffic carried over it.

Beyond mobile operator networks, 5G is also expected to be widely used for private networks with applications in industrial IoT, enterprise networking, and critical communications.

Initial 5G NR launches will depend on existing LTE (4G) infrastructure in [[5G NR#Non-Standalone Mode|non-standalone (NSA) mode]] (5G NR software on LTE radio hardware), before maturation of the [[5G NR#Standalone Mode|standalone (SA) mode]] (5G NR software on 5G NR radio hardware) with the 5G core network.

As of April 2019, the [[Global Mobile Suppliers Association]] had identified 224 operators in 88 countries that are actively investing in 5G (i.e. that have demonstrated, are testing or trialling, or have been licensed to conduct field trials of 5G technologies, are deploying 5G networks or have announced service launches).<ref>[https://gsacom.com/paper/lte-5g-market-statistics-8-april-2019/?utm=reports4g GSA: LTE and 5G Market Statistics, 8 April 2019] (retrieved 24 April 2019)</ref> The equivalent numbers in November 2018 were 192 operators in 81 countries.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ 5G Investments: Trials, Deployments, Launches – Updated March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402105309/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (retrieved 2nd March 2019)</ref> The first country to adopt 5G on a large scale was South Korea, in April 2019.

As of March 2019, there are reportedly 52 countries, territories, special administrative regions, disputed territories and dependencies that are formally considering introducing certain spectrum bands for terrestrial 5G services, are holding consultations regarding suitable spectrum allocations for 5G, have reserved spectrum for 5G, have announced plans to [[Spectrum auction|auction frequencies]] or have already allocated spectrum for 5G use.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-spectrum-licensing-mar-2029/ Spectrum for Terrestrial 5G Networks: Licensing Developments Worldwide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402093330/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-spectrum-licensing-mar-2029/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (March 2019)</ref>

===Unlicensed spectrum===
MNOs are increasingly using unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 and 5 Gigahertz (GHz) frequency bands. 5G networks will need to tap into the vast amount of spectrum available in these unlicensed bands to offload traffic in heavily congested areas and provide connectivity for billions of IoT devices. Advancements in Wi-Fi, LTE in Unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U), License Assisted Access (LAA), and MulteFire, among others, provide better quality and regulated access to unlicensed spectrum.

In June 2019, "Huawei signed a deal with Russia's largest telecoms operator MTS to develop 5G technologies and launch a fifth-generation network in Russia within the next year."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/huawei-russia-china-splinternet-intl/index.html|title=Huawei is building 5G in Russia and China. We may be seeing the start of the internet break up|first=James|last=Griffiths|department=Analysis|publisher=CNN|access-date=July 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701074258/https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/business/huawei-russia-china-splinternet-intl/index.html|archive-date=July 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2019, Moscow announced the opening of 5G demo centres for testing new technologies and city services. The demo centres provide access to 5G networks for Russian and foreign companies via 5G laboratories operating on the principle of vendor neutrality, which means openness to business, information security and respect for patent law.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Agreements on launching a 5G network have been signed with Russia's main telecom operators. The operators will deploy segments of permanently operating 5G zones, test new functionalities of the 5th generation network, and interact with each other.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Each of the 4 operators will have its own pilot zone: at the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, Skolkovo, Sparrow Hills and Tverskaya Street. At the same time, the operators will work with the regulator independently on frequency bids and permits.

In 2018, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin and Sergei Soldatenkov, CEO of MegaFon, Russia's second largest mobile phone operator, have signed a cooperation agreement aimed at developing communication services and information and telecommunications technologies in Moscow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Beeline has also signed a five-year renewable agreement with the Moscow authorities under which it will deploy a pilot 5G network in the capital next year alongside NB-IoT, Smart City and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) solutions.

Ericsson has been selected by Tele2 Russia to upgrade its network with the 5G-ready Ericsson Radio System including software, as part of a five-year network modernisation deal to enable higher speeds and capacity and prepare for the 5G launch.

Tele2 Russia has also entered into a partnership agreement with Huawei, involving strategic cooperation in the development of a 5G-oriented transport and core network, including testing of ultra-wideband communication networks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

At the Mobile World Congress, Ericsson signed a 5G “roadmap agreement” with MTS. The agreement outlines the rollout of 5G networks for the operator in the 2019–2022 timeframe.

The commercial launch of 5G is one of Moscow's priority projects. The first pilot zones will be small areas in key locations across Moscow. These areas fall into two main categories: crowded places (parks and central streets), where more consumer tech 5G tests and demonstrations will be held; and innovation centres and technoparks, where technology companies will be able to test industrial 5G. The project is being implemented in cooperation with Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and IBM.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

During the 2018 World Cup, MegaFon used Nokia 5G equipment to demonstrate VR Broadcast technology for indoor coverage at a venue for media representatives and football fans. Fifty people used VR glasses to watch the VR broadcast, with 20 VR glasses being used simultaneously at speeds of up to 35 Mbit/s per device.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== New radio frequencies ===
{{See also|5G NR frequency bands}}
The air interface defined by 3GPP for 5G is known as New Radio (NR), and the specification is subdivided into two frequency bands, FR1 (below 6&nbsp;GHz) and FR2 (mmWave),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_FR_Bandwidth.html|title=5G &#124; ShareTechnote|website=sharetechnote.com|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204926/http://sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_FR_Bandwidth.html|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> each with different capabilities.

==== Frequency range 1 (< 6 GHz) ====
The maximum channel bandwidth defined for FR1 is 100&nbsp;MHz, due to the scarcity of continuous spectrum in this crowded frequency range. The band most widely being used for 5G in this range is around 3.5&nbsp;GHz. The Korean carriers are using 3.5&nbsp;GHz although some millimeter wave spectrum has also been allocated.

==== Frequency range 2 (> 24 GHz) ====
The minimum channel bandwidth defined for FR2 is 50&nbsp;MHz and the maximum is 400&nbsp;MHz, with two-channel aggregation supported in 3GPP Release 15. In the U.S., Verizon is using 28&nbsp;GHz and AT&T is using 39&nbsp;GHz. 5G can use frequencies of up to 300&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322|title=5G vs 4G: Everything You Need to Know|author=Tim Fisher|website=Lifewire|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421230135/https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The higher the frequency, the greater the ability to support high data transfer speeds without interfering with other wireless signals or becoming overly cluttered. Due to this, 5G can support approximately 1,000 more devices per meter than 4G.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-shift-from-4g-to-5g-will-change-just-about-everything/|title=The Shift From 4G to 5G Will Change Just About Everything|website=adweek.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421230136/https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-shift-from-4g-to-5g-will-change-just-about-everything/|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===== FR2 coverage =====
5G in the 24&nbsp;GHz range or above use higher frequencies than 4G, and as a result, some 5G signals are not capable of traveling large distances (over a few hundred meters), unlike 4G or lower frequency 5G signals (sub 6&nbsp;GHz). This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Massive MIMO ===
{{See also|Multi-user MIMO}}
Massive MIMO (multiple input and multiple output) [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] increases sector throughput and capacity density using large numbers of antennas and [[Multi-user MIMO]] (MU-MIMO). Each antenna is individually-controlled and may embed radio transceiver components. Nokia claimed a five-fold increase in the capacity increase for a 64-Tx/64-Rx antenna system. The term "massive MIMO" was coined by Nokia Bell Labs researcher Dr. Thomas L. Marzetta in 2010, and has been launched in [[4G]] networks, such as [[Softbank]] in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|title=ZTE, SoftBank achieve 956 Mbps in Massive MIMO test|website=FierceWireless|language=en|access-date=2019-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421014202/https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/zte-softbank-achieve-956-mbps-massive-mimo-test|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Of more than 562 separate 5G demonstrations, tests or trials globally of 5G technologies, at least 94 of them have involved testing Massive MIMO in the context of 5G.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ 5G Investments: Trials, Deployments, Launches – Updated March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402105309/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (retrieved 2 March 2019)</ref>

=== Edge computing ===
{{main|Mobile edge computing}}
[[Edge computing]] is delivered by cloud computing servers closer to the ultimate user. It reduces latency and data traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.pcmag.com/feature/51666/it-needs-to-start-thinking-about-5g-and-edge-cloud-computing|title=IT Needs to Start Thinking About 5G and Edge Cloud Computing|date=7 February 2018|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142041/http://au.pcmag.com/feature/51666/it-needs-to-start-thinking-about-5g-and-edge-cloud-computing|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sdn.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2016/mobile-edge-computing-an-important-ingredient-of-5g-networks|title=Mobile Edge Computing – An Important Ingredient of 5G Networks|date=March 2016|publisher=IEEE Softwarization|access-date=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231318/https://sdn.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2016/mobile-edge-computing-an-important-ingredient-of-5g-networks|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Small cell ===
{{main|Small cell}}
Small cells are low-powered cellular radio access nodes that operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum that have a range of 10 meters to a few kilometers. Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.

=== Beamforming ===
{{main|Beamforming}}
Beamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[Phased array]] antennas.

=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===
One expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s<nowiki/> can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===
{{main|NOMA (5G)}}
NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.

=== SDN/NFV ===
{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}
Initially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access. Today a new era of innovative tools and technologies is inclined towards developing a new pool of applications. This pool of applications consists of different domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), web of connected autonomous vehicles, remotely controlled robots, and heterogeneous sensors connected to serve versatile applications.<ref name="Software Defined Network for 5G">{{cite web|url=https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|title=WS-21: SDN5GSC – Software Defined Networking for 5G Architecture in Smart Communities|date=17 May 2018|website=IEEE Global Communications Conference|access-date=March 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002935/https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|archive-date=March 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In this context, [[5G network slicing|network slicing]] has emerged as a key technology to efficiently embrace this new market model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ordonez-Lucena|first=J.|last2=Ameigeiras|first2=P.|last3=Lopez|first3=D.|last4=Ramos-Munoz|first4=J.

=== Channel coding ===
The [[Forward error correction|channel coding]] techniques for 5G NR have changed from [[Turbo code]]s in 4G to [[Polar code (coding theory)|polar codes]] for the control channels and [[Low-density parity-check code|LDPC]] (low-density parity check codes) for the data channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|title=5G Channel Coding|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206003124/https://www.accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|archive-date=December 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|title=A Vision for 5G Channel Coding|last=Maunder|first=Robert|date=September 2016|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206003124/https://www.accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|archive-date=December 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Operation in unlicensed spectrum ===
Like [[LTE in unlicensed spectrum]], 5G NR will also support operation in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U).<ref name="QualcommNRU">{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/12/13/3gpp-commits-5g-nr-unlicensed-spectrum-its-next-release|title=5G NR 3GPP &#124; 5G NR Qualcomm|date=December 12, 2018|website=Qualcomm|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422063743/https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/12/13/3gpp-commits-5g-nr-unlicensed-spectrum-its-next-release|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA) from LTE that enable carriers to use those unlicensed spectrum to boost their operational performance for users, in 5G NR it will support standalone NR-U unlicensed operation that will allow new 5G NR networks to be established in different environments without acquiring operational license in licensed spectrum, for instance for localized private network or lower the entry barrier for providing 5G internet services to the public.<ref name="QualcommNRU" />

In 2019, the United States via its [[FBI]], the British [[GCHQ]], other intelligence agencies, and criminal prosecuting organizations, is heavily involved in adjusting surveillance standards. The 5G security architecture is being adjusted so as much metadata as possible is collected for [[mass surveillance]] purposes. This happens via the 3SALI meetings of the [[3GPP]] standardization organization.<ref>[https://fm4.orf.at/stories/2989759/ FBI greift massiv in 5G-Überwachungsstandards ein] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811210436/https://fm4.orf.at/stories/2989759/ |date=August 11, 2019 }}, orf.at, 2019-08-11.</ref>

Dr. Paul Ben-Ishai, a member of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s Physics department, found that human skin is extremely conductive of 5G's EMF radiation. A study on his research by Arjun Alia for Collective Evolution described the sweat ducts as "a number of helical antennas when exposed to these wavelengths that are put out by the devices that employ 5G technology." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/09/26/emf-frequencies-used-for-crowd-control-weapons-form-the-foundation-of-5g-wireless-network/|title=EMF Frequencies Used For Crowd Control Weapons Form The Foundation of 5G Network|last=Walia|first=Arjun|website=collective-evolution.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022214654/https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/09/26/emf-frequencies-used-for-crowd-control-weapons-form-the-foundation-of-5g-wireless-network/|archive-date=October 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Health concerns related to radiation from cell telephone towers and cell telephones are not new. Although [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] is not scientifically recognized, diffuse symptoms such as headache and tiredness have been claimed to result from exposure to electromagnetic fields such as those that carry 5G and Wi-Fi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Electromagnetic fields and public health|website=WHO|access-date=2019-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522000241/https://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/|archive-date=May 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, 5G technology presents a couple of new issues that depart from 4G technology, namely, higher microwave frequencies from 2.6&nbsp;GHz to 28&nbsp;GHz, compared to 700–2500&nbsp;MHz typically used by 4G. Because the higher millimeter wave used in 5G does not penetrate objects easily, this requires the installation of antennas every few hundred meters, which has sparked concern among the public.<ref name=":1" />

In 2018, Dr. Martin Pall, Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Basic Medical Sciences at [[Washington State University]] believes "Putting in tens of millions of 5G antennae without a single biological test of  safety has got to be about the stupidest idea anyone has had in the history of the world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emfacts.com/2018/08/martin-palls-book-on-5g-is-available-online/|title=Martin Pall's book on 5G is available online|date=2018-08-20|website=EMFacts Consultancy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112062313/https://www.emfacts.com/2018/08/martin-palls-book-on-5g-is-available-online/|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He cites the increased number of [[Phased array]]<nowiki/>s, the high energy pulses which can easily penetrate the human body, and the bulk of antennae required to operate the network as potential causes for concern.

=== Marketing of non-5G services ===
{{main|5G Evolution|LTE Advanced Pro|LTE Advanced}}
In various parts of the world, carriers have launched numerous differently branded technologies, such as "[[5G Evolution]]", which advertise improving existing networks with the use of "5G technology".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnet.com/news/at-t-brings-5g-evolution-not-real-5g-to-117-more-markets/|title=AT&T brings higher speeds with pre-5G tech to 117 cities|date=19 April 2018|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204643/https://www.cnet.com/news/at-t-brings-5g-evolution-not-real-5g-to-117-more-markets/|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, these pre-5G networks are an improvement on specifications of existing LTE networks that are not exclusive to 5G. While the technology promises to deliver faster speeds, and is described by AT&T as a "foundation for our evolution to 5G while the 5G standards are being finalized," it cannot be considered to be true 5G. When AT&T announced 5G Evolution, 4x4 MIMO, the technology that AT&T is using to deliver the faster speeds, had already been put in place by T-Mobile without being branded with the 5G moniker. It is claimed that such branding is a marketing move that will cause confusion with consumers, as it is not made clear that such improvements are not true 5G.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theverge.com/2017/4/25/15425414/att-5g-evolution-network-lte-advanced-misleading-marketing|title=AT&T announces it will build a fake 5G network|date=2017-04-25|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121215106/https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15425414/att-5g-evolution-network-lte-advanced-misleading-marketing|archive-date=November 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
