In [[telecommunications]], '''5G''' is the fifth generation technology standard for [[broadband]] [[cellular network]]s, which [[mobile network operator|cellular phone companies]] began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the [[4G]] networks which provide connectivity to most current [[cellphone]]s.<ref name="Looper">{{cite web

All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the [[Internet]] and [[telephone network]] by [[radio wave]]s through a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] in the cell.   The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], giving higher [[download speed]]s,<ref name="Looper" /> eventually up to 10&nbsp;[[gigabits per second]] (Gbit/s).<ref name="Hoffman" />  Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will not exclusively serve cellphones like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general [[internet service provider]]s for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as [[cable internet]], and also will make possible new applications in [[internet of things]] (IoT) and [[machine to machine]] areas.  4G cellphones are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G enabled wireless devices.

The increased speed is achieved partly by using higher-frequency radio waves than previous cellular networks.<ref name="Looper" />  However, higher-frequency radio waves have a shorter useful physical range, requiring smaller geographic cells.  For wide service, 5G networks operate on up to three frequency bands &mdash; low, medium, and high.<ref name="Horwitz" /><ref name="Looper" />  A 5G network will be composed of networks of up to three different types of cells, each requiring specific antenna designs, each providing a different tradeoff of download speed vs. distance and service area.  5G cellphones and wireless devices connect to the network through the highest speed antenna within range at their location:

Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to 4G cellphones, 600-850&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], giving download speeds a little higher than 4G: 30-250&nbsp;[[megabits per second]] (Mbit/s).<ref name="Horwitz">{{cite web

Mid-band 5G uses [[microwaves]] of 2.5-3.7&nbsp;[[gigahertz|GHz]], allowing speeds of 100-900&nbsp;Mbit/s, with each cell tower providing service up to several miles in radius.  This level of service is the most widely deployed, and should be available in most metropolitan areas in 2020. Some regions are not implementing low-band, making this the minimum service level.  High-band 5G uses frequencies of 25–39&nbsp;GHz, near the bottom of the millimeter wave band, although higher frequencies may be used in the future. It often achieves download speeds in the&nbsp;[[gigabits per second|gigabit per second]] (Gbit/s) range, comparable to cable internet.  However, [[millimeter wave]]s (mmWave or mmW) have a more limited range, requiring many small cells.<ref name="Nokia">{{cite web | last = Davies | first = Darrell | title = Small Cells – Big in 5G | publisher = Nokia | date = May 20, 2019 | url = https://www.nokia.com/blog/small-cells-big-5g/ | access-date = August 29, 2020}}</ref> They have trouble passing through some types of materials such as walls and windows.  Due to their higher cost, plans are to deploy these cells only in dense urban environments and areas where crowds of people congregate such as sports stadiums and convention centers.  The above speeds are those achieved in actual tests in 2020, and speeds are expected to increase during rollout.<ref name="Horwitz" />

The industry consortium setting standards for 5G is the [[3rd Generation Partnership Project]] (3GPP).<ref name="Looper" />  It defines any system using [[5G NR]] (5G New Radio) software as "5G", a definition that came into general use by late 2018.  Minimum standards are set by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU).   Previously, some reserved the term 5G for systems that deliver download speeds of 20 Gbit/s as specified in the ITU's [[IMT-2020]] document.

==Overview==

5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically "[[Handover|handed off]]" seamlessly to the new cell. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, while 4G supports only up to 100,000 devices per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|title=Eight Reasons Why 5G Is Better Than 4G|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Altran]]|author=Shatrughan Singh|access-date=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525070540/https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|archive-date=May 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/clx-forum/1-million-iot-devices-per-square-km-are-we-ready-for-the-5g-transformation-5d2ba416a984|title=1 Million IoT Devices per Square Km – Are We Ready for the 5G Transformation?|first=C.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long.

Massive [[MIMO]] (multiple-input multiple-output) was deployed in 4G as early as 2016 and typically used 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. In the right frequencies and configuration, it can increase performance from 4 to 10 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/9-mimo/687-china-mobile-softbank-ordering-1-000-s-of-massive-mimo-bases-2|title="I am crazy about Massive MIMO," Kitihara of Softbank ordering 1,000's of Massive MIMO bases|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> Multiple [[bitstream]]s of data are transmitted simultaneously.

===Application areas===
The [[ITU-R]] has defined three main application areas for the enhanced capabilities of 5G. They are Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|title=5G – It's Not Here Yet, But Closer Than You Think|date=October 31, 2017|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204238/https://www.electronicdesign.com/embedded-revolution/5g-it-s-not-here-yet-closer-you-think|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Only eMBB is deployed in 2020; URLLC and mMTC are several years away in most locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/infrastructure/managing-the-future-of-cellular.pdf?revision=72c22c02-de7e-43d5-bf10-5690d65352cd|title=Managing the Future of Cellular|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=September 24, 2020}}</ref>

Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) uses 5G as a progression from 4G LTE [[mobile broadband]] services, with faster connections, higher throughput, and more capacity. This will benefit areas of higher traffic such as stadiums, cities, and concert venues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Heejung|last2=Lee|first2=Howon|last3=Jeon|first3=Hongbeom|date=October 2017|title=What is 5G?

Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) refer to using the network for [[mission critical]] applications that require uninterrupted and robust data exchange.

Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) would be used to connect to a large number of [[LPWAN|devices]].  5G technology will connect some of the 50 billion connected IoT devices.<ref name="newsroom.intel.com">{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|title=Intel Accelerates the Future with World's First Global 5G Modem|website=Intel Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906234205/https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-accelerates-the-future-with-first-global-5g-modem/|archive-date=September 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Most will use the less expensive Wi-Fi.

The similarity in terms of throughput between 4G and 5G in the existing bands is because 4G already approaches the [[Shannon limit]] on data communication rates. 5G speeds in the less common [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wave]] spectrum, with its much more abundant bandwidth and shorter range, and hence greater frequency reuseability, can be substantially higher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2017/05/17/taking-a-fresh-look-at-5g-technology-enablers/|title=Taking a fresh look at 5G – Technology enablers I|last=Saracco|first=Roberto|website=IEEE Future Directions|language=en-US|access-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105164116/https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2017/05/17/taking-a-fresh-look-at-5g-technology-enablers/|archive-date=November 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[IEEE]] covers several areas of 5G with a core focus in wireline sections between the Remote Radio Head (RRH) and Base Band Unit (BBU). The 1914.1 standards focus on network architecture and dividing the connection between the RRU and BBU into two key sections. Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized. This is based on the [[3GPP]] definition of functional splits. Multiple network synchronization standards within the IEEE groups are being updated to ensure network timing accuracy at the RU is maintained to a level required for the traffic carried over it.

[[5G NR]] (New Radio) is a new [[air interface]] developed for the 5G network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|title=What is 5G New Radio (5G NR)|website=5g.co.uk|access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184631/https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g-new-radio/|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It is supposed to be the global standard for the air interface of 3GPP 5G networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|title=Making 5G New Radio (NR) a Reality – The Global 5G Standard – IEEE Communications Society|website=comsoc.org|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184634/https://www.comsoc.org/webinars/making-5g-new-radio-nr-reality-%E2%80%93-global-5g-standard|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Pre-standard implementations====
* 5GTF: The 5G network implemented by American carrier [[Verizon]] for [[fixed wireless|Fixed Wireless Access]] in late 2010s uses a pre-standard specification known as 5GTF (Verizon 5G Technical Forum). The 5G service provided to customers in this standard is incompatible with 5G NR.

Beyond mobile operator networks, 5G is also expected to be used for private networks with applications in industrial IoT, enterprise networking, and critical communications.

Initial 5G NR launches depended on pairing with existing LTE (4G) infrastructure in [[5G NR#Non-Standalone Mode|non-standalone (NSA) mode]] (5G NR radio with 4G core), before maturation of the [[5G NR#Standalone Mode|standalone (SA) mode]] with the 5G core network.

As of April 2019, the [[Global Mobile Suppliers Association]] had identified 224 operators in 88 countries that have demonstrated, are testing or trialing, or have been licensed to conduct field trials of 5G technologies, are deploying 5G networks or have announced service launches.<ref>[https://gsacom.com/paper/lte-5g-market-statistics-8-april-2019 GSA: LTE and 5G Market Statistics, 8 April 2019] (retrieved April 24, 2019)</ref> The equivalent numbers in November 2018 were 192 operators in 81 countries.<ref name="auto1">GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ 5G Investments: Trials, Deployments, Launches – Updated March 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402105309/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-investments-global-progress-feb19/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (retrieved March 2, 2019)</ref> The first country to adopt 5G on a large scale was South Korea, in April 2019.

As of March 2019, there are reportedly 52 countries, territories, special administrative regions, disputed territories and dependencies that are formally considering introducing certain spectrum bands for terrestrial 5G services, are holding consultations regarding suitable spectrum allocations for 5G, have reserved spectrum for 5G, have announced plans to [[Spectrum auction|auction frequencies]] or have already allocated spectrum for 5G use.<ref>GSA: [https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-spectrum-licensing-mar-2029/ Spectrum for Terrestrial 5G Networks: Licensing Developments Worldwide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402093330/https://gsacom.com/paper/5g-spectrum-licensing-mar-2029/ |date=April 2, 2019 }} (March 2019)</ref>

===Unlicensed spectrum===
[[Mobile network operator|MNO's]] are increasingly using unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4- and 5-gigahertz (GHz) frequency bands. 4G and 5G networks also use these bands to offload traffic in heavily congested areas and provide connectivity for billions of IoT devices. Advancements in Wi-Fi, LTE in Unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U), License Assisted Access (LAA), and MulteFire use 4G & 5G technologies in these bands.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The air interface defined by 3GPP for 5G is known as New Radio (NR), and the specification is subdivided into two frequency bands, FR1 (below 6&nbsp;GHz) and FR2 (mmWave),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_FR_Bandwidth.html|title=5G &#124; ShareTechnote|website=sharetechnote.com|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204926/http://sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_FR_Bandwidth.html|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> each with different capabilities.<ref>Unique Oxygen Absorption Properties|https://www.rfglobalnet.com/doc/fixed-wireless-communications-at-60ghz-unique-0001</ref>

==== Frequency range 1 (< 6 GHz) ====
The maximum channel bandwidth defined for FR1 is 100&nbsp;MHz, due to the scarcity of continuous spectrum in this crowded frequency range. The band most widely being used for 5G in this range is 3.3–4.2&nbsp;GHz. The Korean carriers are using n78 band at 3.5&nbsp;GHz although some millimeter wave spectrum has also been allocated.

==== Frequency range 2 (> 24 GHz) ====
The minimum channel bandwidth defined for FR2 is 50&nbsp;MHz and the maximum is 400&nbsp;MHz, with two-channel aggregation supported in 3GPP Release 15. In the U.S., Verizon is using n258 band 26&nbsp;GHz and AT&T is using 39&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322|title=5G vs 4G: Everything You Need to Know|author=Tim Fisher|website=Lifewire|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421230135/https://www.lifewire.com/5g-vs-4g-4156322|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The higher the frequency, the greater the ability to support high data-transfer speeds.

===== FR2 coverage =====
5G in the 24&nbsp;GHz range or above use higher frequencies than 4G, and as a result, some 5G signals are not capable of traveling large distances (over a few hundred meters), unlike 4G or lower frequency 5G signals (sub 6&nbsp;GHz). This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Massive MIMO ===
{{See also|Multi-user MIMO}}
MIMO systems use multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver ends of a wireless communication system.  Multiple antennas use the spatial dimension in addition to the time and frequency ones, without changing the bandwidth requirements of the system. 

Massive MIMO (multiple input and multiple output) [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] increases sector throughput and capacity density using large numbers of antennas and [[Multi-user MIMO]] (MU-MIMO). Each antenna is individually-controlled and may embed radio transceiver components. Nokia claimed a five-fold increase in the capacity increase for a 64-Tx/64-Rx antenna system.

=== Edge computing ===
{{main|Mobile edge computing}}
[[Edge computing]] is delivered by computing servers closer to the ultimate user. It reduces latency and data traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.pcmag.com/feature/51666/it-needs-to-start-thinking-about-5g-and-edge-cloud-computing|title=IT Needs to Start Thinking About 5G and Edge Cloud Computing|date=February 7, 2018|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142041/http://au.pcmag.com/feature/51666/it-needs-to-start-thinking-about-5g-and-edge-cloud-computing|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sdn.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2016/mobile-edge-computing-an-important-ingredient-of-5g-networks|title=Mobile Edge Computing – An Important Ingredient of 5G Networks|date=March 2016|publisher=IEEE Softwarization|access-date=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231318/https://sdn.ieee.org/newsletter/march-2016/mobile-edge-computing-an-important-ingredient-of-5g-networks|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Small cell ===
{{main|Small cell}}
Small cells are low-powered cellular radio access nodes that operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum that have a range of 10 meters to a few kilometers. Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.

=== Beamforming ===
{{main|Beamforming}}
Beamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by shaping the radio waves to point in a specific direction. The technique combines the power from elements of the antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference, while other signals pointing to other angles experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality in the specific direction, as well as data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming to improve the signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.

=== Convergence of Wi-Fi and cellular ===
One expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===
NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.

=== SDN/NFV ===
{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}
Initially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access. Today a new era of innovative tools and technologies is inclined towards developing a new pool of applications. This pool of applications consists of different domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), web of connected autonomous vehicles, remotely controlled robots, and heterogeneous sensors connected to serve versatile applications.<ref name="Software Defined Network for 5G">{{cite web|url=https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|title=WS-21: SDN5GSC – Software Defined Networking for 5G Architecture in Smart Communities|date=May 17, 2018|website=IEEE Global Communications Conference|access-date=March 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002935/https://globecom2018.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-21-sdn5gsc-software-defined-networking-5g-architecture-smart-communities|archive-date=March 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In this context, [[5G network slicing|network slicing]] has emerged as a key technology to efficiently embrace this new market model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ordonez-Lucena|first1=J.|last2=Ameigeiras|first2=P.|last3=Lopez|first3=D.|last4=Ramos-Munoz|first4=J.

=== Channel coding ===
The [[Forward error correction|channel coding]] techniques for 5G NR have changed from [[Turbo code]]s in 4G to [[Polar code (coding theory)|polar codes]] for the control channels and [[Low-density parity-check code|LDPC]] (low-density parity check codes) for the data channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|title=5G Channel Coding|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206003124/https://www.accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|archive-date=December 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|title=A Vision for 5G Channel Coding|last=Maunder|first=Robert|date=September 2016|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206003124/https://www.accelercomm.com/sites/accelercomm.com/files/5G-Channel-Coding_0.pdf|archive-date=December 6, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Operation in unlicensed spectrum ===
Like [[LTE in unlicensed spectrum]], 5G NR will also support operation in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U).<ref name="QualcommNRU">{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/12/13/3gpp-commits-5g-nr-unlicensed-spectrum-its-next-release|title=5G NR 3GPP &#124; 5G NR Qualcomm|date=December 12, 2018|website=Qualcomm|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422063743/https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2018/12/13/3gpp-commits-5g-nr-unlicensed-spectrum-its-next-release|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA) from LTE that enable carriers to use those unlicensed spectrum to boost their operational performance for users, in 5G NR it will support standalone NR-U unlicensed operation that will allow new 5G NR networks to be established in different environments without acquiring operational license in licensed spectrum, for instance for localized private network or lower the entry barrier for providing 5G internet services to the public.<ref name="QualcommNRU"/>

== Electromagnetic interference ==
The [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] used by various 5G proposals will be near that of passive [[remote sensing]] such as by [[weather satellite|weather]] and [[Earth observation satellite]]s, particularly for [[water vapor]] monitoring.

There have been a number of concerns over the spread of disinformation in the media and online regarding the potential health effects of 5G technology. Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2019, [[William Broad]] reported that [[RT America]] began airing programming linking 5G to harmful health effects which "lack scientific support", such as "brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors, and Alzheimer's disease". Broad asserted that the claims had increased. RT America had run seven programs on this theme by mid-April 2019 but only one in the whole of 2018.

When AT&T announced 5G Evolution, 4x4 MIMO, the technology that AT&T is using to deliver the faster speeds, had already been put in place by T-Mobile without being branded with the 5G moniker.

* On November 1, 2012, the EU project "Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty Information Society" (METIS) starts its activity toward the definition of 5G. METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name="METIS presentation">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=February 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on "[[small cell]]" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]]. According to [[Günther Oettinger]], the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society (2014–2019), "an innovative utilization of spectrum" is one of the key factors at the heart of 5G success. Oettinger further described it as "the essential resource for the wireless connectivity of which 5G will be the main driver".<ref name="Speech at Mobile World Congress: The Road to 5G">{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_15_4535|title=Speech at Mobile World Congress: The Road to 5G|date=March 2015|access-date=April 20, 2015}}</ref> iJOIN was selected by the European Commission as one of the pioneering 5G research projects to showcase early results on this technology at the [[Mobile World Congress]] 2015 (Barcelona, Spain).
