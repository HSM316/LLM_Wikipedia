A '''data processing unit''' ('''DPU''') is a programmable [[Processor (computing)|computer processor]] that tightly integrates a general-purpose [[CPU]] with [[Network interface controller|network interface]] hardware.<ref name="davie-2021">{{Cite news |last=Davie |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Davie |url=https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2021/11/24/infrastructure_processing_units/ |title=SmartNICs, IPUs, DPUs de-hyped: Why and how cloud giants are offloading work from server CPUs |date=November 24, 2021 |work=[[The Register]] |access-date=2023-07-11}}</ref> Sometimes they are called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs".<ref name="sharwood-2023">{{Cite news |last=Sharwood |first=Simon |author-link=Bruce Davie |url=https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/23/google_cloud_c3_ipu/ |title=Google Cloud upgrades with next-gen accelerator that embiggens its VMs |date=May 23, 2023 |work=[[The Register]] |access-date=2023-07-11 |quote=…Infrastructure Processing Unit – the same kind of kit that others call SmartNICs or Data Processing Units…}}</ref> They can be used in place of traditional [[Network interface controller|NICs]] to relieve the main CPU of complex networking responsibilities and other "infrastructural" duties; although their features vary, they may be used to perform [[Encryption|encryption/decryption]], serve as a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], handle [[TCP/IP]], process [[HTTP]] requests, or even function as a [[hypervisor]] or [[Disk array controller|storage controller]].<ref name="davie-2021"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/smartnic |title=Definition of SmartNIC |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=[[PCMag]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |access-date=2023-07-11}}</ref> These devices can be attractive to [[cloud computing]] providers whose servers might otherwise spend a significant amount of CPU time on these tasks, cutting into the cycles they can provide to guests.<ref name="davie-2021"/>
