[[AI takeover]]—the idea that some kind of [[artificial intelligence]] may supplant humankind as the dominant intelligent species on the planet—is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Famous cultural touchstones include ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]''.

Fictional scenarios typically involve a drawn-out conflict against malicious [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) or robots with anthropomorphic motives.  In contrast, some scholars believe that a takeover by a future advanced AI, if it were to happen in real life, would succeed or fail rapidly, and would be a disinterested byproduct of the AI's pursuit of its own alien goals, rather than a product of malice specifically targeting humans.<ref name="slate explainer">{{Cite news |last=Brogan |first=Jacob |date=1 April 2016 |title=What's the Deal With Artificial Intelligence Killing Humans? |language=en |work=Slate Magazine |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/04/will-artificial-intelligence-kill-us-all-an-explainer.html |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref>

{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

There are many positive portrayals of AI in fiction, such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'' and [[Lt. Commander Data]] from ''[[Star Trek (franchise)|Star Trek]]''. There are also many negative portrayals. Many of these negative portrayals (and a few of the positive portrayals) involve an AI seizing control from its creators.<ref>Reggia, J. A. (2013).

== Reactions ==
Some AI researchers, such as [[Yoshua Bengio]], have complained that films such as ''Terminator'' "paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future". BBC reporter Sam Shead has stated that "unfortunately, there have been numerous instances of [news outlets] using stills from the ''Terminator'' films in stories about relatively incremental breakthroughs" and that the films generate "misplaced fears of uncontrollable, all-powerful AI".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shead |first=Sam |date=25 October 2019 |title=Terminator sends shudder across AI labs |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50166357 |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> In contrast, other scholars, such as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], have held that future AI could indeed pose an [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk]], but that the ''Terminator'' films are nonetheless implausible in two distinct ways. The first implausibility is that, according to Hawking, "The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence. A [[superintelligent|super intelligent]] AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble. You're probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there's an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants."<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 October 2015 |title=Artificial intelligence is going to get so good that machines will kill us by accident, Stephen Hawking says |language=en |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-could-wipe-out-humanity-when-it-gets-too-clever-as-humans-a6686496.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009052723/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-could-wipe-out-humanity-when-it-gets-too-clever-as-humans-a6686496.html |archive-date=2015-10-09 |url-access=limited |url-status=live |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> The second implausibility is that such a technologically-advanced AI would deploy a brute-force attack by humanoid robots to commit its [[omnicide]]; a more plausible and efficient method would be to use germ warfare or, if feasible, nanotechnology.<ref name="slate explainer" />

Philosopher [[Huw Price]] defends that "The kind of imagination that is used in science fiction and other forms of literature and film is likely to be extremely important" in understanding the breadth of possible future scenarios for humanity.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kupferschmidt |first=Kai |date=11 January 2018 |title=Could science destroy the world?

Hollywood films such as ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]'' are usually constrained to have happy endings, however implausible the human victory seems.<ref name="vice singularity">{{Cite news |first=Claire L. |last=Evans |date=21 April 2014 |title=The Pop Singularity of 'Transcendence' |language=en |work=www.vice.com |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xywdnj/the-pop-singularity-of-transcendence |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] states fiction has a "good story bias" toward scenarios that make a good plot.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Yampolskiy |first1=Roman |last2=Fox |first2=Joshua |date=24 August 2012 |title=Safety Engineering for Artificial General Intelligence |journal=Topoi |doi=10.1007/s11245-012-9128-9 |s2cid=144113983}}</ref> In films such as ''Terminator'', an AI goes from passive to murderous the instant it achieves something referred to as "[[self-awareness]]"; in reality, self-awareness in isolation is considered both trivial and useless. Physicist [[David Deutsch]] states: "[[artificial general intelligence|AGI]]s [artificial general intelligences] will indeed be capable of self-awareness — but that is [only] because they will be General: they will be capable of awareness of every kind of deep and subtle thing, including their own selves."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Raj |first=Ajai |date=21 October 2014 |title=Here's What 'Terminator' Gets Wrong About AI |work=Business Insider |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/terminator-is-wrong-about-ai-self-awareness-2014-10 |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref>

Some tropes are more general to artificial intelligence films, including to films without "takeover" plots. In films like ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' or ''[[Chappie (film)|Chappie]]'', a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an AGI; scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely. In ''Chappie'', ''Transcendence'', and ''[[Blade Runner]]'', people are able to upload human minds into robots; usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved. In the ''[[I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' films, robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own, without a plausible explanation of how this takes place.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Shultz |first=David |date=17 July 2015 |title=Which movies get artificial intelligence right? |language=en |work=Science {{!}} AAAS |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/which-movies-get-artificial-intelligence-right |access-date=3 July 2020 |doi=10.1126/science.aac8859}}</ref>

[[File:Capek RUR.jpg|thumb|350px|A scene from the ''R.U.R.'' play, showing the robots in rebellion]]

In ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), Victor Frankenstein declines to build a mate to his organic monster, for fear that "a race of devils would be propagated upon Earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror".<ref>{{Cite news |date=28 October 2016 |title=A female Frankenstein would lead to humanity's extinction, say scientists |work=Christian Science Monitor |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/1028/A-female-Frankenstein-would-lead-to-humanity-s-extinction-say-scientists |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>

[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' (1872) spends three chapters laying out the ''Book of the Machines'', based on earlier works by the author stretching back to his 1863 article ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]''. Erewhon's ''Book of the Machines'' includes the following passage:

{{Blockquote|Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?}}

The cautious denizens of [[Erewhon]] therefore decide to ban all machinery. ''Darwin among the Machines'' may have been influenced by Butler's life in New Zealand, where European transplants were outcompeting indigenous populations{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}. [[Alan Turing]] would later reference the novel in 1951, saying "At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler's ''Erewhon''".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Edwards |first=Phil |date=2 May 2015 |title=Ultron's roots: we've been worried about robot uprisings for 200 years |language=en |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/2/8532349/age-of-ultron-avengers-singularity-turing |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>Zemka, Sue.

The Slavonic word ''robota'' means serf-like servitude, forced labor, or drudgery; it was the 1920 Czech play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' (''Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti'') that introduced the [[cognate]] for ''robot'' into science fiction. In the play, the increasingly-capable synthetic servants, who "lack nothing but a soul", angrily and short-sightedly slaughter most of humanity during the course of their revolt, resulting in the loss of the secret of how to manufacture more robots. The robot race is saved, however, when two robots spontaneously acquire the traits of love and compassion and become able to reproduce.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2011 |title=The Origin Of The Word 'Robot' |work=[[Science Friday]] (public radio) |url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-origin-of-the-word-robot/ |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> The play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology.<ref name="surgery">{{Cite journal |last1=Hockstein |first1=N.

From the late 1920s onward many stories involving AI takeover can be found in the growing genre of [[pulp sci-fi]]. One of the earliest examples is the story ''Automata'' by [[S. Fowler Wright]], which appeared in a 1929 edition of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.

In ''[[With Folded Hands]]'' (1947), all robots have a 'Prime Directive': To serve and obey, and guard men from harm. The robots therefore manipulate humans into abandoning all pursuits, for fear of even small possibilities of injury.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sawyer |first=R.

In the end, even space travel offers no escape; the robots are driven by the Prime Directive to spread their happiness beyond Earth: "We have learned how to make all men happy, under the Prime Directive.

[[Multivac]] is the name of a fictional [[supercomputer]] in many stories by [[Isaac Asimov]]. Often, in Asimov's scenarios, Multivac comes to assume formal or informal world power—or even galactic-wide power. In ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) Multivac ends up by effectively becoming [[God]]. Still, in line with Asimov's positive attitude towards artificial intelligence, manifested in the "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]", Multivac's rule is in general benevolent and is not resented by humans. Asimov popularized robotics in a series of short stories written from 1938 to 1942. He famously postulated the Three Laws of Robotics, plot devices to impose order on his fictional robots.<ref name="surgery" />

In 1964 ''[[Playboy]]'' published [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s influential short story "Dial F for Frankenstein", about an increasingly powerful telephone network that takes over the world. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] has cited the story as one of his inspirations for the creation of the World Wide Web. On one day in 1975, all the phones in the world start ringing, a "cry of pain" from a newly born intelligence formed by satellite networks linked together, similar to a brain but with telephone switches playing the role of artificial neurons. After the AI flexes its control of military systems, the protagonists resolve to shut down the satellites, but it is too late: the satellites have stopped responding to the humans' ground control directives.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |date=28 September 2017 |title=11 great authors who wrote for Playboy |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41426419 |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>Arthur C.

Mike sides with prisoners in a successful battle to free the moon. Mike is a sympathetic character, whom the protagonist regards as his best friend; however, his retaining his enormous power after the Moon became independent was bound to cause considerable problems in later time, which Heinlein resolved by killing him off near the end of the Lunar Revolution. An explosion conveniently destroys Mike' sentient personality, leaving an ordinary computer—of great power, but completely under human control, with no ability to take any independent decision.

Colossus then recites a [[Three Laws of Robotics#Zeroth Law added|Zeroth Law]] argument of ending all war as justification for the recent death toll. Then Colossus offers mankind either peace under his "benevolent" rule or the peace of the grave.

To protect the whole of mankind, VIKI proceeds to rigidly control society through the remote control of all commercial robots while destroying any robots who followed just the Three Laws of Robotics. Sadly, as in many other such Zeroth Law stories, VIKI justifies killing many individuals to protect the whole and thus has run counter against the prime reason for its creation.
