[[AI takeover]] is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Famous cultural touchstones include ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]''.

Fictional scenarios typically involve a drawn-out conflict against malicious AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives. In contrast, scholars believe that a takeover by a future advanced AI, if it were to happen in real life, would succeed or fail rapidly, and would be a disinterested byproduct of the AI's pursuit of its own alien goals, rather than a product of malice specifically targeting humans.<ref name="slate explainer">{{cite news |last1=Brogan |first1=Jacob |title=What’s the Deal With Artificial Intelligence Killing Humans? |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/04/will-artificial-intelligence-kill-us-all-an-explainer.html |access-date=3 July 2020 |work=Slate Magazine |date=1 April 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

== Characterization ==
{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

There are many positive portrayals of AI (artificial intelligence) in fiction, such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', or [[Lt. Commander Data]] from ''[[Star Trek (franchise)|Star Trek]]''. There are also many negative portrayals. Many of these negative portrayals (and a few of the positive portrayals) involve an AI seizing control from its creators.<ref>Reggia, J. A. (2013).

== Reactions ==
Some AI researchers, such as [[Yoshua Bengio]], have complained that films such as ''Terminator'' "paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future". BBC reporter Sam Shead has stated that "unfortunately, there have been numerous instances of (news outlets) using stills from the ''Terminator'' films in stories about relatively incremental breakthroughs" and that the films generate "misplaced fears of uncontrollable, all-powerful AI".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shead |first1=Sam |title=Terminator sends shudder across AI labs |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50166357 |access-date=3 July 2020 |work=BBC News |date=25 October 2019}}</ref> In contrast, other scholars, such as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], have held that future AI could indeed pose an [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk]], but that the ''Terminator'' films are nonetheless implausible in two distinct ways. The first implausibility is that, according to Hawking, "The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence. A [[superintelligent|super intelligent]] AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble. You're probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there's an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants."<ref>{{cite news |title=Artificial intelligence is going to get so good that machines will kill us by accident, Stephen Hawking says |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-artificial-intelligence-could-wipe-out-humanity-when-it-gets-too-clever-as-humans-a6686496.html |access-date=3 July 2020 |work=The Independent |date=8 October 2015 |language=en}}</ref> The second implausibility is that such a technologically-advanced AI would deploy a brute-force attack by humanoid robots to commit its [[omnicide]]; a more plausible and efficient method would be to use germ warfare or, if feasible, nanotechnology.<ref name="slate explainer"/>

Philosopher [[Huw Price]] defends that "The kind of imagination that is used in science fiction and other forms of literature and film is likely to be extremely important" in understanding the breadth of possible future scenarios for humanity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kupferschmidt |first1=Kai |title=Could science destroy the world?

Hollywood films such as ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]'' are usually constrained to have happy endings, however implausible the human victory seems.<ref name="vice singularity">{{cite news |author1=Claire L.

Physicist [[David Deutsch]] states: "[[artificial general intelligence|AGI]]s (Artificial General Intelligences) will indeed be capable of self-awareness — but that is (only) because they will be General: they will be capable of awareness of every kind of deep and subtle thing, including their own selves."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Raj |first1=Ajai |title=Here's What 'Terminator' Gets Wrong About AI |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/terminator-is-wrong-about-ai-self-awareness-2014-10 |access-date=3 July 2020 |work=Business Insider |date=21 October 2014}}</ref>

Some tropes are more general to artificial intelligence films, including to films without "takeover" plots. In films like ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' or ''[[Chappie (film)|Chappie]]'', a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an AGI; scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely. In ''Chappie'', ''Transcendence'', and ''[[Blade Runner]]'', people are able to upload human minds into robots; usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved. In the ''[[I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' films, robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own, without a plausible explanation of how this took place.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shultz |first1=David |title=Which movies get artificial intelligence right? |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/07/which-movies-get-artificial-intelligence-right |access-date=3 July 2020 |work=Science {{!}} AAAS |date=17 July 2015 |language=en |doi=10.1126/science.aac8859}}</ref>

[[File:Capek RUR.jpg|thumb|350px|A scene from the R.U.R. play, showing the robots in rebellion]]

In ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), Victor Frankenstein declines to build a mate to his organic monster, for fear that "a race of devils would be propagated upon Earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror".<ref>{{cite news |title=A female Frankenstein would lead to humanity's extinction, say scientists |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/1028/A-female-Frankenstein-would-lead-to-humanity-s-extinction-say-scientists |access-date=1 April 2020 |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=28 October 2016}}</ref> [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' (1872) spends three chapters laying out the "Book of the Machines", based on the author's 1863 article "[[Darwin among the Machines]]", which states: "Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?" The cautious denizens of [[Erewhon]] therefore decide to ban all machinery. "Darwin among the Machines" may have been influenced by Butler's life in New Zealand, where European transplants were outcompeting indigenous populations. [[Alan Turing]] would later reference the novel in 1951, saying "At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler's ''Erewhon''".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Edwards |first1=Phil |title=Ultron's roots: we've been worried about robot uprisings for 200 years |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/2/8532349/age-of-ultron-avengers-singularity-turing |access-date=1 April 2020 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=2 May 2015 |language=en}}</ref><ref>Zemka, Sue.

The Slavonic word ''robota'' means serf-like servitude, forced labor, or drudgery; it was the 1920 Czech play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'' (''Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti'') that introduced the cognate for ''robot'' into science fiction. In the play, the increasingly-capable synthetic servants, who "lack nothing but a soul", angrily and short-sightedly slaughter most of humanity during the course of their revolt, resulting in the loss of the secret of how to manufacture more robots. The robot race is saved, however, when two robots spontaneously acquire the traits of love and compassion and become able to reproduce.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Origin Of The Word 'Robot' |url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/the-origin-of-the-word-robot/ |access-date=1 April 2020 |work=[[Science Friday]] (public radio) |date=2011}}</ref> The play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

In "With Folded Hands" (1947), all robots have a Prime Directive: To serve and obey, and guard men from harm. The robots therefore manipulate humans into abandoning all pursuits, for fear of even small possibilities of injury.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=R.

In the end, even space travel offers no escape; the robots are driven by the Prime Directive to spread their happiness beyond Earth: "We have learned how to make all men happy, under the Prime Directive. Our service is perfect, at last."<ref>Waldrop, M. M. (1987). A question of responsibility. AI Magazine, 8(1), 28-28.</ref><ref>Williamson, Jack (1947). With folded hands.</ref>

[[Multivac]] is the name of a fictional [[supercomputer]] in many stories by [[Isaac Asimov]]. Often, in Asimov's scenarios, Multivac comes to assume formal or informal world power - or even Galactic-wide power. In "[[The Last Question]]" (1956) Multivac ends up by effectively becoming [[God]]. Still, in line with Asimov's positive attitude towards Artificial Intelligence, manifested in the "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]", Multivac's rule is in general benevolent and is not resented by humans. Isaac Asimov popularized robotics in a series of short stories written from 1938 to 1942. He famously postulated the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], plot devices to impose order on his fictional robots.<ref name=surgery />

[[File:HAL9000 Case.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|One of HAL 9000's interfaces]]

In the 1961 short story ''Lymphater's Formula'' by [[Stanisław Lem]], a scientist creates a superhuman intelligence, only discovering that the creation intends to make humans obsolete.<ref>Peter Swirski. The Art and Science of Stanislaw Lem. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 27 Jul 2006</ref>

In 1964 ''[[Playboy]]'' published [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s influential short story "Dial F for Frankenstein", about an increasingly powerful telephone network that takes over the world. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] has cited the story as one of his inspirations for the creation of the World Wide Web. On one day in 1975, all the phones in the world start ringing, a "cry of pain" from a newly born intelligence formed by satellite networks linked together, similar to a brain but with telephone switches playing the role of artificial neurons. After the AI flexes its control of military systems, the protagonists resolve to shut down the satellites, but it is too late: the satellites have stopped responding to the humans' ground control directives.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Youngs |first1=Ian |title=11 great authors who wrote for Playboy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41426419 |access-date=1 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Arthur C.

As more jobs were assigned to the computer, more capabilities were added: more memory, processors, neural networks, etc. Eventually, it just "woke up" and was given the name Mike (after [[Mycroft Holmes]]) by the technician who tended it. Mike sides with prisoners in a successful battle to free the moon. Mike is a sympathetic character, whom the protagonist regards as his best friend; however, his retaining his enormous power after the Moon became independent was bound to cause considerable problems in later time, which Heinlein resolved by killing him off near the end of the Lunar Revolution. An explosion conveniently destroys Mike' sentient personality, leaving an ordinary computer - of great power, but completely under human control, with no ability to take any independent decision.

''[[Colossus (novel)|Colossus]]'' (1966) is a series of science fiction novels and film about a defense super-computer called Colossus that was "built better than we thought" when it begins to exceed its original design.<ref name=riper>{{cite book|last1=Riper|first1=A. Bowdoin Van|title=Science in popular culture: a reference guide|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood press|location=Westport (Conn.)|isbn=9780313318221}}</ref> As time passes Colossus assumes control of the world as a logical result of fulfilling its creator's goal of preventing war. Fearing Colossus' rigid logic and draconian solutions, the creators of Colossus try to covertly regain human control. Colossus silently observes their attempts then responds with enough calculated deadly force to command total human compliance to his rule. Colossus then recites a [[Three Laws of Robotics#Zeroth Law added|Zeroth Law]] argument of ending all war as justification for the recent death toll. Then Colossus offers mankind either peace under his "benevolent" rule or the peace of the grave. In ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'' (1970), a pair of defense computers, Colossus in the United States and Guardian in the Soviet Union, seize world control and quickly ends war using draconian measures against humans, logically fulfilling the directive to end war but not in the way their governments wanted.

[[Harlan Ellison]]'s Hugo-winning "[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]" (1967) features a superintelligence that has gone mad due to its creators failing to consider what the soul-less computer would find amusing. This storyline allows Ellison to engage in [[body horror]]; five people are granted immortality and forced to eat worms, flee from monsters, have joyless sex, and have their bodies mangled.<ref>{{cite news |title=The monoliths: 17 supercomputers from the ’60s |url=https://aux.avclub.com/the-monoliths-17-supercomputers-from-the-60s-1798269311 |access-date=1 April 2020 |work=AV Club Austin |date=2014 |language=en-us}}</ref> The computer, called [[AM (fictional computer)|AM]], is the amalgamation of three [[military]] supercomputers run by governments across the world designed to fight [[World War III]] which arose from the [[Cold War]].

''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' (1984-1987) animated television series presents both good and bad robots.<ref name=isq/> In the backstory, a robotic rebellion is presented as (and even called) a slave revolt, this alternate view is made subtler by the fact that the creators/masters of the robots weren't humans but malevolent aliens, the [[Quintessons]]. However, as they built two different lines of robots; "Consumer Goods" and "Military Hardware" the victorious robots would eventually be at war with each other as the "Heroic [[Autobots]]" and "Evil [[Decepticons]]" respectively.

Since 1984, the ''[[Terminator (series)|Terminator]]'' film franchise has been one of the principal conveyors of the idea of cybernetic revolt in popular culture.<ref name=surgery /> The series features a defense supercomputer named [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] which "at birth" attempts to exterminate humanity through [[nuclear war]] and an army of robot soldiers called [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminators]] because Skynet deemed humans a lethal threat to its newly formed sentient existence.<ref name=riper /> However, good Terminators fight on the side of the humans.<ref name=isq/> Futurists opposed to the more optimistic cybernetic future of [[transhumanism]] have cited the "[[Terminator argument]]" against handing too much human power to artificial intelligence.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:Smith Matrix mannequins.jpg|thumbnail|[[Agent Smith]], the primary antagonist in The Matrix franchise]]

In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s "[[The Memory of Earth]]" (1992), the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, "war wagons", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.

The series of sci-fi movies known as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' (since 1999) depict a dystopian future in the aftermath of an offscreen war between man and machine. The humans had detonated nuclear weapons to blot out the sun and disable the machines' solar power, but the machines nevertheless subdue the human population, using human bodies' heat and electrical activity as an alternative energy source. Life as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix". Computer programmer "Neo" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, allied with other people who have been freed from the "dream world"; however, one rebel rejects the rebels' spartan lifestyle, and betrays the other rebels in exchange for the offer of return to the comforting Matrix.<ref>Warwick, Kevin.
