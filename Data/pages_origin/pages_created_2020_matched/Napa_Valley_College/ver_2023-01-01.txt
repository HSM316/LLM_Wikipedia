The college was founded in 1942 after voters in Napa County passed a bond initiative in 1941.  From 1942 to 1964, it operated as a [[four-year junior college]], incorporating grades 11 through 14.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Winter|first=Carl G.|title=History of the Junior College Movement in California|publisher=Bureau of Junior Colleges|year=1964|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED346902.pdf |page=13}}</ref> The original campus was located on the same property as [[Napa High School]].  The college was later moved to its current location in 1965 when a campus was established on surplus state property which originally was part of land belonging to [[Napa State Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite journal
