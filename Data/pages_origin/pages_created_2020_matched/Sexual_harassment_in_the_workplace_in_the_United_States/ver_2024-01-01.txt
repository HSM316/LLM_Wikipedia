'''Sexual harassment in the workplace''' in [[US labor law]] has been considered a form of [[sex discrimination|discrimination on the basis of sex]] in the United States since the mid-1970s.<ref name="mcelroy">{{cite web|url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|date=27 October 2004|website=iFeminists.com|access-date=15 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="Siegel">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&dq=lin+farley&pg=PA8|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=0-300-09800-6|page=8}}</ref> There are two forms of sexual harassment recognized by United States law: [[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|quid pro quo sexual harassment]] (requiring an employee to tolerate sexual harassment to keep their job, receive a tangible benefit, or avoid punishment) and behavior that creates a [[hostile work environment]] (persistent sexual behavior that unreasonably interferes with an employee's ability to work). It has been noted that a number of the early sexual harassment cases were brought by [[African Americans|African American]] women and girls.

== History ==
The term ''sexual harassment'' was popularized following a consciousness-raising session led by [[Lin Farley]] as part of a Cornell University program on women in the workplace,<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Katherine A. |last2=Siegel |first2=Reva B. |title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law |date=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300135305 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhYip0PqV4EC |access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref> and the term entered popular use in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Farley |first1=Lin |title=I Coined the Term 'Sexual Harassment.'

A number of the original sexual harassment cases were pursued on behalf of black women and girls.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&pg=PA431|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814744864|pages=431|language=en}}</ref>

United States law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment:

*'''[[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|Quid pro quo sexual harassment]]''': an employee is required to tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for employment, a raise or job benefit, or promotion.
*'''[[Hostile work environment]]''': sexual harassment in the workplace results in an offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes an employee's work performance.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], sex, color, [[national origin]] or religion. Initially only intended to combat sex discrimination against people based on sex alone, (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2) the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] now extends to discrimination based on sexuality and transgender identity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf |title=Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia |website=US Supreme Court |access-date=21 June 2020 }}</ref><ref>[[Bostock v. Clayton County|Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)]]</ref> This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker, the worker's sexual preference, or the worker's sex at birth, is made a condition of employment (e.g., all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|website=EEOC|publisher=U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission|access-date=15 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations (1980) ===
In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1991 ===
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment.

=== Case Law ===
==== ''Barnes v Train'' (1974) ====
''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/27/sad-evolution-sexual-harassment.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|date=2004-10-27|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Paulette Barnes, an African American woman, was a payroll clerk who worked for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].

==== ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) ====
In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' was the first case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] to establish that [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Carrie N. |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/womens-movement-against-sexual-harassment/74881C13993E1EC38B8024216CD786E1 |title=The Women's Movement against Sexual Harassment |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87935-4 |location=Cambridge |doi=10.1017/9780511840067}}</ref> A male supervisor was found to have retaliated against [[Diane R.

Judge Richey's decision received a lot of media attention, including stories in multiple national newspapers.<ref name=":3" /> A lot of this attention was critical of the decision, and focused on a footnote Judge Richey included in the [[Memorandum opinion|Memorandum Opinion]].<ref name=":3" /> This footnote indicated that sexual harassment from a supervisor who is bisexual cannot be considered sex discrimination under [[Title VII]] if both male and female employees are subject to the harassment. <ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" />

Williams' case was appealed multiple times, and it took around eight years for her to win.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news |last=Baker |first=Donald P. |date=1979-10-24 |title=Proving Sexual Harassment Is a Struggle |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/10/24/proving-sexual-harassment-is-a-struggle/2b6eb091-f975-4844-901f-98f8b5237565/ |access-date=2023-05-07 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":3" /> Judge Richey granted Williams $19,147 to make up for lost pay.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6" />

''Williams v Saxbe'' was the first [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] decision to recognize quid pro quo sexual harassment.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":3" /> In response to the findings of this case, several earlier decisions against sex discrimination in lower courts were reversed on appeal, including ''Barnes v Train.'' <ref name=":1" />

==== ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977) ====
Although ''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) was initially dismissed, Paulette Barnes won on appeal in ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977). During this case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] ruled it was sex discrimination for a woman to suffer tangible employment losses (for example losing her job) for refusing to submit to requests for sexual favors. The appeals ruling was based in part on the ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) decision.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&pg=PA431|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814744864|pages=431–432|language=en}}</ref> The court also found that companies are liable for not stopping sexual harassment if they know it is being conducted by supervisors.<ref name=":12" /> As part of the ruling of ''Barnes v. Costle,'' Barnes received around $18,000 for back pay and the loss of promotions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wenzelfenton.com/blog/2018/01/01/history-sexual-harassment-laws-united-states/|title=History of Sexual Harassment Laws in the United States|date=2018-01-01|work=Wenzel Fenton Cabassa, P.A.|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== ''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'' (1986) ====
In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".<ref>{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v.

==== ''Ellison v. Brady'' (1991) ====
The case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Profio|first1=Debra A.|title=Ellison v. Brady: Finally, a Woman's Perspective|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|date=1992|volume=2|page=249|doi=10.5070/L321017565|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3206643c|access-date=15 August 2017|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==== ''Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'' (1991) ====
Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others.

Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards.

==== ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''Burlington v. Ellerth'' (1998) ====
In the same year, the courts concluded in ''[[Faragher v. City of Boca Raton|Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida]]'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

==== ''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998)'' ====
Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

==== ''Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White'' (2006) ====
In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

==== ''Astra USA v. Bildman'' (2009)====
In ''Astra USA v. Bildman'', 914 N.E.2d 36 (Mass. 2009), applying New York's [[faithless servant]] doctrine, the court held that a company's employee who had engaged in financial misdeeds and sexual harassment must "forfeit all of his salary and bonuses for the period of disloyalty."<ref name="auto6x">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RaGDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22faithless+servant%22&pg=PA472|title=Employment Law: Private Ordering and Its Limitations|first1=Timothy P.|last1=Glynn|first2=Rachel S.|last2=Arnow-Richman|first3=Charles A.|last3=Sullivan|date= 2019|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|via=Google Books|isbn=9781543801064}}</ref> The court held that this was the case even if the employee "otherwise performed valuable services," and that the employee was not entitled to recover restitution for the value of those other services.<ref name="auto6x"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Faithless Servants Beware: Massachusetts Forfeiture Law is More Severe than Astra USA, Inc. v.

=== Forced arbitration ===
In the 2002 ''EEOC v. Waffle House Inc.'' United States Supreme Court ruling, it was held that arbitration agreements could not prevent the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from pursuing victim-specific relief in litigation on behalf of an employee who files a timely charge of discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/recission-mandatory-binding-arbitration-employment-discrimination-disputes-condition|title=Recission of Mandatory Binding Arbitration of Employment Discrimination Disputes as a Condition of Employment|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=3 March 2022}}</ref> In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which excludes these types of complaints from contracts with forced [[arbitration clause]]s, including retroactively. The law was championed by [[Gretchen Carlson]], who also opposes the use of [[non-disclosure agreement]]s to shield perpetrators.<ref>{{cite web |title=Congress approves bill to end forced arbitration in sexual assault cases |website=[[NPR]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725162823/https://www.npr.org/2022/02/10/1079843645/congress-approves-bill-to-end-forced-arbitration-in-sexual-assault-cases |archive-date=July 25, 2023 |url-status=live |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/02/10/1079843645/congress-approves-bill-to-end-forced-arbitration-in-sexual-assault-cases}}</ref> It would be officially signed into law by U.S. President [[Joe Biden]] on March 3, 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-signs-bill-ending-ending-forced-arbitration-sexual-misconduct-ca-rcna18664|title=Biden signs bill ending ending forced arbitration in sexual misconduct cases|first=Dareh|last=Gregorian|publisher=NBC News|date=March 3, 2022|accessdate=March 3, 2022}}</ref>

===Sexual harassment in government===

The California legislature in Sacramento is known to have paid at least $850,000 in sexual harassment settlements in the period 1996–2017, though the [[New York Times]] notes often settlements are unknown to the public because of the terms of the settlements themselves.<ref>{{cite news|last1=JESS BIDGOOD|last2=MIRIAM JORDAN|last3=ADAM NAGOURNEY|title=Sexual Misconduct in California's Capitol Is Difficult to Escape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/sacramento-sexual-harassment-california.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0|access-date=30 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 October 2017|quote=many harassment cases disappear into the court system, where the outcomes are often sealed as women sign nondisclosure agreements.

== Mandatory workplace training ==

Several States require organizations based in the area to provide mandatory sexual harassment training to their employees.

=== California ===
California requires organizations with more than 5 employees to provide a written sexual harassment policy as well as an interactive training (either in-person or online) by January 1, 2021. This is an expansion of a 2005 law that required organizations with more than 50 employees to provide training to supervisors only. All employees and contractors (including temporary and seasonal employees) based in the state must go through the training within six months of hire or promotion and every two years thereafter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Saad |first1=Bianca N. |title=Required Harassment Prevention Training FAQs |url=https://hrcalifornia.calchamber.com/cases-news/-/media/hrcalifornia/cases-news/required-harassment-prevention-training-faqs.pdf |website=CalChamber |publisher=California Chamber of Commerce |access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref>

=== Illinois ===
All Illinois organizations must provide a policy as well as a sexual harassment prevention training to their employees, starting in 2020. The in-person or online training must be taught every year to each employee.<ref>http://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/101/PDF/101-0221.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

Connecticut, Delaware, and Maine have also passed laws mandating sexual harassment training for employers.
