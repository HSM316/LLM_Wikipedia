'''Trump National Golf Club Westchester''' is a private [[golf club]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. The {{convert|140|acre|ha|adj=on}} course has eighteen holes, with a {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} clubhouse. Founded in 1922 as ''Briarcliff Country Club'', it later operated as ''Briar Hills Country Club'' and ''Briar Hall Golf and Country Club.'' [[Donald Trump]], the former [[president of the United States]], purchased the property in 1996 and renamed the club after its county, [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], in a similar manner to his [[The Trump Organization#Golf courses|other golf properties]]. He had the clubhouse and course rebuilt for its 2002 reopening; the course was designed by Jim Fazio. Donald Trump served as president over Trump National Golf Club LLC (managing the Westchester club) from August 2000 until January 19, 2017, the day before his inauguration.<ref name="Discl">{{cite web|title=Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report|publisher=United States Office of Government Ethics|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3867112-Trump-Financial-Disclosure-2017.html|date=June 16, 2017|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617021721/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3867112-Trump-Financial-Disclosure-2017.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Briar Hills pool 2.tif|thumb|Briar Hills pool, c. 1940]]
The club had its origins around 1895, with Briarcliff founder [[Walter W. Law]]'s private nine-hole course on his estate, which became available to [[Briarcliff Lodge]] guests, and was then known as the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year.<ref name="Sale"/><ref name="1952history"/>{{rp|page=84}} The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club.<ref name="1952history"/>{{rp|page=84}}<ref name="MCMA"/> Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness.<ref name="1929club"/> In 1936, [[A. W. Tillinghast]] redesigned the course.<ref name="Till"/> In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club.<ref name="MCMA"/> The 1964 [[Metropolitan Open]] was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship.<ref name="MOpen"/> In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.<ref name="MCMA"/>
<!--Briar Hills - A new clubhouse was built, and a new golf course, designed by [[Devereux Emmet]]. For a time, the club utilized a large white house, Elderslie, as its clubhouse.<ref name="Landscape"/>{{rp|page=80}}-->

Henry Law, a son of village founder Walter W. Law, was among Briar Hill's founders.<ref name="Landscape"/>{{rp|page=80}} Among the club's directors were Henry Law and his son Theodore Gilman Law;<ref name="Landscape"/>{{rp|page=80}} [[Gene Sarazen]] was the club's golf professional in 1923â€“24,<ref name="MCMA"/> followed by [[1952 PGA Championship|1952 PGA Champion]] [[Jim Turnesa]].<ref name="Turnesa"/>

===Trump's purchase and redevelopment===
At the time of Briar Hall's 1996 sale, the club had an 18-hole, {{convert|6313|yard|m|0}} golf course and  {{convert|78782|sqft|m2|0}} clubhouse, seven tennis courts, an in-ground swimming pool, pro shop, maintenance building, and pool house.<ref name="Sale"/> Briar Hall had been taken over by the Marine Midland Bank, which then sold the property to Trump.<ref name="Ebsco1"/> Trump bought Briar Hall Country Club for $7.5 million<ref name="Value"/> in the foreclosure in December 1996<ref name="Controversy"/> and ran the club until 1999, until he closed the property to begin its redevelopment.<ref name="NYT1"/> The first general manager of the club, Chief Operating Officer [[Carolyn Kepcher]], later became co-host on Trump's television show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.<ref name="Kepcher1"/> She was fired from the show and management position in August 2006.<ref name="Kepcher2"/>

On March 16, 1999, Briarcliff was operating its mayoral election, and incumbent mayor Keith Austin ran unopposed. Write-ins supporting lawyer Richard Mattiaccio prompted a conflict involving hundreds of residents, which led to one arrest. The event took place near the polls at the Village Hall; Mattiaccio had gained supporters by criticizing Austin's weak opposition to Trump's club reconstruction plans. Many residents believed a large project would congest streets with construction vehicles and rip up the landscape.<ref name="Controversy"/> In redesigning the club and its course, Trump hired golf course architect Jim Fazio, brother of [[Tom Fazio]] in the same profession.<ref name="Fazio"/> Around the same time, the workmen resodded a village soccer field and assisted in constructing a new veterans' memorial in Briarcliff.<ref name="NYT1"/> He also had the current {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} white clapboard and fieldstone clubhouse<ref name="Rebuild"/> built on the property.<ref name="Value"/> At one time, due to residents' criticism, the clubhouse was reduced to {{convert|35000|sqft|adj=on}}, eliminating guest rooms and special event halls. It was designed by Robert Lamb Hart Planners & Architects, and included three stories with lockers, a 150-seat restaurant, and top-floor lounge.<ref name="Reduce"/><!--He demolished a {{convert|65000|sqft|adj=on}} clubhouse and replaced it with a {{convert|42000|sqft|adj=on}} one (originally planned at {{convert|81500|sqft|adj=on}})<ref name="Rebuild"/>--> Other difficulties with the club's plans arose; the village planning board recognized villager concerns over golf tournaments, membership requirements, and pesticide use. And at the time of the club's reconstruction, Trump had three other golf clubs planned, including one in [[Seven Springs (Bedford, New York)|Seven Springs]], an area within three towns which would require approval from all three, and one in the French Hill section of Yorktown.<ref name="Rebuild"/> Trump later dropped all of the plans, calling Westchester County "the toughest place to build on the planet".<ref name="Rebuild"/>

===Reopening and further events===
The first head golf professional was Frank Graniero.<ref name="Ebsco1"/> The club's first nine holes opened on April 15, 2002, followed by the next nine on June 29, 2002. The club had a total cost of $30 million<ref name="MCMA"/> or $40 million,<ref name="OpenCost"/> and was claimed to be the largest excavation project in Westchester County's history, with about {{convert|3000000|cuyd|adj=on}} of earth moved. The thirteenth hole cost Trump $7 million, surrounded by an artificial {{convert|101|ft|adj=on}} black granite waterfall, which pumps {{convert|5000|usgal|L|-2}} a minute.<ref name="OpenCost"/><!--$15 million 45,000 square foot clubhouse.<ref name="MCMA"/>-->

In 2003 Trump tried to move the [[Sybase Classic]], a [[LPGA]] tournament, from [[Wykagyl Country Club]] to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatzky was opposed to the plan; Trump attempted to persuade the mayor to talk to his wife, [[Jean Chatzky]], about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the [[Briarcliff Manor Public Library]]'s then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there.<ref name="LPGA">{{cite news|last=Rojas|first=Marcela|title=Trump to Briarcliff: Don't be 'stupid'|newspaper=The Journal News|date=July 6, 2003|id={{ProQuest|442536341}}}}</ref> The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or [[PGA Tour|PGA]] tournament to the club.<ref name="Tour2">{{cite news|last=Marchant|first=Robert|title=Trump wants golf event in village|newspaper=The Journal News|date=June 18, 2004|id={{ProQuest|442647322}}}}</ref>

A storm in June 2011 caused public utilities including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, which made the course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though it did not take corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.<ref name="War">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=David McKay|title=Trump at war with Briarcliff Manor|newspaper=The Journal News|date=September 17, 2015|id={{ProQuest|1712761478}}}}</ref><ref name="Flood"/>

When President Obama was in Westchester in 2014, his staff attempted to schedule visits to local golf clubs including Trump National, none of which wanted to close their courses for the president to play. Trump replied to [[NBC 4 New York]]'s report of the news with a widely circulated and publicized tweetâ€”"If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the countryâ€”I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!"<ref name="Obama"/> In 2015, the club sued the town of [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] to lower its worth from $13.5 million to $1.4 million in order to reduce property and school taxes; local residents complained because their own taxes would rise.<ref name="Value"/> In 2016, the club revised its claims to $9 million, closer to the 2014 town estimate of $14.3 million.<ref name="NewValue"/> In June 2017, Trump disclosed a value of the club at over $50 million, with $9.7 million in personal income in 2016.<ref name="Discl"/>

[[Daniel Scavino]] began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 1990, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to general manager of the club after Trump's purchase.<ref name="Scav1"/><ref name="Scav2"/> After serving as social media director for Trump's presidential campaign, he became Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media in December 2016.<ref name="Scav3">{{cite news|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Viebeck|first2=Elise|title=Trump hires Conway, Spicer and other loyalists for senior White House jobs|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/9f3c5692-c862-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf|date=December 22, 2016|access-date=December 23, 2016}}</ref> Trump's candidacy for the [[2016 United States presidential election]] affected the club; [[Horace Greeley High School]] used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate.<ref name="Prom1"/> The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision.<ref name="Prom2"/> In the following year, it was reported that [[Pleasantville High School (New York)|Pleasantville High School]]'s graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well.<ref name="PHS">{{cite news|title=Pleasantville students debate whether to hold prom at Trump golf course Pleasantville students debate whether to hold prom at Trump golf course|newspaper=News 12|url=http://hudsonvalley.news12.com/pleasantville-students-debate-whether-to-hold-prom-at-trump-golf-course-1.13083417|date=February 8, 2017|access-date=February 15, 2017|archive-date=February 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216222504/http://hudsonvalley.news12.com/pleasantville-students-debate-whether-to-hold-prom-at-trump-golf-course-1.13083417|url-status=live}}</ref> The graduating class voted, 97â€“44, to keep the venue.<ref name="PHS2">{{cite news|last=Barron|first=Sam|title=Pleasantville Seniors Vote To Keep Prom At Trump National In Briarcliff|newspaper=Briarcliff Daily Voice|url=http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/schools/pleasantville-seniors-vote-to-keep-prom-at-trump-national-in-briarcliff/700429/|date=February 17, 2017|access-date=February 17, 2017|archive-date=February 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218065010/http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/schools/pleasantville-seniors-vote-to-keep-prom-at-trump-national-in-briarcliff/700429/|url-status=live}}</ref> On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican primaries]].<ref name="Speech1">{{cite news|last=Deb|first=Sopan|title=Trump delivers restrained victory speech with teleprompter|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-delivers-restrained-victory-speech-with-teleprompter/|date=June 8, 2016|access-date=September 16, 2016|archive-date=August 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810044223/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-delivers-restrained-victory-speech-with-teleprompter/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Speech2">{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|last2=Maggie|first2=Haberman|title=Donald Trump Softens His Tone, and the G.O.P.

In July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] released a campaign video of one of the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with [[the Trump Organization]], where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to pay the bill, Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Clinton campaign]] used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses.<ref name="Tesoro1">{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Susan|title=This Architect Says Trump Almost Destroyed His Business...|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2016/07/13/this-architect-says-trump-almost-destroyed-his-business-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-cant-get-coffee/|date=July 13, 2016|access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Tesoro2">{{cite news|last=Frizell|first=Sam|title=How Hillary Clinton Is Hitting Donald Trump's Business Record on Two Fronts|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://time.com/4397159/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-business-record/|date=July 7, 2016|access-date=September 6, 2016|archive-date=September 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903205035/http://time.com/4397159/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-business-record/|url-status=live}}</ref> Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on|spell=in}} painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]]. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President [[Barack Obama]] publicly criticized Trump's purchase.<ref name="Painting">{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|title=Trump bought a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself with charity money.

==Current operations==
In 2001, annual membership dues were stated to be $9,000 per member or $12,000 for a family, with an initial deposit of $250,000.<ref name="NYT1"/> Before the 2008 recession, initiation fees were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, initiation fees were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an initiation fee or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.<ref name="2015dues"/>

===Property===
The club is located on about {{convert|140|acre|ha|-1}} adjacent to Briarcliff Manor's central business district<ref name="CBD"/> and in a residential area near [[Pace University]]'s former [[Briarcliff College|Briarcliff campus]]<ref name="NearPace"/> off Pine Road.<ref name="Ebsco1"/> The property contains "The Residences at Trump National Golf Club", a series of sixteen attached townhouses ranging in size from {{convert|3100|-|3,400|sqft}} and which were designed by William Devereaux & Associates.<ref name="NYT1"/> Plans exist for an additional 71 condominiums; the site was approved for 87 home sites in 1987.<ref name="Condos"/> The club also includes a member restaurant, which serves [[Kobe beef]] burgers, tuna flown in daily from Honolulu, and [[Trump Ice]] bottled water.<ref name="Grill"/>

===Tax assessments===
Every year since 2015, the Trump Organization has challenged the local tax assessment which is based on the property's value. Local entity officials assessed it at $15 million, while the organization put it at $1.4 million. In a compromise agreement in July 2021, the assessed value was reduced by 30%. In October, the district attorney for Westchester County subpoenaed the property-tax records, indicating "signaling a previously unknown criminal inquiry into the Trump Organization."<ref>{{cite web |last=Fahrenthold |first=David A. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-westchester-golf-criminal-investigation/2021/10/20/b19358c4-31b5-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html |title=Trump faces new criminal investigation into New York golf club |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 20, 2021 |access-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021020142/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-westchester-golf-criminal-investigation/2021/10/20/b19358c4-31b5-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rashbaum |first1=William K. |last2=Protess |first2=Ben |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/trump-westchester-golf-club-investigation.html |title=Trump Organization, Already Under Indictment, Faces New Criminal Inquiry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 20, 2021 |access-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-date=October 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211021025906/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/trump-westchester-golf-club-investigation.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It is very likely to go to trial with the others.

Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] became a member of the club in May 2003. Donald Trump has said that he bought the club partly "because he knew Bill Clinton would need a place to play".
