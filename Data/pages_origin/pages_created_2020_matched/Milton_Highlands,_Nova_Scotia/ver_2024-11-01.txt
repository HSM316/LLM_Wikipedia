Climate is from [[Yarmouth Airport]] located {{cvt|4.4|km}} to the southeast.

The area has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''), closely bordering on an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), typical of climates surrounded by the sea but close to large continents such as [[southern Norway]] and [[Hokkaido|coastal Hokkaido]] but with latitude variations. Being near the -3&nbsp;°C isotherm in the average of the coldest month (east of the city), causing that in peninsular areas like [[Yarmouth Bar, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth Bar]] and [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia|Cape Forchu]] are between a transition band for the [[oceanic climate]]s (''Cfb'').<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kottek |first=M.|author2=J.

The area's summers are cool due to the strong coastal influence from the sea which keeps summer temperatures cool, meaning temperatures above {{cvt|30|C}} are very rare.<ref name="climate" /> The average temperature in the warmest month, August is {{cvt|17.5|C}}. Spring and fall are transitional seasons in which falls are warmer than spring since the waters are at the warmest temperatures in fall and the coldest during early spring.<ref name="climate" /> Precipitation is significant, averaging {{cvt|1290.1|mm}} a year, with July and August the driest months on average and November the wettest month on average. An outstanding feature is the late-fall to early-winter precipitation maximum, owing to the combination of intense storm activity from November to January and relatively more-stable summers, with thunderstorm activity here much less frequent than in the U.S. Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and points southward. Yarmouth averages 1,898.3 hours of sunshine or 41.2% of possible sunshine with summer being the sunniest and winter being the cloudiest.<ref name=ccn1981/> Yarmouth averages 191 days of [[fog]] each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=30617&refer=&units=us |title=Yarmouth, Nova Scotia Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase}}</ref>

The highest temperature ever recorded was {{cvt|32.5|C}} on July 16, 2013.<ref name="ccnyarm"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{cvt|-24.4|C}} on February 14, 1894.<ref name="February 1894"/>
