{{short description|Seafloor spreading center of the West Philippine Sea Basin}}
'''Central Basin Spreading Center''' (CBSC), formerly '''Central Basin Fault,''' is a seafloor [[Mid-ocean ridge|spreading center]] of the [[West Philippine Basin]].<ref>{{citation|title=Complexities in the tectonic evolution of the West Philippine Basin|first=C. L.|last=Mrozowski|first2=S. D.|last2=Lewis|first3=D. E.|last3=Hayes|date=1982|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=82|issue=1–2|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(82)90085-3|bibcode=1982Tectp..82....1M}}</ref> It is a long, NW-SE-trending structure that is considered to have been the spreading center of the [[West Philippine Basin]] (WPB) from the [[Eocene]] to the [[Oligocene|middle Oligocene]]. It is a remnant spreading center, meaning that it is no longer active. However, it still displays many of the features that are characteristic of spreading centers, such as a [[rift valley]], axial ridges, and [[Abyssal hill|abyssal hills]]. The CBSC is divided into two segments: the eastern segment and the western segment. The eastern segment is characterized by slow-spreading features, such as a deep rift valley and nodal basins. The western segment is characterized by fast-spreading features, such as overlapping spreading centers and volcanic axial ridges.

The CBSC is also associated with a number of other features, including [[Oceanic plateau|oceanic plateaus]] and [[Seamount|seamount chains]]. These features suggest that the CBSC formed in a complex tectonic environment, possibly involving a [[mantle plume]]. The study of the CBSC provides important insights into the formation and evolution of marginal basins. Marginal basins are small ocean basins that are formed on the margins of continents or island arcs. The CBSC is a good example of a marginal basin that formed through [[seafloor spreading]].
