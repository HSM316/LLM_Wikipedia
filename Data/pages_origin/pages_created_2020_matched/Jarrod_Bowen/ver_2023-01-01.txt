== Style of play ==
Regarded as a quick, direct, mobile, energetic player with good technique and an eye for goal, Jarrod Bowen is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball in order to create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates. A versatile forward, he primarily plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]] on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind the defence towards goal. He can also play in the centre as main striker, behind the main striker as either an [[Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or [[Second striker|second striker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jarrod Bowen {{!}} West Ham United|url=https://www.whufc.com/teams/first-team/squad/jarrod-bowen#Profile|access-date=11 February 2022|website=www.whufc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jarrod Bowen joins West Ham United {{!}} West Ham United|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/january/31-january/jarrod-bowen-joins-west-ham-united|access-date=11 February 2022|website=www.whufc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jarrod Bowen, West Ham hungry for a trophy, ready to crash Premier League top four {{!}} NBC Sports|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnSALV1zlAM|access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Can Jarrod Bowen get an England call up?🔥🔴 Stuart Pearce says Southgate will have his eye on Bowen!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_64pKevd4kQ|access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=16 January 2019|title=Jarrod Bowen: from playing without pay to scoring for fun at Hull|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/jan/16/jarrod-bowen-hull-championship-hereford|access-date=11 February 2022|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=20 September 2021|title=Jarrod Bowen offers glimpse of why Liverpool, Spurs and Leicester are circling|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/jarrod-bowen-west-ham-transfer-b1923015.html|access-date=11 February 2022|website=The Independent}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Whilst at [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]], for whom he scored five goals on his debut for in August 1996, Sam won a trial with West Ham under the management of [[Harry Redknapp]], before the move fell through due to Merthyr's financial demands for Sam's services.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harry Redknapp wanted to sign my Dad for West Ham! - Jarrod Bowen|url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/february/27-february/harry-redknapp-wanted-sign-my-dad-west-ham-jarrod-bowen |website=West Ham United F.C. |access-date=22 March 2022 |date=27 February 2019}}</ref> Sam also scored hat-tricks on his debuts for [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] and [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]], leading to the ''[[South Wales Argus]]'' labelling him a "debut king" upon his transfer to [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in January 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title='Debut king' has a passion for goals|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/4607675.debut-king-has-a-passion-for-goals/ |website=South Wales Argus |access-date=22 March 2022 |date=24 January 2004}}</ref>
