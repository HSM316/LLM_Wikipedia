==Style of play==
Bowen has been compared to former [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] legend [[Arjen Robben]] through his footballing talent, with sports journalist Daniel Emery stating, "He is a budget Arjen Robben in the way that he plays. [[EFL Championship|Championship]] defenders know exactly what he is going to do, but they simply cannot stop it. He gets the ball on the channel on the right and looks to cut inside onto his left foot and find the far corner. Despite it being his trademark move, defenders still struggle to prevent him from getting his shot off. Would [[Premier League]] defenders stifle him? It remains to be seen."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://readnewcastle.com/2019/09/07/budget-arjen-robben-qa-on-jarrod-bowen-with-championship-expert/|publisher=Read Newcastle|accessdate=15 December 2019|last=Emery|first=Daniel|title="Budget Arjen Robben" – Q&A on Jarrod Bowen with Championship expert|date=September 2019}}</ref>
