===Program history===
{{Main|Baylor Bears football}}
The Baylor Bears football program finished 2008 with a 4&ndash;8 record and a 521&ndash;523&ndash;43  (0.499) all-time record, marking the first time in decades that Baylor's overall record was losing.  The program has not won its conference or attended a [[bowl game]] since 1994, when it both won the [[Southwest Conference]] and played in the [[1994 Alamo Bowl]]; it has not had a winning season record since 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&id=3227136|title=Baylor coach shaped by life in tiny Texas town|work=[[ESPN]]|date=February 2, 2008|author=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref>  The Bears are currently the only Big 12 team to not have made a bowl game since the Big 12's inception, and the team has gone the longest of any team in a [[BCS conference]] without a bowl game appearance ([[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke Blue Devils]] last played in a bowl game two days later in the [[1995 Hall of Fame Bowl]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/4263/loss-of-griffin-could-doom-baylors-bowl-hopes|title=Big 12 Blog: Loss of Griffin could doom Baylor's bowl hopes|work=[[ESPN]]|first=Tim|last=Griffin|date=September 27, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930021746/http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/4263/loss-of-griffin-could-doom-baylors-bowl-hopes|archivedate=September 30, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/big12/2007-11-28-baylor-football-coach_N.htm|title=Houston's Briles to Take Baylor football helm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|first=Stephen ([[Associated Press]])|last=Hawkins|date=November 28, 2007|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283660238|title=Hahnfeldt's late FG edges BC to deliver Vandy first bowl win in 53 years|work=[[ESPN]]|date=December 31, 2008|author=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaafootball.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=34&url_article_id=9255&change_well_id=2 |title=Bowl Schedules/Results |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=September 19, 2009 |work=[[NCAA]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803194501/http://www.ncaafootball.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=34&url_article_id=9255&change_well_id=2 |archivedate=August 3, 2007 }}</ref>

==Facilities==
In fall 2008, two new facilities, the Highers Athletic Complex and the Simpson Athletics and Academic Center, were completed.  The 2009 football season is the first in which the two facilities are available for use year-round.  With five consecutive record-breaking fund-raising years for the Baylor Bear Foundation and the "Above and Beyond" and "Victory with Integrity" Board of Regents campaigns, the Highers Athletic Complex and Simpson center were built and Grant Teaff Plaza and club seating were improved, in addition to various other non-football construction and improvements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kwtx.com/sports/headlines/55146127.html|title=Baylor Campaign Nears Finish Line|work=KWTX|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Highers Athletic Complex===
The Alwin O. and Dorothy Highers Athletic Complex is a set of three full-size practice football fields, two of natural turf and the third of artificial turf.  Located on the main Baylor Campus next to the Baylor Marina, the Highers Athletic Complex is now the main location of football practice.  Its location is much closer than that of [[Floyd Casey Stadium]], the current home stadium of Baylor and previous practice location.<ref name="athletic facilities">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baylormag.com/story.php?story=006137 |title=Athletic Facilities |magazine=Baylor Magazine |volume=6 |issue=3 |date=Winter 2008 |access-date=September 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812012517/http://www.baylormag.com/story.php?story=006137|archive-date=August 12, 2010}}</ref>

Construction began in November 2008 for the Jay and Jenny Allison Indoor Practice Facility.  The final facility of the Highers Athletic Complex was completed in August 2009 and offers an 80-yard synthetic turf field with ten-yard end zones.  At an estimated $11 million cost, the facility provides Baylor its first indoor practices ever, allowing for practice in most weather, including extreme heat, cold, and rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/sports/content/sports/college/2009/08/02/08022009wacbuindoor.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806161336/http://www.wacotrib.com/sports/content/sports/college/2009/08/02/08022009wacbuindoor.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 6, 2009 |title=Baylor Football Ready for Elements With New Indoor Practice Facility |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |newspaper=[[Waco Tribune-Herald]] |first=John |last=Werner }}</ref>

===Simpson Athletic and Academic Center===
The Simpson Athletic and Academic Center is located adjacent to the Highers Athletic Complex and Baylor Marina.  The Simpson Center has the main athletics training room and equipment room for most Baylor athletes, the football locker room and weight room, football coaches' offices, football meeting rooms, academic center for all student-athletes, and the Baylor Athletic Department administrative offices.  In 2008, for the third straight year, Baylor University had the highest NCAA Graduation Success Rate in the Big 12 Conference.

===Floyd Casey Stadium===
{{Main|Floyd Casey Stadium}}
Floyd Casey Stadium, located about four miles from the Baylor University campus, is the site of the Baylor Bears' home games.  The stadium, built in 1950, has an official capacity of 50,000 and has an artificial turf field, fixed aluminum bleachers, and the Big 12's largest locker room.

Baylor held its second home game and third overall at home, hosting the [[Northwestern State Demons]].  Baylor received the ball first, but a fourth-down rushing attempt failed, and the Demons recovered the ball, eventually resulting in a touchdown.  Baylor responded with four consecutive touchdowns before Northwestern State could finally score again, with a field goal; the Bears finished the first half with two more touchdowns.  Quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] did not return for the second half due to an injury that required season-ending surgery, but Blake Szymanski still helped the Bears to four more touchdown passes before initiating the [[quarterback kneel]] in the fourth quarter to prevent Baylor from scoring further; the Demons managed one field goal in each of the third and fourth quarters.

In the second half, Oklahoma consistently moved the ball down the field, but was held by Baylor's defense to four field goals, before finally scoring a touchdown late in the fourth quarter.  Blake Szymanski, Baylor's second-string quarterback, led the Bears' final drive; despite a 42-yard pass from Szymanski to David Gettis, Baylor did not score due to an [[end zone]] interception.

Having lost its last nineteen games against ranked opponents, Baylor was hoping for a Homecoming miracle to beat #12 Oklahoma State.  Unfortunately, Oklahoma State, facing major injuries like Baylor, was preparing for its showdown with the Texas Longhorns for the Big 12 South leadership, and used Baylor to do it.  OSU quarterback set a team record with his 85 percent completion rate, and Baylor scored its first points, a touchdown and successful try, in the fourth quarter.  Statistically, the teams' efforts were similar, except in OSU's much better ability to rush the ball, and its better kickoff yardage.
