[[Image:Louis Renard colorful fish.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the book ''Histoire naturelle'' by Louis Renard, published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1754.]]'''Biological illustration''' is the use of [[technical illustration]] to visually communicate the structure and specific details of biological subjects of study. This can be used to demonstrate [[anatomy]], explain biological functions or interactions, direct surgical procedures, distinguish species, and other applications. The scope of biological illustration can range from the whole organism level to microscopic.

==History==
[[Image:Vesalius Fabrica p206.jpg|thumb|Image from [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s [[De humani corporis fabrica]] (1543), page 206]]Historically, biological [[illustration]]s have been in use since the beginning of man's exploration and attempts to understand the world around him. The [[paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]] were so detailed that we can even recognize species and breeds of many of the depicted animals today.<ref name="AHA">{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/prehistoricart/| last=Moffat|first=Charles| title=Prehistoric & Ancient Art|year=2007|website=Arthistoryarchive.com|publisher=Lilith Gallery Network|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> For example, in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave]] (circa 30,000 BC), at least 13 different species have been identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/art-history/prehistoric-art/the-paleolithic-period/cave-paintings/|title=Cave Paintings|publisher=Boundless|website=Boundless.com|accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> In one prehistoric cave (circa 15,000 BC), there is a drawing of a mammoth with a darkened area where the heart should be.

During the [[Renaissance]], artist and scientist [[Leonardo DaVinci]] [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Human anatomy|famously sketched]] his observations from human dissections, as well as his studies of [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Botany|plants]] and the [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|flight of birds]]. In the mid-16th century, the physician [[Andreas Vesalius]] compiled and published the ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', a collection of textbooks on human anatomy superior to any illustrations that had been produced until that point. In the early 1600s, the explorer [[Ã‰tienne de Flacourt]] documented his travels to [[Madagascar]], and illustrated the unique fauna there, setting a precedent for future explorers as world travel became a more feasible reality.

[[Image:Haeckel Actiniae.jpg|thumb|49th plate from Ernst Haeckel's ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'' of 1904, showing various [[sea anemone]]s, classified as Actiniae.]]During his five-year voyage aboard {{HMS|Beagle}}, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote and illustrated ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', which was published in 1839. In the beginning of the 20th century, one of the most prolific biological illustrators, [[Ernst Haeckel]], discovered, described, and named thousands of new species, and his published work, ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'', contained hundreds of prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.

==Education and employment==
Biological illustrations can be found in use in [[History textbooks|history]] and [[anatomy]] textbooks, nature guides, [[natural history museums]], [[Science journalism|scientific magazines]] and [[scientific journal|journals]], [[botanical gardens]], [[zoos]] and [[aquariums]], surgical training manuals, and many more applications. Biological illustration can be pursued as a degree in the undergraduate, graduate, and technical college levels. Preparation for a biological illustration career can include a background of art or science, or a combination of both. Skills development in biological illustration can involve two-dimensional art, [[animation]], [[graphic design]], and [[sculpture]] (such as necessary in custom [[prosthetics]]).

It is possible to work in biological illustration without a specific degree, but a degree will significantly enhance an illustrator's employment opportunities. Job applications can be submitted to scientific researchers, publishers of scientific manuscripts, research institutions, museums, scientific foundations, commercial book publishers or university presses, individual authors, hospitals and medical training centers, local and state government offices, park services, environmental control offices, special government committees, printers and commercial publishing houses. Employment opportunities in the biological illustration profession are fairly limited, full-time jobs are not often available, and many experienced illustrators are [[self-employed]], on short-term contracts, or work in [[science communication]] careers with few illustration duties. Many illustrators prefer the flexibility of their own working arrangements, but this is only possible when they are well established in the field and capable of locating work when needed. Many [[freelance]] illustrators supplement their salary with [[commercial art|commercial illustration]] and graphic design projects, as is common in many art careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnsi.org/science-illustration/careers-ed|title=Careers and Education in Science Illustration|publisher=Guild of Natural Science Illustrators|website=GNSI.org|year=2010|accessdate=25 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301115006/http://www.gnsi.org/science-illustration/careers-ed|archive-date=1 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Technique==
Biological illustration has traditionally employed the techniques of using [[carbon dust]], [[color pencil]], [[stipple]] pen and ink, [[lithography]], [[watercolor]] and [[gouache]]; however, [[digital illustration]] has recently become more important in the field. Every professional scientific illustration begins with multiple rough sketches. Many details must be discussed between the artist and scientist before a final drawing can be completed, and additional preliminary drawings must be prepared in order to work out aesthetic details.

Pen and ink (often a [[flex nibs|flex nib]] fountain pen) line illustrations are clean, crisp, clear, and inexpensive to produce, making them ideal for biological illustrations. Ink drawings are typically made on a heavy drawing paper, such as [[Bristol board]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleobiology.si.edu/paleoart/prentice/pages/pen_and_ink.html|title= Drawing |website=Department of Paleobiology|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>

Digital illustration can be done using a monitor or [[drawing tablet]], computer software such as [[Adobe Illustrator]] or [[Photoshop]], or it can be used in [[post-production]] after the illustration has been drawn by hand.
