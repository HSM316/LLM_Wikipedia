'''Jozef Peeters''' (1895–1960) was a Belgian painter, engraver and graphic artist.

In 1913, Jozef Peeters attended for a short time the [[Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts]], but was mainly interested by his own experiments. In 1914 he started painting [[Luminism (Impressionism)|luminist]] [[landscape]]s and [[portrait]]s. From 1915 to 1917 he turned to [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolistic]] works inspired by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]].

In 1918 he meets [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], who convinced him to join the [[futurism|futurist movement]]. With [[Edmond Van Dooren]] and [[Jan Cockx]], Jozef Peeters established the "Modern Art" group in September 1918. The group was able to establish international contacts with the "[[Der Sturm]]" Gallery in [[Germany]]. It also organized three art congresses with exhibitions.

In 1920, Jozef Peeters presents his first abstract painting. He is considered to be, next to [[Karel Maes]], one of the first Belgian abstract painters. The next year he published his first album with six [[linocut]]s. Jozef Peeters also participated in several international art exhibitions among which the International exhibition in [[Geneva]] (1921) and the First exhibition of modern art in [[Bucharest]] (1924).

En 1924, he worked on the [[interior decoration]] and designed the [[furniture]] for his new house.

Jozef Peeters was also committed to art publications. In 1921, in cooperation with [[Geert Pijnenburg]] and [[Michel Seuphor]], he publishes the ''[[Het Overzicht]]'' (The Panorama) in Antwerp. In April 1925, Jozef Peeters creates the "[[De Driehoek]]" (The Triangle) magazine, supporting [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist art]].

In 1930 he gives up painting and all other artistic activities.
