==History==
Since the early 1970s, climate activists have called for more effective political action regarding [[climate change]] and other environmental issues. In 1970, [[Earth Day]] was the first large-scale environmental movement that called for the protection of all life on earth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Jennifer |date=2014 |title=A History of Climate Justice |url=https://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/article/a-history-of-climate-justice/ |journal=The Solutions Journal |volume=5 |pages=89–92}}</ref> The Friends of Earth organisation was also founded in 1970.<ref name=":102">{{Cite book |title=Routledge handbook of the climate change movement |date=10 January 2014 |others=Dietz, Matthias., Garrelts, Heiko. |isbn=978-1-135-03886-1 |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon |oclc=869543253}}</ref>

Between 2006 and 2009, the [[Campaign against Climate Change]] and other British organisations staged a series of demonstrations to encourage governments to make more serious attempts to address climate change.<ref name=":102" />

The [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen was the first UNFCCC summit in which the climate movement started showing its mobilization power at a large scale. According to Jennifer Hadden, the number of new NGOs registered with the UNFCCC surged in 2009 in the lead-up to the Copenhagen summit.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book |last=Hadden |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/networks-in-contention/2686C0383A92F6A2F58C23399448E511 |title=Networks in Contention: The Divisive Politics of Climate Change |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-08958-7}}</ref> Between 40,000 and 100,000 people attended a march in Copenhagen on December 12 calling for a global agreement on climate.<ref name="protest">{{cite news |date=13 December 2009 |title=Climate activists condemn Copenhagen police tactics |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |url-status=live |access-date=14 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215101510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8410414.stm |archive-date=15 December 2009}}</ref> Activism went beyond Copenhagen, with more than 5,400 rallies and demonstrations took place around the world simultaneously.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 October 2009 |title=International day of demonstrations on climate change |work=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/10/24/international.climate.change.demonstrations/}}</ref>

These are several approaches that have been used in the past by climate advocates and advocacy campaigns:

* the provision of information,
* framing of information about aspects of global climate change, and
* challenging the terms of political debates.

All three of these methods have been implemented in climate campaigns aimed at the general public. The information about the impacts of global climate change plays a role in forming climatic beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, while the effects of other approaches (e.g. provision of information about solutions to GCC, consensus framing, use of mechanistic information) is yet mostly unknown.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Skalík|first1=Jan|last2=Chabada|first2=Tomáš|last3=Urban|first3=Jan|date=2018-12-28|title=Effects of information-based interventions and framing interventions on attitudes to climate change and mitigation behavior|url=https://envigogika.cuni.cz/index.php/Envigogika/article/view/563|journal=Envigogika|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|doi=10.14712/18023061.563|issn=1802-3061|doi-access=free}}</ref> The third approach is to create space for discussions that move beyond questions of economic interests that often dominate political debates to emphasize ecological values and grass-roots democracy.

=== Climate disobedience ===
{{See also|Ende Gelände 2016|Ende Gelände 2017|Ende Gelände 2018|Ende Gelände 2019|Extinction Rebellion}}

Climate disobedience is a form of [[civil disobedience]], deliberate action intended to critique government climate policy. In 2008, American climate activist [[Tim DeChristopher]] posed as a bidder at an auction of US [[Bureau of Land Management]] oil and gas leases of public land in [[Utah]], won the auction, reneged on payment, and was imprisoned for 21 months. In September 2015, five climate activists known as the Delta 5 obstructed an oil train in [[Everett, Washington]]. At trial, the Delta 5 were allowed the [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity defense]], that is, breaking a law in the service of preventing a greater harm. After testimony, the judge determined the grounds for the necessity defense were not met and instructed the jury to disregard testimony admitted under the necessity defense. The Delta 5 were fined for trespassing but were acquitted of more serious charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=How to Stop an Oil Train: The Hearts-and-Minds Climate Defense That Won Over a Courtroom |magazine=[[Yes!

=== Declaring emergency state ===
{{Further|Climate emergency declaration}}
Enacting a state of emergency may be composed of two elements: declaring a state of emergency that has formulated real-world i.e. legal effects and the associated enabling or ensuring of rapid complementary large-scale changes in human activity for the articulated purposes. To date, many governments have acknowledged, sometimes in the form of tentative text-form "declarations", that humanity is essentially in a state of climate emergency.

In November 2021 [[Greta Thunberg]] with other climate activists begun filing a petition to the United Nation calling it to declare a level 3 global [[Climate emergency declaration|climate emergency]]. This should lead to the creation of a special team that will coordinate the response to the climate crisis in the international level. The response should be at least as strong as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bryant |first1=Miranda |date=10 November 2021 |title=Youth activists petition UN to declare 'systemwide climate emergency' |agency=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/youth-activists-petition-un-to-declare-systemwide-climate-emergency |access-date=12 November 2021}}</ref>

=== Fossil fuel divestment ===
{{Excerpt|Fossil fuel divestment|paragraphs=1-2|file=no}}

The divestment movement against [[fossil fuels]] has shed a different light on conversations surrounding fossil fuel finance. Banks and investors have been increasingly questioning the viability of the fossil fuel sector in the long-term. This is because this disinvestment movement is stigmatizing fossil fuels and is raising uncertainty around continued use of fossil fuels, thus reducing the financial desirability of fossil fuel assets. Because the extraction, exploration, and mining of fossil fuels are all capital-intensive activities, uncertainty around their financial risks can reduce investment. If there is a reduction in the supply of capital or a rise in the costs of capital, fossil fuel projects will end up being uneconomical. This will make the valuation of fossil fuel companies go down making them to go out of the market.<ref name="Carlin">{{Cite web |last=Carlin |first=David |title=The Case For Fossil Fuel Divestment |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidcarlin/2021/02/20/the-case-for-fossil-fuel-divestment/ |access-date=2021-12-17 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref>      

The main argument behind fossil fuel divestment campaigns is that earning profits from investments in activities associated with fossil fuels is unethical owing to the fact that fossil fuel emissions are the primary drivers responsible for global climate change.<ref name="Thomä 111–124">{{Citation |last=Thomä |first=Jakob |title=The stranding of upstream fossil fuel assets in the context of the transition to a low-carbon economy |date=2018-05-11 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315651606-5 |work=Stranded Assets and the Environment |pages=111–124 |location=Abingdon, Oxon |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9781315651606-5 |isbn=9781315651606 |access-date=2021-12-17}}</ref> Fossil Fuel divestment campaigns such as the Go Fossil Free campaign by 350.org are pleading with the investors to divest by immediately freezing any new investments that they might make in any fossil fuel companies and to divest from any direct ownership and commingled funds, such as fossil fuels public equities together with corporate bonds, in the next five years.<ref name="Thomä 111–124"/>

Fossil fuel divestment campaign have three primary aims. One of them is to pressure government across the globe to put legislation in place including carbon tax or banning any further drilling of fossil fuels. The second aim is to pressure fossil fuel companies to enact transformative change in their companies by switching to forms of energy supply that are less carbon-intensive in nature. The third aim is to ensure transparency when it comes to the carbon exposure that is caused by fossil fuel companies and also to put pressure on governments across the globe to play an active role in restricting the extraction of fossil fuels.<ref name="Thomä 111–124"/>  

Fossil fuel divestment campaigns thus seek to cut everything that would be required for the growth and survival of the fossil fuel industry.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Cheon |first1=Andrew |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781351173124 |title=Activism and the Fossil Fuel Industry |last2=Urpelainen |first2=Johannes |date=2018-02-06 |isbn=9781351173124 |doi=10.4324/9781351173124}}</ref> These include the social license that this industry requires to operate, the political license that the fossil fuel industry needs to grow and to survive, and the financial investments that support its existence, survival, and growth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ayling |first=Julie |date=October 2017 |title=A Contest for Legitimacy: The Divestment Movement and the Fossil Fuel Industry |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lapo.12087 |journal=Law & Policy |language=en |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=349–371 |doi=10.1111/lapo.12087 |issn=0265-8240 |s2cid=158445903}}</ref> These campaigns also seek to pressure governments to play their role in trying to limit emissions.

Divestment campaigns have been used for a variety of social justice issues in the past. For example, divestment campaigns have been launched to end investment in South Africa during apartheid, Israel, and Sudan, and against the tobacco industry. Most recently, divestment campaigns have focused on private prisons and the fossil fuel industry. These divestment calls have received a lot of attention with varying outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Apfel |first=Daniel C. |date=2015 |title=Exploring Divestment as a Strategy for Change: An Evaluation of the History, Success, and Challenges of Fossil Fuel Divestment |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44282147 |journal=Social Research |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=913–937 |issn=0037-783X |jstor=44282147}}</ref>  

The good news for the fossil fuel divestment campaigns is that their strategy could be effective. This owes to the fact that there has been an increase in the fossil fuel divestment commitments since 2000. These divestment commitments have resulted in reductions in the flow of capital into the gas and oil sector, as experienced in 33 countries across the globe between the years 2000 and 2015. Research has found that increasing gas and oil divestment pledges in various countries has also been influenced by divestment campaigns. More stringent environmental policies have also been enacted by regimes that recognize climate change as a threat to their country.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cojoianu |first1=Theodor F |last2=Ascui |first2=Francisco |last3=Clark |first3=Gordon L |last4=Hoepner |first4=Andreas G F |last5=Wójcik |first5=Dariusz |date=2021-02-23 |title=Does the fossil fuel divestment movement impact new oil and gas fundraising? |url=https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/21/1/141/6042790 |journal=Journal of Economic Geography |language=en |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=141–164 |doi=10.1093/jeg/lbaa027 |issn=1468-2702|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Fossil fuel divestment has indeed gained remarkable traction over the last few years. It has transformed from being a fringe idea to becoming a movement currently valued at around $14.5 trillion. It has over one thousand endowments, pension plans, and major investors committed. It has made many of today’s retail investors and institutional investors channeling their money towards environmentally conscious funds.<ref name="Carlin"/>  

== Public environmental activism ==
This type of citizen activism is important to creating a path to systemic change that will benefit the environment. This change can be assisted through government involvement by way of making more environmentally-conscious policies and all-encompassing changes that will be needed to make substantial environmental change. Different strategies, actions, and systems are used by citizen environmental activists for the purpose of supporting and in some cases demanding these environmental changes. There are however, issues that this type of activism faces. Issues such as potential decline in favorability and participation in environmental movements in BRIC countries, barriers to environmental citizen involvement and mobilization, and divergence in goals between environmental movements.

=== Systems and actions in public activism ===
Different strategies, systems, and actions are utilized in public environmental activism. Certain actions may be unavailable to different types of public activists depending on economic standpoint.

Erik Wright's theories of social transformation were used to analyze environmental movements and in part the actions that these movements took in their activism that connected to Wright's "transformational strategies".<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Stuart|first1=Diana|last2=Gunderson|first2=Ryan|last3=Petersen|first3=Brian|date=2020-05-28|title=The climate crisis as a catalyst for emancipatory transformation: An examination of the possible|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0268580920915067|journal=International Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=433–456|doi=10.1177/0268580920915067|s2cid=219738689|issn=0268-5809}}</ref> This includes "interstitial strategies", which are strategies that try to alter or challenge the current system, are seen in citizens actions like buying more efficient appliances and other environmentally-friendly focused consumer actions.<ref name=":4" /> "Ruptural strategies" "smash the current system through confrontation".<ref name=":4" /> Strategies like these connect to the practice in environmental movement to hold protests and resistance demonstrations.<ref name=":4" /> Lastly, "symbiotic strategies" are focused on collaboration through social reformation such as promoting and reforming policy to prioritize the climate's health as opposed to profit.<ref name=":4" /> Other types of strategies that citizen activists take are "awareness building, alliance building, and network foundation."<ref name=":2" /> "Conservation behavior", the public's willingness to life more environmentally-sustainable lifestyles, has been seen to become increasingly more popular both in developed and "developing democracies."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dalton|first=Russell J.|date=2015-07-04|title=Waxing or waning?

Public activism faces challenges due to differences in economic development as well as differences in government and law. There have been "signs of declining confidence and membership in environmental [organizations]"<ref name=":5" /> in the BRIC countries as well as "barriers to public involvement and social [mobilization] due to close monitoring and censorship, notably in China and Russia.<ref name=":5" /> Issues facing more long-term environmental discourse are feelings of unconcern and helplessness are cited as obstacles that public activist groups face in trying to promote change.<ref name=":4" /> In addition, mainstream environmental movements are "increasingly being challenged by environmental counter-movements"(pg 309).<ref name=":1" /> There are also many different goals and gaps between these types of movements, as well as barriers to producing an effective, influential message to inspire other to enact change.<ref name=":1" /> This prevents a solid, widespread message and specific goal from all environmental groups being produced.

=== Targeting of activists ===
The United States government through its domestic intelligence services targeted, as "domestic terrorists," environmental activists and climate change organizations, including by investigating them, questioning them, and placing them on national [[No fly list|"watchlist]]s" that makes it more difficult for them to board airplanes and that could instigate local law enforcement [[surveillance|monitoring]].<ref>The Guardian, 24 Sept. 2019, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/revealed-how-the-fbi-targeted-environmental-activists-in-domestic-terror-investigations?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other "Revealed: How the FBI Targeted Environmental Activists in Domestic Terror Investigations: Protesters Were Characterized as a Threat to National Security in What One Calls an Attempt to Criminalize their Actions"]</ref> Unknown actors also secretly hired professional hackers to launch [[phishing]] hacking attacks against climate activists who were organizing the [[ExxonMobil climate change controversy|

There have been coalitions of [[institutional investor]]s that have promulgated climate activism.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal |last1=Condon |first1=Madison |date=March 2020 |title=Externalities and the Common Owner |url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/992 |journal=Washington Law Review |volume=95 |issue=1 |page=1}}</ref>  These initiatives have sometimes included expansive group efforts, such as Climate Action 100+ - a coalition over 300 institutional investors (including some of the largest greenhouse emitters).<ref>{{cite web |date=2021 |title=Global Investors Driving Business Transition |url=https://www.climateaction100.org/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212192514/http://www.climateaction100.org/ |archive-date=2017-12-12 |access-date=2021-05-15 |website=Climate Action 100+}}</ref>  Institutional activism is not uncommon, despite the common assumption that shareholder interests would be averse to such action.<ref name="auto" />  However, industry-wide efforts to mitigate climate risks is often in the interest of heavily diversified firms, as climate change can have a strong effect on the global economy.<ref name="auto" />

===Climate Mobilization===
{{Main|The Climate Mobilization}}

Since 2014, growing portions of the climate movement, especially in the United States have been organizing for an international economic response to climate change on the scale of the mobilization of the American [[home front during World War II]], with the goal of rapidly slashing carbon emissions and transitioning to 100% clean energy faster than the free market is likely to allow. Throughout 2015 and 2016, [[The Climate Mobilization]] led grassroots campaigns in the U.S. for this scale of ambition, and in July 2016, activists succeeded in getting text adopted into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s national platform calling for WWII-scale climate mobilization.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greene |first1=Russell |date=19 July 2016 |title=Beyond Paris: Finding the Courage to Face the Climate Emergency |work=CommonDreams |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/07/19/beyond-paris-finding-courage-face-climate-emergency}}</ref> In August 2015, environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] published an article in the [[The New Republic|New Republic]] rallying Americans to "declare war on climate change."<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKibben |first1=Bill |date=15 August 2016 |title=We Need to Literally Declare War on Climate Change |magazine=New Republic |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii}}</ref>

=== Youth Climate Movement ===
Youth all over the world have been striking, advocating, and volunteering for climate solutions. Youth climate action groups such as [[SustainUS]], [[School Strike for Climate|Fridays for Future]], and the [[Sunrise Movement]] have called on young people to hold leaders accountable, whether through attending conferences,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-06-14 |title=Our Impact {{!}} SustainUS |url=https://sustainus.org/our-impact/ |access-date=2021-12-14 |language=en-US}}</ref> striking from school and pressuring politicians to listen to scientists,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fridays for Future – How Greta started a global movement |url=https://fridaysforfuture.org/what-we-do/who-we-are/ |access-date=2021-12-14 |website=Fridays For Future |language=en-GB}}</ref>  or calling for greater green jobs and consolidating voting power.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About The Sunrise Movement |url=https://www.sunrisemovement.org/about/ |access-date=2021-12-14 |website=Sunrise Movement |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2020 the United Nations Secretary General launched the global Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change, selecting seven members who meet to represent the changes youth are demanding globally.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nations |first=United |title=To the Secretary-General: youth press for climate priorities |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/yag-meeting |access-date=2021-12-14 |website=United Nations |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Nations |first=United |title=The Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/youth-in-action/youth-advisory-group |access-date=2021-12-14 |website=United Nations |language=en}}</ref>

Youth involvement in pro-climate action movements has increased significantly in the 21st century, and has intensified over the past few years.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.3390/su131911119 | doi-access=free | title="These Are the Very Small Things That Lead Us to That Goal": Youth Climate Strike Organizers Talk about Activism Empowering and Taxing Experiences | year=2021 | last1=Budziszewska | first1=Magdalena | last2=Głód | first2=Zuzanna | journal=Sustainability | volume=13 | issue=19 | page=11119 }}</ref> Youth climate activists have used social media platforms as a vehicle to engage and protest with the current environmental issue. After Greta Thunberg started the youth movement "[[School Strike for Climate|Strikes for Climate]]" by protesting outside the Swedish Parliament in 2018, she documented her journey on Twitter, where she built a network to promote her cause and call people to action.<ref>Astor, Maggie. 2018. “7 Times in History When Students Turned to Activism.” New York Times, March 05. Retrieved February 18, 2021 (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/student-protest-movements.html).</ref> The youth climate movement starts shifting from the traditional way to the social media platforms and it will continue in the future.

Younger generations are paying more attention to global events, particularly climate change. Research shows that climate change is of greater concern among younger people than older people. Over 70% of Americans aged 18 to 34 worry about global warming compared with 62% of those 35 to 54 and 56% who are 55 or older.<ref name="Reinhart, RJ. 2021">Reinhart, RJ. “Global Warming Age Gap: Younger Americans Most Worried.” Gallup.com, Gallup, 20 Nov. 2021, news.gallup.com/poll/234314/global-warming-age-gap-younger-americans-worried.aspx.</ref> Corner claims that across European countries, young people tend to have similar or higher levels of concern than adults and have a higher sense of risk perception.<ref name="Reinhart, RJ. 2021"/> Younger generations are more likely to have learned through general education about climate change in their schooling, and to be aware of the negative effects that climate change has brought to the Earth. In addition, they also see climate change as a more serious global event that is relevant to themselves because they will be more impacted, and thus should take the lead on addressing climate change.

When the pandemic hit, most school strikes movements around the world continued to be held, but moved more onto social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, etc), resulting in lower participation rates. However, participation in youth climate movement on social media continued to rise. Social media provided an outlet for youth to share their concerns, generate knowledge, and be more politically active since they are not yet able to vote and face logistical limitations in face-to-face participation.<ref>Seo, Hyunjin et al. “Teens’ Social Media and Collective Action.”New Media and Society 16(6):883-902.</ref><ref>Velasquez, Alcides and Robert LaRose. 2015. “Youth Collective Activism through Social Media: The Role of Collective Efficacy.” New Media and Society 17(6):899-918.</ref>

The research found that activists in their study created a sense of connection to other young people and other climate change activists.<ref>Wielk, Emily and Alecea Standlee. 2021. “Fighting for Their Future: An Exploratory Study of Online Community Building in the Youth Climate Change Movement.” Qualitative Sociology Review 1 7(2):22-37. R etrieved M onth, Year ( <nowiki>http://www.qualitativesociologyreview</nowiki>. org/ENG/archive_eng.php). DOI: <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.18778/1733-8077.17.2.02</nowiki></ref> They usually post their activist identities on their social media account profile. (For example, @GretaThunberg, a young climate activist #climatechange#climatestrike #youthmovement). What they share in common is that they try to inspire others to do the same in their communities by showcasing themselves as climate activists with a strong voice. The strategy for younger activists is to situate themselves within a specific role to create a relevant identity to others and make connections with other people on the internet. Thus, regardless of which side the activists are going to support, they are utilizing their social media as a medium to communicate with others in a shared way. They are playing an important role focused on engaging a range of supporters worldwide to join in the youth climate movement.{{Excerpt|Youth Climate Movement}}YOUNGO is the official children and youth Constituency of the UNFCCC, with members up to 35 years old.

=== 2023 Climate Protests  ===
{{Further|2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference}}
In November 2023 around 70,000 people participated in a climate march in Amsterdam, Netherlands, 10 days before the elections in the country. This was the biggest climate march in the history of the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Thousands March Through Amsterdam Calling for Climate Action Ahead of Dutch General Election |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-through-amsterdam-calling-for-climate-action-ahead-of-dutch-general-election-/7351658.html |access-date=15 November 2023 |agency=VOA |publisher=Associated Press |date=12 November 2023}}</ref>

Many climate protests are scheduled for the [[2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] including a climate march in London. The conference has created many protests, as the head of the conference is at the same time the head of the oil company ADNOC which according to one research "is planning the largest expansion of oil and gas production of any company in the world."<ref>{{cite web |title=COP28: How you can campaign to call for action on the climate crisis |url=https://cafod.org.uk/news/campaigning-news/cop28-how-you-can-campaign-to-call-for-action-on-the-climate-crisis |website=CAFOD |access-date=15 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Climate activists to gather across the UK as part of the COP28 Global Day of Action |url=https://www.sustainweb.org/news/nov23-cop28-global-day-of-action-uk/ |website=Sustain |access-date=15 November 2023}}</ref>
