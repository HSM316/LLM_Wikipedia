'''The Lansdowne Club''' is a [[Social club|private members' club]] in [[London]], [[England]] occupying a large building, notable in its own right. It was established in 1935 and occupies most of 9 Fitzmaurice Place, a street connecting [[Berkeley Square]] to [[Curzon Street]] in [[Mayfair]].

==History==
{{see also|Lansdowne House}}
The club formed later than many [[List of gentlemen's clubs in London|London clubs]], and it permitted women from its inception. It has always had a relatively young membership, with an active social scene. The building's main [[Robert Adam|Adam]] and otherwise 1930s [[Art Deco]] interiors, with some authentic frontages, mean it has been Grade II* listed since its first assessment in 1970. This is the mid-category of [[listed building]], a statutory scheme of protection which has a pyramidal hierarchy.

In 1930, [[Westminster City Council]] decided to improve access to Berkeley Square by creating an extra road into the square. This was accomplished by demolishing half of the main range of [[Lansdowne House]], which stood since the 1760s. What remained was given a new frontage and a newly renovated interior, and became the Lansdowne Club. The 'First Drawing Room' was thus taken to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], and the 'Dining Room' exists in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

The venue was founded as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing' and their families, and unlike many rivals, it had no vocational, artistic, or political 'theme'. Its facilities include a ballroom, a terrace, a fencing Salle and a basement gym with Art Deco swimming pool. Internally architecture is extremely unusual; some is modern for its type, being significantly Art Deco, as opposed to [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]/[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]/[[Edwardian]] styles. The Adam Room and other parts of the club on the ground floor are Georgian though.

The building underwent extensive renovation and further modernisation in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-209730-lansdowne-club-greater-london-authority|title = Lansdowne Club, City of Westminster, Westminster}}</ref> Resident fencing coach, {{abbreviation|Prof.|Professor}} Wojciechowski, is official coach of the British Olympic squad.
