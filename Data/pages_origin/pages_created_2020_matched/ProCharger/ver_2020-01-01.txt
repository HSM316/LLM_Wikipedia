==History==
ProCharger was incorporated in December 1993,<ref>[http://www.manta.com/c/mm4v77g/accessible-technologies-inc Accessible Technologies Inc (Accessible Technologies, Inc) - Lenexa, Kansas (KS) | Company Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and its initial supercharger systems were for 5.0 Mustangs and carbureted Chevrolet applications.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WaxglIaVPh4C&pg=PA46&dq=%22ProCharger%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RACIT7uxNsWi2gXr7aTnCQ&ved=0CE0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22ProCharger%22&f=false Sport Compact Turbos & Blowers - Joe Pettitt - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ProCharger was originally located in a leased property in Lenexa, KS. In December 1998 it moved into a building designed specifically for the company, and that building was expanded in 2004. In 2010, the company acquired control of a second building, adjacent to the primary building.[[File:ProCharger Headquarters.jpg|350px|thumb|right|ATI ProCharger headquarters]]

==Products and Distribution==

The company manufactures ProCharger superchargers and supercharger systems for a variety of applications, including automotive, truck, motorcycle, UTV ([[utility terrain vehicle]]) and marine.  ProChargers are distributed primarily through a network of dealers who have installation and calibration capabilities.  The company also designs aircraft deicing compressors and industrial blowers, blower packages and compressors  through its Inovair division.

==Manufacturing==
Superchargers, supercharger systems and subassemblies are manufactured in-house on [[Numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) equipment, utilizing [[Coordinate-measuring machine|coordinate measuring machines]] (CMM's), balancing equipment, run-in stands and other equipment to verify quality during the production and assembly process. Billet impellers are manufactured from large diameter sticks of 7075 T-6 aluminum, which are cut to height on the saw, contoured on a CNC lathe and then machined on a CNC mill (5 axis, 4 axis or 3 axis, depending on complexity).  On its street-legal superchargers, ProCharger offers a choice of noise levels, with the quieter "stealth" gearset featuring a helical design.<ref>[http://www.mustangandfords.com/techarticles/engine/mdmp_1110_mmf_tech_supercharger_systems_and_upgrades_pressurized_power/index.html Supercharger Systems and Upgrades - Pressurized Power - Modified Mustangs & Fords Magazine]</ref>  Quality control includes running every supercharger that leaves the facility, rather than random sampling.<ref>[http://blogs.truckinweb.com/6736505/opinions/procharger-hq-tour/ Procharger HQ Tour Truckin Magazine]</ref>  The engineering team utilizes 3D [[computer-aided design]] software, rapid prototyping equipment, a large test lab, and engine and chassis dynamometers during the R&D process.<ref>[http://www.stangtv.com/tech-stories/power-adders/procharger-shop-tour-how-superchargers-are-made/ ProCharger Shop Tour: How Superchargers Are Made - StangTV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Industry Contributions==
Among its initial industry contributions, ProCharger was the first to offer a complete intercooled supercharger system for the aftermarket performance industry<ref>5.0 Mustang and Super Ford, June 2000.</ref><ref>[http://www.mustang50magazine.com/techarticles/36298_ati_procharger_sc_supercharger/index.html ATI ProCharger SC Supercharger - 5.0 Mustang & Super Fords Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In track testing in July 1994, the automotive press documented an improvement in quarter mile performance of 2 seconds and 16&nbsp;mph on a stock 1993 Cobra running 9 psi in 97 degree weather, utilizing an intercooled ProCharger system.<ref>Muscle Mustangs and Fast Fords, November 1994, pp 134-144.</ref>

In 1995, an intercooled ProCharger system became the first supercharger system to receive an emissions exemption (CARB EO # D-365) for an application running more than 8 psi of boost, receiving that exemption for a 14 psi intercooled supercharger system for a 5.0 Mustang.<ref>Muscle Mustangs and Fast Fords, April 2002</ref> In 1996, ProCharger was the first company to offer complete intercooled supercharger systems for marine applications.<ref>"Powerboat" Magazine, March 1998</ref>

In 2000, Doug Mangrum became the first racer to run faster than a 7.0 ET (elapsed time) in the quarter mile using a centrifugal supercharger. Donny Walsh and Jim Summers soon followed with 6-second quarter mile passes in the same year, with all 3 using a ProCharger supercharger and also exceeding 200&nbsp;mph. The supercharger design used by these 3 racers includes a patented “bearing within a bearing” design for the high speed output shaft.

In 2006, Bo Butner, running a ProCharger supercharger, became the first racer to win a championship in NHRA running a centrifugal supercharger, which had previously been outlawed in NHRA.<ref>[http://sportsman.nhra.com/apcm/APCMviewer_sp.asp?a=17635&print=yes NHRA.com - Lucas Oil Comp Champion: Bo Butner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The company began manufacturing intercooled supercharger systems for Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2006. That product included several patented design elements, and this H-D supercharger kit in 2006 was awarded a Popular Mechanics award for Design and Innovation,<ref>Popular Mechanics, December 2006</ref> and then in 2008 achieved further industry recognition as the Easyriders Performance Product of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vtwin-expo.com/pdfs/AMD%20118%20Page%2021-37.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128041351/http://www.vtwin-expo.com/pdfs/AMD%20118%20Page%2021-37.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-28 }}</ref>
