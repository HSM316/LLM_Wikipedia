== Life and work ==
Livingston was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. As a child, her single mother moved the family to rural western New York, including time on the [[Tonawanda Reservation]], before returning with her seven children to northeast Rochester. 

Livingston's family attended Corpus Christi Church led by Father [[James Callan]] where she was one of the first [[female altar servers]] and participated in anti-nuclear protests at the [[Seneca Army Depot]], and, later, actions against the first [[Gulf War]]. Her experiences of [[Roman Catholicism]] and urban and rural [[poverty in the United States]] during the 1970s and 1980s largely inform her work, and are the basis for her award-winning memoir ''Ghostbread''.<ref>https://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/rochester/sonja-livingston-on-discovery-through-memoir/Content?oid=2753197</ref> 
 
Her writing is marked by lyricism and a focus on place. She has said: 
''The job of the writer - especially the nonfiction writer - is to get beyond easy categories and judgments. As someone who grew up in a family and setting that are very easily judged (often harshly and incorrectly) I'm especially sensitive to those things, the wrong they do, and the ways they falsely divide us.''<ref>http://appalachianheritage.net/2016/08/31/interview-sonja-livingston/</ref>
