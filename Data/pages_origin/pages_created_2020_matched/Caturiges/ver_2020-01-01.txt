The '''Caturiges''' ({{lang-la|Caturĭges}}, {{lang-el|Κατόριγες}}) were a [[Ligures|Ligurian tribe]]  in the ancient Roman province of [[Alpes Maritimae]], at first located on the ''Druentia'' river (modern [[Durance]]), towards its source, west of ''Vapincum'' (modern [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]]), but later extending into [[Vienne, Isère|Viennensis]] and [[Narbonensis]].<ref name="Hazlitt">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0134.html |title=William Hazlitt, ''The Classical Gazetteer'' (1851), p. 132 |access-date=2009-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606012118/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0134.html |archive-date=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their capital was ''Catorimagus'' (or ''Caturigomagus''), also known as ''Caturiges'' (modern [[Chorges]]), situated between ''Dea [[Vocontii|Vocontiorum]]'' (modern [[Die, Drôme|Die]]) and ''Ebrodunum'' (modern [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]).<ref name="Hazlitt"/>
The tribal name is derived from the theonym [[Caturix]], a Gallic war god who was identified with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in [[Gallo-Roman religion]].

The Caturiges are mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] ([[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]], 1.10):
:''... Here (in the Alps) the [[Ceutrones]] and the [[Graioceli]] and the '''Caturiges''', having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the [[Vocontii]] in the Further Province on the seventh day from [[Avigliana|Ocelum]], which is the most remote town of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the [[Allobroges]], ...''<ref>Caesar, ''Bell. Gall.'' I 10,4</ref>
