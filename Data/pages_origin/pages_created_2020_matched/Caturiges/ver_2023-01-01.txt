{{short description|Gallic tribe}}
The '''Caturiges''' ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]: ''Caturīges'', 'kings of combat') were a [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe dwelling in the upper [[Durance]] valley, around present-day towns of [[Chorges]] and [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], during the [[La Tène culture|Iron Age]] and the [[Roman period]].

== Name ==
They are mentioned as ''Caturiges'' by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] (mid-1st c. BC) and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (1st c. AD),<ref>[[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/caesar-gallic_wars/1917/pb_LCL072.17.xml 1:10:4]; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. ''Naturalis Historia'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL352.93.xml 3:125], [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL352.103.xml 3:137].</ref> and as ''Katourgídōn'' (Κατουργίδων) by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd c. AD).<ref>[[Ptolemy]]. ''Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis'', 3:1:35.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Falileyev|2010}}, s.v. ''Caturiges''.</ref>

The [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] [[ethnonym]] ''Caturīges'' (<small>sing.</small> ''Caturix'') literally means 'kings of combat'. It stems from the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]] root ''catu''- ('combat, battle') attached to ''rīges'' ('kings').{{sfn|Lambert|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Delamarre|2003|pp=111, 261}}

The city of [[Chorges]], attested in the 4th c. AD as ''Caturrigas'' (''Cadorgas'' in 1062, ''Chaorgias'' in 1338), is named after the tribe.{{sfn|Nègre|1990|p=153}}

== Geography ==

=== Territory ===
The Caturiges dwelled in the upper course of the [[Durance]] river.{{sfn|Graßl|2006}} Their territory was located east of the [[Tricorii]], [[Avantici]] and [[Edenates]] (further west lived the [[Vocontii]]), south of the [[Brigianii]] and [[Quariates]], west of the [[Veneni]] and [[Soti (tribe)|Soti]], and north of the [[Savincates]].<ref>{{harvnb|Talbert|2000}}, Map 17: Lugdunum.</ref> They were probably clients to the larger Vocontian people as part of their confederation.{{Sfn|Kruta|2000|p=526}}

Initially part of the province of [[Alpes Cottiae]] after the Roman conquest, the Caturiges were integrated into the province of [[Alpes Maritimae]] during the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284–305 AD).{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}

=== Settlements ===
Their chief town was known as [[Ebrodunum|Eburodunum]] (modern [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]), located on a rocky plinth that dominated the Durance river. It was an important station on the route between Gaul the [[Italian Peninsula]].{{Sfn|Rivet|1988|p=338}}{{sfn|Lafond|Walser|2006}} After the western part of the province of [[Alpes Cottiae]] was transferred to the [[Alpes Maritimae]] under [[Diocletian]] (284–305), Eburodunum replaced [[Cemenelum]] as the capital of the Alpes Maritimae.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graßl|first=Herbert|date=2006|title=Alpes Maritimae|journal=Brill's New Pauly|doi=10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e116390|ref=none}}</ref>

Caturigomagus ('market of the Caturiges'; modern [[Chorges]]) was a frontier city located on the route to Italy via the [[Col de Montgenèvre]], in the western part of the Caturigian territory near the border between the [[Alpes Cottiae|Regnum Cottii]] and the [[Vocontii|Vocontian confederation]]. Probably outshined by the neighbouring Eburodunum and Vappincum ([[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]]), the city declined in the 4th century AD and was not listed as ''civitates'' by the ''[[Notitia Galliarum]]'' ca. 400.{{Sfn|Barruol|2004|pp=403–404}}

== History ==
According to Pliny, the Caturiges were originally part of the [[Insubres]].{{sfn|Graßl|2006}} The presence of a ''Mars Caturix'' in another town named Eburodunum ([[Yverdon-les-Bains]], Switzerland), as well as other mentions near [[Barrois]], in the [[Po Valley]], and perhaps in [[Haute-Savoie]], may indicate ancient migrations, although their period and direction remain unknown.{{Sfn|Barruol|1969|p=344}}
{{Blockquote|text=Other communities that have perished are the Caturiges, an exiled section of the Insubrians...|source={{harvnb|Pliny|1938}}, ''Naturalis Historia'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL352.93.xml 3:125].}}
In the mid-first century BC, the Caturiges are mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] as a tribe hostile to Rome. In what appears to be a concerted attack, they attempted to prevent his passage through the upper [[Durance]] along with the [[Ceutrones]] and [[Graioceli]] in 58 BC.{{sfn|Barruol|1969|p=43}}{{sfn|Rivet|1988|p=335}}

{{Blockquote|text=There [Titus Labienus] enrolled two legions, and brought out of winter quarters three that were wintering about Aquileia; and with these five legions made speed to march by the shortest route to Further Gaul, over the Alps. In that region the Ceutrones, the Graioceli, and the Caturiges, seizing points on the higher ground, essayed to stop the march of his army. They were repulsed in several actions; and on the seventh day he moved from Ocelum, the last station of Hither Gaul, into the borders of the Vocontii in Further Gaul.|source={{harvnb|Caesar|1917}}, ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/caesar-gallic_wars/1917/pb_LCL072.17.xml 1:10:4].}}

They are mentioned by Pliny the Elder as one of the Alpine tribes conquered by Rome in 16–15 BC, and whose name was engraved on the [[Tropaeum Alpium]].{{sfn|Graßl|2006}}<ref name="Pliny">[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. ''Naturalis Historia'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL352.103.xml 3:20].</ref> They also appear on the [[Arch of Augustus (Susa)|Arch of Susa]], erected by [[Cottius]] in 9–8 BC.{{sfn|Barruol|1969|p=32}}
