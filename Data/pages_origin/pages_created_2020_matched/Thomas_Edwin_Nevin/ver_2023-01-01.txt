'''Thomas Edwin Nevin''' (4 October 1906 in [[Bristol]], [[Somerset]] – 16 July 1986 in [[Dublin]]) was an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[physicist]] and [[Academic personnel|academic]] who had a distinguished career in the field of [[Spectroscopy#Molecules|molecular spectroscopy]].<ref name=medal/> He was Professor of [[Experimental Physics]] and Dean of the Faculty of Science in [[University College Dublin]] from 1963 to 1979.<ref>[http://www.ucd.ie/sciencealumnipartners/aboutus/history/ucddeansofscience/ UCD Deans of Science] Professor Thomas E. Nevin, Experimental Physics: 1963-1976</ref>

==Personal life==
Thomas E. Nevin was born in Bristol, Somerset on 4 October 1906.<ref>[https://www.ukbmd.org.uk/ UKBMD  Births, Marriages, Deaths and Censuses on the internet]</ref> He was the eldest of seven children born to Thomas Nevin of [[Cashel, County Tipperary]], and Alice Nevin (née Higginson) of [[Herefordshire]]. Áine Ní Chnáimhín (1908–2001) who wrote a biography of [[Pádraic Ó Conaire]] was Nevin's sister; historian and trade unionist [[Donal Nevin]] was his brother.<ref>[https://www.ainm.ie/Bio.aspx?ID=1643 Ní Chnáimhín, Áine (1908–2001)] [[Dublin City University]]</ref>

In January 1936 he married Monica T. M. Morrissey, a UCD graduate in [[Celtic studies]] who went on to serve on the Council of the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] and did research on antiquarian matters for ''Irish History Online''.<ref>[https://catalogues.ria.ie/Presto/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=KElyaXNoX0hpc3RvcnlfT25saW5lLmF1dGhvcjoobmV2aW4gbW9uaWNhKSk=&qcf=NjY3NGZmNzQtY2IwYi00MWU0LWIwYWYtY2MxNzA5NTk4YWVi Author: Monica Nevin] Irish History Online</ref> The couple had four daughters together.<ref name="dictionary" />

==Education and career==
Born in 1906 in Bristol, England, the oldest of seven children of an Irish father and English mother, the family soon settled in Ireland where he spent his youth. From 1919 to 1924 he attended the [[CBS Sexton Street]] secondary school in [[Limerick City]]. The school had no science program, but Nevin was interested in physics and managed to learn the subject pretty thoroughly on his own. In 1924 he got a scholarship to University College Dublin, where he excelled in mathematics and physics, winning [[first-class honours]] every year, and earning an honours B.Sc. in [[Experimental Physics]] and Mathematics in 1927. He got his M.Sc. under [[John James Nolan|J.J. Nolan]] in 1928 for a treatise on "The Effect of Water Vapour on the Diffusion Coefficients and Mobilities of Ions in the Air". That year he was also awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]], which enabled him to study [[spectroscopy]] at [[Imperial College, London]] (1929–1931). In 1931, he returned to Dublin to continue his research and was appointed an assistant in the department of experimental physics.<ref name=dictionary>[http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do? Nevin, Thomas Edwin (1906–86)] Dictionary of Irish biography</ref>

In 1940, he was awarded a D.Sc. degree at [[National University of Ireland]] for previously published work, and in 1942, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at [[Queen's University Belfast]].<ref name=dictionary/> Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he continued his research in molecular spectroscopy, often working with research groups in fundamental particle and cosmic ray physics. He was a capable administrator at UCD, serving on the university's finance and buildings committees, as well as the [[academic council]] and governing body, and he initiated many improvements to the physics department. When [[J. J. Nolan]] died in 1952, Nevin succeeded him as Professor of Experimental Physics, a position he held until his retirement in 1979.

Nevin was a strong advocate for expansion of the UCD campus, which for half a century was based at Earlsfort Terrace in the city. As a key member of UCD's academic council and a member of its buildings committee (1957–76), he was instrumental in moving the science faculty to the new [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]] campus in the southern suburbs in 1964.

He was a key figure in the formation of the Irish branch of [[Institute of Physics]].<ref name=IOP_anniversary>[http://www.iopireland.org/about/history/file_49872.pdf 40th Anniversary Newsletter] Institute of Physics in Ireland, Series 5, No 10, September 2004</ref><ref name=IOP_history>[http://www.iopireland.org/about/history/index.html About Us: Early History of IOP in Ireland] The Institute of Physics in Ireland</ref>

At the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] he was a member of the governing boards of the school of theoretical physics (1943-1961) and the school of cosmic physics (1948-1956).<ref>[https://www.dias.ie/category/dias/dias-councilgbspast/page/4/ School of Theoretical Physics: Council and Governing Boards as at 31/3/1960: Appointed Members] Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS)</ref>
On 16 March 1942 he was elected a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and served on its council from 1944 to 1968.

The Thomas E. Nevin Medal and Prize is given annually, in honour of Nevin, to the graduate who passes with first-class honours and is placed first in the BSc (Honours) degree examination in Physics, at the University College Dublin..<ref name=medal>[https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/W_HU_REPORTING.P_DISPLAY_QUERY?p_query=SC101-1A&p_parameters=06EC1B771E596A89BFDBC88ED2A4CD5FE3644D47681FC679BB3F9EA17BDCE18F6E66596A3CB22900D29DECFFF4D54FD5377B92AC796A6DD59CF2BA6FE0882C0D23D63CC8F1196811809242B65431DCB6D153CC01CC695924DB95840104799010E556D8EDBFFA7DF523045D86B783F76B Long Description] Thomas E.
