The company was initially destined to replace foreign-owned [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] as the states primary oil company, but due to company inefficiencies, personal rivalries and corruption, instead it was decided to make it "Saudized" Aramco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hertog-saudi/the-one-thing-in-saudi-arabia-that-works-well-is-under-threat-idUSKCN0VD177|title=The one thing in Saudi Arabia that works well is under threat|date=4 February 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29865/1/Petromin_the_Slow_Death_of_Statist_Oil_Development_in_Saudi_Arabia_(LSERO).pdf|title=Petromin: the slow death of statist oil development in Saudi Arabia|date=September 2008|work=LSE Research Online|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>
