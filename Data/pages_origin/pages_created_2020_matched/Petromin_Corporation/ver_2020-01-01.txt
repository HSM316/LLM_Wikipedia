The company was established by a [[royal decree]] on 22 November 1962<ref name=sher>{{cite journal|last=Hertog|first=Steffen|title=Petromin: the slow death of statist oil development in Saudi Arabia|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29865/1/Petromin_the_Slow_Death_of_Statist_Oil_Development_in_Saudi_Arabia_(LSERO).pdf|journal=Business history|year=2008|volume=50|issue=5|pages=645-667| doi=10.1080/00076790802246087|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> The initial name of the company was Petromin Lubricating Oil Company and was renamed to Saudi Arabian Lubricating Oil Company in 1997. It was established as a joint venture between [[Saudi Aramco]] and [[Mobil|Mobil investments]] and started production at its first blending plant in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia|Jeddah]], in 1970.<ref>[http://www.petromin.com/index.php?q=en/about/background/130 Official Website] Company Information</ref><ref>[http://www.tradeboss.com/default.cgi/action/viewcompanies/companyid/559801/ www.tradeboss.com/ Petromin Corporation Petromin Corporation] ''Trade Boss''. Retrieved 7 July 2014.</ref> The first director general of the company was Abdulhadi Taher.<ref name=sher/>

The company was initially destined to replace foreign-owned [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco]] as the states primary oil company, but due to company inefficiencies, personal rivalries and corruption, the prince of [[Saudi Arabia|SA]] decided instead to "Saudiized" Aramco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hertog-saudi/the-one-thing-in-saudi-arabia-that-works-well-is-under-threat-idUSKCN0VD177|title=The one thing in Saudi Arabia that works well is under threat|date=February 4, 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29865/1/Petromin_the_Slow_Death_of_Statist_Oil_Development_in_Saudi_Arabia_(LSERO).pdf|title=Petromin: the slow death of statist oil development in Saudi Arabia|date=September 2008|work=LSE Research Online|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

In May 2003, Petromin became one of the first companies to obtain international [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO Certification]] for their Quality and [[Integrated Management]] Systems ([[ISO 9000#Contents of ISO 9001:2015|ISO 9001]]:2015). The company has since been re-certified in 2014 and received the [[OHSAS 18001]]:2007 certification for their [[Health management system|Health]] and [[Safety Management Systems]] at the Jeddah plant in 2017.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/OGN_332103.html|title=Petromin's Jeddah plant gets OHSAS certification|date=October 26, 2017|work=Trade Arabia|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.petromin.com/pioneering/|title=ISO Achievements|date=|work=Petromin Corporation| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.petromin.com/environmental-policy/|title=Petromin Integrated Management System Policy|date=|work=Petromin Corporation|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

It was established to be the statist oil development of Saudi Arabia because at that time Aramco was 100% American owned. Under the responsibility of Dr. [[Abdulhadi H. Taher]], Petromin became an industrial behemoth with tens of thousands of employees. It was responsible for all oil exploration, refining, and distribution of all petroleum and mineral resources in the kingdom that were not in the domain of then US-controlled oil concessionaire Aramco. After the Kingdom purchased Aramco from the americans, Petromin and most of its industrial developments were infused into it.

In 2007, Petromin was a joint venture between Mobil Investments (29% stake) and [[Saudi Aramco]] (71% stake), and was purchased by Dabbagh Group and Gulf Oil Corporation, a subsidiary of Indian [[Hinduja Group]], for $200 million. Dabbagh took a 51% stake and Hinduja a 49% stake in the new [[joint venture]].

In 2008, the company was renamed to its current name Petromin Corporation.<ref name="company">{{cite web| url=https://www.domain-b.com/industry/oil_gas/20130409_dabbagh_group.html|title=Saudi Arabia's Dabbagh Group in talks to buy Hinduja's stake in Petromin JV|date=April 9, 2013|work=Domain-B|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
