He also made 12 appearances for the [[Estonia national bandy team]] and [[Estonia men's national ice hockey team|Estonia national ice hockey team]].

Sillak was born in [[Märjamaa]] in 1906, and began playing for [[SK Tallinna Sport|Sport]] in 1923. He earned his first cap for the [[Estonia national football team|Estonian national team]] in 1929, and became a mainstay in the defensive line in the 1930s.

==Early life==
Sillak was born in [[Märjamaa]].<ref>https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/47050/Karl_Rudolf_Silberg_Sillak.html</ref> He began playing football in 1919, at age 13, with the [[SK Tallinna Sport|Sport]] U19 academy.

==Club career==
Sillak began playing with Sport's senior team in 1923. That year, Sport, who had won the previous two [[Meistriliiga]], lost to [[JK Tallinna Kalev|Kalev Tallinn]]. After the loss that year, Sillak and [[Eugen Einman]] constituted a strong defensive line which resulted in Sport winning the Meistriliiga in [[1924 Estonian Football Championship|1924]], [[1925 Estonian Football Championship|1925]], and [[1927 Estonian Football Championship|1927]]. Although Einman was transferred to [[Tallinna JK|Tallinna Jalgpalliklubi]] in 1927, Sillak also won the Meistriliiga in [[1929 Estonian Football Championship|1929]], [[1931 Estonian Football Championship|1931]], and [[1932 Estonian Football Championship|1932]].

After winning the Meistriliiga in 1932, Sillak was transferred to Tallinna Jalgpalliklubi. He played for the club until 1940, the final official year of the Meistriliiga until 1945, when Estonia became part of the Soviet Union, and the Meistriliiga became the Estonian SSR Football Championship.

Sillak played briefly for [[FC Tskhinvali|Spartaki]] in the [[Erovnuli Liga|Georgian SSR Football Championship]], playing sparingly until his retirement in 1951.<ref>http://www.esbl.ee/biograafia/Karl-Rudolf_Sillak</ref>
