'''Redistricting in Virginia''' has been a controversial topic due to allegations of [[gerrymandering]]. In the 2017 Virginia General Assembly, all of the redistricting reform bills were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/2017/02/14/virginia-house-panel-rejects-redistricting-reform-bills/97908772/ |title=Virginia House panel rejects redistricting reform bills |publisher=Newsleader.com |date=2017-02-14 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref>

== Constitutional requirements ==
The [[Virginia Constitution]] states: <blockquote>"Members of the House of Representatives of the United States and members of the Senate and of the House of Delegates of the General Assembly shall be elected from electoral districts established by the General Assembly. Every electoral district shall be composed of contiguous and compact territory and shall be so constituted as to give, as nearly as is practicable, representation in proportion to the population of the district. The General Assembly shall reapportion the Commonwealth into electoral districts in accordance with this section in the year 2011 and every ten years thereafter."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section6/ |title=Constitution of Virginia - Article II.

==Congressional districts==
The Republican Party lost one of its seats in Congress when a federal court redrew [[Virginia's 4th congressional district]]. A suit claimed the district had been racially gerrymandered to give an advantage to white Republicans. The ruling in that case found that the General Assembly in 2012 unconstitutionally packed too many black voters into [[Bobby Scott (politician)|Bobby Scott]]'s district, weakening the clout of blacks in nearby districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/supreme-court-rejects-request-to-delay-virginia-s-new-congressional/article_a58cb516-47f1-5654-97ff-ff88a63fbd0e.html |title=Supreme Court rejects request to delay Virginia's new congressional districts &#124; Virginia Politics |publisher=pilotonline.com |date=2016-02-01 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref> This ruling allowed Democrat [[Donald McEachin]] to represent the 4th District in the newly convened U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewjournalandguide.com/2017/01/26/momentum-grows-in-virginia-to-improve-redistricting-process/ |title=Momentum Grows In Virginia To Improve Redistricting Process - New Journal Guide |publisher=Thenewjournalandguide.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref>

==House of Delegates districts==
Delegate [[Mark L. Cole]] noted that even without gerrymandering, [[political polarization]] will exist because of the stark political differences between urban and rural areas, which makes drawing competitive districts impossible in some regions of the state.<ref>{{cite web|author=By GRAHAM MOOMAW Richmond Times-Dispatch |url=http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-redistricting-reform-efforts-dead-for-the-year-as-house/article_29711020-7228-5448-bfeb-f2b383d58ab7.html |title=Virginia redistricting reform efforts dead for the year as House kills bipartisan Senate proposals &#124; Virginia Politics |publisher=richmond.com |date=2017-02-14 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}</ref>

==Proposed reforms==
Article II, section 6 on apportionment states, "Members of the ... Senate and of the House of Delegates of the General Assembly shall be elected from electoral districts established by the General Assembly. Every electoral district shall be composed of contiguous and compact territory and shall be so constituted as to give, as nearly as is practicable, representation in proportion to the population of the district."<ref>[http://law.justia.com/constitution/virginia/constitution.html#2S6 Virginia Constitution Article II, section 6.

It made two recommendations for each state legislative house that showed maps of districts more compact and contiguous than those adopted by the General Assembly.<ref>[http://cnu.edu/redistrictingcommission/final_redistricting_commission_report.pdf The Public Interest in Redistricting] Bob Holsworth, Chair for the Independent Bipartisan Advisory Commission on Redistricting, Commonwealth of Virginia, April 1, 2011, p.22-27.</ref>

In 2011, the Virginia College and University Redistricting Competition was organized by Professors Michael McDonald of George Mason University and Quentin Kidd of Christopher Newport University. About 150 students on sixteen teams from thirteen schools submitted plans for legislative and U.S. Congressional Districts. They created districts more compact than the General Assembly's efforts. The "Division 1" maps conformed with the Governor's Executive Order, and did not address electoral competition or representational fairness. In addition to the criteria of contiguity, equipopulation, the federal Voting Rights Act and communities of interest in the existing city and county boundaries, "Division 2" maps in the competition did incorporate considerations of electoral competition and representational fairness. Judges for the cash award prizes were Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute.<ref>[http://cnu.edu/redistrictingcommission/final_redistricting_commission_report.pdf The Public Interest in Redistricting] Bob Holsworth, Chair for the Independent Bipartisan Advisory Commission on Redistricting, Commonwealth of Virginia, April 1, 2011, p.9-10</ref>

In January 2015, Republican State Senator [[Jill Holtzman Vogel]] of Winchester and Democratic State Senator [[Louise Lucas]] of Portsmouth sponsored a Senate Joint Resolution to establish additional criteria for the Virginia Redistricting Commission of four identified members of political parties, and three other independent public officials. The criteria began with respecting existing political boundaries, such as cities and towns, counties and magisterial districts, election districts and voting precincts. Districts are to be established on the basis of population, in conformance with federal and state laws and court cases, including those addressing racial fairness. The territory is to be contiguous and compact, without oddly shaped boundaries. The commission is prohibited from using political data or election results to favor either political party or incumbent. It passed with a two-thirds majority of 27 to 12 in the Senate, and was then referred to committee in the House of Delegates.<ref>[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?151+ful+SJ284S1 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 284] AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE (Proposed by the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on January 20, 2015) (Patrons Prior to Substitute--Senators Vogel and Lucas [SJR 224])</ref>

In 2015, at ''Vesilind v. Virginia State Board of Elections'' in a Virginia state court, plaintiffs sought to overturn the General Assembly's redistricting in five House of Delegate and six state Senate districts as violations of both the Virginia and U.S. Constitutions because they failed to represent populations in "continuous and compact territory".<ref>[http://redistricting.lls.edu/files/VA%20Vesilind%2020150914%20Complaint.pdf Vesilind v.
