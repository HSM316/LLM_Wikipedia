'''Ichigo Ichie''' is a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] ''[[kaiseki]]'' [[restaurant]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was awarded a [[Michelin star]] for 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/michelin-awards-2019-three-cork-restaurants-earn-one-star-status-1.3647891|title=Michelin awards 2019: three Cork restaurants earn one-star status}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetaste.ie/wp/miyazaki-ichigo-ichie-review/|title=Unforgettable Dining Unlike Anything Else in Ireland - Ichigo Ichie Review|date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

The restaurant name alludes to the Japanese idiom ''[[Ichi-go ichi-e]]'' (一期一会), literally "one time, one meeting", reminding people to cherish any gathering that they may take part in, citing the fact that many meetings in life are not repeated. Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated exactly.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/teainjapanessays00varl|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/teainjapanessays00varl/page/187 187]|quote=Ichigo Ichie.|title=Tea in Japan: Essays on the History of Chanoyu|first1=H.

The phrase “ichigo-ichie” has two parts: “ichigo” means “one life” and “ichie” means “a one-time encounter.” And so this is often translated as “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” This phrase originated with the tea ceremony, where it expresses the feelings of the host to show sincere hospitality towards guests.
