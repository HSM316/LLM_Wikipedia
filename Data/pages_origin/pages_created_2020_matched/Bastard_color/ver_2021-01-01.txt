In [[theatre lighting]], a '''bastard color''' is a color, typically in a [[color gel]], wherein the predominant color is blended with small amounts of complementary colors; for example, a "bastard orange" gel would produce predominantly [[orange (color)|orange]] light with undertones of [[blue]]. Bastard colors appear warmer and more natural than pure colors and are used to replicate [[Sunlight|natural light]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pnta.com/lighting/gels/e-colour-004-med-bastard-amber/ |title=Rosco E-Colour #004: Medium Bastard Amber |accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>
