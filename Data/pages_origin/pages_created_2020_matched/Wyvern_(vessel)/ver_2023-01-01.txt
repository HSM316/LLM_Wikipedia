'''''Wyvern''''' is a {{convert|60|ft|0|adj=on}} open sea sailing ship operated by [[Stavanger Museum#Stavanger Maritime Museum|Stavanger Maritime Museum]]. The ship was designed by [[Colin Archer]] on a commission from British-born Frederick Croft and was launched on 10 August 1897. She sailed under the German flag from 1909. The Norwegian newspaper editor [[Rolf Thommessen]] bought her in 1924 and renamed her ''{{lang|no|Havfruen III}}'' (''Mermaid III''). This name was kept by the English owners, Anne and Terrence Carr, who acquired her in 1947 and sold her to Christian-Frederick Mattner in 1970--who renamed her to the original 'Wyvern'.She was contracted for sale to a Norwegian consortium for £ 50 000 //of which £30 000 is still owed// after having been hijacked from San Antonio Ibiza.

In 1984, ''Wyvern'' was donated to the Stavanger Maritime Museum by local companies which had paid for her restoration. She sank in the [[Baltic Sea]] on 11 July 2013 during the [[Tall Ships' Races#2013|2013 Tall Ships' Race]]. The crew were rescued, but a member of a rescue team died during the accident. She was raised from the sea in August 2013 and returned to Stavanger. In December 2013, Her repairs started at a Denmark shipyard.

==History==
Frederick Croft, a timber merchant who was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] but lived in [[Skien]], Norway, commissioned the vessel in 1894 from [[Colin Archer]], a ship designer and ship builder who also built ''[[Fram (ship)|Fram]]'' for the explorer [[Fridtjov Nansen]]. The construction took place at the shipbuilding yard Porsgrund Baatbyggeri which was headed by Thor Martin Jensen. Named after the heraldic beast [[wyvern]], the vessel was launched in 1897. Croft used her among other things to sail to his hometown Hull.<ref name=smm>[http://www.museumstavanger.no/museene/stavanger-maritime-museum/wyvern/ The Colin Archer yacht Wyvern] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140909190056/http://www.museumstavanger.no/museene/stavanger-maritime-museum/wyvern/ |date=9 September 2014 }} Stavanger Maritime Museum.

She sailed, from 1909, under the German flag and the name ''Tatjana'', but later returned to Norway. Newspaper editor [[Rolf Thommessen]] bought her in 1924 and renamed her ''{{lang|no|Havfruen III}}'' (''Mermaid III''). This name was kept when she was sold in 1934 to the English couple Anne and Terrence Carr. They sailed her for 27 years.<ref name=smm/> The Carrs crossed the Atlantic twelve times and in the 1950s sailed around the world in the vessel.<ref name=smm/>

In 1970 she was acquired by Christian-Frederick Mattner and renamed back to "Wyvern'. In 1973/4 'Wyvern' was extensively restored in a Spanish Shipyard and registered in Panama. 

In 1978 'Wyvern'  was contracted, for Sterling£ 50000.- to a Norwegian consortium--which loaded Wyvern/ without the owners consent/onto a Norwegian Oil-supply ship/ without paying the Purchase monies in full/ Sterling £ 30000,- is still outstanding.
After an initiative by the [[Norwegian Maritime Museum]], she was brought back to Norway for restoration by companies in the oil industry in [[Rogaland]] in 1978.<ref>[http://www.aftenbladet.no/nyheter/lokalt/stavanger/Historien-bak-Wyvern-3213905.html#.UwAXZYXxZ-w Historien bak «Wyvern»] {{in lang|no}} ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''. 11 July 2013. Retrieved 16 February 2014</ref> In 1984, she was given to [[Stavanger Museum#Stavanger Maritime Museum|Stavanger Maritime Museum]] as a cultural monument by [[Crown Prince Haakon]]. Sailed by volunteers, she has represented Stavanger in several national and international sailing regattas and gatherings, including five Tall Ship races.<ref name=smm/>

==2013 shipwreck and salvage==
On 11 July 2013, during the [[Tall Ships' Races#2013|2013 Tall Ships' Race]], ''Wyvern'' started to take in water between the Swedish islands [[Gotland]] and [[Öland]].<ref name=nina>Nina Berglund (11 July 2013) [http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/07/11/historic-vessel-sinks-off-sweden/ Historic vessel sinks off Sweden] News in English.

Three crew members from the Dutch sailship ''[[Wylde Swan]]'', which also participated in the Tall Ships' race, went onboard ''Wyvern'' shortly before she sank in an attempt to rescue the vessel by pumping out water. Two of the crew were later rescued, but a third crew member went down with the ship.<ref>[http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/1969/fatal-accident-during-rescue-sailing-ship-july-11-2013 Fatal accident during rescue sailing ship, 11 July 2013] Dutch Safety Board.

Note from C>F>Mattner // owner 1970-1978; The fact of corroded keel bolts was known & disclosed, to the consortium which contracted to purchase Wyvern in 1978--the lack of funds to afford such a  repair, was  the reason for C.F. Mattner's decision selling the vessel.  

In December 2013, ''Wyvern'' sailed to Denmark for repairs at a shipyard.<ref>[http://www.museumstavanger.no/hjem/p/wyvern-til-danmark-for-restaurering?ctl=Details&neID=3582&mid=3166 Wyvern til Danmark for restaurering] Stavanger Maritime Museum. Retrieved 14 February 2014</ref>
