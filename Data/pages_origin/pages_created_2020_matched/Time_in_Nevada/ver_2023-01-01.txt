Almost all of [[Nevada]] is in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] ([[UTC]] -8). The few exceptions that exist all observe [[Mountain Time]] (UTC -7) and are close to the borders of [[Idaho]] or [[Utah]]. Other than these minor exceptions, Nevada is the only non coastal state to be entirely on Pacific Time, most of Idaho uses Mountain Time, and Arizona is officially on Mountain Time except for the 3/4 of the year when Daylight Saving Time is in effect, which they don't observe (other than the Navajo Nation).

[[Mountain Time]] is officially observed close to the border to Utah in:
* [[West Wendover, Nevada|West Wendover]], making [[Elko County, Nevada]] one of the few counties in the US that is split between two time zones.

[[Mountain Time]] is also unofficially observed in the following Idaho border areas:<ref>{{cite web|title=OnTimeZone.com Exceptions, Oddities, and Notes|url=http://ontimezone.com/exceptions.php|publisher=OnTimeZone.com|accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>
