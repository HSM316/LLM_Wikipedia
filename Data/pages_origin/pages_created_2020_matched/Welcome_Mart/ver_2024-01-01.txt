'''Welcome Mart''' was an Australian supermarket chain that was founded by David and Holdings in [[Canberra]] and [[New South Wales]] in 1992, the same time they rebranded some of Canberra's supermarkets as [[Festival IGA Supermarkets|Festival]]. They rebranded all the [[Foodmaster Supermarkets]]. The first stores opened in [[Downer, Australian Capital Territory|Downer]], [[Fraser, Australian Capital Territory|Fraser]], [[Dickson, Australian Capital Territory|Dickson]], [[McKellar, Australian Capital Territory|McKellar]], [[Melba, Australian Capital Territory|Melba]], [[Kingston, Australian Capital Territory|Kingston]], [[Kambah, Australian Capital Territory|Kambah]], [[Macquarie, Australian Capital Territory|Macquarie]], [[Queanbeyan]], [[Latham, Australian Capital Territory|Latham]], [[Holder, Australian Capital Territory|Holder]] and [[Isaacs, Australian Capital Territory|Isaacs]].

In 1994, one supermarket opened in [[Theodore, Australian Capital Territory|Theodore]].

Eventually, by 2014, almost all Welcome Mart Supermarkets were bought out. The Isaacs Welcome Mart was rebranded as a general supermarket in 2000, and in 2014, it rebranded and now operates as Shoplands.
