'''David Henry Benedictus''' (born 16 September 1938) is an English writer and theatre director, best known for his novels. His work includes the [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] novel ''[[Return to the Hundred Acre Wood]]'' (2009). It was the first such book in 81 years.

==Life==
Born in 1938 to Henry Jules and Kathleen Constance (Ricardo) Benedictus, he  was educated at [[Eton College]], [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and the [[University of Iowa]]. His first novel ''[[The Fourth of June]]'' was a best-seller and he adapted it for the London stage. His second novel, ''[[You're a Big Boy Now (novel)|You're a Big Boy Now]]'', was made into a [[You're a Big Boy Now|1966 feature film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. He was an assistant to [[Trevor Nunn]] at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. He has also worked as a [[commissioning editor]] for Drama at  [[Channel 4]], and ran the ''[[Book at Bedtime]]'' series for [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egmont.co.uk/contributor.asp?contid=246|title=David Benedictus author profile|publisher=[[Egmont Publishing]]|accessdate=21 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717041359/http://www.egmont.co.uk/contributor.asp?contid=246|archive-date=17 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He previously wrote and produced audio readings of the ''Pooh'' stories, with [[Judi Dench]] as [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]] and [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as [[Eeyore]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/04/winnie-pooh-hundred-acre-wood |title= Pooh sequel returns Christopher Robin to Hundred Acre Wood |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=4 October 2009 |work= [[The Guardian]] |location =London |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> He sent the trustees of the [[A. A. Milne]] estate two sample stories of his sequel, and it took more than eight years for them to approve the project.<ref name="guardian"/>

At the time of the book's publication he admitted to nerves over its reception, saying, <blockquote>What's the worst thing that can happen, that I'll be torn apart by wild journalists? Happened before and I survived. At worst everyone will hate me and I'll just crawl under a bush and hide – I can live with that. Some people do hate the whole idea of a sequel, but it's not as if I'm doing any damage to the original, that will still be there. My hope is that people will finish reading a cracking story and just want more of them, and that's where I come in.<ref name="guardian"/></blockquote> Michael Brown, chairman of the Pooh Properties Trust, said Benedictus had a "wonderful feel" for the world of Pooh.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/books/05pooh.html?hpw |title=The Same Pooh Bear, but an Otter Has Arrived |last=Lee |first=Felicia |date=4 October 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> However, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' was cool on the book, describing it as  "largely forgettable" and as missing "the charm of the first book".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-42160-3 |title=Return to the Hundred Acre Wood |accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

Benedictus commented on his work in 1985, "Given peace of mind, financial independence, and a modicum of luck, I may produce a novel to be proud of one day."<ref>Kirkpatrick, D. L.; Vinson, James. ''Contemporary Novelists'' (1986), p. 93.</ref> In March, 2014, he moved to [[Hove]], a resort on the south coast of England, to be close to his extending family. He has four children, [[Jolyon Maugham]] QC, a barrister,<ref>{{cite news|last=Eleftheriou-Smith|first=Loulla-Mae|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-jo-maugham-etonian-father-qc-barrister-twitter-a7917621.html|title=Katie Hopkins' attempt to shame barrister on Twitter for having an Etonian father backfires|work=The Independent|date=29 August 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> Leo a journalist and novelist (''The Afterparty'', his first novel, was published by Jonathan Cape), Chloe a psychodynamic psychotherapist, and Jessica, a theatre producer.

He published an [[autobiography]], ''Dropping Names'', in 2005. According to an interview Benedictus gave to the Israeli newspaper [[Yediot Aharonot]] in 2009, he said that a cousin had done research into his surname and found out that it was actually "[[Baruch (given name)|Baruch]]" (ברוך - having the same meaning as "Benedictus" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), as well as research into how his ancestors emigrated to Britain, which revealed that they have [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] heritage.
