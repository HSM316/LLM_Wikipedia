'''''MLS on TSN''''' is the branding used for [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s telecasts of [[Major League Soccer]] matches. TSN first acquired rights to MLS in 2011.

==History==
In February 2011, [[CTVglobemedia]] announced a six-year deal for national MLS broadcast rights in Canada. TSN and [[TSN2]] would broadcast 24 matches during the [[2011 MLS season|2011 season]] and air a minimum of 30 matches per season during the subsequent five seasons, all featuring at least one Canadian team. French-language sister networks [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] and [[RDS2]] had similar broadcast rights. The networks also carried the [[MLS Cup]] and select playoff matches, the [[MLS All-Star Game]], and additional matches not involving Canadian teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|title=TSN Becomes Official Broadcaster of MLS in Canada with Landmark Six-Year Deal|author=TSN|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2011|author-link=The Sports Network|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174603/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> [[GolTV (Canadian TV channel)|GolTV]] continued to carry selected all-U.S. MLS matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|title=GolTV Canada Matches for March 11–17, 2011|author=GolTV (Canada)|author-link=GolTV (Canada)|accessdate=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181933/http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|archivedate=July 6, 2011}} (lists carriage of a Los Angeles vs. Seattle MLS game)</ref>

[[Toronto FC]] regional matches were split between TSN and the [[Sportsnet]] networks (their parent companies, [[Rogers Communications]] and [[Bell Canada]], jointly own a stake in TFC's parent company [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]). In 2014, TSN acquired rights to [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] regional matches.<ref name="bell-mlsprwhitecaps">{{cite web|title=Every Game, All Season Long: MLS ON TSN Kicks Off its Complete Coverage of Vancouver Whitecaps FC This Saturday|url=http://www.bellmediapr.ca/Network/TSN/Press/Every-Game-All-Season-Long-MLS-ON-TSN-Kicks-Off-its-Complete-Coverage-of-Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-This-Saturday-|access-date=April 5, 2014|publisher=Bell Media}}</ref><ref name="tsn-whitecapsdeal">{{cite web|title=TSN to broadcast all Whitecaps FC games beginning in 2014|url=https://www.tsn.ca/soccer/story/?id=439310|access-date=January 21, 2014|work=TSN.ca|publisher=Bell Media}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Bell Media]] reached a five-year extension to its English-language rights to Major League Soccer, with coverage remaining similar to previous seasons (though with French-language rights moving to rival network [[TVA Sports]], and the option for matches to be simulcast on broadcast network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]). TSN also assumed exclusive rights to Toronto FC.<ref name="mls-canadiantv17">{{Cite web|title=Canadian national broadcast schedule for 2017 revealed; CTV to air 7 games|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/02/09/canadian-national-broadcast-schedule-2017-revealed-ctv-air-7-games|access-date=February 22, 2017|website=MLSSoccer.com}}</ref>

On December 15, 2021, MLS announced that it would be continuing with the same Canadian broadcasters for 2022. TSN will broadcast all Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps games while TVA Sports will cover [[CF Montréal]] in French. TSN will also broadcast select additional matches, and CTV will show eight MLS games.<ref name="s2022">{{cite web |title=MLS Announces 2022 Regular Season Schedule |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/mls-announces-2022-regular-season-schedule |website=mlssoccer |access-date=6 January 2022 |date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

TSN acquired national rights to select MLS games for the 2023–2026 seasons. TSN will broadcast at least one match per week featuring a Canadian team, eight playoff matches, and the [[MLS Cup|MLS Cup Final]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reedy |first1=Joe |title=MLS broadcast rights awarded to TSN, Fox Sports for next 4 years |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/mls-broadcast-rights-awarded-to-tsn-fox-sports-for-next-4-years-1.6192852 |website=CTVNews |publisher=The Associated Press |access-date=15 December 2022 |date=13 December 2022}}</ref> Matches aired on TSN are non-exclusive and will also be available in Canada on [[MLS Season Pass]].
