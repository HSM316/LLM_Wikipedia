'''''YBNL''''' (an abbreviation for yah no yah '''''Laptop''''') is the second studio album by Nigerian rapper [[Olamide]]. It was released on November 12, 2012, as the follow-up to his debut studio album ''[[Rapsodi (Olamide album)|Rapsodi]]'' (2011). The album features [[guest appearance]]s from Kay Switch, [[Tiwa Savage]], [[Dammy Krane]], [[Davido]], Kidakudz, [[Reminisce (musician)|Reminisce]], Base 1, Buckwyla and Minus 2. Olamide enlisted [[Pheelz]], Samklef, I.D Cabasa, 2Kriss and Tyrone to produce the album. ''YBNL'' was supported by the singles "Ilefo Illuminati", "First of All", "Stupid Love" and "Voice of the Street".

==Background==
Olamide promoted the album by holding a launch party at Octopus Club in [[Yaba, Lagos]]; the party featured performances from [[Dammy Krane]], Morell, Djzeez, [[Phyno]], Phenom, Samklef, [[Skales]] and Lace.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tooxclusive.com/2012/12/04/video-olamide-ybnl-launch-party/ | title=VIDEO: Olamide YBNL Launch Party | publisher=Tooxclusive | date=4 December 2012 | access-date=16 January 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117015726/http://tooxclusive.com/2012/12/04/video-olamide-ybnl-launch-party/ | archive-date=17 January 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> Prior to the album's launch party in Yaba, Olamide held a concert at Mazabs Event Centre in [[Ilorin]] on March 21, 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ngscene.com/2013/07/olamide-ybnl-album-concert-held-in-ilorin/ | title=Olamide #YBNL Album Concert held in ILORIN. | publisher=The Scene- Nigeria | date=22 July 2013 | access-date=16 January 2014 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20140116142710/http://ngscene.com/2013/07/olamide-ybnl-album-concert-held-in-ilorin/ | archive-date=16 January 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Composition==
The ''YBNL'' phrase is, in itself, a paradox. In layman's terms, Olamide wants to be fly like a "Yahoo Boy" but doesn't want to be associated with sending scam emails. The album's lyrics focus primarily on his love for God and the streets that raised him. In "Jesu O’ Kola", he looks to God for support because he believes the music industry castigated him. In the Church-inspired track "Jale", Olamide thanked God for preventing him from stealing. In "Voice of the Streets", he raps about his ambition to blow and about the passion and energy that young hustlers like himself possess. In "Street Love", he is reminiscent of his humble upbringing in Bariga. In "Money", Olamide talks about his constant quest for paper chasing. In "Fucking with the Devil", he said he's not "born again" but can hear angels calling.<ref name="Nigerian Entertainment Today"/>

==Singles==
The 2Kriss-produced track "Ilefo Illuminati" was released on November 20, 2011, as the album's lead single.
