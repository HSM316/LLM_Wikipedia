Ciardi completed his PhD at the University of Wyoming in 1997, and remained in Laramie for another year as a post-doctoral fellow.  He left Wyoming to become a post-doc at the University of Florida, ostensibly to work on the [[Wide Field Infrared Explorer]] (WIRE) mission.  The unfortunate failure of WIRE's main telescope immediately following launch sidetracked that research path; however, Ciardi remained at Florida and became a staff member with the infrared instrumentation group where he worked on an array of infrared instruments, including T-ReCS for the 8m telescope [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini South]] and [[Gran Telescopio Canarias#CanariCam|CanariCam]] for the 10m [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]].  In 2002, Ciardi took a staff astronomer position at the [[NExScI|NASA Exoplanet Science Institute]]; he served as the NExScI Chief Scientist from 2017-204 and is currently the NExScI Deputy Director and is a Member of the Professional Staff at [[Caltech]].

== Awards and honors ==
In 2016, Ciardi was awarded the [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] for his work on Kepler and his contributions to the confirmation of Kepler's exoplanets which have led to the characterization of planets ranging in size from Jupiters to Earths.  The [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] is awarded to individuals for unusually significant scientific contributions toward achievement of aeronautical or space exploration goals. Asteroid [[26312 Ciardi]] was named in his honor.<ref name="MPC-object" /> The official {{MoMP|26312|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 18 May 2019 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 114954}}).<ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" />  In September 2019, Ciardi, as part of the [[TESS]] team, was awarded the [[NASA Silver Achievement Medal]].
