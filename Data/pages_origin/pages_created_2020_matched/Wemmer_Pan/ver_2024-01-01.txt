'''Wemmer Pan''' is a lake and recreational area in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. It's located to the south of the city centre, in the suburb of [[La Rochelle, Johannesburg|La Rochelle]].

==History==
"Pan" is an [[Afrikaans]] and [[South African English]] word for a shallow lake.

The Wemmer Pan was named after Mr Sam Wemmer. It was originally a quarry, and was later taken over by the City Deep Mine which required the water for mining purposes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wemmer.org.za/Documents/Wemmer-History-1911-1939.pdf |title=The History of Wemmer Pan Rowing Club |access-date=2014-08-18 |archive-date=2014-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819102721/http://www.wemmer.org.za/Documents/Wemmer-History-1911-1939.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Wemmer Pan is part of [[Pioneers' Park]], which was built at the turn of the 20th century. Pioneers' Park was formally opened on 26 April 1924 by the Governor General, the [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]], on land bought by the City Council. The park is named in memory of the founders of Johannesburg and of the gold mining industry of which it is the centre.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063910/www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=28|archive-date=2011-10-05|title=Wemmer Pan/Pioneer Park}}</ref>

On the banks of the lake is [[Santarama Miniland]], which contains about 80 scale models of notable buildings and locations from around South Africa, on a scale of 1:25. These include a scale model of [[Robben Island]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] was held prisoner, the [[Union Buildings]] and the Hillbrow Tower. A full-scale replica of [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s ship, the [[Dromedarus]], takes visitors on a free boat ride on the lake. Also included are a mini-golf course, miniature railroads, a miniature harbor and a cableway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://joburg.co.za/santarama-miniland-broken-lilliput-south/ | title=Santarama Miniland – The broken Lilliput of the South| access-date=2023-11-04}}</ref>

Next door is the [[James Hall Transport Museum]], which is the largest transport museum in Africa. It was established in 1964 by Jimmie Hall, and it preserves and promotes the history of over 400 years of transport in South Africa in particular and Africa in general. The collection includes over 400 years’ worth of various modes of land transport that range from steam-driven vehicles, trains, trams and trolley buses, to animal-drawn carriages, early bicycles and cars. The courtyard houses a number of steam vehicles, some of them still in working order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jhmt.org.za/ |title=Home |website=jhmt.org.za}}</ref>
