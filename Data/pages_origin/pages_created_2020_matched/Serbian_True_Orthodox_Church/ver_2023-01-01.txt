The '''Serbian True Orthodox Church''' ('''STOC'''; {{lang-sr-cyr|Српска истинска Православна црква}}) is a denomination that separated from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1996. Its founder and current leader is bishop [[Akakije (Stankovic)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serbiantrueorthodox.blogspot.com/p/bishop.html |title=Bishop |publisher=Serbian True Orthodox Church official website |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> The members refer to themselves as ''revnitelji'' ('consistent', 'persistent'); they are informally called ''ziloti'' ('zealots') by the public.<ref name=novosti/> The church is part of the traditionalist [[True Orthodoxy]] movement, a loose group of Orthodox churches which resist [[ecumenism]] and other attempts of modernization within the mainstream churches.

==History==
The Serbian True Orthodox Church originated in the 1990s, when three Serb monks returned from the [[Esphigmenou Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]], a stronghold of [[Greek Old Calendarists]]. Among them was Nemanja Stanković, who later took the church name Akakije.<ref name="politika">{{cite web | url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/Ko-su-ziloti-pravoslavni-fundamentalisti.lt.html | title=Ko su ziloti, pravoslavni fundamentalisti |trans-title=Who are Zealots, Orthodox Fundamentalists | publisher=[[Politika]] | date=1 May 2010 | accessdate=5 August 2014 | author=Beoković, Jelena}}</ref> In 1996 Akakije returned to Serbia and established a monk community on [[Fruška Gora]] mountain, near [[Nova Ravanica]] monastery.<ref name=politika/> The movement follows the "old calendarist" doctrines of rejecting all perceived attempts at reform of the church, particularly [[ecumenism]] and other contacts with "heretics", baptism by [[aspersion]] and acceptance of [[Gregorian calendar]].<ref name=politika/>

As of 2014, the number of followers of the church is estimated to several hundred.<ref name=politika/> In a 2010 interview, hegumenia of Novi Stjenik monastery stated that "there is 350 of us, but the number of sympathizers is much larger".<ref name=novosti/>

The relationships of the STOC and the mainstream Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) have been tense. The SOC considers the members of the church to be "schismatics, fundamentalists and heretics".<ref name=politika/> In an article in ''[[Svetosavlje]]'', official magazine of the SOC, bishop [[Atanasije Jevtić]] analyzed history and theology of the STOC, refuting their "theological blunders", as he puts it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svetosavlje.org/biblioteka/Izazovi/Zablude/Lat_zablude05.htm |title=Zablude raskolnika, tzv. "Starokalendaraca" |trans-title=Blunders of schismatics, aka "Old Calendarists" |publisher=Svetosavlje |date=2004 |author=Atanasije Jevtić}}</ref>

===Churches and monasteries===
In 2007, sisterhood of [[Stjenik]] monastery near Čačak refused loyalty to the Serbian Orthodox Church after it signed the [[Ecumenic Charter]] agreeing to hold a Great Christian Communion in [[Niš]] in 2013. After they were expelled from the monastery, they founded a new one, called "Novi Stjenik", in remote [[Kučaj mountains]] in eastern Serbia. In 2010, the monastery had 13 nuns.<ref name=novosti>{{cite news|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:296243-Litu.. |title=Liturgije u pećini |trans-title=Liturgies in a cave |publisher=Večernje Novosti |date=14 August 2010 }}</ref>

A former weekend house on Fruška Gora was turned into a men's Monastery, called "Church of Saint Cyril and Metodius". {{as of|2010}}, the monastery had three monks.<ref name=novosti/>

Since 2012, the STOC has been building a church of ''Utešiteljevo'' near [[Ralja (Sopot)|Ralja]], south of Belgrade. The church is its formal episcopal seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uteshiteljevo.blogspot.com/search/label/%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%9A%D0%B0 |title=Utešiteljevo |publisher=Serbian True Orthodox Church official website |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://serbiantrueorthodox.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_01.html |title=Parohije i manastiri |trans-title=Parishes and Monasteries |publisher=Serbian True Orthodox Church official website |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>

All STOC monasteries and churches hoist a black flag with inscription "Orthodoxy or death!".<ref name=novosti/><ref name=politika/>

==Child camp controversy==
In August 2014, the Serbian True Orthodox Church organized the second "Holy Lazar Orthodox Youth Camp" on Kučaj mountains, that gathered a number of 12- to 18-year-olds. They came in the focus of Serbian public after it was revealed that the children were taught how to operate air-soft replicas of [[Kalashnikov rifle]]s, among other military skills. The organizers were criticized of child recruitment and child abuse.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/485023/Spavanje-u-pecinama-sklekovi-i-kalasnjikovi-Sekta-na-Kucajskim-planinama-sprema-decu-za-rat |title=Spavanje u pećinama, sklekovi i "kalašnjikovi": Sekta na Kučajskim planinama sprema decu za rat |publisher=Blic |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Serbian}}</ref> Bishop Akakije and Efrosinija, [[hegumenia]] of the Novi Stjenik monastery, stated that the camp was organized by a model of similar camps in Russia, as well as [[scouting]] camps worldwide, that the children were taught outdoor survival skills and self-defense, and the shooting training was only one day of a 10-day course. The police and the public prosecutor of the city of [[Bor, Serbia|Bor]] started an investigation of the case.<ref>{{cite news|title=Igumanija spremna za saslušanje |trans-title=Hegumenia ready for hearing |url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/424237/Igumanija-spremna-za-saslusanje |date=7 August 2014 |publisher=Vesti |language=Serbian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kalašnjikov u ime Hrista  |trans-title=Kalashnikov in the Name of Christ |url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Srbija/423700/Kalasnjikov-u-ime-Hrista |date=5 August 2014 |publisher=Vesti |language=Serbian}}</ref>
