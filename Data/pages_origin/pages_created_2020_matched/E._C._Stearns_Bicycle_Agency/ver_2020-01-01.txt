Stearns]] brought the industry to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in 1888 and transformed his father's hardware and wagon factory in [[Oneida, New York]], to a bicycle plant.<ref name="ruled"/>

Stearns, president and founder of '''E. C. Stearns Bicycle Agency''', established several other manufacturing plants in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] including [[E. C. Stearns & Company]], Wholesale Bi-steam Carriage Company and Stearns Automobile Company or [[Stearns Steam Carriage Company]].<ref name="companies">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/notablemenofcent00stod/notablemenofcent00stod_djvu.txt |title=Notable Men of Central New York |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |work=|publisher=Dwight J. Stoddard, 1903}}</ref>

The company motto was "ridden in every civilized country on the globe"<ref name="ruled"/>

===Early years===

When the bicycle first became popular, it was natural that [[Edward C. Stearns]] should take it up "first as a sport and then as a business." After becoming one of the best riders in this "section" he decided to manufacture the new vehicles in his shop at 224 Oneida Street where he had moved the business after his father's death. He soon developed several of the "best selling models of the bicycle era. He employed "noted" riders to "race his product", few of them any better riders than he. His models became so popular they were in demand throughout the world.<ref name="athlete">{{cite news |title=Edward C. Stearns, Civic Leader and Pioneer in Bicycle Industry, Dies |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first= |last= |date=April 22, 1929}}</ref>

At one time, the company had four plants in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and 3,500 employees. Additionally, the company had another plant in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and one in [[Germany]].<ref name="athlete"/>

===Bicycle models===

The number of bicycle riders in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] by 1890 was 10,000 and the city was a "hub of bicycle production." Among the most popular bicycles was the ''Yellow Fellow'', manufactured by E. C. Stearns Company who employed 2,000 and produced 500 bicycles a day. Bicycles were so popular during that period that streetcar earnings declined.<ref name="numberssyracuse">{{cite news |title=Syracuse Scenes 1880-1900 |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |date=July 29, 1998 |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]}}</ref> At that time, Stearns was the largest manufacturer of bicycles in the world.<ref name="expresssix"/>

[[Image:Stearns 1896 yellow-fellow-yearbook.jpg|left|thumb|250px|E. C. Stearns & Co. - Yellow Fellow Year Book in 1896]]

In November 1895, the company exhibited their products at the ''St. John's Cathedral Fair'' in [[Alhambra, California]] and showed three "styles of wheels" including a ''Stearns Special'', ''Stearns Racer'' and the third a "lady's machine." The company distributed a large number of bamboo canes, "tastefully ornamented with a bow of orange ribbon" as well as large quantities of the ''Yellow Fellow'' buttons.<ref name="makers"/>

In late 1896, the company advertised the ''Stearns Special'' for $125. It had narrow tread, artistic lines and weighed only 20 pounds.<ref name="shakespere">{{cite news |title=Stearns Bicycles |first=|last=|location=|date=December 1896 |newspaper=The Philistine: A Periodical of Protest}}</ref>

During 1901, the company was manufacturing models such as the ''Chainless'' priced at $75, the ''Racer'' for $50, the ''Light Roadster'' also $50, the ''Roadster'' priced at $40 and the ''Regular Roadster'' for only $30. The authorized agent in the city for the bicycles was W. D. Andrews of 216 East Railroad Street.<ref name="stearnsmodels">{{cite news |title=The Stearns Bicycles |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=June 5, 1901 |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]}}</ref>

===Yellow Fellow===

By 1896, ''Yellow Fellow'' production was at an all-time high and "the smoke poured from the chimneys of the Stearns company." Carloads were shipped from [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] bearing huge posters that read, "''Yellow Fellows'', made in Syracuse," followed by the name of the dealer in some distant city.<ref name="pricebike"/>

The model was produced in ''one-seater'', ''two-seater tandems'', ''triplets'' and ''sextets''.<ref name="expresssix"/>

On August 14, 1896, Eugene A. Neidert rode a ''Yellow Fellow'' up the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. His exploit found its way into the news column of almost every newspaper in the [[United States]] and the Stearns company "capitalized the stunt" in their trade paper, ''Yellow Fellow'', which was issued weekly. Frank J. Marion, affiliated with [[Hollywood]] "motion picture" interests, was editor of the journal and G. H. E. "Go-Home-Early" Hawkins, who worked for a large soap company, was managing editor.<ref name="pricebike"/> According to the local press these trade journals "advised ''scorchers'' known to this era as ''speeders'', on the proper way to ride wheels in the city."<ref name="pricebike"/>

[[Image:Stearns-bicycle 1897-0418.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Stearns Bicycle - "Yellow Fellow" - 1897]]

===Yellow Fellow advertising===

High pressure advertising men of the era performed many "stunts" and "poems were recited, songs written and sung, speeches made at dinners, picnics, hometown celebrations and conventions---all advertising bicycles in general and the ''Yellow Fellow'' in particular."<ref name="pricebike"/>

The "ad men" coined slogans and influenced the fashion of the day by telling the women what well dressed "centurions" wore. The "centurions", or women riders, were told "never to wear red petticoats as they attract undo attention" and were advised instead to wear gray linen or "crash suits" with ''Yellow Fellow'' wheels, with matching hats and scarves.<ref name="pricebike"/>

Stearns always incorporated the ''Yellow Fellow'' model in all their advertising. When asked why, the advertising manager, G. H. E. Hawkins indicated that the name was "synonymous with 'Stearns' so that whenever one sees a yellow wheel his mind naturally reverts to ''Stearns'' and ''Yellow Fellow''. Our efforts in this direction have been flatteringly successful, and there's hardly a man, woman and child on the continent knowing the difference between a bicycle and a tricycle, but instinctively recognizing any yellow bicycle as a 'Stearns'."<ref name="yellowbike">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75dIAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA7-PA5&lpg=RA7-PA5&dq=%22yellow+fellow%22+stearns&source=bl&ots=HCtpkSAkBR&sig=HB09xVuBboNZvyB_aMBuw1NRKec&hl=en&ei=ePAsTcbxKZH6sAPmysWFBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Printers' Ink |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |work=|publisher=George P. Rowell & Co., 1896}}</ref>

Stearns also published a weekly, ''Yellow Fellow'' trade paper and national weeklies as well as posters and circulars.<ref name="yellowbike"/>

The company rated newspaper publicity, whether it consisted of paid space or favorable notices from events, above all other forms of advertisement in terms of effectiveness. A spokesman noted that the ''Journal-Examiner Yellow Fellow Relay'' generated "two scrap books full of valuable reading notices that were freely given." Stearns felt the relay was the greatest advertising scheme the company ever originated. The ''[[New York Journal]]'' and ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', in particular, generated much publicity for the ''Yellow Fellow''."<ref name="yellowbike"/>

Because the company believed the name Stearns was used on the stage more extensively than any other bicycle, they were working on an advertising campaign in 1896 which contained the photos and testimonials of such stars as [[Olga Nethersole]], [[Loie Fuller]], [[Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter]], [[Cissy Fitzgerald]], [[Richard Mansfield]], Robert Hilliard and [[John Drew (actor)|John Drew]], among others.<ref name="yellowbike"/>

[[Olga Nethersole]] endorsed the 1896 Stearns bicycle when she wrote a letter to the company;

{{Quotation|size=60%|
"Dear Sir, Will you favor me by ordering another '96 Stearns bicycle to be shipped to my [[London]] residence, Walsingham House, Piccadilly. The Stearns is the lightest and most durable wheel that I have ridden and an ideal bicycle for women. Yours very truly, Olga Nethersole."<ref name="olga">{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingcrowd.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/technical/25484/Olga-Nethersole-endorsement |title=Olga Nethersole endorsement |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |publisher=CyclingCrowd.com, January 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215338/http://www.cyclingcrowd.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/technical/25484/Olga-Nethersole-endorsement |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}

The company also maintained billboards along the "elevated" railroad in [[New York City]].<ref name="yellowbike"/> In 1896, sheet music entitled ''The Yellow Fellow - Two Step'', composed by Walter B. Rogers and dedicated to "the riders of the Stearns bicycle" was published by J. W. Pepper.<ref name="music">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewheelmen.org/sections/memorabilia/covers/music_index.pdf |title= Bicycle Related Sheet Music |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |work=|publisher=The Wheelmen, 2011}}</ref>

During early February 1897, the company was expending a "tremendous" amount of money each year on their advertising costs. Stearns was considered among the three heaviest advertisers in the business. The company, for example, paid $1,100 for "just the space" they used at the ''Chicago Bicycle Show'' and a "corresponding amount" at least at a dozen other cycle shows throughout the country. Additional costs included the electrical display, transport of goods, the construction and decoration of the trade booths, expense of a large force of assistants and it is readily seen that by the time show season was over, such a concern had "spent as much money as an ordinary concern does business in a year." The bicycle show held in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] at the Alhambra Hall was "exactly the same as it appeared in Chicago, where it was conceded without a dissenting voice to be the most elegant and artistic." Stearns introduced their very latest "novelty," a Stearns tricycle "that is sure to attract a great deal of attention." The new tricycle was described as an "exceedingly light, pretty wheel and is a worthy member of the ''Yellow Fellow'' family."<ref name="advertising">{{cite news |title=Bicycle Trade - Stearns and Barnes |newspaper=[[Syracuse Post-Standard|Syracuse Standard]] |first= |last= |location=[[Syracuse, New York]] February 28, 1897}}</ref>

===Publications===

[[Image:Bicycle 1897 good-roads.gif|right|thumb|300px|Scorcher - Good Roads - 1897]]

The company published a magazine called ''Cycle Topics'' in which they warned riders on the practices of the road. "Don't scorch--this means you" was one suggestion, as well as "keep to the right of the road" and "turn to one side for a heavy load even if you are on the right side."<ref name="expresssix"/>

Speeding was quite a problem in the 1890s and the young riders would make it a practice to "scorch" through villages and were warned by Stearns to "ride no faster than {{Convert|8|mph}} through villages where you are unfortunate with the ordinances, it will save you money."<ref name="expresssix"/> Another issue of the magazine warned readers; "Be ever ready to assist a female rider in distress on the road without the formality of an introduction."<ref name="paths">{{cite news |title=Bicyling Craze Made City Hub of Bicycle World |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |date=September 13, 1953 |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]}}</ref>

The ''Yellow Fellow'' was a "popular trade journal" and was first published on June 10, 1893. In June 1897, the journal became a monthly and "several new and attractive features were arranged."<ref name="stearnsracers"/>

===Slogans===

Some of the slogans for Stearns bicycles were;<ref name="yellowbike"/>
* "Ride a 'Stearns' and be content."
* "Where'er one turns, He finds a Stearns."
* "Watch the sunlight glisten on those orange rims."
* "The way to do it is to do it on a 'Stearns.'"

===Race circuit===

John J. McLaughlin, on a Stearns ''Yellow Fellow'', broke the record on December 18, 1894, of a straightaway unpaced mile in 1:21 in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="mclaughlin">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/03/17/106059021.pdf|title=Among the Wheelmen |first= |last=|date=March 17, 1895 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]], [[New York, New York]]}}</ref>

By late 1894, John S. "Johnny" Johnson rode a Stearns wheel when he made a "remarkable mile" in 1:35.<ref name="nybikeshow"/> In August that year Johnson had a "falling out" with Stearns when they did not like the idea of him traveling to [[Canada]] without authority and "saddling the expenses upon the firm." Appeal was taken to Chairman Raymond of the [[League of American Bicyclists|League of American Wheelmen]] racing board to have Johnson live up to his contract. According to the local newspaper, "Johnson will probably give Syracuse the cold shoulder hereafter. He received great advertising as a rider and was treated generously in Syracuse, but like all "pure amateurs" he is probably "out for his stuff" and will go where he can get the most money." A reporter who called at the Stearns works to learn the latest developments in the case were told that both Stearns and Maslin were enjoying themselves at their cottages on [[Skaneateles Lake]].<ref name="john">{{cite news |title=John S. Johnson - Amateur |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=August 5, 1894 |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald]]}}</ref>

During 1896, the Stearns company sponsored dozens of racing teams all over the [[United States]], in [[Australia]] and [[Europe]] to ride the ''Yellow Fellow'' model. According to a local reporter, "Records fell right and left before the Stearns wheel" and the "famous" team of ''Round-the-World Yellow Fellows'' including [[Earl Kiser]], C. M. Murphy and Harry Wheeler, went abroad to capture European prizes.<ref name="pricebike"/>

Both E. E. Anderson's ride of a mile behind a locomotive in 1:03 and the ''Journal-Examiner Yellow Fellow Relay'' across the continent were popular events in 1896 that brought the ''Yellow Fellow'' much notoriety.<ref name="yellowbike"/>

E. E. Anderson of [[St. Louis, Missouri]], of "mile a minute fame," rode a Stearns bicycle during the 1897 season. According to the press, "Anderson is another professional who preferred to be mounted on a fast wheel rather than be handicapped by an unreliable mount, even though he is paid nothing for his services." Several professional riders had "signaled their intention of riding Stearns bicycles" that season including [[Marshall Taylor|Major Taylor]], John S. Johnson and Carroll B. Jack.<ref name="stearnsracers">{{cite news |title=Notes of the Trade |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=May 31, 1897 |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald|The Evening Herald]]}}</ref>

John S. Johnson was training in Minneapolis in May 1897 on his new ''Yellow Fellow'' racer. He wrote that he expected to follow the national circuits and "thinks he stands an equal show for the prize money with any of the 'cracks' in the business."<ref name="stearnsracers"/>

[[Earl Kiser|Earl H. Kiser]], who was nicknamed the "Little Dayton Demon," raced for the Stearns ''Yellow Fellow'' team.

===Empire state express===

On July 28, 1896, a team of six bicycle riders who were employees of Stearns, raced the Empire State Express of the [[New York Central Railroad]]. Stearns racer, William H. Bex, led a sextuplet over the rough passageway on a ''sextuple-tandem'' between two railroad tracks "near the old baseball ground to the old stone pump house a mile away" in [[Geddes, New York|Geddes]] where the famous race was staged. The racers held their own for some distance and when they neared the pump house at Geddes, half a mile away, the sextet pulled ahead of the train by four wheels. From the train's rate of speed, it was estimated that the bicycle was going {{Convert|45|mph}}. The team had agreed ahead of time to finish the race at the pump house near the reservoir. It took the riders a quarter mile to slow down and stop and the $2,000 bicycle finally halted on the brink of a railroad culvert.<ref name="expresssix"/>

The outcome of the contest was used extensively by Stearns for advertising the ''Yellow Fellow'' and the event was named the ''Stearns Sextuplet Empire State Express Race''.<ref name="pricebike"/> The members of the sextet also included Don B. Smith, William Fournier, Robert Darling, William Roth and James Carey.<ref name="ruled">{{cite news |title=When Syracuse was hub of the bicycle world |first=Arlene |last=LaRue |location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |date=February 13, 1983 |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald|Syracuse Herald-American]]}}</ref>

[[Barney Oldfield]] began as a bicycle racer in 1894, winning silver medals and a gold watch.<ref name="hof"/> At age 16, in 1894, he entered his first bicycle race, and soon officials from ''Dauntless'' bicycle factory asked him to ride for the [[Ohio]] state championship. Although Oldfield came in second in the race, it was a turning point in his life and he was hired as a parts sales representative for Stearns, where he met his future wife, Beatrice Lovetta Oatis whom he married in 1896.<ref name="stearnsoldfield">{{cite book |url=http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/nspf_03/nspf_03_00413.html |title=Barney Oldfield |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |work=|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|The Gale Group, Inc.]], a division of Thomson Learning, Inc. |year=2004}}</ref>

===Major Taylor pacing tandem===

{{See also|Marshall Taylor}}

[[Major Taylor]], a top bicycle racer and world class athlete of the day, went to [[Syracuse, New York]], for the 1899 season with his friend, mentor and manager, Louis "Birdie" Munger to sign a contract with Stearns. Taylor, Munger and sponsor, Harry Sager had arrived in the city to enter into negotiations with the Olive Wheel Company, however, they were able to work out a more lucrative contract with Stearns who agreed to build Taylor's bicycles using the Sager gear chainless mechanism designed by Harry Sager. The bikes only weighed about {{Convert|20|lb}} and had an {{Convert|88|in|mm|adj=on}} gear for sprinting and a {{Convert|120|in|mm|adj=on}} gear for longer, paced runs.<ref name="major"/>

Stearns also agreed to build Taylor a "revolutionary" steam-powered pacing tandem "behind which he could attack world records and challenge the leading exponents of paced racing." Although the pacing tandem was temperamental, Taylor easily broke the world record of {{Convert|1|mi|km}} in 01:19 at a speed of {{Convert|45.56|mph}} and beat his competitor, Eddie McDuffie on November 15, 1899.<ref name="major">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrEMV_uiKFoC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=%22yellow+fellow%22+stearns&source=bl&ots=SzSFNXqtIE&sig=XfuPoiOuImJjKN-SeG0_sPe3u7U&hl=en&ei=cUsuTc34FpKWsgPjz6i-BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CB4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22yellow%20fellow%22%20stearns&f=false |title=Major Taylor: The Extraordinary Career of a Champion Bicycle Racer |accessdate=January 12, 2011 |first=Andrew |last=Ritchie |work=|page= 114; 131|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=1988}}</ref>

===Cross country trip===

During 1895, George Loher, a butcher from [[Oakland, California]], rode a Stearns ''Yellow Fellow'' across the [[United States]] from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Loher took a northerly route which sent him north through [[Oregon]] and then across 13 states and territories where he crossed "deserts, sandy valleys and five mountain ranges."<ref name="crosscountry">{{cite web|url=http://symonsez.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/could-you-ride-a-bike-across-america-with-no-brakes/ |title=Could You Ride a Bike Across America…With No Brakes? |accessdate=January 14, 2011 |first=Andrew |last=Ritchie |work=|publisher=Symon Sez |year=2011}}</ref>

[[Image:Stearns 1895-0415 machine.gif|right|thumb|300px|Stearns Bicycle - Advertisement - [[New York Times]], 1895]]

Loher was not the first to cross the nation on bicycle, 11 years earlier another cycler from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], Thomas Stevens, made the trip on a high-wheeler. Loher, however, was the first to do so with the "new [[Bicycle tire|pneumatic tire]]." He also had no brake on the bicycle and his method of stopping was "to drop a bunch of brush and sticks tied to a rope on his bike and drag it behind to slow his momentum."<ref name="crosscountry"/>

Along the way he had a few minor problems when he nearly ran into a train in [[Oregon]] and in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] he broke the front forks on his machine. In [[Montana]] he ran his front wheel into a boulder.<ref name="crosscountry"/>

He also traveled through [[North Dakota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Ohio]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. The trip took 80 days and returned to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] by train.<ref name="crosscountry"/>

After returning home, Loher wrote a journal about his adventures but did not publish it because "he thought it was too ordinary." In the 1960s, his granddaughter found the manuscript and had it published in the early 1970s as ''The Wonderful Ride''.<ref name="crosscountry"/>

===Cycle shows===

On January 20, 1895, the company participated in the ''New York Cycle Show'' which was held in [[Madison Square Gardens]] in [[New York City]] where they displayed models of the year including a light roadster, weighing {{Convert|21.5|lb}} and an ordinary roadster that weighed {{Convert|27|lb}}. The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that "Their display is one of the largest and most complete at the show, and anyone is convinced after a short talk with the salesman, that the Stearns wheel is a good one."<ref name="nybikeshow">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/01/20/103362246.pdf |title=New York's Cycle Show |first= |last=|work=|newspaper=[[The New York Times]], [[New York, New York]], January 20, 1895 |date=January 20, 1895}}</ref>

Adjoining the Stearns exhibit was the Bidwell-Tinkham Cycle Company who displayed not only their own bicycle, the ''Tourist'', but also the Stearns wheel, for which they were the New York agent.<ref name="nybikeshow"/>

The ''Grand Cycle Show'' was held in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] on March 2, 1898, in the Herald Building on Warren Street. Included were the Stearns ''Chainless'' and ''Racer''.

===Bicycle patents===

[[Edward C. Stearns]] continued to design important components for his bicycle line in much the same manner as he designed tools for his hardware enterprise, [[E. C. Stearns & Company]]. By May 28, 1895, he invented what he described as a "new and useful" support for bicycle saddles which was "light, yet strong and rigid" that permitted it to be adjusted forward or backward. Witnesses were Alfred Wilkinson and L. F. Weisburg.<ref name="saddle">{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=prhqAAAAEBAJ&pg=PP3&lpg=PP3&dq=stearns+bicycle&source=bl&ots=3WnK8_7IxG&sig=P0DOZs5rhyjY9eg_0gFN16bZkgU&hl=en&ei=4s4wTbTFPIXGsAP3-JH6BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDMQ6AEwCTiKBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Support for Bicycle Saddle |first= |last=|work=|publisher=U.S. Patent Office, [[New York, New York]], May 28, 1895}}</ref>

===Factories and branches===

By 1896, the company had factories in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and [[Paris, France]]. They also had branches located in [[San Francisco]], [[Berlin, Germany]], [[New York City]]<ref name="ruled"/> and [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name="yellowbike"/>

Frederick J. Haynes, who began his practical work experience in the machine shop of Syracuse Bicycle Company in the 1890s was the superintendent of the E. C. Stearns Bicycle Company in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in 1899 for one year. He later served as general manager of the Lake Shore Engine Works in [[Marquette, Michigan]] and by 1904 he was assistant engineer and later served as plant manager at [[Franklin (automobile)|H. H.

===Sales agency===

The Stearns Bicycle Agency, located at 315 Warren Street in the Herald Building was the sales agency for the [[E. C. Stearns & Company]] bicycles and components. By December 1898, the agency advertised their bicycle cleaning and storage services for $1 during the winter months. They also offered "repairs at cost" such as new wood rims for $1.20 and tire "bargains" starting at $3.25.<ref name="winter">{{cite news |title=Stearns Bicycle Agency |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=December 5, 1898 |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald Journal|Evening Herald]]}}</ref>

During late December 1898, the agency touted the 1899 Stearns model as well as bicycles for children, cyclometers, pumps, bells, saddles and book holders and the fact they were "open evenings" was always included in the advertisements.<ref name="xmas">{{cite news |title=Memory Aids for Xmas |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=December 24, 1898 |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald Journal|Evening Herald]]}}</ref>

===American Bicycle Company===

By 1896, the bicycle industry reached a "bitterly" competitive crisis. The market was clearly flooded by too many manufacturers.<ref name="ruled"/> Within three years time, in 1900, the blow fell. In an attempt to control supply and limit competition, 42 manufacturers (later over 75 companies) formed the [[American Bicycle Company]] (A.B.C.), known familiarly as "the trust." The concern bought up one company after another and eventually had formed into a monopoly. Even strong, profitable companies such as Stearns sold out their rights to the new conglomerate.<ref name="ruled"/>

A.B.C. soon announced plans to open a branch plant in [[Canada]] called the National Cycle Company<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles15.cfm |title=The Canada Cycle and Motor Company (C.C.M.) - Canada Science and Technology Museum |access-date=January 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313054751/http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles15.cfm |archive-date=March 13, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> located in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

===Defendant in lawsuit===

[[Image:Stearns 1900 abc-mfg.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Stearns, Barnes and Syracuse - American Bicycle Company - 1900]]

By June 1900, the [[American Bicycle Company]] demanded that company founder, [[Edward C. Stearns]], Herbert E. Maslin and [[Avis Stearns Van Wagenen|Mrs. Avis Van Wagenen]], of Syracuse, execute an agreement not to engage in the manufacture of bicycles in competition with A.B.C., who claimed they made an agreement with the Stearns company when their factory was sold to the combination. A.B.C. felt that Stearns was in violation of their contract because the Bretz Manufacturing Company, in which the parties were alleged to be interested, was notified to cease manufacture of both the ''Regal'' and ''Holland'' and "other machines" which closely resemble the ''Stearns'' and ''Barnes'' bicycles made by A.B.C. Both the Frontenac Cycle Company and Stearns Cycle Agency of Syracuse were warned against manufacture and sale of the machines, however, E. C. Stearns denied he was connected with the manufacture of bicycles and the Bretz Company also claimed their bicycles were different from the ''Stearns'' and ''Barnes'' bicycles.<ref name="suit">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShXWAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA4&lpg=RA3-PA4&dq=%22barnes+bicycles%22&source=bl&ots=80fp_NJhXP&sig=CI7YFFNvtC-TvIerSd-lyOR-HlQ&hl=en&ei=lFMdTf2kKIeqsAPP-Z23Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22barnes%20bicycles%22&f=false |title=Good roads: devoted to the construction and maintenance of roads, Volume 31 |first= |last=|work=|publisher=Emil Grossman & Bros., [[New York, New York]], June 1900}}</ref>

A charge of conspiracy was filed when A.B.C. claimed its business had been damaged and asked for an injunction preventing the use of words ''Stearns'', ''Yellow Fellow'' and ''Original Stearns Plant''. A bill of complaint in the [[United States]] Court was served against the Stearns Bicycle Agency, [[Edward C. Stearns]], individually and as a director, Herbert E. Maslin, individually and as president and director, and William A. Doubleday, as treasurer and director in which $200,000 damages were demanded. The suit was claimed to be the result of the manufacture and sale of the ''Regal'' bicycle in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite news |title=Trust Sues for $200,000 |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=May 19, 1895 |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]}}</ref>

Both Stearns and Maslin were in the employ of A.B.C., known as the "trust," when they purportedly entered into a conspiracy; part of which was to purchase through Doubleday the capital stock of the Stearns Bicycle Agency from A.B.C., which bought it when they acquired the interests of [[E. C. Stearns & Company]]. The agency was formed for retail business and at the time [[Edward C. Stearns]] was then local manager of the A.B.C. at $12,000 a year salary. The pair leased the old Stearns factory and A.B.C. claimed they entered into the business of manufacture of bicycles in competition with A.B.C. instead of the purposes represented when they leased the building.<ref name="lawsuit"/>

It was also claimed that Stearns, Maslin and Doubleday then organized as W. A. Doubleday & Co., a corporation, and it was alleged that this company assumed the "real business" of the Stearns Bicycle Agency. It was further claimed that the defendants sent circulars signed with the name Stearns Bicycle Agency with H. A. Maslin as president to the agents of A.B.C. and to the agents for the old Stearns wheels. A.B.C. felt that the circulars represented the agency as selling the "Stearns wheels" and "Yellow Fellows" which turned out to be the ''Regal'' wheel.<ref name="lawsuit"/>

While the trust was to discontinue making the Stearns bicycle, instead, it was said that the trust had more agents selling the wheel than ever before and at the same time had twice as many working men engaged in the manufacture.<ref name="lawsuit"/>

The ''Regal'' model was said to be a pattern close to the Stearns wheel, having a similar name, the same colored enamel in yellow and olive and striping, the same style of joints and frame, and in fact, "being a Chinese copy." It also had a nameplate that said ''The Stearns Bicycle Agency''. A.B.C. demanded that the men should be prevented from "stating to the trade" that the wheels were made in the original Stearns factory and by the old Stearns workmen. Also, from selling bicycles or bicycle accessories which are substantially similar.<ref name="lawsuit"/>

It was also asked that Stearns and Maslin provide a full account of profits derived from the sale of the bicycles and the alleged infringement of rights. The injunction was served by Judge Coxe at [[Utica, New York]].<ref name="lawsuit"/>

Stearns and Maslin both denied that either was in any way engaged in the bicycle business.<ref name="lawsuit"/> The injunction was argued on June 19, 1898 and was partially granted and partially denied. Both sides claimed a partial victory. Attorneys Edward Nottingham, William Nottingham and Alfred Wilkinson represented Stearns and Maslin while ''Hey & Parson'' appeared for A.B.C. The injunction was denied except as to the use of the name ''Stearns'', ''Yellow Fellow'' and the like on any wheel colored yellow or partly yellow. Additionally, the Stearns Bicycle Agency could continue to sell the ''Regal'' in the variety of colors, including yellow, as long as they did not add the Stearns name.<ref name="lawsuittried">{{cite news |title=Bike Makers are Enjoined |first=|last=|location=[[Syracuse, New York]]|date=June 19, 1895 |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]]}}</ref>

===Doubleday company===

By December 1900, the W. A. Doubleday Company were successors to the Stearns Bicycle Agency and were located on South Warren Street in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].<ref name="double">{{cite news |title=W. A.
