Count '''Kuno Friedrich Viktor von Westarp''' (12 August 1864 – 30 July 1945) was a conservative politician in Germany.

==Life and career==
Westarp was born in [[Ludomy|Ludom]] (present-day Ludomy, [[Poland]]) in the Prussian [[Province of Posen]], the son of a senior forestry official. He attended the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' secondary school in [[Potsdam]] and studied [[jurisprudence]] at the universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Wrocław|Breslau]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], passed the ''[[Staatsexamen]]'' in 1886 and did his military service in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] and Potsdam, where he was elevated to a reserve officer of the [[1st Foot Guards (German Empire)|1st Foot Guard]] regiment.

In 1887 he began his career in civil service at the administrative district (''[[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') office in [[Bad Freienwalde|Freienwalde]], [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] whose head was [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], the later [[Chancellor of Germany]]. After his second ''Staatsexamen'' in 1891 Westarp continued his career as an [[Assessor (law)|assessor]] in [[Gostyń|Gostyn]] and [[Babimost|Bomst]] in Posen, and in [[Szczecin|Stettin]]. He joined the service of the Prussian State Ministry in 1902 and became Chief of Police in the [[Schöneberg]] and [[Wilmersdorf]] suburbs of [[Berlin]], before in 1908 he was appointed a senior judge at the Prussian administrative court.

Westarp had joined the [[German Agrarian League]] in the 1890s, his political advancement began in 1908 as a member of the German ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' parliament as a member of the [[German Conservative Party]], from 1913 to 1918 as head of the parliamentary group. During [[World War I]], he agitated against the 1917 [[Reichstag Peace Resolution]], advocated the unrestricted [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|submarine warfare]] and rejected the reform of the [[Prussian three-class franchise]] initiated by Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg.

After the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], Westarp became one of the founding members of the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). From 1919 he worked as an editor of the conservative ''[[Kreuzzeitung]]'' newspaper whose shareholder he became in 1925. While his career in civil service ended with his retirement in 1920, he was again elected into the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' parliament of the [[Weimar Republic]]. Initially an exponent of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]], anti-democratic forces within his party, he was involved in the preparations of the failed [[Kapp Putsch]], however, he adopted more centrist positions in the mid-1920s, rising to become head of the DNVP parliamentary group and party chairman in 1926.

In 1925 the DNVP had temporarily abandoned its anti-republican attitude by joining the German cabinet in a liberal-conservative [[coalition government]] under Chancellor [[Hans Luther]]. However, in the [[1928 German federal election|1928 federal election]], the party suffered a disastrous defeat and had to accept the formation of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] government under Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]]. Westarp resigned as chairman; when in 1930 his support for the government of [[Heinrich Brüning]] did not meet with the approval of his party, and because of the anti-republican tendencies of his successor [[Alfred Hugenberg]] which became manifest during the [[1929 German referendum|1929 referendum]], he finally left the DNVP in 1930. In the same year he and [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (politician)|Gottfried Treviranus]] were among the founders of the moderate [[Conservative People's Party (Germany)|Conservative People's Party]] (KVP), with which he sat in the Reichstag until 1932.

Westarp did not stand for another seat in the [[July 1932 German federal election|1932 federal election]] whose outcome was a triumph of the rising [[Nazi Party]]. Upon the 1933 ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' he retired into private life. Suspected by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities to be involved in the [[20 July plot]], preliminary investigations against him furnished no proof. At the end of [[World War II]], he was temporarily arrested by [[Allied-occupied Germany|Soviet occupation]] forces in Berlin but soon released and died shortly afterwards.
