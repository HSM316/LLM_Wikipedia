El Ghazzali comes from a Sufi Berber family.<ref name="Tagi" /> His grandfather built a mosque in his village, his father, a dentist, wanted to have the son trained as an imam.

Addressing the council, El Ghazzali also said that "Iran’s human rights record brings shame on us all."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://iheu.org/iran-iheu-condemns-torture-detainees-oppression-protests-denial-human-rights/ |title=Iran: IHEU condemns torture of detainees, oppression of protests, and denial of human rights |author=Elizabeth O'Casey |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union |date=15 March 2018 |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>
