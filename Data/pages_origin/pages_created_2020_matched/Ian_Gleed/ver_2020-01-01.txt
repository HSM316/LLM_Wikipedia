[[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] '''Ian Richard Gleed''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|DSO|DFC}} (3 July 1916 – 16 April 1943), nicknamed "Widge," was a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) pilot and [[flying ace]] credited with the destruction of 13 enemy aircraft during the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Birtles|2003|p=43}} He served in the [[Battle of France]] and [[Battle of Britain]] before being shot down and killed over Tunisia.<ref name="monument">{{cite web|title=Battle of Britain London Monument - F/Lt.

Gleed Avenue in [[Bushey]] is named in his honour, one of a number of streets in the area named after Battle of Britain pilots.{{cit|date=January 2018}}

==Early life==

Gleed was born in [[Finchley]], north London on {{Birth date|1916|7|3|df=yes}} to Seymour Richard and Florence Hair Gleed.<ref name="grave"/> His father, a doctor, had served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] during the [[First World War]], and his sister Daphne was also involved in medicine.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}}

He studied at [[Epsom College]] and was an avid sailor.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}} Gleed told friends that after the war, he planned to buy a sailboat and sail to the [[South Seas]].{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 14—Hector Bolitho: The Writer}}

==Military career==
===Pre-war===
After learning to fly as a civilian, Gleed was granted a RAF commission in 1936. He completed training on Christmas Day 1936 and was posted to [[No. 46 Squadron RAF|46 Squadron]], flying the [[Gloster Gauntlet|Gloster Gauntlet II]], a biplane fighter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squadron Info – No 46 Squadron RFC and RAF|url=http://46squadron.org/squadron-info/|website=46squadron.org|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="monument"/> Gleed was promoted to flying officer on 9 October 1938.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}}

His RAF nickname, "Widge," is said to be short for "Wizard Midget" for Gleed's short stature and his habit of using "wizard" as an adjective.<ref name=Hatfield/>

===Phoney War===
At the onset of war in September 1939, he was transferred to [[No. 266 Squadron RAF|266 Squadron]] as a flight commander.<ref name="monument"/> The squadron took deliveries of [[Spitfires]] in January.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sqn Histories 266-270_P|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820051510/http://www.rafweb.org/Sqn266-270.htm|accessdate=5 February 2018|date=20 August 2008}}</ref>

In February 1940, a Spitfire he was flying broke up in the air. Gleed was injured while falling out of the plane but regained consciousness soon enough to pull his parachute.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}}

===Battle of France===

Gleed regained his full flying status on 14 May 1940, when he was posted to [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87 Squadron]],<ref name="monument"/> a [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] squadron. 87 was stationed in France, and had suffered significant casualties during the first week of the [[Battle of France]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Britain London Monument - F/Lt. D H WARD|url=http://www.bbm.org.uk/airmen/WardDH.htm|website=www.bbm.org.uk|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>

About Gleed's arrival in France, British RAF pilot [[Roland Beamont]] said the following:

:Gleed was one of our replacement pilots and he came out from the UK to tell us exactly how to run the war – all 5ft 6ins of him! He was immediately as good as his word and tore into the enemy on every conceivable occasion with apparent delight and entire lack of concern. His spirit was exactly what was needed to bolster up the somewhat stunned survivors of the week following 10 May. That is not to say that 87 Squadron's morale was not extremely high, but The Widge somehow managed to raise it further.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 15—Brief Encounters in the Blackout</ref>

Gleed's first victories came on 18 May, when he claimed two [[Bf 110]] destroyed. The following day, he claimed one [[Bf 109]] destroyed and an additional probable, two [[Do 17]] bombers, and a shared [[He 111]] bomber destroyed.<ref name="monument"/> This is the basis of the claim that Gleed was the fastest RAF pilot to make [[flying ace|ace]], in only two days.<ref name="Hatfield"/> 87 Squadron was evacuated back to Britain on 22 May.<ref name="monument"/>

===Battle of Britain===
During the Battle of Britain, [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87 Squadron]] was part of [[No. 10 Group RAF|10 Group]], based at [[Church Fenton]] and later [[Exeter]].<ref>{{cite web|title=No. 87 Squadron (RAF) during the Second World War|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/air/units/RAF/87_wwII.html|website=www.historyofwar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> At one point, converting to Spitfires was considered but abandoned after Beamont and Gleed were able to easily defeat a Spitfire pilot in a dogfight with their Hurricanes.<ref>Beamont 47</ref> During the air raids of [[The Blitz]], 87 Squadron was assigned night fighter duties defending Bristol. Despite the limitations of using searchlights to direct the Hurricanes to enemy aircraft,{{sfnp|Lanchbery|1955|p=58}} Gleed scored two victories at night.<ref name="DSO"/> In December 1940 Gleed was promoted to [[squadron leader]] and took command of 87 Squadron at [[RAF Charmy Down]].<ref name="Hatfield"/><ref name=bbc-19800919>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/49/a6845349.shtml |title=RAF 10 Group HQ Reminiscences - Part 1 |last=Roffey |first=Len |publisher=BBC |date=19 September 1980 |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> At the time, [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]] was serving as 87 Squadron's adjutant.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=Mr. Strachey's Statement |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1946/mar/12/mr-stracheys-statement |date=12 March 1946|speaker =[[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]}}</ref> He wrote the forward to Gleed's memoir, ''Arise to Conquer.''{{sfn|Gleed|1942|p=vii}} 
[[File:Dowding and The Few.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|300px|Reunion of Battle of Britain pilots with Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding]] in September 1942. Gleed is third from left.]]

A year later (November 1941, at the age of 25) Gleed was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and was appointed [[wing leader]] at [[RAF Middle Wallop]] and later [[RAF Ibsley]]. (A [[wing leader]] is responsible for flying operations of three to five squadrons, but has no authority over administrative matters.) At Ibsley, he directed the operations of 118, 234 and 501 Squadrons, which made fighter sweeps across the English Channel and conducted bomber escorts.<ref name="Hatfield"/> 

At other times, the Hurricane squadrons would act as fighter-bombers with Spitfires as top cover.{{sfn|Conroy|2003|pp=210, 214}} During bomber escorts, Gleed advised his pilots to stay with the bombers and not get distracted by chasing enemy fighters. Nevertheless, he was quick to take action when the opportunity presented itself.{{sfn|Bowman|2010|p=98}}

In June 1942 he was rested from operations and [[Christopher Frederick Currant|"Bunny" Currant]] was promoted to command the Ibsley Wing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Britain London Monument - F/Lt. C F CURRANT|url=http://www.bbm.org.uk/airmen/Currant.htm|website=www.bbm.org.uk|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref> Gleed was posted to [[RAF Bentley Priory]], HQ Fighter Command, where he was Wing Commander Tactics and subsequently Wing Commander Operations.<ref name="monument"/>

[[File:SpitfireVb 601Sqn Djerba1943.jpg|thumb|300px|Two [[No. 601 Squadron RAF|601 Sqn]] Spitfire Vb over [[Djerba Island]] in early 1943, led by Wing Commander Gleed in his personal Spitfire marked IR-G.]]

===Tunisian Campaign===

However, Gleed was not content sitting behind a desk, and arranged to be posted to an operational command in the Middle East, a more active theater following the [[Operation Torch|Torch]] landings.{{sfn|Bowyer|2000|p=78}} In January 1943, he was posted to the Middle East, where he took command of 244 Wing on 31 January. He claimed his final aerial victory on 17 March. Even after the newer, faster Spitfire IX became available, Gleed insisted on allowing less experienced pilots to fly it, instead flying a lower-performing Spitfire Vb.<ref name="Hatfield"/>

244 Wing participated in [[Operation Flax]], a series of fighter sweeps over the [[Cap Bon]] area intended to intercept transport aircraft attempting to evacuate Axis personnel from Tunisia to Sicily. Gleed led one such operation on 16 April. The RAF destroyed seven [[SM.82]] fast bombers and a Bf 109, but Gleed and his wingman were killed. Gleed was likely shot down by the high-scoring Luftwaffe ace [[Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert]].<ref name="monument"/> Reinert had claimed a [[P-51 Mustang]], but it is believed that he misidentified Gleed's clipped-wing Spitfire Vb.{{sfn|Murawski|2009|p=35}}

His loss caused the Allies to abandon small-scale fighter sweeps. From that point on missions consisted of three P-40 squadrons covered by one Spitfire squadron.{{sfn|Murawski|2009|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Levine|2008|p=180}}

Gleed's final "score" was thirteen destroyed, seven probables, four damaged, one destroyed on the ground and one damaged on the ground.{{sfn|Birtles|2003|p=43}}

==Personal life==

The publisher of Gleed's memoir was concerned about his "confirmed bachelor" status and encouraged Gleed to invent a fictional fiancée, named Pam. Gleed told his family that he invented her because "readers like a taste of romance."{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}}

A 1978 biography of Gleed by [[Norman Franks]] struck one reviewer as leaving "many questions unanswered" especially regarding his personal life: "[[Neville Duke]] and Roland Beamont do not, as quoted, provide us with much of a clue to the kind of man Ian Gleed was (other than an exceptionally successful, gallant and determined fighter pilot). Norman Franks tells us of only one close friend—a boy who used to go sailing with Gleed and whose company he seems to have gone to considerable lengths to enjoy, even at the risk of court martial for 'the employment of aircraft for unauthorised purposes in wartime.'"{{sfn|Flight International|1979|p=1770}}

In 1997, RAF pilot Christopher Gotch gave an interview on a BBC documentary on LGBT history, "It's Not Unusual." He said that he had had a [[homosexual]] relationship with Gleed while they were stationed at [[RAF Middle Wallop]] in 1942.{{sfn|Jivani|1997|pp=79–80}}{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 16—Against the Law}} Gotch recalled that Gleed had approached him and initiated a sexual relationship, at considerable risk as [[gross indecency]] was not only a court-martial offence but a crime punishable by jail time. The relationship ended when Gleed was posted to [[RAF Bentley Priory]] and then the Middle East.{{sfn|Jivani|1997|p=85}} They were never caught, although Gotch describes a close call in which he hid in Gleed's closet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Age of Innocence, It's Not Unusual: a Lesbian and Gay History - BBC Four|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007y8b3|website=BBC|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>

Modern sources have described Gleed as gay.{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 13—Ian Gleed: The Hero}}<ref>Reeve</ref>

==Honours==
His [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] was gazetted on 13 September 1940 without a citation.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34945|date=13 September 1940|page=5488 |supp= }}</ref>

Distinguished Service Order, gazetted on 22 May 1942:
:"This officer has led his wing on 26 sorties over enemy territory. He has always displayed a fine fighting spirit which, combined with his masterly leadership and keenness, has set an inspiring example. Wing Commander Gleed has destroyed at least 12 enemy aircraft, 2 of which he shot down at night."<ref name="DSO">{{London Gazette |issue=35569 |date=19 May 1942 |page=2237 |supp=y }}</ref>

== Memorials ==

Gleed was interred at [[Cap Bon|Tazoghrane]], but reburied at the military cemetery in [[Enfidaville]].<ref name=monument/>{{sfn|Bowman|2010|p=105}} The inscription on his grave reads: ONE WHO HELD WE FALL TO RISE, ARE BAFFLED TO FIGHT BETTER, SLEEP TO WAKE.<ref name="grave">{{cite web|title=Ian Richard Gleed|url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2104166/gleed,-ian-richard/|website=www.cwgc.org|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=22 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Bunny Currant described Gleed as "[a] pocket-sized man with care for others and courage beyond compare."{{sfn|Bourne|2017|loc=chpt. 16—Against the Law}}

A wartime history of the Tunisia Campaign described him as "one of [the [[Desert Air Force]]'s] greatest leaders" and a "great little pocket Hercules."{{sfn|Wisdom|1944|p=180}}
Gleed was the subject of a 1978 biography, ''Fighter Leader'', by aviation historian Norman Franks.
