'''Robert Hermann Sterl''' (23 June 1867 &ndash; 10 January 1932) was a German painter and graphic artist.

== Life ==
Sterl was born in Großdobritz, now part of [[Dresden]], the son of a [[stonemason]]. From 1881 to 1888, he attended the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]], where he studied under [[Leon Pohle]] and [[Julius Scholtz]], later becoming a master student of [[Ferdinand Pauwels]]. A stay at the artists' colony in Goppeln near [[Bannewitz]] introduced him to [[impressionism]] and [[plein air]] painting.<ref name="S">[http://www.stadtwikidd.de/wiki/Robert_Sterl Robert Sterl biography] @ Stadtwiki Dresden</ref>

After leaving Pauwels' studio, he worked as a landscape painter and portraitist and, until 1904, operated a private painting school for women. In 1893, he became one of the founding members of the [[Secession (art)|Dresden Secession]]. He was appointed a Professor at the Academy in 1906, where he taught until 1931,<ref name="S" /> and became an associate member of the [[Berlin Secession]] in 1909. From 1913 to 1930, he was a member of the Dresdner Galeriekommission and, from 1920, had a seat on the Gallery Advisory Board, both of which positions enabled him to help young artists. When [[Gotthardt Kuehl]] died in 1915, Sterl took over his Master Class. During World War I, he worked as a war painter, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915 and the southern front in the [[Dolomites]] in 1917.<ref name="S" /> After the war, he bought a house in Struppen and built a spacious studio there.

===Work and legacy===
In addition to the usual impressionist subject matter, he painted musicians and workers, especially [[Quarryman|quarrymen]]. He was sympathetic to liberal causes, producing many socially conscious works; some of which are set in Russia, where he had travelled briefly before the war. Two of his paintings were labelled "[[degenerate art]]" in 1937 and removed from the [[Galerie Neue Meister]]. During the [[GDR]] years, his works were praised for some of the same reasons the Nazis had condemned them.<ref name="S" />

He died in [[Struppen]] after a long illness and was buried at his home, bequeathing his estate to the Academy for the purpose of discovering and promoting new artists. The "Robert and Helene Sterl Foundation" was created just before his death in 1931 and, since 1981, the home has been operated as a museum and research facility.<ref name="S" /> Beginning in 1997, the Foundation and related organizations have awarded the "Robert Sterl Prize" to a master student at the Academy. The prize includes €3,000 and an exhibit at the museum.<ref>[http://www.hfbk-dresden.de/hochschule/preise-und-stipendien/sterl-preis.html Robert-Sterl-Preis] with a list of the honorees</ref>
