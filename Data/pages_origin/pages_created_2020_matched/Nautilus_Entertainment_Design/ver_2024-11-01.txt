==History==
After viewing a show that Tetlow designed in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in 1991, an executive from [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] hired him to light their shows on board a new ship, [[Sensation (ship)|Carnival Sensation]].  Lighting design on further ships followed and in 1994 Tetlow was asked to consult on the entertainment facilities for [[Carnival Destiny]], the first cruise ship in excess of 100,000 tons.  Following that success, the fledgling company quickly expanded as they were called upon to now design all the new entertainment systems for most of the Carnival brands that includes [[Carnival Cruise Line]], [[Costa Crociere]], Holland America, [[Seabourn Cruise Line|Seabourn]], and [[Cunard Line|Cunard]].
