==Life and career==
Matheus was probably born in the diocese of [[Noyon]], northeast of Paris.  Nothing of his early life is known, nor is his age when he begins to appear in historical records.  He worked in England from about 1366 as a clerk for the son-in-law of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and later for [[Philippa of Hainault]], queen consort of Edward.  In 1368 he came back to France.  The next ten years are a blank, but at some time during this period he had begun working for Robert of Geneva, who later became [[Antipope Clement VII]].  In November 1378 – the same year Clement became pope<!--he did not become antipope till much later, in 1378 he was thought of as a pope. :-) --> – he is recorded as being a clerk for the [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou]], and between 1382 and 1387 he was at the papal court in [[Avignon]] as a chaplain.<ref name="Grove1"/>

==Music==
Six of his compositions have survived with reliable attribution.  They include an unusual [[motet]] for five voices, ''Ave post libamina/Nunc surgunt'' (very few motets of the period have more than four voices),<ref>Günther (1980)</ref> and five secular works:  three ballades and two [[rondeau (music)|rondeaux]].  Two of the ballades, and one of the rondeaux, are for three voices, and these are later compositions more associated with the ''ars subtilior'' style; the others are four voices, and were possibly written earlier.  That he was well-appreciated in England can be seen in late copies of his motet made there around 1430, for example, in the [[Old Hall Manuscript]].<ref name="Grove1"/>

Two of his works are in the Codex "ModA" (Modena, Biblioteca Estense, α.M.5.24), but without attribution.<ref>Hoppin, 489</ref>  The motet ''Ave post libamina'' is included in [[Corpus mensurabilis musicae]], vol. 46 (1969).<ref name="Grove1"/>
