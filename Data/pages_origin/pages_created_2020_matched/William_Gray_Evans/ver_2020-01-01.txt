'''William Gray Evans''' was the oldest son of Colorado's second territorial governor, [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]]. William was president of the [[Denver Tramway]] Company.{{sfn |History of the House|2011}}  He was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1855.  He moved with his family to [[Denver]], Colorado in 1862 when [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed his father, [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] as Colorado's territorial governor.{{sfn|Du Pont Breck|1964}}

William Evans served as secretary and later president of the Denver Tramway Company. He retired in 1913. In addition to his work with the [[Denver Tramway]] Company, William Evans was instrumental in building the [[Moffat Tunnel]].  Evans worked with [[David Moffat]] in financing the project in New York.{{sfn|Aspen Daily Times|1905}} Evans was with [[David Moffat]] at the time of his death in 1911, and the ''Grand Valley News'' described Evans as "the mainstay of Mr. Moffat in his railroad building and other enterprises for a number of years."{{sfn|Grand Valley News|1911}} After David Moffat's death, William Evans took over Moffat's positions as president of the [[Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway]] as well as president of the Colorado-Utah Construction Company.  Taking over Moffat's former offices allowed Evans to continue the work the two men had started in negotiating the terms of the [[Moffat Tunnel]]'s construction.{{sfn|Steamboat Pilot|1911}}

Evans was also influential in Denver politics in the first years of the twentieth century, and counted Denver Mayor [[Robert W. Speer]] and University of Denver chancellor [[Henry Buchtel]] among his personal friends.{{sfn|Yuma Pioneer|1906}}

William Gray Evans' home at 1310 Bannock Street in Denver is now a historic house museum, operated by History Colorado as the [[Byers-Evans House Museum]].
