==Early life and education==
Born in [[Evanston, Illinois]], on December 16, 1855,{{sfn|First Ladies of Colorado|1962}} he was the oldest child of [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] and [[Margaret Gray Evans]]. He moved with his parents to [[Denver]], Colorado in 1862{{sfn|Pharris|2012}} when [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed his father, [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] as Colorado's territorial governor.{{sfn|Du Pont Breck|1964}} They lived in Denver at 14th and Arapahoe streets.{{sfn|Pharris|2012}}

==Career==
[[File:1909 Denver tramway (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Denver Tramway]] streetcar, 1909]]
Evans, his father John Evans, [[William Byers]], Roger Woodbury and [[Henry C. Brown]] incorporated the [[Denver Tramway|Denver Tramway Company]] in 1866.{{sfn|Denver Tramway Archives}} William Evans served as secretary and later president of the Denver Tramway Company.{{sfn|Aspen Daily Times|1905}} Under his leadership, the Denver Tramway became a monopoly in the Denver area, putting horse railway and streetcar companies out of business. The tramway company then installed electricity-driven streetcars in every Denver neighborhood.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} Travel by tramway was essential within the city because most people did not have horses and carriages. Aside from a means of transportation for daily life, they were also used to transport caskets to the Riverside or Fairmount Cemeteries or were rented out for weddings.{{sfn|Denver Tramway Archives}} He oversaw the construction of the Denver Tramway headquarters at 14th and Arapahoe Streets, on the site of John Evan's family home. The building is now the Hotel Teatro.{{sfn|Pharris|2012}}

[[File:Image Moffat west2a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moffat Tunnel]]]]
Evans was instrumental in building the [[Moffat Tunnel]]. He worked with [[David Moffat]] in financing the project in New York.{{sfn|Aspen Daily Times|1905}} Evans was with [[David Moffat]] at the time of his death in 1911, and the ''Grand Valley News'' described him as "the mainstay of Mr. Moffat in his railroad building and other enterprises for a number of years."{{sfn|Grand Valley News|1911}} After David Moffat's death, he took over Moffat's positions as president of the [[Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway]] as well as president of the Colorado-Utah Construction Company.  Taking over Moffat's former offices allowed him to continue the work the two men had started in negotiating the terms of the [[Moffat Tunnel]]'s construction.{{sfn|Steamboat Pilot|1911}} The tunnel, which provided railroad service between Denver and the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope]], was completed in 1927. The first railroad train through the tunnel was from the [[Denver and Salt Lake Railway]].{{sfn|Wommack|2014}}

Evans was also influential in Denver politics in the first years of the twentieth century, and counted Denver Mayor [[Robert W. Speer]] and University of Denver chancellor [[Henry Buchtel]] among his personal friends.{{sfn|Yuma Pioneer|1906}} He is said to have "controlled Denver's political machine for many years.{{sfn|Zimmer|2012}}

Between 1909 and 1913, Evans worked on Mayor Robert Walter Speer's plan for a [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]], which involved creating parks throughout Denver. The plan for the parks was created the Evans family in 1894.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} He retired in 1913.{{sfn|Aspen Daily Times|1905}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Byers-Evans House, Denver, about 1889.png|thumb|[[Byers–Evans House]], Denver, about 1889, when the Evans family members were photographed. It was the home of William Gray Evans beginning 1889. In 1900, [[Margaret Gray Evans]] and her daughter [[Anne Evans (arts patron)|Anne Evans]] moved into the house.]]
He was married to Cornelia Lunt Gray (1863-1955),{{sfn|Byers-Evans House Museum Site}} his first cousin and the daughter of William Patten Gray.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} His mother [[Margaret Gray Evans]] and William Patten Gray were sister and brother.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} Cornelia and William had four children, John, Josephine, Margaret, and Katherine Evans.{{sfn|Pharris|2012}} John was the president of the [[First National Bank Building (Denver, Colorado)|First National Bank of Denver]].{{sfn|Zimmer|2012}}

William Gray Evans' home at 1310 Bannock Street in Denver is now a historic house museum, operated as the [[Byers-Evans House Museum]].{{sfn|Byers-Evans House Museum}} After the death of his father John Evans on July 3, 1897, William transferred the deed to the Byers-Evans House to his wife.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} Cornelia's father, who was a widower, moved into their home about 1897. A two-story addition with an elevator was added to the house in 1900 for his mother [[Margaret Gray Evans]] and his sister [[Anne Evans (arts patron)|Anne Evans]] who moved into the house. {{sfn|Wommack|2014}} Anne remained in the house after Cornelia and William's death.{{sfn|Wommack|2014}} Evans family members lived in the house until 1981.{{sfn|Pharris|2012}}

He died on October 21, 1924 in Denver,{{sfn|Shaw|1924}} and he was buried at [[Fairmount Cemetery (Denver, Colorado)|Fairmount Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
His son, John, said that his father and grandfather were "dreamers and believers in the future."{{sfn|Great Family: Evans of Denver|1959}} Of his father, he continued:
