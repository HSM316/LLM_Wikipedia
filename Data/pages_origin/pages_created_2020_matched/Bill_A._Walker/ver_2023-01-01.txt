'''William Armley "Johnnie" Walker''' (29 August 1886 – 8 November 1934)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianfootball.com/players/player/bill%2Bwalker/2816 |title=Bill Walker - Player Bio |publisher=Australian Football|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played for [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in the [[Australian Football League|VFL]].

==Family==
The son of William Walker, and Susannah Walker (1843–1912), née Kidd,<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5977959 Marriage: Walker—Kidd, ''The Argus'', (Thursday, 10 March 1881), p.1.]</ref><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197406897 Deaths: Walker, ''The Age'', (Tuesday, 23 January 1912), p.1.]</ref> William Armley Walker was born in [[Essendon, Victoria]] on 29 August 1886.<ref>Note that although his official birth records have his name as "William Armley Walker", his official death records, his death notices in the newspapers and, also, the death notices for his wife all refer to him as "Armley William Walker".</ref>

He married Josephine Harnett (?–1941) in 1916.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205293161 Deaths: Walker, ''The Age'', (Monday, 17 March 1941), p.1.]</ref> Josephine Harnett was the licensee of the Tankerville Arms Hotel, Nicholson Street, Fitzroy for twenty years.

==Football==
===Essendon (VFL)===
Walker, also known by his nickname 'Johnnie', was recruited from the Collingwood Juniors.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article242217387 Gossip in General from All Quarters, ''The Herald'', (Friday, 28 April 1911), p.2.]</ref>

A [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], he was a member of Essendon's 1911 and 1912 premiership teams. His 14 goals in 1915 was enough to top Essendon's goal-kicking. Although selected to represent the VFL in a match against a combined Bendigo Football League team, played in Bendigo on 3 July 1912, he did not play in the game.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226949858 Football, (Thursday, 4 July 1912), p.8.]</ref>

Although he missed the team's first match, against Collingwood, he played in the remaining eleven matches of the (truncated due to World War I) 1915 season.

Essendon did not compete in the VFL in 1916 and 1917. Walker did not resume his career in 1918, when Essendon re-entered the competition.

===VFL Tribunal (30 July 1913)===
In July 1913 Walker, who played in a long-sleeved [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]], was reported by both [[Dan Feehan]], the match steward, and [[Jack Elder (umpire)|Jack Elder]], the central umpire, for striking (ex-Essendon) Fitzroy's [[Jim Martin (Australian footballer)|Jim Martin]] with his elbow during the [[1913 VFL season#Round 14|26 July 1913 match against Fitzroy]].

In the evidence given to the tribunal it was established that Mertin had, indeed, been elbowed by somebody; and that the perpetrator had been wearing a short-sleeve guernsey. Martin gave evidence that it was not Walker who had struck him, but it was [[Jack Woolley (footballer)|Jack Woolley]]. Jack Woolley also appeared before the tribunal, stating that he had worn a short-sleeved guernsey, and that it was he, rather than Walker, who had had struck Martin with his elbow. The charge against Walker was dismissed.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197485594 Rough Football: Charges of Elbowing, ''The Age'', (Thursday, 31 July 1913), p.11.]</ref><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7290972 Football: League Players Reported: Mistaken Identity,''The Argus'', (Thursday, 31 July 1913), p.4.]</ref><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article241539398 Elbow Room, ''The Herald'', (Friday, 1 August 1913), p.3.]</ref>
