The '''Nephin Beg Range''' or '''Nephin Mountains'''<ref>O'Hara, Bernard. ''Mayo: Aspects of Its Heritage''. Archaeological, Historical & Folklore Society, 1982. p.207</ref>  is a [[mountain range]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Republic of Ireland]]. The range contains the mountains of [[Slieve Carr]] (its highest peak), [[Nephin Beg]], [[Birreencorragh]] and Corranabinnia/Cushcamcarragh, among others. The range hosts the Nephin forest, a 4,843 [[hectares]] [[forest]] managed by [[Coillte]].

The range is in the process{{when?|date=March 2023}} of becoming Ireland's first designated wilderness area, a 10-15 year project including remaking forest roads as walking trails and setting up huts for sustainable camping. The wilderness, when finished, is due to cover 16,000 hectares including a large amount of [[Ballycroy National Park]] and [[Coillte]] land.{{fact|date=March 2023}}
