'''Migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates''' describe the alien foreign workers who have moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for work. As a result of the proximity of the UAE to South Asia and a better economy and job opportunities, most of the migrant foreign workers are from [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationpolicyinstitute-europe.org/article/labor-migration-united-arab-emirates-challenges-and-responses|title=Labor Migration in the United Arab Emirates: Challenges and Responses - migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=2016-06-12}}</ref>

== Emiratisation ==
[[Emiratis]] receive favorability in employment via the [[Emiratisation]] program forcing companies by law to limit the number of migrant workers in a company. This is done for the purposes of stabilizing the labor market and protecting the rights of this group as a minority in their own country. At the same time, however, due to the welfare benefits of the UAE government, many Emiratis are reluctant to take up low paying jobs especially those in the private sector; private sector employers are also generally more inclined to hire overseas temporary workers as they are cheaper and can be retrenched for various reasons, for example, if they go on strike<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emiratisation.org/ |title=<!---->ManpowerGroup <!----> |publisher=www.emiratisation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref><ref>[http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/labour/Emiritisation/10049370.html New emiratisation drive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203052442/http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/labour/Emiritisation/10049370.html |date=2009-02-03 }}, gulfnews.com; accessed 27 October 2015.</ref><ref>[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/04/18/10119108.html Call for cautious Emiratisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316044258/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/04/18/10119108.html |date=2009-03-16 }}, GulfNews.com; accessed 27 October 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rights-group-urges-uae-not-deport-strikers-503032.html |title=Rights group urges UAE not to deport strikers |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref> Most UAE locals also prefer government jobs and seek university degrees to gain higher positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn |title=Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref>

== Alien work permit ==
The United Arab Emirates has a work visa [[Kafala system|sponsorship system]] to issue work permits for foreign alien nationals who wish to migrate for work in the UAE.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lori|first=Noora|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/offshore-citizens/E5C614AE7864BC6EB19846498CD8C1BB|title=Offshore Citizens: Permanent Temporary Status in the Gulf|date=2019|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-49817-3|location=Cambridge}}</ref> Most of the visas are sponsored by institutions and companies. A person looking to enter the UAE for work needs to first procure a work permit from the Ministry of Human Resources. The work permit allows the holder to enter the UAE for employment and it is valid for two months from the date of issue. After the employee enters the UAE on the basis for work, the sponsoring company or institution arranges to complete the requirements of medical testing, obtaining Emirates ID card, labor card and stamping the work residency permit on his passport. The work residency permit on the employee's passport denotes that his legal presence for work in the country is provided by the company he is employed by. After this process, the employee can sponsor his family members and bring them into the country. Per Article 1 of Ministerial Decree No. 766 of 2015, an employee whose employment was terminated because of expiry of his contract can get a new work permit when he wishes to join a new employment. The employee may remain in the UAE on a 6 month job seeker visa to find a new job which will legalize his residency status to work in the country for a longer period. A new work permit is also issued if it is determined that the employer has failed to meet the legal and contractual obligations, including but not limited to failure to pay wages for more than 60 days. A worker may request his contract to be terminated after at least 6 months of employment. A worker whose employer terminated him unfairly is entitled to receive a new work permit without the need to complete six months.<ref name="UAE">{{cite web|url=https://government.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visa/getting-a-work-and-residency-permit|title=Getting a work and residency permit|publisher=UAE Government}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/uae-amnesty-2018-6-month-visa-for-violators-who-seek-jobs-a-golden-opportunity-1.2258997|title=UAE Amnesty 2018: 6-month visa for violators who seek jobs a golden opportunity|newspaper=Gulf News|date=30 Jul 2018}}</ref>

The right of alien residence and work permit is protected by the UAE Federal law No. 6 of 1973 on the Entry and Residence of aliens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/732140/work+visas/Overview+Immigration+Law+of+The+UAE|title=United Arab Emirates: Overview: Immigration Law Of The UAE|publisher=Mondaq.com|date=2 September 2018}}</ref> Per UAE law, an employer may not deny an employee on a work visa right to an annual leave, regular paid wage, 45 days maternity leave, right to resign, resign gratuity, and a 30 day grace period to find a new job. An employer is also prohibited by law to confiscate an employee passport, force the employee to pay for his residency visa fees, or force the employee to work more than 8 hours a day or 45 hours a week without compensation. An employee who wishes to leave needs to complete their legal notice period, which is usually 30 days or less, before leaving their job or risk being banned to work in UAE for up to one year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/how-to/employment/uae-labour-law-10-facts-that-you-need-to-know-about-working-in-the-uae-1.1556692179767|title=UAE Labour Law: 10 facts that you need to know about working in the UAE|newspaper=Gulf News|date=1 May 2019}}</ref> Alien widows or divorced women whose legal presence in the country was sponsored by their husband's work status are given a 1 year visa to stay in the country without the need for a work permit or a sponsor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/widows-divorced-women-can-now-sponsor-themselves-1.2292573|title=Widows and Divorced Women can now Sponsor Themselves|newspaper=Gulf News|date=22 October 2018}}</ref> As of August 2019, the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship issued a new family sponsorship policy that permits UAE residents to sponsor dependents based on their income, not their job titles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/government/new-family-sponsorship-policy-for-uae-expats-comes-into-effect-|title=New family sponsorship policy for UAE expats comes into effect|last=Tesorero|first=Angel|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>

==Foreign labor ==
[[Skill (labor)|Skill]] is a measure of the worker's expertise and other related factors. The United Arab Emirates receive many labors from different nationalities and with different skill levels - from 1975 onwards, non-nationals have consistently outnumbered the number of nationals residing within the Emirates (see Table 1, below). Indian, Bangladeshi, Nepali, Sri Lankan, and Pakistani workers make up 90 percent of the workforce.<ref name="ftn2">{{Cite web|last=Youha|first=Froilan T.

== Labor reforms ==
[[Reforms]] to abrogate the [[Kafala system|sponsorship]] system have been adopted in order to help prevent [[unfree labour]] that have emerged from the exploitation of the work visa sponsorship system. In January 2016, a ministerial decree, the first of its kind in [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] countries, was issues in order to protect [[Low pay|low-paid]] migrant workers from becoming [[forced laborers]]. It has been criticized by the HRW for the lack of details and possibility of non-applicability to domestic workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/01/uae-move-protect-migrant-workers|title=UAE: A Move to Protect Migrant Workers|website=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2016-06-12|date=November 2015}}</ref>

The DCT or Democracy Centre for Transparency released a report in April 2021 citing the discrimination faced by foreign workers and [[expatriates]] living in the United Arab Emirates. The conclusion is drawn not only based on the conditions faced by the foreign workers but also drawn on the contrast between the treatment of expatriates and Emirati citizens. The report focuses on the fact that despite the easing of the [[Kafala system]] in 2020 as part of labor reforms, some substantial gaps remain in the implementation and enforcement of the legal efforts introduced in exchange by the government. The social hierarchy in combination with the Kafala system and the exclusionary citizenship law has led to the non-UAE nationals facing racialization, discrimination on the basis of gender, wages, and obtaining promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dctransparency.com/discrimination-against-foreigners-and-expatriates-living-in-the-uae-versus-emirati-citizens/|title=Discrimination against foreigners and expatriates living in the UAE versus Emirati citizens|accessdate=26 April 2021|website=Democracy Centre for Transparency}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://dctransparency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Revised-UAE-discrimination-DEF-4.pdf|title=Discrimination against foreigners and expatriates living in the UAE versus Emirati citizens|accessdate=26 April 2021|website=Democracy Centre for Transparency}}</ref>

===UAE Domestic Workers Rights Bill===
In June 2017, the UAE adopted a new bill to bring the country's labor law into consistency with the [[International Labour Organization]]'s (ILO) [[Domestic Workers Convention]], providing migrant domestic workers with the same labor protections as other workers in the UAE.<ref name="hrwbill">{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/07/uae-domestic-workers-rights-bill-step-forward| title=UAE: Domestic Workers' Rights Bill A Step Forward|author=Human Rights Watch|access-date=15 August 2018| date=2017-06-07}}</ref> The bill requires employers to provide domestic workers with accommodation and food and provides them with 30 days of annual paid leave and daily rest of at least 12 hours. It also guarantee 15 days of paid sick leave, 15 days of unpaid sick leave, and compensation for work-related injuries or illnesses.<ref name=hrwbill></ref> The bill sets out a weekly rest day but permits the employer to make the domestic worker forgo the rest day if paid.<ref name=hrwbill></ref>

===Incident of domestic workers abuse===
In October 2014, Human Rights Watch estimated that there were 146,000 female migrant domestic workers in the UAE whose work visa was sponsored by employers in the UAE. In an interview with 99 female domestic workers, HRW listed abuses claimed by their interviewees: most had their passports confiscated by their employers; in many cases, wages were not fully paid, overtime (up to 21 hours per day) was required, or food, living conditions or medical treatment was insufficient. 24 had been physically or sexually abused.<ref name="HRW_UAE_pdf_en">{{cite web|title='I Already Bought You' — Abuse and Exploitation of Female Migrant Domestic Workers in the United Arab Emirates (pdf) |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=2014-10-09 |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uae1014_forUpload.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6W0M1MD9W?url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uae1014_forUpload.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> HRW criticized the UAE government for failing to adequately protect domestic workers from exploitation and abuse and made many recommendations to the UAE, including repeal or amendment of Federal Law No. 6 of 1973 on the Entry and Residence of Foreigners, so that domestic workers can decide on their own to change between employers without losing their immigration status.<ref name="HRW_UAE_pdf_en" /> The UAE introduced Ministerial Decree No. 766 of 2015, which allows a worker to terminate his contract without losing their immigration status if the employer has treated him or her unfairly and be issued a new work permit, or to request the contract to be terminated without losing immigration status and receive a new work permit after at least 6 months of employment provided they have found a new employer.<ref name=UAE></ref>

== COVID-19 pandemic ==
In 2020, migrant workers in [[Dubai]] were left jobless because of the [[COVID-19]] pandemic. With visas expired and no salaries, many had to leave their accommodation and had no place of their own.
