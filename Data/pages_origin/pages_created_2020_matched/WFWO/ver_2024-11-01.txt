'''WFWO''' (89.7 FM) was a [[radio station]] located in [[Medina, New York]] and broadcasting at a frequency of 89.7&nbsp;MHz (Channel 209) with 400 watts of [[effective radiated power]] from an antenna 40 meters [[height above average terrain]]. The station was owned by FellowshipWorld, which had previously carried its programming on [[WBBF|AM 1120]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

WFWO signed on in 2010. On February 12, 2013, WFWO went silent.<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=172262 WFWO station details from fcc.gov]</ref> It applied for an extension of its special temporary authority to remain silent on November 1, 2013. The station had been rebuked by the FCC for attempting to broadcast from a tower in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] instead of their city of license (Medina) without FCC permission. On August 26, 2014, the FCC cancelled WFWO's license.

A separate license on the 89.7 frequency was awarded to the neighboring village of [[Albion (village), New York|Albion]] shortly thereafter. That station, '''W209BF''', operates on a much lower power (38 watts) and simulcasts the [[Family Life Network]].
