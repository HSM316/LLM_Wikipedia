About the song, tastemaker website [[RCRD LBL|RCRDLBL]] said "Amtrac, the solo project of Kentucky's Caleb Cornett, has just the right mixture of pop and cutting-edge sonics to break through the void. On 'Came Along,' Amtrac guides a rapid, crunchy beat and electric piano figures to a thoroughly mature songwriting space. He's restless, though. This poise quickly evolves into spliced samples flickering across the track in microtonal dots—a true dancefloor deconstruction."<ref name=rcrdlbl>{{cite web|last=Maness |first=Carter |title=Download: Amtrac – Came Along |url=http://rcrdlbl.com/2011/08/31/download_amtrac_came_along |publisher=RCRDLBL |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508115649/http://rcrdlbl.com/2011/08/31/download_amtrac_came_along |archivedate=May 8, 2012 }}</ref>
