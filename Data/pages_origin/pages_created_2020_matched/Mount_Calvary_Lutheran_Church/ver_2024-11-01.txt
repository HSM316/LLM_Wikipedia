==History==
It is not known when this congregation was established. In 1765 John Schwarbach, who apparently was temporarily rendering pastoral services, conveyed {{Convert|3|acre||abbr=|spell=in}} of land to Peter Painter and Jacob Shaffer, trustees of this church.<ref>Frederick County, Virginia, Deed books, Frederick County Courthouse, Winchester, Virginia, John and Margaret Schwarbac to Peter Painter and Jacob Shafer, 6 August 1765, Deed book 10, pages 544-546.</ref> The church was first called the “Hoxbiehl” or “Hacksbill” (Hawksbill), later “Comer’s Church” due to so many members by that name, and lastly “Mount Calvary.” This church was first served by the [[Pennsylvania Ministerium]], Bathaser Sauer having attended a convention as a lay delegate.<ref>''U.S. Works Progress Administration of Virginia Historical Inventory'', County: Page, Class: Church, "Mt.

Mount Calvary was originally a union church shared by members of the Lutheran and Reformed faiths. The insistence on conducting all church functions in the German language led to the cancellation of the union agreement in 1832, when the Reformed people formed a separate congregation.<ref>Klaus Wust, translator, ''The Record of Hawksbill Church 1788-1850 Page County, VA'' (Edinburg, Virginia: Shenandoah History, 1979), p. 8.</ref>

The church served an active congregation until 1959, when regular services ceased.<ref name="dhr8.5">[[#refDHR|Potterfield, McRae 1998, 2008]], section 8, p. 5.</ref>

Mount Calvary was the mother church of five other congregations in Page County that were organized, directly or indirectly, from her membership: Morning Star (organized 29 November 1873), Grace (organized 10 March 1877), St. Mark’s (organized 1876), St. James’ (Rileyville, organized 1884), and Beth Eden (organized 31 December 1896).<ref>C.
