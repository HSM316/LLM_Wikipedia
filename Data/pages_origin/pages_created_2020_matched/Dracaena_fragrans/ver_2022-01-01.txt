'''''Dracaena fragrans''''' ('''cornstalk dracaena'''), is a [[flowering plant]] [[species]] that is [[native plant|native]] throughout tropical Africa, from Sudan south to [[Mozambique]], west to Côte d'Ivoire and southwest to Angola, growing in upland regions at {{convert|600|–|2250|m|abbr=on}} altitude.<ref name="jstor">JSTOR Plant Science: [http://plants.jstor.org/flora/ftea009079 ''Dracaena fragrans'']</ref><ref name="GRIN">{{GRIN | accessdate = 22 December 2017}}</ref> It is also known as '''striped dracaena''', '''compact dracaena''', and '''corn plant'''.

''Dracaena fragrans'' is a slow growing shrub, usually multistemmed at the base, mature specimens reaching {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} or more tall with a narrow crown of usually slender erect branches. Stems may reach up to {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} diameter on old plants; in forest habitats they may become horizontal with erect side branches. Young plants have a single unbranched stem with a rosette of leaves until the growing tip flowers or is damaged, after which it branches, producing two or more new stems; thereafter, branching increases with subsequent flowering episodes.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="Huxley">Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening'' 2: 96. Macmillan {{ISBN|0-333-47494-5}}.</ref>

The leaves are glossy green, lanceolate, {{convert|20|–|150|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|–|12|cm|abbr=on}} wide; small leaves are erect to spreading, and larger leaves usually drooping under their weight. The [[flower]]s are produced in [[panicles]] {{convert|15|–|160|cm|abbr=on}} long, the individual flowers are {{convert|2.5|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, with a six-lobed corolla, pink at first, opening white with a fine red or purple central line on each of the {{convert|7|–|12|mm|abbr=on}} lobes; they are highly fragrant, and popular with pollinating insects. The fruit is an orange-red berry {{convert|1|–|2|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, containing several seeds.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="Huxley"/>

In Africa, ''D. fragrans'' is commonly grown as a [[hedge]] plant.<ref name="jstor"/> It is suited to frost-free climates and [[USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]]s 10-11. Elsewhere, it is primarily popular as a [[houseplant]] and valued for its tolerance of a wide range of indoor conditions from full light to low light.<ref name="Huxley"/> It is also very tolerant of neglect. The [[NASA Clean Air Study]] indicated that the plant aided removal of indoor pollutants such as [[formaldehyde]], [[xylene]], and [[toluene]].<ref>Wolverton, B. C. 1996. ''How to Grow Fresh Air''. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> The plant is known as "[[masale]]" to the [[Chagga people]] of [[Tanzania]], who regard it as holy.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Chagga people of Kilimanjaro |last=Stahl |first=Kathleen Mary |page=60 |year=1964 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter|Mouton]] |oclc=1382652 }}</ref>

===Cultivars===
Several [[cultivar]]s have [[variegation|variegated]] foliage. 'Massangeana', also commonly denominated "Mass Cane", has a bright yellow central stripe on the foliage. 'Compacta' is more compact and suitable for indoor cultivation. Other popular cultivars include 'Janet Craig', 'Lemon Lime', and 'Warneckei' ('Warneckii'), which are often sold under the synonym ''D. deremensis''.<ref name="Huxley"/>

===Propagation===
''Dracaena fragrans'' is propagated by [[cuttings (plant)|cutting]] segments of old stems {{convert|10|–|20|cm|abbr=on}} long, drying them, and then inserting them into moist sand until they root. New growth, typically being two or three shoots, comes from old foliar scars at the top of the stem.

==Etymology and synonymy==
The species name refers to the fragrant flowers, while the English name derives from a perceived resemblance of the stem to a [[maize|corn]] (''Zea mays'') stalk. Synonyms include ''Aletris fragrans'' L. (basionym), ''Cordyline fragrans'' (L.) Planch., ''Pleomele fragrans'' (L.) Salisb., ''Sansevieria fragrans'' (L.) Jacq., ''Dracaena deremensis'' Engl., ''Dracaena smithii'' Hook.f., and ''Dracaena ugandensis'' Baker.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="GRIN"/> Other English names include striped dracaena (for variegated cultivars), corn plant (for the cultivar 'Massangeana';<ref name="Huxley"/>), Chinese money tree, and fortune plant.<ref>MacDonald, Elvin "The World Book of House Plants" pp.238 Popular Books</ref>

The plant is known as "බෝතල් ගස් - bothal gas" (meaning "bottle tree") in Sinhala, in [[Sri Lanka]].
