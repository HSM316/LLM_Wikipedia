One month after she moved to New York City, the [[September 11 attacks]] took place.

Before going on air, she was told, "Prepare yourself. The whole of Portugal is watching you."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/911_OneYearLater/story_08.html|title=What have you learned in school today?|last=Goldman|first=Ari|work=September 11, One Year Later|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=8 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612034859/http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/911_OneYearLater/story_08.html|archive-date=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebigstory.org/front/front-reportingfrom.html|title=Reporting from Ground Zero|last=Van Dusen|first=Matt|date=June 4, 2002|publisher=The Big Story/UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref>
