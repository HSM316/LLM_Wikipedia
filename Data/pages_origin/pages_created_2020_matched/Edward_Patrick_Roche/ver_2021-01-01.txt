'''Edward Patrick Roche''' (1874-1950)  was a [[Newfoundland]]er [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's, Newfoundland|Archbishop of St. John's]] from 1915 until 1950, at the time of his appointment and until 1949 Newfoundland was not part of Canada, so he reported directly to the Pope,<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlcar2/Roche.htm Archbishop Edward Patrick Roche (1874-1950)]</ref> he opposed the confederation of Newfoundland and Canada.<ref name="conf" />

==Early life==
He was born 19 Feb 1874, Place Harbour, Placentia Bay, [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Fr. Roche was educated at St. Patrick's Hall, [[St. Bonaventure's College]] in St. John's and [[All Hallows College]], Dublin, Ireland, where he was ordained on June 24, 1897.<ref  name="conf">[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/confederation/bio7.html Edward Patrick Roche] The Confederation Debate: 50 Years and Counting, Newfoundland and Labrador History.</ref>

After ordination he returned to Newfoundland and ministered in Conception Bay South, in 1907 became the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of St. John's.

He was appointed Archbishop by Pope Pius X. and consecrated by Monsignor Stagni, Apostolic Delegate to Newfoundland at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist 29 June 1915.

He suffered from tuberculosis, however it was treated in New York and was able to return to his pastoral duties.

Responsible for the developments of many educational institutions he was significantly responsible for the development of St. Clare's Mercy Hospital.

He opposed the confederation of Newfoundland and Canada as did many other Catholic clergy, and articulated his view prior to the [[Newfoundland referendums, 1948|1948 referendums]]. In reaction to this, the [[Loyal Orange Association]] advised Protestants to resist Catholic influence by supporting union with Canada.  The results were correlated with demographics, and a majority of districts on the Avalon peninsula with mostly Catholic voters supported responsible government instead of confederation.

Archbishop Roche died in 1950 and is buried under the main altar of the Basilica in St. John's. He was succeeded by Bishop Patrick J. Skinner.
