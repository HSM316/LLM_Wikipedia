'''''Zoothamnium niveum''''' is a species of [[Ciliophora|ciliate]] [[protozoan]] which forms feather-shaped colonies in marine [[coast]]al environments. The ciliates form a [[symbiosis]] with sulfur-oxidizing [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic bacteria]] of the species "''[[Candidatus]]'' Thiobios zoothamnicoli", which live on the surface of the colonies and give them their unusual white color.

== Characteristics ==
The conspicuously white and feather-shaped colonies are composed of individual bell-shaped cells known as [[zooid]]s. The stalks of individual cells grow from a single central stalk. Colonies can reach a length of up to 15&nbsp;mm, formed from hundreds of single zooids, each with a length of only 120&nbsp;µm. An entire colony can contract into a ball-shaped bunch through the contraction of [[myonemes]] in their stalks.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Monika|last2=Espada-Hinojosa|first2=Salvador|last3=Lagkouvardos|first3=Ilias|last4=Volland|first4=Jean-Marie|date=2014|title=The giant ciliate Zoothamnium niveum and its thiotrophic epibiont Candidatus Thiobios zoothamnicoli: a model system to study interspecies cooperation|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=en|volume=5|pages=145|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00145|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3985026|pmid=24778630|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The white color is produced by [[autotrophy|chemolithoautotrophic]] sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, which cover the entire surface of the ''Z. niveum'' colony.<ref name=":1" /> In most other species of ''Zoothamnium'', bacteria are only known to cover the stalks. The bacteria contain [[Sulfur|elemental sulfur]], which appear white. ''Z. niveum'' appears colorless when the bacteria are absent.<ref name=":0" />

Like in other ciliates, a [[contractile vacuole]] maintains osmotic balance for the cell, and allows it to survive the salt concentrations in both marine and brackish water. The vacuole is located in ''Z. niveum'' directly below the lip of the [[peristome]].<ref name=":2" />

== Polymorphism ==
Most ciliates live as single-celled organisms in aquatic environments, and the single cell carries out all functions of life, such as nutrition, metabolism, and reproduction. Colonies of ''Z. niveum'' are composed of numerous individual cells that form a feather-like [[Colony (biology)|colonial unit]], with several different cell types. Old branches of the colony illustrate the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] of the [[zooid]]s when viewed under the microscope. Three different forms of the individual ciliate cells are present, which are distinct in both form and function. The large '''macrozooids''' can transform into '''swarmers''' and leave the colony. They settle on suitable surfaces and develop into new colonies. The '''microzooids''' are small cells specialized for feeding, which the colony does by consumption of their symbiotic bacteria and other organic particles. At the terminal ends of the colony are specialized zooids that can elongate and facilitate the asexual reproduction of the colony.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Bauer-Nebelsick|first1=Monika|last2=Bardele|first2=Christian F.|last3=Ott|first3=Jörg A.|title=Redescription of Zoothamnium niveum (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1831) Ehrenberg, 1838 (Oligohymenophora, Peritrichida), a ciliate with ectosymbiotic, chemoautotrophic bacteria|journal=European Journal of Protistology|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1016/s0932-4739(96)80036-8|year=1996}}</ref>

The bacteria on different parts of a host have different shapes despite belonging to the same species ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]). Those on the stalks are shaped like rods, but those in the region of the ciliated oral apparatus of the microzooids are shaped like small spheres (coccoid). Intermediate forms are also found in between.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Rinke|first1=Christian|last2=Schmitz-Esser|first2=Stephan|last3=Stoecker|first3=Kilian|last4=Nussbaumer|first4=Andrea D.|last5=Molnár|first5=Dávid A.|last6=Vanura|first6=Katrina|last7=Wagner|first7=Michael|last8=Horn|first8=Matthias|last9=Ott|first9=Jörg A.|date=March 2006|title="Candidatus Thiobios zoothamnicoli," an ectosymbiotic bacterium covering the giant marine ciliate Zoothamnium niveum|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=2014–2021|doi=10.1128/AEM.72.3.2014-2021.2006|issn=0099-2240|pmc=1393213|pmid=16517650}}</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==
The [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] colonies of ''Z. niveum'' were first described from the shallow waters of the [[Red Sea]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfried|first=Ehrenberg, Christian|date=1838|title=Die Infusionsthierchen als vollkommene Organismen.|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/46381099#page/50/mode/1up|language=de|volume=[Text pt.2]|publisher=L. Voss}}</ref> They were later also found in the [[Florida Keys]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and at the [[Belize Barrier Reef]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name=":0" />

The colonies settle in environments that contain [[sulfide]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]], [[sulfide]], and related sulfur-containing compounds like [[thiosulfate]] are produced during the decomposition and remineralization of organic material. For example, plant material like the torn-off leaves of ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'' in [[seagrass meadow]]s of the [[Mediterranean]] accumulate in depressions of rocky ledges and decompose. In [[Mangrove|mangrove forests]] of the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], organic material can form peat and release sulfide.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Ott|first1=Jörg A.|last2=Bright|first2=Monika|last3=Schiemer|first3=Friedrich|date=1998-09-01|title=The Ecology of a Novel Symbiosis Between a Marine Peritrich Ciliate and Chemoautotrophic Bacteria|journal=Marine Ecology|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.1998.tb00464.x|bibcode=1998MarEc..19..229O|issn=1439-0485}}</ref> Hydrogen sulfide can also originate from geological phenomena such as at underwater [[hydrothermal vents]], e.g. off the [[Canary Islands]].

== Ecological conditions ==
Extreme ecological conditions prevail at these sources of sulfide close to which colonies of ''Z. niveum'' settle. Because there is little water current under [[mangrove|mangrove roots]] and at seagrass deposits under rock ledges, these decomposition hot-spots are extremely poor in oxygen and rich in sulfide. In mangrove forests off the coast of Belize, they have been found around small holes in the mangrove peat which form when the mangrove rootlets decompose.<ref name=":3" /> These openings have been called sulfide "microvent[s]",<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vopel|first1=Kay|last2=Thistle|first2=David|last3=Ott|first3=Jörg|last4=Bright|first4=Monika|last5=Røy|first5=Hans|date=2005-01-01|title=Wave-induced H2S flux sustains a chemoautotrophic symbiosis|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=128–133|doi=10.4319/lo.2005.50.1.0128|bibcode=2005LimOc..50..128V|issn=1939-5590|url=https://openrepository.aut.ac.nz/bitstream/10292/1466/2/vopel%20et%20al%202005.pdf|doi-access=free|hdl=10292/1466}}</ref> because they resemble in miniature the [[hydrothermal vents]] of the deep sea, the so-called [[black smokers]], although the temperatures in shallow waters are much lower (28&nbsp;°C in the Caribbean, 21&nbsp;°C-25&nbsp;°C in the Mediterranean (summer)), compared to the gradient between >300&nbsp;°C and 2&nbsp;°C in the deep sea because of volcanic activity. The ''Zoothamnium'' colonies do not settle directly over the decomposing material, but nearby e.g. on overhanging rocks, leaves of seagrass or seaweed, or mangrove roots.<ref name=":0" />

== Symbiosis ==
The symbiotic benefits provided by the colonies of ''Z. niveum'' for its attached ectosymbiotic bacteria ''[[Candidatus]]'' Thiobios zoothamnicoli (a member of the [[Gammaproteobacteria]]<ref name=":1" />), which are vertically transmitted to its host,<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6803713/ Thiotrophic bacterial symbiont induces polyphenism in giant ciliate host Zoothamnium niveum]</ref> are its active alternation between oxygen-rich and sulfide-rich conditions. This alternation can occur through the regular contraction and extension of the colonies and through the water currents set up by the beating of the cilia in the region of the oral opening of the ciliates.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Rinke|first1=Christian|last2=Lee|first2=Raymond|last3=Katz|first3=Sigrid|last4=Bright|first4=Monika|date=2007-09-22|title=The effects of sulphide on growth and behaviour of the thiotrophic Zoothamnium niveum symbiosis|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=274|issue=1623|pages=2259–2269|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0631|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1950315|pmid=17660153}}</ref>

The rapid contraction and slow re-extension of the colonies causes a flow of both sulfide-rich water for the feeding of the bacteria and normal oxygenated seawater for the respiration of ''Z. niveum''. Through the beating of its cilia at the oral apparatus of ''Zoothamnium'' is the mixing regulated. When there is a low supply of sulfur compounds, the bacteria use the sulfur that is stored inside their cells. They eventually appear pale and transparent after four hours because the stored sulfur has been consumed. However, if the sulfide concentration is too high, it can be toxic to the ''Zoothamnium'' colonies and kill the ciliates despite the bacteria.<ref name=":4" />

Bacteria close to the oral end of the microzooids have a coccoid form, a larger volume, and a higher division rate than the rod-shaped bacteria on the stalks, despite both belonging to the same species. This is because the mixing of water by the beating of the oral cilia result in a more optimal concentration of both oxygen and sulfide in the water there.<ref name=":4" /> The bacteria at the oral region can thus be used as a food source and are swirled into the mouth ([[cytostome]]) of the ciliate and digested.
