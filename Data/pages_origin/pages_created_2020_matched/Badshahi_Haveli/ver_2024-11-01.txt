'''Badshahi Haveli''' is an historic building in Naya Bazar, [[Ajmer]] in India.

It was built in 1507 on the order of [[Emperor Akbar]]. Rectangular in shape, the building has a pillared hall inside. The Haveli has rooms on all the four corners and can be entered via the eastern [[verandah]]. The Haveli was used by one of the [[Emir|Amirs]] of Akbar as a residence later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asijaipurcircle.nic.in/Badshahi%20haveli,%20Ajmer.html#|title=BADSHAHI HAVELI {{!}} ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF INDIA JAIPUR CIRCLE|website=asijaipurcircle.nic.in|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patrika.com/ajmer-news/overlook-at-heritage-lock-310845/|title=धरोहर पर अनदेखी का ताला|website=www.patrika.com|date=18 October 2015 |language=hindi|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>
