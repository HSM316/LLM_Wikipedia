The '''Suppression of Heresy Act 1414''' (2 Hen. V St. 1, c. 7) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. The Act made [[heresy]] an offence against the [[common law]] and temporal officers were to swear to help the spiritual officers in the suppression of heresy. [[Justices of the Peace]] were given the power of inquiry; to issue an order to arrest; and to hand over the suspected heretic to the ecclesiastical court for trial.<ref>Dudley Julius Medley, ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History. Sixth Edition'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1925), pp. 601-02.</ref> It also enacted that{{Quote |''that whoever should read the Scriptures in English'' (which was then called [[John Wycliffe|Wicliffe]]'s Learning) ''should forfeit land, cattle, goods, and life, and be condemned as heretics to God, enemies to the crown, and traitors to the kingdom; that they should not have the benefit of any sanctuary, though this was a privilege then granted to the most notorious malefactors; and that, if they continued obstinate, or relapsed after pardon, they should first be hanged for treason against the king, and then burned for heresy against God.''}}
