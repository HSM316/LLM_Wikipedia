'''Audiotransparent''' is a Dutch [[indie pop]] band, influenced from several genres, including [[American (music)|american]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/audiotransparent |title=Audiotransparent &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref> This band was formed in 2002 but they made their debut in 2003, with their self-titled album ''[[audiotransparent (album)|Audiotransparent]]'', and received positive reviews.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disagreement.net/reviews/audiotransparent_audiotransparent.html |title=Audiotransparent |publisher=disagreement.net |date=n.d. |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>

In 2005, they released their second album, ''[[nevland (album)|nevland]]''. It was named after the Norwegian striker [[Erik Nevland]], who played for [[FC Groningen]] until 2008. There were some changes in their line-up before it was finally released.

After two years of recording in a fully analog studio, their third album, ''[[Chekhov Guns]]'' was finally released in 2009. With all habits and rules overthrown, the band tried to focus on what was best for their upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audiotransparent.bandcamp.com/ |title=Audiotransparent |publisher=bandcamp.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref> The band members faced several issues; ending friendships, relationships and cancer; which formed the leading themes for their songs.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://audiotransparent.com/about |title=About Audiotransparent |publisher=Audiotransparent.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2012-08-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913225831/http://www.audiotransparent.com/about/ |archivedate=2008-09-13 }}</ref>
