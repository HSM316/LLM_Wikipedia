The '''''Ada Express''''' ({{lang-tr|Ada Ekspresi}}) is a limited stop regional train service operating between [[Pendik railway station|Pendik]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Adapazarı]]. It was inaugurated on 5 January 2015 as the successor to the popular ''[[Adapazarı Express]]'' train service. However, unlike its predecessor, the ''Ada Express'' does not make local stops and run as often and it does not operate into central [[Adapazarı]]. Trains consist of [[TCDD TVS2000|TVS2000]] cars and use [[TCDD E68000|E68000]] series locomotives for motive power.
