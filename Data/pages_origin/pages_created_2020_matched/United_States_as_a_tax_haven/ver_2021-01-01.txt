In 2010, the United States implemented the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]]; the law required financial firms around the world to report accounts held by US citizens to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. 
The US on the other hand refused the [[Common Reporting Standard]] set up by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], alongside [[Vanuatu]] and [[Bahrain]].<ref name="SwansonApr5" />

This means the US receives tax and asset information for American [[asset]]s and [[income]] abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries. In other words, it has become attractive as a [[tax haven]].<ref name=BloombergDrucker />

It is more of a cause for concern than any other individual country – because of both the size of its offshore sector, and also its rather recalcitrant attitude to international co-operation and reform. Though the U.S. has been a pioneer in defending itself from foreign secrecy jurisdictions, aggressively taking on the Swiss banking establishment and setting up its technically quite strong Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) – it provides little information in return to other countries, making it a formidable, harmful and irresponsible secrecy jurisdiction at both the Federal and state levels."|source=[[Tax Justice Network]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Financial Secrecy Index 2015 reveals improving global financial transparency, but USA threatens progress|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FSI-2015-Presser.pdf|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=Tax Justice Network|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Robert W.|title=The World's Next Top Tax Haven Is...America|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/01/27/the-worlds-next-top-tax-haven-is-america|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=Forbes|date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>}}

===Offshore tax avoidance===
{{main|Tax avoidance in the United States}}
Despite this, the US [[Public Interest Research Group]] (PIRG) said in 2014 that the [[United States]] loses roughly $184 billion per year due to corporations such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying US taxes. According to PIRG:
*[[Pfizer]] paid no US income taxes 2010–2012, despite earning $43 billion. The corporation received more than $2 billion in federal tax refunds. In 2013, Pfizer operated 128 subsidiaries in tax havens and had $69 billion offshore which could not be collected by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS);
*[[Microsoft]] maintains five tax haven subsidiaries and held $76.4 billion overseas in 2013, thus saving the corporation $24.4 billion in taxes;
*[[Citigroup]] maintained 21 subsidiaries in tax haven countries in 2013, and kept $43.8 billion in offshore jurisdictions, thus saving the corporation an additional $11.7 billion in taxes.<ref name="U.S. PIRG">{{cite news|title=Picking Up the Tab 2014|url=http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/picking-tab-2014|work=U.S. PIRG|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref>
