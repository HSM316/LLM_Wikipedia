'''Arivaca Creek''' is a small valley [[stream]] in southern [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]], [[Arizona]], that is approximately {{convert|5.5|mi}} long from its origin in Arivaca Valley to its confluence with the [[Brawley Wash]] stream system. As a seasonal stream, Arivaca Creek is perennial for only about two miles most years and experiences its greatest stream-flow during winter and the summer [[North American Monsoon|Monsoon season]].<ref name="Hull, pg. 179">{{cite book|last=Hull|first=Tim|authorlink=|title=Moon: Arizona & the Grand Canyon|publisher=Avalon Travel|year=2014|isbn=1612387616}}</ref><ref name="aziba.org">{{cite web|title=Arivaca Cienega and Creek IBA >> Arizona Important Birding Areas Program |url=http://aziba.org/?page_id=778 |accessdate=2015-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218015834/http://aziba.org/?page_id=778 |archivedate=2015-02-18 }}</ref>

Most of Arivaca Creek and the [[riparian corridor]] it supports is protected as part of the [[Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge]] (Buenos Aires NWR). A rare swamp-like desert [[wetland]] area called '''Arivaca Cienega''' is located in the upper reaches of the creek and makes up the easternmost part of the Buenos Aires NWR. Both areas are open to the public for hiking, bird watching and other outdoor recreational activities. The small community of [[Arivaca, Arizona]], is located along the banks of the creek, in between the Arivaca Cienega just east of town and the Arivaca Creek trailhead to the west.<ref name="Hull, pg. 179"/><ref name="americantrails.org">{{cite web|title=National Recreation Trails: Arivaca Creek|url=http://www.americantrails.org/NRTDatabase/trailDetail.php?recordID=3419|publisher=|accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>
