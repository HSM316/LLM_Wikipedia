'''''Perfect Stride''''' is a semi-unreleased unfinished [[Indie game|indie]] [[skateboarding]] [[video game]] developed by [[Arcane Kids]] and released in an alpha form in 2013. Announced by the studio in 2013, the game, an online, first-person skateboarding simulator where players can do skateboarding tricks and socialize, depicts what would have happened in an apocalyptic alternate universe in which pro skater [[Tony Hawk]] had never landed the [[900 (skateboarding)|900]] at [[X-Games|X Games V]] in 1999 and achieved widespread recognition, and thus had never "triggered an explosion of corporate skateboarding", leading to the rise-in-power of an immortal "time wizard" who uses his abilities to prevent anybody from dying.<ref name="Time Wizard">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/22/4451778/perfect-stride-time-wizard|title=How Arcane Kids replaced Tony Hawk's 900 with a Time Wizard in Perfect Stride|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 June 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="Weird Thing">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/zineth-developers-next-game-is-a-weird-psychedelic-skateboarding-thing/|title=Zineth developer's next project is Perfect Stride, a psychedelic skateboarding game|website=PC Gamer|date=29 May 2013|publisher=|last1=Williams|first1=Katie}}</ref><ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://asherpenn.com/interview/arcane-kids/|title=Asher Penn|website=asherpenn.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> The player's overarching goal is to venture through the various islands within the game's dystopian environment and find what is rumored to be the very last bullet to exist on Earth and use it to kill the Time Wizard once and for all.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> According to the game's developers, it also takes place within a metaphorical depiction of [[Yahoo! Geocities]] and serves as a symbol of the "dying web," noting that the various pieces of architecture are representative of personal web pages.<ref name="Interview"/>

Gameplay-wise, ''Perfect Stride'' takes inspiration from early movement exploits in first-person shooting games.<ref name="PStride">{{cite web|url=http://pstride.tumblr.com|title=Perfect Stride|website=pstride.tumblr.com}}</ref> Making use of only the computer mouse, it utilizes a unique control scheme in which the player clicks the left and right buttons to build up force and moves the mouse in that direction to gain momentum.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> A "rewind" feature allowing players to correct mistakes is also present in the game, included out of the developers' experiences with other games and a desire to make the gameplay fair.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> The rewind gimmick is also tied into the game's plot; the player is unable to die at any point at all in the game, as time is frozen whenever they are about to and they are forced to rewind out of it.<ref name="Time Wizard"/>

The concept for ''Perfect Stride'' was inspired by developer and co-creator Ben Esposito's early attempts to modify ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', in which he mistakenly produced an unorthodox style of control that he felt would be interesting as a game of its own.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> Esposito brought the idea to co-developer Russell Honor, who took a full month in order to faithfully recreate the style of movement that Esposito had described.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> The game is meant to simulate the social atmosphere of a real-life [[skate park]], taking heed from early mods and online chat rooms,<ref name="Good Laugh">{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/good-laugh-ben-esposito/|title=Confessions of an online prankster: A good laugh with Ben Esposito - Kill Screen|date=14 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> and is intended to provide a laid-back multiplayer experience, with the team referring to it as a "lifestyle game".<ref name="Interview"/>

An early access alpha version of ''Perfect Stride'' was first made available to backers of the [[Kickstarter]] campaign for [[LA Game Space]] in August 2013.<ref name="Time Wizard"/><ref name="Weird Thing"/><ref name="Good Laugh"/> The build was a finalist for the "Excellence in Visual Arts" category in the 2014 [[Independent Games Festival]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moddb.com/games/perfect-stride/features/igf-2014-finalists|title = IGF 2014 Finalists feature - Perfect Stride}}</ref> and was released for free via [[the Internet Archive]] when LA Game Space ceased operation in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://igf.com/perfect-stride|title=Perfect Stride|date=22 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/LAGSEGP01Win|title = LA Game Space: Experimental Game Pack 01 - Windows}}</ref>

Due to its ambitious nature,<ref name="Good Laugh"/> the game is still in development and planned for an eventual release via [[Steam (service)|Steam]], with intentions to include a [[level editor]] and a full-fledged multiplayer feature separate from the story mode.<ref name="Time Wizard"/> Though as of 2022 it is unlikely the game will ever be released as Arcane Kids has mostly split up with the about section of the game stating on Ben Esposito's website "The perfect game. Can you find a copy?".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Perfect Stride â€“ Ben Esposito |url=http://www.torahhorse.com/index.php/portfolio/perfect-stride/ |access-date=2022-06-16 |language=en-US}}</ref>
