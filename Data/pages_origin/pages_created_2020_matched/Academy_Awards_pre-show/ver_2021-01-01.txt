The '''Academy Awards pre-show''' (currently known as '''Oscars Red Carpet Live''') is a live televised pre-show which precedes the start of the [[Academy Awards]] telecast by 90 minutes (previously by 30 minutes until 2011). The pre-show takes place on the [[red carpet]] surrounding the theater which holds the telecast, and is almost always hosted by various media personalities, such as [[Regis Philbin]], [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]], [[Tim Gunn]], and [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]].

In February 2011, ABC announced that due to the ending of [[Barbara Walters]]' Oscar Special,<ref>https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/barbara-walters-end-oscar-special-year/story?id=9818424&page=1</ref> the pre-show would instead take place 90 (rather than 30) minutes before the start time of the Oscar telecast, beginning with the [[83rd Academy Awards]] ceremony.

== History ==

Beginning with the [[1st Academy Awards]], there were no Oscar pre-shows. Instead, photographers and interviewers would approach the ceremony's nominees and other attendees as usual.  However, these events were neither [[television|televised]] nor heard on the [[radio]] prior to the ceremony. In 1979, [[Regis Philbin]] officially began the very first red carpet pre-show. However, this event was actually produced by [[KABC-TV]], the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[owned and operated station|O&O]] station in Los Angeles, and was not broadcast elsewhere. Ten years later, in 1989, both [[MTV]] and [[E!|Movie Time]] (which became E! a year later) began their red carpet pre-shows with focus on fashion. It would pass another decade, in 1999, when the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] eventually produced its own red carpet pre-show to air on ABC. 

Broadcasters such as [[CNN]], E! (under the ''[[Live from the Red Carpet]]'' banner also used for similar coverage from other major awards shows), and [[Pop (U.S. TV channel)|Pop]]) have continued to air their own extended red carpet coverage prior to the ceremony. To protect the official telecast, ABC has an exclusive window during the final hour before the ceremony (5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. PT) during which no other broadcaster may broadcast live or newly-recorded footage from the red carpet. To comply with this rule, most competing red carpet programs either sign off, or use footage that was recorded earlier. Interviews by other media outlets may continue, but they may not air on television until the end of the window.<ref name="cnnmoney">{{cite web|title=The quirky Oscars red carpet rule that helps ABC|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/02/22/media/oscars-red-carpet-tv-rules/|website=CNNMoney|access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref>

== Hosts ==

The pre-show usually employs the use of recent TV or media personalities as the hosts, who interview the nominees and attendees and sometimes introduce special segments in the moments preceding the ceremony.  Below is a listing of the hosts of the pre-show since the [[74th Academy Awards]] ceremony held in 2002.
