A '''snagboat''' is a river boat, resembling a [[barge]] with [[superstructure]] for crew accommodations, and deck-mounted [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[Hoist (device)|hoists]] for removing [[snags]] and other obstructions from rivers and other shallow [[waterway]]s.

During the [[American Civil War]], when much of the naval fighting was done on rivers and their tributaries, numerous snagboats were in operation.  {{USS|Benton|1861|6}}, for example, was a commercial snagboat quickly converted by the [[Union Army]] to a river [[gunboat]] when the American Civil War broke out.

In Canada, many of the rivers of [[British Columbia]] were maintained and kept open for navigation by federal Department of Public Works snagboats. On the [[Fraser River]], in southern British Columbia, a series of [[sternwheeler]] snagboats named ''Samson'' were operated by the Canadian Federal Government from the early 1880s until the retirement of final vessel in the series, the ''Samson V'' in 1980. The Samson V is now preserved as a museum on the waterfront of New Westminster, B.C. and was the last steam -powered sternwheeler to operate in Canada.   In northern British Columbia, Department of Public Works snagboats operated out of [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] and cleared the waters of the [[Nass River|Nass]], Ecstall, and [[Skeena river]]s.

The snag-clearance service was mainly important on the Fraser River because of the large amount of marine traffic. Passenger and freight-carrying sternwheelers operated out of [[New Westminster]] from 1859 until the early 1920s. These lightly built vessels were vulnerable to the woody debris and drift logs that would wash down the river with every spring [[freshet]]. After the 1920s, most of the traffic on the Fraser was tug and barge service along with deep sea shipping in the lower reaches of the river, and a greater portion of the snagboat's assignments was in maintenance of government docks and aids to navigation.  In northern British Columbia, as on the Fraser River, a major part of the snagboat service provided by the Canadian federal government was in support of the [[gillnet]] salmon-fishing industry and the canneries that were built in and around the estuaries of the major rivers. Huge amounts of timber debris would wash down-river every year creating hazards for fishermen and destroying nets.
