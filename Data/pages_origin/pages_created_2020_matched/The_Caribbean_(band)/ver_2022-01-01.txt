'''The Caribbean''' is an [[United States|American]] [[experimental music|experimental]] pop group from [[Washington, D.C.]], primarily composed of Michael Kentoff, Matthew Byars and Dave Jones.<ref>Artist Page, ''home-tapes.com'', May 10, 2011, "[http://home-tapes.com/Hometapes/The_Caribbean.html]'', May 11, 2011''</ref> The band has been critically acclaimed for its deconstructionist approach<ref>Joe Tangari, ''Pitchfork.com'', Feb. 23, 2011, "[http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15143-discontinued-perfume/]'', May 3, 2011''</ref> to pop music, its wry, literary lyrics, and its eclectic sound, which incorporates elements of [[American pop]], [[indie rock]] and [[experimental rock]], [[cool jazz]], [[folk music]], [[lounge music]], and even [[Brazilian music]].<ref>David Malitz, ''The Washington Post'', April 22, 2011, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/todays_paper?dt=2011-04-22&bk=T&pg=5]'', May 3, 2011''</ref>

== History ==
Formed in 1999, The Caribbean began as a songwriting and recording project between members of [[Washington, D.C.]] [[indie rock]] and [[post-punk]] acts Townies and [[Smart Went Crazy]].<ref>Heather Phares, ''AllMusic.com'', Jan. 15, 2002, "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-caribbean-p437366]'', May 3, 2011''</ref> Townies singer-guitarist Michael Kentoff and drummer-guitarist Matthew Byars joined Smart Went Crazy drummer Tony Dennison and began writing and arranging new songs to record.

The recording collective grew in 2001 with the addition of multi-instrumentalist Don Campbell, which allowed it to tour for the first time as a group. For the most part, The Caribbean remained a recording collective as its members spanned [[Maryland]], [[Florida]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Kentucky]]. Since 2004, all of their records have been mixed by producer/engineer/songwriter Chad Clark (Smart Went Crazy, [[Beauty Pill]]).<ref>Jonathan Fischer, ''Washington City Paper'', March 25, 2011, "[http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2011/03/25/the-caribbean-out-of-exile/]'', May 6, 2011''</ref> The Caribbean’s records eventually found release on [[Endearing Records]],<ref>Label Page, ''endearing.com'', Spring 2005, "[http://www.endearing.com/]'', May 11, 2011''</ref> [[Germany]]’s [[Tomlab]],<ref>Artist Page, ''tomlab.com'', 2009, "[http://www.tomlab.com/front/index.php?action=artist_detail&artist_id=11]'', May 11, 2011,''</ref> and, later, respected underground imprint Hometapes.<ref>Artist Page, ''home-tapes.com'', May 10, 2011, "[http://home-tapes.com/Hometapes/The_Caribbean.html]'', May 11, 2011''</ref> [[Western Australian]] experimental label [[Hidden Shoal Recordings]] releases The Caribbean’s less pop-song-oriented music, including a 2009 remix of the group's 2007 album, Populations, by producer/engineer [[Scott Solter]] (who has worked with [[John Vanderslice]], [[Okkervil River]], [[Fred Frith]], and [[The Mountain Goats]]).<ref>Artist page, ''hiddenshoal.com'', Jan. 15, 2009, "[http://agora.hiddenshoal.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37&products_id=103]'', May 5, 2011''</ref>

Guitar player Dave Jones joined in 2004 and the group again toured as a quartet until Campbell departed for graduate school in 2006. The trio of Kentoff, Byars, and Jones have stabilized as the main touring concern since then, with Campbell and Dennison still active in recordings."<ref>Digital album page, ''thecaribbeandc.bandcamp.com'', Nov. 16, 2010, "[http://thecaribbeandc.bandcamp.com/album/make-the-day-out-of-range-the-caribbean-2000-2008/]'', May 6, 2011''</ref>

The group has toured the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] extensively, including at respected [[North American]] music festivals such as [[South by Southwest]],<ref>South by Southwest schedule, ''schedule.sxsw.com'', March 16, 2011, "[http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_MS14226]'', May 6, 2011''</ref> [[CMJ Music Marathon]],<ref>Hometapes CMJ schedule, ''home-tapes.com'', Nov. 1, 2006, "[http://www.home-tapes.com/live.html]'', May 6, 2011''</ref> [[Toronto]]’s [[North by Northeast]]<ref>North by Northeast schedule, ''NowToronto.com'', June 5, 2003, "[http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=136950&archive=22,40,2003]'', May 6, 2011''</ref> and [[The Denver Post]]’s Underground Music Showcase.<ref>The UMS 2009 schedule, ''TheUMS.com'', July 26, 2009, "[http://gigbot.com/shows/24493]'', May 6, 2011''</ref>

The band's 2011 album, ''Discontinued Perfume'', received high praise from [[Pitchfork Media]], with the reviewer stating: "It’s as though the band had all the pieces for comfortable indie pop in its possession but no interest in putting them into a standard order. This is of course what makes them interesting. They are bound to confound your expectations several times on any given album, and if you’re into that, they’re good enough at putting these weird songs together that they can pull you in with surprising ease."<ref>Joe Tangari, ''Pitchforkmedia.com'', Feb. 23, 2011, "[http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15143-discontinued-perfume/]'', May 4, 2011''</ref>

In addition, the record received a 9/10 from [[PopMatters]], wherein the review stated, "They walk out of step with prevailing pop-culture trends and fashions. Yet they’re making some of the most interesting and multi-faceted music that exists right now. Operating on the fringes, they’re nonetheless capturing essential dilemmas of our time, and doing so through the musical equivalents of quandaries, rumors, and whispers. To the band, the listener, the songs’ characters, and the instruments themselves, Discontinued Perfume is an exciting exercise in unlocking the puzzle that is the world around us."<ref>Dave Heaton, ''popmatters.com'', April 22, 2011, "[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/138787-the-caribbean-discontinued-perfume/]'', May 4, 2011''</ref> Additionally, PopMatters named ''Discontinued Perfume'' the "Best Indie-Pop Record of 2011" in their year-end "Best Of" list.<ref>Dave Heaton, popmatters.com, December 7, 2011, "[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/151816-the-best-indie-pop-of-2011/P1]''[16], December 7, 2011''</ref> "Mr. Let's Find Out" from the record was named to Washington, DC City Paper writer Ryan Little's "Ten Best Local Tracks of 2011,"<ref>Ryan Little, http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com, December 21, 2011, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2011/12/21/ryan-littles-10-best-local-tracks-of-2011/]"[17], December 21, 2011</ref> the title track from the record was named to DC City Paper Arts Editor Jonathan Fischer's "Ten Best Local Tracks of 2011,"<ref>Jonathan Fischer, http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com, December 22, 2011, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2011/12/22/jonathan-l-fischers-10-best-local-tracks-of-2011/]"[18], December 22, 2011</ref> the Washington Post hailed the record as a "subtle masterpiece,"<ref>Mark Jenkins, https://www.washingtonpost.com, December 22, 2011, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-gurus/post/best-dc-music-of-2011/2011/12/21/gIQAANtnBP_blog.html]"[19], December 22, 2011</ref> and the Denver Post's online site Reverb listed the record as one of their Top 10 Albums of 2011, as well.<ref>John Wenzel, http://www.heyreverb.com, December 23, 2011, [http://www.heyreverb.com/2011/12/23/albums-of-the-year-2011/]"[19], December 23, 2011</ref>
