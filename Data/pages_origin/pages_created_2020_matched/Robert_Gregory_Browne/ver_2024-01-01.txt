'''Robert Gregory Browne''' (born 1955) is an American novelist, former screenwriter, and co-founder and creative director of Braun Haus Media, LLC.

==Early life==
Browne was born in [[California]], but at the age of eleven, moved with his family to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. After discovering the work of [[Donald Westlake]], Browne set his sights on becoming a writer and at seventeen wrote 130 pages of a comedy mystery novel that remains unfinished. Browne tried writing speculative episodes of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' and ''[[Harry O]]'', among others, but none of these scripts were ever purchased and Browne shifted his interest to music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertgregorybrowne.com/?page_id=2 |title=About Rob – Robert Browne Thrillers |publisher=Robertgregorybrowne.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref>

==Hollywood==
In 1990, Browne took up writing again and completed a feature-length screenplay, which was a winner in the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]] competition. The program is sponsored by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences]] and is designed to give aspiring screenwriters a way into the film industry. Browne was one of five winners that year and received a twenty thousand dollar grant for his screenplay, ''Low Tide''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/fellows/1986-present.html |title=Nicholl Fellows 1986 - Present &#124; Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting Competition &#124; The Don & Gee Nicholl Fellowships Program &#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> Several weeks after winning, that screenplay sold to [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and was slated to be produced by the network. After two years of development, executives overseeing production left the network and the screenplay was put into turnaround.

Browne continued working in Hollywood for many years. In the late 1990s, he worked with producer-writer Larry Brody, and was hired by [[Saban Entertainment|Saban]]/[[Fox Kids]] as a staff writer for the animated show, ''[[Diabolik]]'', based on the famed Italian comic book. He and Brody later worked together on the [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] production, ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.

In 2010, [[CBS Television]] and Sony Pictures produced a television pilot based on Browne's novel, ''Kiss Her Goodbye''. The pilot starred [[Dylan Walsh]],  [[Michael Rapaport]], [[Sandrine Holt]], and [[Terry Kinney]], with a script written and directed by [[Michael Dinner]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i9ee4b481143e87d751f61e4c1dfab8e4 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206131651/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i9ee4b481143e87d751f61e4c1dfab8e4 |date=February 6, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.robertgregorybrowne.com/website/?page_id=574 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123181435/http://www.robertgregorybrowne.com/website/?page_id=574 |date=November 23, 2010 }}</ref>

==Career as a Novelist==
In 2005, Browne's first novel, ''Kiss Her Goodbye'', sold to [[St. Martin's Press]]. St. Martin's subsequently published three more novels, ''Whisper in the Dark'' (which received a starred review from [[Publishers Weekly]]),<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6623987.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225175158/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6623987.html |date=February 25, 2013 }}</ref> ''Kill Her Again'', and ''Down Among the Dead Men''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/QuickSearchResults.aspx?search=robert+gregory+browne&ctl00%24ctl00%24cphContent%24ucAdvSearch%24imgGo.x=9&ctl00%24ctl00%24cphContent%24ucAdvSearch%24imgGo.y=11 |title=Macmillan information |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> In 2011, Browne moved to [[Dutton Penguin]], which released his apocalyptic supernatural thriller, ''The Paradise Prophecy.''
