'''Cwmcych''', '''Cwm Cych''' or {{langnf|cy|'''Glyn Cuch'''|Valley of the river Cych|italic=no}} is a small village in the upper [[Afon Cych|Cych]] valley straddling the border between [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Pembrokeshire]], Wales, in the [[Community (Wales)|community]] of [[Manordeifi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Manordeifi Community Council|url= http://www.pembstcc.co.uk/manordeifi-community-council|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref>

==Situation==
The village is in the parish of [[Cilrhedyn]], which also straddles the counties of Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Vision of Britain through Time: Cwmcych|url= http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/26361|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Vision of Britain through Time: Cilrhedyn|url= http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/4643|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GENUKI: Cilrhedyn|url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CMN/Cilrhedyn/|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref> The Afon Cych valley is wooded with steep sides and narrow lanes; after heavy rain in May 2002 part of the road to the south of Cwmcych fell {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} into the river.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=18 May 2002|title=Flood waters wash out homes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1995556.stm|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref>

==Historic buildings==
In the centre of the village is the Grade II listed bridge, [[Pont Cych]], dated 1737 but probably rebuilt in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=British Listed Buildings: Pont Cych|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-14243-pont-cych-partly-in-preseli-pembrokeshire/osmap|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{National Historic Assets of Wales|num=14243 |desc=Pont Cych |grade=II |access-date=22 July 2019 }}</ref>

Until 2015 there was a long-standing pub called the ''Fox and Hounds''; this has since become a private dwelling. Another building of historic significance is Pontcych Lodge, one of the several lodges of the Glaspant Manor estate frequently mentioned in the Glaspant Diary of 1896.

While most pre-20th century buildings date from the 19th century, older cottages in the village were built of stone or earth under thatched roofs. Some new housing has been built since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dyfed Archaeology|url=http://www.dyfedarchaeology.org.uk/HLC/drefachfelindre/drefachfelindrehistoric.htm|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref>

There were a number of mills in the vicinity for wool or sawing; they were operated by water power from Afon Cych and its tributaries; the mill upstream at Cwm Morgan, Dreifa Mills, has been restored.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welsh Mills Society|url= http://www.welshmills.org.uk/dreifa.m0.html|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref>

There are no places of worship in Cwmcych but there are several chapels and the parish church within {{convert|1|or|2|mi|spell=in}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=GENUKI:Cilrhedyn churches|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/cgi-bin/churchmap?CCC=CMN,GR=SN279348,PLACE=Cilrhedyn|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref>
