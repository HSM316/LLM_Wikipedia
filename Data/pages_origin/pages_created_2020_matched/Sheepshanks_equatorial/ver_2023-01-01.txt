'''Sheepshanks equatorial''' was a 6.7 inch (170&nbsp;mm) aperture [[refracting telescope]] installed in 1838 at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory in Greenwich]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope was donated to the observatory by the astronomer [[Richard Sheepshanks]]. The telescope had a doublet objective lens made by [[Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix|Cauchoix of Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trinitycollegechapel.com//about/memorials/sculptures/sheepshanks/|title=Trinity College Chapel - Richard Sheepshanks|website=trinitycollegechapel.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Originally it was mounted on a clockwork driven equatorial mounting by [[Grubb Parsons]] on a stone pillar.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

From 1835 to 1963 it was in the Sheepshanks dome at the Greenwich observatory, and from 1963-1982 in the Altazimuth Pavilion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html|title=Sheepshanks telescope &#124; Royal Museums Greenwich }}</ref> In the early 1980s it was placed in storage.<ref name=":0" /> The telescope's Sheepshanks dome was in between the later Great Equatorial Building and the prime Meridian.

The focal length of the telescope has been quoted as 6 feet 2½ inches (1.9 meters) in one source,<ref name=":0" /> but according to another it is 8 feet 2 inches (2.5 meters).<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1896GOAMM..55....1C|title=1896GOAMM..55....1C Page I|journal=Greenwich Observations in Astronomy|page=XVII|bibcode=1896GOAMM..55....1C|access-date=2019-10-31|last1=Christie |first1=William Henry Maloney |year=1896 |volume=55 }}</ref> The telescope tube was made of wood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the new Sheepshanks telescope:<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIdPAAAAYAAJ&q=Sheepshanks&pg=RA6-PT4|title=Astronomical Observations, Made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, ...|date=1840|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref>
{{cquote|The power and general goodness of this telescope make it a most welcome addition to the instruments of the observatory}}
Still in service over half a century later, an 1896 report by [[William Christie (astronomer)|W. H. M. Christie]] had this to say about the Sheepshanks at that time:<ref name=":2" />
{{cquote|Its definition is good : A small quantity of colour from the secondary spectrum, and a diffusion of light from brilliant objects, being the principal defects.}}

At one time the Sheepshanks refractor was the largest aperture telescope at Greenwich.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nP01DwAAQBAJ&q=Sheepshanks+refractor+6.7+inch&pg=PA56|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|last1=Tombaugh|first1=Clyde W.|last2=Moore|first2=Patrick|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811766647|language=en}}</ref> One of the instruments for the telescope was a wire micrometer.<ref name=":2" />

== Observations ==
One of its observations was of [[Comet Encke]].<ref name=":3" /> The Sheepshanks was used to observe the moon occulting stars in 1905.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1906MNRAS..66..342.|title=1906MNRAS..66..342.

In addition to the [[occultation]] of stars by the Moon, the Sheepshanks equatorial is also reported to have been used to observe the [[moons of Jupiter]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZRUAAAAYAAJ&q=sheepshanks+equatorial+greenwich&pg=PR26|title=Introduction to Greenwich Astronomical Observations|last=Observatory|first=Royal Greenwich|date=1889|publisher=H.M.

== Disambiguation ==
There are other telescopes bearing the name Sheepshanks, for example the Sheepshanks telescope, No 3; this was a telescope of 4.6 inches aperture and 5 feet of focal length and used with spectroscope in the 1860s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW1aAAAAYAAJ&q=sheepshanks+telescope&pg=PA14|title=Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1869|publisher=Priestley and Weale|language=en}}</ref> There was also telescope at a Cambridge completed in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBM9AAAAIAAJ&q=sheep+shanks+telescope&pg=PA13|title=Annals of the Solar Physics Observatory, Cambridge Vol. 1|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}</ref>
