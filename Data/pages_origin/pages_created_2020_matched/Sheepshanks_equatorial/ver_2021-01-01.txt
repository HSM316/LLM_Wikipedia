'''Sheepshanks equatorial''' was a 6.7 inch (170&nbsp;mm) [[refracting telescope]] established in 1838 at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory in Greenwich]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope was donated to the observatory by [[Richard Sheepshanks]]. The telescope had an objective double lens made by [[Robert-Agla√© Cauchoix|Cauchoix of Paris]], and it was about 8 feet long (2.4 meters).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trinitycollegechapel.com//about/memorials/sculptures/sheepshanks/|title=Trinity College Chapel - Richard Sheepshanks|website=trinitycollegechapel.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope was originally mounted by [[Grubb Parsons|Grubb]] on an equatorial mounting with a clockwork drive.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope overall rested on a stone pillar.<ref name=":1" />

From 1835 to 1963 it was in the Sheepshanks dome at the Greenwich observatory for the most part, and from 1963-1982 in the Altazimuth Pavilion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html|title=https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html}}</ref> In the early 1980s it was placed in storage and has been there ever since.<ref name=":0" /> The telescope's Sheepshanks dome was in between the later Great Equatorial Building and the prime Meridian.

The focal length of the telescope is about 1.9 meters (6.2 feet) in one source,<ref name=":0" /> and another says 8 feet 2 inches.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1896GOAMM..55....1C|title=1896GOAMM..55....1C Page I|website=adsabs.harvard.edu|page=XVII|bibcode=1896GOAMM..55....1C|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope tube was made of wood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the new Sheepshanks telescope:<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIdPAAAAYAAJ&q=Sheepshanks&pg=RA6-PT4|title=Astronomical Observations, Made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, ...|date=1840|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref>
{{cquote|The power and general goodness of this telescope make it a most welcome addition to the instruments of the observatory}}
Still in service over half a century later, an 1896 report by Christie, W. H. M. had this to say about the Sheepshanks at that time:<ref name=":2" />
{{cquote|Its definition is good : A small quantity of colour from the secondary spectrum, and a diffusion of light from brilliant objects, being the principal defects.}}

One of the instruments for the telescope was a wire micrometer.<ref name=":2" />

The Sheepshanks refractor became the largest aperture telescope at Greenwich.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nP01DwAAQBAJ&q=Sheepshanks+refractor+6.7+inch&pg=PA56|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|last1=Tombaugh|first1=Clyde W.|last2=Moore|first2=Patrick|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811766647|language=en}}</ref> 

== Observations ==
One of its observations was of [[Comet Encke]].<ref name=":3" /> The Sheepshanks was used to observe the moon occulting stars in 1905.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1906MNRAS..66..342.|title=1906MNRAS..66..342.

In addition to the [[occultation]] of stars by the Moon, the Sheepshanks equatorial is also reported to have been used to observe the [[moons of Jupiter]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZRUAAAAYAAJ&q=sheepshanks+equatorial+greenwich&pg=PR26|title=Introduction to Greenwich Astronomical Observations|last=Observatory|first=Royal Greenwich|date=1889|publisher=H.M.

== Disambiguation ==
There are other telescopes bearing the name Sheepshanks, for example the Sheepshanks telescope, No 3; this was a telescope of 4.6 inches aperture and 5 feet of focal length and used with spectroscope in the 1860s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW1aAAAAYAAJ&q=sheepshanks+telescope&pg=PA14|title=Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1869|publisher=Priestley and Weale|language=en}}</ref> There was also telescope at a Cambridge completed in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBM9AAAAIAAJ&q=sheep+shanks+telescope&pg=PA13|title=Annals of the Solar Physics Observatory, Cambridge Vol. 1|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}</ref>
