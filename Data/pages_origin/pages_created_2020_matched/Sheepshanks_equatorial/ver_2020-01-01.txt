'''Sheepshanks equatorial''' was a 6.7 inch (170&nbsp;mm) [[refracting telescope]] established in 1838 at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory in Greenwich]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope was donated to the observatory by [[Richard Sheepshanks]]. The telescope had an objective double lens made by [[Robert-Agla√© Cauchoix|Cauchoix of Paris]], and it was about 8 feet long (2.4 meters).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trinitycollegechapel.com//about/memorials/sculptures/sheepshanks/|title=Trinity College Chapel - Richard Sheepshanks|website=trinitycollegechapel.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope was originally mounted by [[Grubb Parsons|Grubb]] on an equatorial mounting with a clockwork drive.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org/articles.php?article=1171|title=The Royal Observatory Greenwich - where east meets west: Telescope: The Sheepshanks Equatorial (1838)|website=www.royalobservatorygreenwich.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The telescope overall rested on a stone pillar.<ref name=":1" />

From 1835 to 1963 it was in the Sheepshanks dome at the Greenwich observatory for the most part, and from 1963-1982 in the Altazimuth Pavilion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html|title=https://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11074.html|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In the early 1980s it was placed in storage and has been there ever since.<ref name=":0" /> The telescope's Sheepshanks dome was in between the later Great Equatorial Building and the prime Meridian.

An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the new Sheepshanks telescope:<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JIdPAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA6-PT4&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=2#v=onepage&q=Sheepshanks&f=false|title=Astronomical Observations, Made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, ...|date=1840|publisher=Clarendon Press|language=en}}</ref>
{{cquote|The power and general goodness of this telescope make it a most welcome addition to the instruments of the observatory}}
Still in service over half a century later, an 1896 report by Christie, W. H. M. had this to say about the Sheepshanks at that time:<ref name=":2" />
{{cquote|Its definition is good : A small quantity of colour from the secondary spectrum, and a diffusion of light from brilliant objects, being the principal defects.}}

One of the instruments for the telescope was a wire micrometer.<ref name=":2" />

The Sheepshanks refractor became the largest aperture telescope at Greenwich.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nP01DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Sheepshanks+refractor+6.7+inch&source=bl&ots=I1XJNIhwJ6&sig=ACfU3U19L2ngnAfnOtsA87bgwo6LG2Jeyw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZxt7szsflAhUMeKwKHbkOBgcQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=Sheepshanks%20refractor%206.7%20inch&f=false|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|last=Tombaugh|first=Clyde W.|last2=Moore|first2=Patrick|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=9780811766647|language=en}}</ref> 

== Observations ==
One of its observations was of [[Comet Encke]].<ref name=":3" /> The Sheepshanks was used to observe the moon occulting stars in 1905.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1906MNRAS..66..342.|title=1906MNRAS..66..342.

In addition to the [[occultation]] of stars by the Moon, the Sheepshanks equatorial is also reported to have been used to observe the [[moons of Jupiter]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZRUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR26&dq=sheepshanks+equatorial+greenwich&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAzPyty9blAhVKMawKHRW9CWE4FBDoATABegQIBRAC#v=onepage&q=sheepshanks%20equatorial%20greenwich&f=false|title=Introduction to Greenwich Astronomical Observations|last=Observatory|first=Royal Greenwich|date=1889|publisher=H.M.

There are other telescopes bearing the name Sheepshanks, for example the Sheepshanks telescope, No 3; this was a telescope of 4.6 inches aperture and 5 feet of focal length and used with spectroscope in the 1860s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW1aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14&dq=sheepshanks+telescope&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjCs7rUydblAhVDX60KHe0aCQkQ6AEwA3oECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=sheepshanks%20telescope&f=false|title=Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1869|publisher=Priestley and Weale|language=en}}</ref> There was also telescope at a Cambridge completed in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBM9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13&dq=sheep+shanks+telescope&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjXn7WXydblAhUBR6wKHTKyDssQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=sheep%20shanks%20telescope&f=false|title=Annals of the Solar Physics Observatory, Cambridge Vol. 1|publisher=CUP Archive|language=en}}</ref>
