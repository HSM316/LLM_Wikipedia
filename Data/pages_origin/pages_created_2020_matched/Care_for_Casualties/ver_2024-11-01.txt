'''Care for Casualties''' ('''C4C''') is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] launched in early 2009 to raise funds in order to assist British [[Soldier|servicemen and women]] from [[The Rifles]] who have been wounded or injured during service in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or [[War in Afghanistan (2001â€“present)|Afghanistan]], as well as helping their families.

== History ==
C4C was launched in early 2009, by [[Rupert Jones (British Army officer)|Major General Rupert Jones]], who was then commanding officer of [[The Rifles|4th Battalion The Rifles]], Karen Charman-Allen, mother of Rifleman Philip Allen, who was killed in November 2009 as part of [[Operation Herrick]] with [[2nd Battalion, The Rifles|2nd Battalion The Rifles]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/fatalities/rifleman-philip-allen-killed-in-afghanistan|title=Rifleman Philip Allen killed in Afghanistan - Fatality notice - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> and Regimental Secretary Lt Col John Poole-Warren. Since the formation of [[The Rifles]] in 2007, they have seen continued commitment to both [[Operation Herrick|Afghanistan]] and [[Operation Telic|Iraq]], with over 60 [[Rifleman|Riflemen]] killed, and over 300 injured in that time. With the increase in post traumatic stress disorder among soldiers, the appeal was launched to combat this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theriflesnetwork.co.uk/index.php/welfare/care-for-casualties/|title=Care for Casualties  {{!}}|website=theriflesnetwork.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915114451/http://theriflesnetwork.co.uk/index.php/welfare/care-for-casualties/|archive-date=2016-09-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>
