==Overview==
The first track is an untitled improvisational duet between [[Jimi Hendrix]]-inspired guitarist and [[Canned Heat]] member [[Henry Vestine]] and Ayler on [[bagpipe]], but credited as "written" by Henry Vestine and Mary Parks. All other songwriting credits on the album are also claimed by Mary Parks.

The second track contains poetry spoken eloquently by Mary Parks, posing questions which Ayler's sax answers.  

"Toiling" is a guitar-driven blues track.

On "Desert Blood", Ayler sings jazz-vocals reminiscent of [[June Tyson]]'s performances with [[Sun Ra]].

The remainder of the album is in the [[Free jazz]] idiom.
