'''Saddle Peak Hills Wilderness''' is the smallest designated wilderness area created by the [[California Desert Protection Act of 1994]].<ref name=wilderness.net/>

==History==
A 1980 Bureau of Land Management report recommended the area as unsuitable for wilderness designation, as the mineral resources identified in the study were likely to be commercially viable. These included copper, lead, silver and talc, all of which had been historically extracted in the area.<ref name=CDC/>

The area was given wilderness status on 21 October 1994.<ref name=USC/>
 
==Geology==
The area contains considerable deposits of [[talc]].<ref name=CDC/>

==Ecology==
===Vegetation===
Vegetation consists mostly of [[creosote bush]] and [[Saltbush scrub|allscale scrubs]]. No sensitive or significant plant species are known to occur within the wilderness area.<ref name=CDC/>

===Wildlife===
The area is not known to support any listed, sensitive or rare species.{{refn|group=Note|According to 1980 report.<ref name=CDC/>}}

The sandy substrate in an area of approximately 3 square miles (1,920 acres / 7.8 square kilometres) provides habitat for the [[Mojave fringe-toed lizard]], a highly adapted sand-dwelling species.<ref name=CDC/>
