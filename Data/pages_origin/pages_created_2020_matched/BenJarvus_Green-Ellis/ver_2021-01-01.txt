====2010 season====

Following the team's trade of [[Laurence Maroney]] and early-season injuries to [[Fred Taylor (American football)|Fred Taylor]] and [[Kevin Faulk]], Green-Ellis saw an increased role in the Patriots offense. In Week 3, he rushed for 98 yards on 16 carries (6.1 yard average) and a touchdown in a win over the [[Buffalo Bills]]. He made his first start of the season the next week, rushing for 76 yards on 16 carries and adding another touchdown against the [[Miami Dolphins]].

Green-Ellis finished the 2010 season with 1,008 rushing yards on 229 carries (4.4 yard average), and 13 rushing touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GreeBe00/gamelog/2010/ |title=BenJarvus Green-Ellis 2010 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>

At the end of the 2011 season, Green-Ellis and the Patriots appeared in [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. He had ten carries for 44 yards and two receptions for 15 yards, but the Patriots lost 21–17 to the [[New York Giants]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201202050nwe.htm |title=Super Bowl XLVI - New York Giants vs. New England Patriots - February 5th, 2012 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Cincinnati Bengals===
On March 21, 2012, Green-Ellis signed a three-year contract with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. On September 23, 2012, in a game against the [[Washington Football Team]], Green-Ellis recorded his first career fumble, ending an impressive record of 589 touches without a fumble, the most ever to start an NFL career. In the following game, a 27-10 win against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], Green-Ellis fumbled two more times, but did not have another fumble the rest of the regular season. Despite playing in only fifteen games, he gained 1,000 rushing yards in a season for the second time in his career.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GreeBe00/gamelog/2012/</ref>

Green-Ellis was paired with rookie [[Giovani Bernard]] and as a result of Bernard's effectiveness both rushing and receiving, his snaps declined in the 2013 season. On August 29, 2014, he was released by the Bengals, who added [[Jeremy Hill]] in the draft; and despite reported interest from several teams he has not signed with an NFL team since.<ref>{{cite web|work=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11431868/rb-benjarvus-green-ellis-cut-cincinnati-bengals|title=Bengals cut BenJarvus Green-Ellis|date=August 29, 2014|first=Coley|last=Harvey|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/13/benjarvus-green-ellis-says-phones-been-ringing-looking-for-right-team/</ref>
