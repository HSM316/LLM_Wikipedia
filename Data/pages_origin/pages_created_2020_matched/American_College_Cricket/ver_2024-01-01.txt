{{Short description|American collegiate organization for promoting cricket}}
'''American College Cricket''' is the national [[College athletics|collegiate]] organization that has developed and governs [[cricket]] in American (and some Canadian) universities. The mission of the organization is to develop [[cricket]] in colleges in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Since being founded in 2008 the organization has grown to include over 90 member colleges. Each year a national championship is held in [[Florida]], primarily at the [[CBRP Cricket Stadium]], during [[spring break]]. Aside from the main tournament, regional tournaments are held as well as a league between colleges.

As part of its mission to develop cricket in America, American College Cricket made the first broadcast of [[Cricket in the United States]] via web streaming in March 2010. From October 2011, American College Cricket has broadcast its matches through [[TV Asia]] across the USA & Canada.<ref name="2016 ACC">{{cite web | url=http://americancollegecricket.com/2015/06/05/shiv-chanderpaul-announces-2016-national-championship-dates/ | title=Shiv Chanderpaul announces 2016 National Championship Dates | publisher=American College Cricket | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Lloyd Jodah}}</ref>
