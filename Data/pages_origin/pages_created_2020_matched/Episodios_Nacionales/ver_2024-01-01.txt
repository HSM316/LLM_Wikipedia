The '''''Episodios Nacionales''''' ('''''National Episodes''''') are a collection of forty-six historical novels written by [[Benito Pérez Galdós]] between 1872 and 1912. They are divided into five series and they deal with Spanish history from roughly 1805 to 1880. They are fictional accounts which add characters invented by the author within historical events.

With the exception of ''Gerona'', all the episodes follow the adventures of the boy Gabriel de Araceli, beginning in French-dominated Spain through the war of Independence, from the battle of Trafalgar to the defeat of the French armies (1805–1814). There are ten books in this series:

==Second series==
[[Image:ElTerrorde1824.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of El terror de 1824, 1877. [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]].]]
Written between 1875 and 1879, it is a series of ten books. Its main character, who is not always the protagonist, is the liberal crusader Salvador Monsalud. At first a guard of King [[Joseph Bonaparte|José I]], he helps the king escape Spain with the crown jewels, which Jose would sell to pay for his new life in America. Remaining in Spain, Salvador is estranged from power during the six years of absolutist monarchy of [[Ferdinand VII|Fernando VII]] (1814–1820), lauded during the Liberal Triennium (1820–1823) and persecuted during the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain#The Ominous Decade (1823–1833)|Ominous Decade]] (1823–1833). His perpetual dissatisfaction guides us through the convulsions of Spain under Fernando, where future conflicts could be seen to have their beginnings. The titles of the Episodes are:
* ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7vFDAQAAMAAJ El equipaje del rey José]'' (The Baggage of King Jose)
* ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_f09AQAAMAAJ Memorias de un cortesano de 1815]'' (Memoires of a Courtesan of 1815)
