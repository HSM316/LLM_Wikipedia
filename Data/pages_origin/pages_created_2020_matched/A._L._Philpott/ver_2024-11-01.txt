==Early and family life==

Bassett High School]]. He went on to the [[University of Richmond]], getting a BA degree in 1941.

In that private legal practice, Philpott represented Bassett Furniture and other companies in southwest Virginia; his cousin Joe Philpott manages the Superior Lines plant for years and before he retired in 1999 supervised thirteen Bassett factories, including two in Georgia and five in North Carolina.<ref>[[Beth Macy]], Factory Man, Little Brown 2016, ISMN 978-0-316-23143-5 pp. 116, 125-126</ref>

Clark]], both Democrats and members of the [[Byrd Organization]], represented the two-member district consisting of Henry and adjoining [[Patrick County, Virginia|Patrick]] Counties, as well as the city of [[Martinsville, Virginia|Martinsville]]. They replaced two two-term veteran Democrats, [[William F. Stone]] (who was elected to the [[Senate of Virginia]]) and [[William F.

Byrd]]. Philpott established himself as a supporter of continued segregation.<ref name="nytobit"/>
