==Research development==
In 1978 he began research at McGill on a dietary protein source that would boost [[immune system]] performance.  Bounous contends that a deficiency in the protein [[glutathione]] is linked to several diseases, and that a lack of innate [[cysteine]] that inhibits glutathione production.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11205219 |year=2000 |last1=Bounous |first1=G |title=Whey protein concentrate (WPC) and glutathione modulation in cancer treatment |volume=20 |issue=6C |pages=4785–92 |journal=Anticancer Research}}{{Better source|date=May 2011}}</ref>
