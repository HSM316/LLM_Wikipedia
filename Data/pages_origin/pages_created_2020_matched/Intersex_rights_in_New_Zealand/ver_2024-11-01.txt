'''Intersex rights in New Zealand''' are protections and rights afforded to [[intersex]] people. Protection from discrimination is implied by the [[Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act]] and the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]], but remains untested. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission states that there has seemingly been a "lack of political will to address issues involved in current practices of genital normalisation on intersex children".<ref name="hrc2016" />

In March 2017, New Zealand and [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australian]] community organizations issued a joint call for legal reform, including the criminalization of deferrable [[intersex medical interventions]] on children, an end to legal classification of sex, and improved access to peer support.<ref name="darlington2017" />

The New Zealand [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] noted in its 2004 report on the status of human rights in New Zealand that intersex people in New Zealand face discrimination in several aspects of their lives, however the law is unclear on the legal status of discrimination based on sex characteristics or intersex status.<ref name="Human Rights Commission 2004.
