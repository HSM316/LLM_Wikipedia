'''Geoff Dougherty''' is a [[Chicago]] journalist noted for founding two local news organizations, and for his work as a computer-assisted/quantitative journalist.

==Career==
===''Chi-Town Daily News''===
In 2005, Dougherty founded the nonprofit ''Chicago Daily News'', an online-only news organization devoted to hyperlocal coverage of Chicago neighborhoods. The name echoed that of the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', a newspaper which had folded in 1978 and had been held in high regard by him.<ref name=johnson05>{{cite news|last=Steve|first=Johnson|title=Chicago Daily News II: This Time It's Digital|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/technology_internetcritic/2005/12/chicagos_newest.html|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=12 Sep 2005}}</ref> He even used [[Craigslist]] to advertise for writers.<ref name=johnson05/> The organization shortly changed its name to ''Chi-Town Daily News''. In 2007, it received $340,000 in funding from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] to build a network of trained citizen journalists to cover their Chicago neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chi-Town Daily News|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20061047/|publisher=John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|accessdate=2013-05-15}}</ref>

The news organization won national attention for its business model and journalism, including coverage in the ''[[Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Howard|first=Kurtz|title=Web Sites Like Chitown Daily News Find Opportunities When Newspapers Go Bankrupt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/31/AR2009033103927.html?sub=AR|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Washington Post|date=1 Apr 2009}}</ref> and ''[[Boston Globe]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Jonny|title=Online upstarts deliver news without the paper|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/05/14/online_upstarts_deliver_news_without_the_paper/|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=14 May 2009}}</ref> ''Chi-Town Daily News'' attracted some criticism from traditional journalists, who argued that [[citizen journalism]] would encourage news organizations to lay off full-time, professional reporters in favor of unpaid volunteers incapable of producing high-caliber journalism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Daily News wins $340,000 grant |url=http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2007/05/23/Daily-News-wins-340-000-grant-9227.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703232409/http://www.chitowndailynews.org/2007/05/23/Daily-News-wins-340-000-grant-9227.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 July 2013 |access-date=2013-05-15 |newspaper=Chi-Town Daily News |date=23 May 2007 }}</ref> ''Chi-Town Daily News'' closed in September 2009, citing a lack of available [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] funds to continue operations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chi-Town Daily News Abandoning Non-Profit Model In Shakeup|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/11/ichi-town-daily-newsi-aba_n_283807.html|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Huffington Post|date= 11 Nov 2009|first=Tim|last=Taliaferro}}</ref>

===''Chicago Current''===
In 2010, Dougherty and a group of former ''Chi-Town Daily News'' reporters launched ''Chicago Current'', an insider political paper modeled after ''[[Politico]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=What's happening with the Chi-Town Daily News?|url=http://chicago.straightdope.com/sdc20100218.php|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Chicago Reader|date= 8 Feb 2010}}</ref>

===''Computer-Assisted Reporting''===
Before launching the two online newspapers, Dougherty was the [[computer-assisted reporting]] editor at the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', where he undertook investigations on coal mining<ref>{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|title=Safety is casualty as firms chase profits in coal country|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0209240353sep24,0,5453963.story|accessdate=2013-05-14|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> and food safety.<ref>{{cite news|title=Schools Flunk Food Safety|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-10/news/0112100242_1_food-poisoning-school-food-illness-outbreaks|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date= 10 Dec 2001|first1=David|last1=Jackson}}</ref>

Earlier, he served as computer-assisted reporting editor at the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', where he played a key role in the paper's investigation into the flawed [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2000]], and the subsequent effort to examine and analyze all of the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|discarded ballots in Florida]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Who, what, when, where and how of this review|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-04-03-floridahow.htm|accessdate=2013-05-15|newspaper=USA Today|date=2001-04-03}}</ref>

===''US News and World Report''===
Dougherty is now a journalist for ''[[US News and World Report]]'', performing quantitative analysis on health care-related topics.
