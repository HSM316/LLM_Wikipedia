He sits as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] for the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/112014/Phil_BENNION.html |title=Phil BENNION |publisher= [[European Parliament]] |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> having first replaced [[Liz Lynne]] after she stepped down in February 2012.<ref name=Lynne>{{cite news |title=Lib Dem MEP Liz Lynne to stand down |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15611399|publisher= BBC News|date= 6 November 2011|accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Bennion was born in [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], [[Staffordshire]] and educated at [[Landau Forte Academy QEMS|Queen Elizabeth Grammar School]]. He went on to study agriculture and [[agronomy]] at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]]. After returning to Staffordshire to run his family farm, he gained a second degree, in history and economic history, from the [[University of Birmingham]].

==Political career==

Bennion advised [[Charles Kennedy]] on agricultural issues during his leadership of the Liberal Democrats. Bennion went on to serve on the party's federal policy committee for eight years.<ref name=LibDem>{{cite web |url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/meps_detail.aspx?name=Phillip_Bennion_MEP_-_MEP_for_the_West_Midlands_&pPK=8e7536b8-7687-4054-bf5c-7369c0771b2d |title=Phillip Bennion MEP |publisher= Liberal Democrats |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref>

===European parliament===
He was second on the [[Party-list proportional representation|party list]] for the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands]] constituency at the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament election]], but the party's 12% share of the vote entitled them to only one seat. When Liz Lynne stepped down in February 2012, electoral rules meant that Bennion, as the next Liberal Democrat candidate on the list, took her seat.<ref name=Lynne/> He stood for re-election in [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014]] and was placed top of his party's list of candidates, but he lost his seat as the Liberal Democrats polled 5.6% of the vote, too little to secure one of the West Midlands' seven seats. He re-gained his seat in 2019.<ref>''EU Elections 2019'', BBC1, 26 May 2019</ref>

Phil will be sitting on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights during the 9th Parliament.
