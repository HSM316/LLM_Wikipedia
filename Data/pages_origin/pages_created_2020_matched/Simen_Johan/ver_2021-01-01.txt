'''Simen Johan''' (born 1973) is a Norwegian-Swedish contemporary artist, photographer and sculptor living in New York City.

==Early life and education==
Simen Johan was born in [[Kirkenes]], in the extreme north of Norway. [[Sámi]] Heritage. He moved to [[Höllviken]], Sweden in 1979. After attending film school at Lugnetskolan in [[Falun]], Sweden, Johan moved to New York City in 1992 to continue his studies at [[School of Visual Arts]], where he studied under [[Duane Michals]], [[James Casebere]], and [[Gregory Crewdson]].<ref name="Kunstnernes Hus Bio">{{cite book|title=Simen Johan (Exhibition Catalogue)|year=2004|publisher=Kunstnernes Hus|location=Oslo, Norway|isbn=82-7111-050-0|pages=44–46|chapter=Biography}}</ref>

==Early work==
In 1993, Johan drew attention for his pioneering work merging digital manipulation with traditional darkroom techniques.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heiner|first=Cathy|title=Photos from a Twentysomething Point of View|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 8, 1993|page=5D}}</ref>  At a time when digital photo processing was in its infancy, Johan found ways to exploit the medium beyond the boundaries of what was then considered possible. His images recombined fragments of faces and bodies (including his own) into new characters, which he then situated into similarly fabricated scenes.  By inverting his files and then printing them onto transparent film, Johan was able to produce "negatives," allowing him to use traditional [[darkroom]] processes to create sepia toned silver gelatin prints.<ref name="A.D. Coleman">{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=A.D.|title=Simen Johan (Exhibition Catalogue|year=2004|publisher=Kunstnernes Hus|location=Oslo, Norway|isbn=82-7111-050-0|pages=41–43|chapter=Painting with Photographs: The Hybrid Vision of Simen Johan}}</ref>    By the mid-90s, his work was frequently featured in exhibitions spearheading digital art, including ''Bit by Bit: Postphotographic Imaging'', at [[Hunter College]], New York, and ''(R)evolution,'' at [[Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia "Leonardo da Vinci"]] in Milan, Italy.<ref name="Kunstnernes Hus Bio" /><ref name="Yossi Milo Gallery CV" />

==Later work and career==

With his series ''Evidence of Things Unseen'' (2000-2004), Johan began creating large format color prints.<ref name="A.D. Coleman" /><ref name="NYTimes L. Rexer">{{cite news|last=Rexer|first=Lyle|title=Fairy Tales Move to a Darker, Wilder Part of the Forest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/arts/art-architecture-fairy-tales-move-to-a-darker-wilder-part-of-the-forest.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 7, 2002}}</ref>     In a review for [[The Village Voice]], [[Vince Aletti]] wrote:  "Johan's...new pictures continue to plumb a troubled dream world where fantasy and ritual meet. In virtually all of these images, solitary, self-possessed youngsters appear to be engaged in bizarre masquerades... There's an edge of horror and derangement in these photos that's all the more disturbing because it seems as much a projection of the child's imagination as the photographer's."<ref>{{cite news|last=Aletti|first=Vince|title=Voice Chioces: Simen Johan|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=March 12, 2002|page=77}}</ref>   A traveling museum exhibition of this series was organized by [[Kunstnernes Hus]] in Oslo, Norway, and the National Art Museum of Lithuania.<ref name="Yossi Milo Gallery CV" />    [[A. D. Coleman]] wrote the catalogue essay.<ref name="A.D. Coleman" />

In 2005, Johan shifted his focus towards the natural world, at the same time also beginning to create sculptural works.  The images in his series ''Until the Kingdom Comes'' incorporate elements photographed in a wide variety of locations around the world, including both wild and captive animals.<ref name="Yossi Milo Press Release" />   According to the New Yorker, "At nearly six feet by eight feet, the largest of these pictures rival natural-history dioramas, but very little is natural about this menagerie. A deer in a snowy forest is uncannily white; malevolent snakes curl around sticks and one another in a sunny ravine, like fugitives from Dante's Inferno. Johan undermines even his most convincing fictions, and the nagging sense that something is wrong here keeps viewers just where he wants us: on edge."<ref>{{cite news|title=Goings on About Town: Simen Johan|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=Sep 21, 2009|page=20}}</ref>  The sculptures, as featured in the New York Times "incorporate taxidermy, insects and foliage into parasitical eco-systems resonant with the vitality of ritualistic headdresses,"<ref>{{cite news|last=Angier|first=Natalie|title=Art That Was Once Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/04/science/20100504_angier-12.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>  while others, shaped like meteorites, were constructed from barnacles, cement and fiber optics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Untitled #170, 2011|url=http://www.yossimilo.com/artists/sime_joha/?show=0&img_num=14|publisher=Yossi Milo Gallery|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>    Solo exhibitions of ''Until the Kingdom Comes'' were presented at [[Brown University]], Providence, RI; the [[Frist Center for the Visual Arts]], Nashville and at the [[Southern Methodist University]], Dallas, TX.<ref name="Yossi Milo Press Release">{{cite web|title=Press Release|url=http://www.yossimilo.com/exhibitions/2013_10-simen_johan/|publisher=Yossi Milo Gallery|accessdate=3/6/2014}}</ref>  A limited edition book was published in 2014.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johan|first=Simen|title=Until the Kingdom Comes|year=2014|location=US|isbn=978-0-615-85587-5}}</ref>

Johan received the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Fellowship in 2002, the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]] Grant in 2009 and the George A. and Eliza Gardner Howard Foundation Grant for Photography in 2012.<ref name="Yossi Milo Gallery CV" />  His work has appeared on the covers of [[Aperture (magazine)]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Rexer|first=Lyle|title=Seeing is Believing, Photographs by Simen Johan|newspaper=Aperture Magazine|date=Fall 2003|pages=cover, 2–16}}</ref>   and [[Art+Auction]],<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Art & Auction|date=Nov 2002}}</ref> and he was interviewed on [[WNYC]]'s [[Leonard Lopate]] radio show.<ref name="Yossi Milo Gallery CV" />   In 2010, [[Comme des Garçons]] used Johan's sculpture of a long haired wolf for their fall advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Simen Johan - COMME des GARÇONS|url=http://www.pocko.com/en/articles/2010/10/28/simen-johan-comme-des-garcons/|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>   [[Louis Vuitton]] incorporated his work into their spring 2017 ad campaign.  His image of a buffalo reclining in littered dirt was featured in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film [[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]].<ref>{{cite news|last=La Ferla|first=Ruth|title=What Walls Say in 'Wall Street'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/fashion/30wall.html?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults%230&version=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry805%23%2Fsimen+johan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Sep 29, 2010}}</ref> Johan has been represented by the Yossi Milo Gallery since 2000.<ref name="Yossi Milo Gallery CV">{{cite web|title=CV|url=http://www.yossimilo.com/artists/sime_joha/?show_bio=bio|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>
