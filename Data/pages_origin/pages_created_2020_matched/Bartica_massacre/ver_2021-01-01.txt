The '''Bartica Massacre''' refers to the murder of twelve residents of [[Bartica]], [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni]], Guyana, murdered by the criminal gang led by [[Rondell "Fineman" Rawlins]]. Rawlins and many of the other suspected gang members were later killed by Guyanese security forces. This [[massacre]] was part of a series of murders that appeared to have begun with the [[Mash Day Prison break]].

== Events ==
On Sunday night, February 17, 2008, a number of gunmen attacked the mining community of Bartica, Essequibo, killing twelve residents and injuring several others. The group of about twenty armed gunmen arrived at Bartica by speed boat. They landed at the Transport and Harbours wharf around 10pm on Sunday night. Upon arrival, they attacked the Bartica Police Station, where they killed Lance Corporal Zaheer Zakir, Constable Shane Fredericks and Constable Ron Osbornes. After murdering the three police officers, the gang stole cash, arms, ammunition and a vehicle from the police station. Using the stolen police vehicle, they drove through the streets of Bartica shooting at civilians, fatally wounding Irwin Gilkes. They then proceeded to CBR Mining, where they killed Irving Ferreira, stole arms and ammunition, and removed two safes containing cash and gold. Next, they shot and killed Dexter Adrian before returning to the wharf. At the wharf, they executed Abdool Yassin Jr, Deonarine Singh, Errol Thomas, Ronald Gomes, Baldeo Singh and Ashraf Khan. After their one-hour rampage, the gunmen departed from Bartica by boat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murderous rampage stuns Bartica |url=http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042911/http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gunmen murder 12 at Bartica Large gang came by river, attacked police station, fired wildly, three cops among dead |url=http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042911/http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

== Reaction ==

The Bartica Massacre was immediately linked with the Lusignan Massacre,<ref>{{cite web|title=Murderous rampage stuns Bartica |url=http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042911/http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> while some initially questioned the link,<ref>{{cite web|title=Modus operandi in Lusignan, Bartica killings differ - no police statement on link, |url=http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042911/http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> the Guyanese security forces have since attributed all of the murders to Rondell Rawlins and his criminal gang. In the immediate aftermath, President [[Bharat Jagdeo]] noted that the attackers targeted law enforcement, while others decried the apparent inability of the government and the security forces to deal with the extended crime wave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Security officials clueless after Bartica mayhem |url=http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html|publisher=Stabroek News|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611042911/http://www.guyana.org/bartica_slayings.html| archivedate= 11 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>
