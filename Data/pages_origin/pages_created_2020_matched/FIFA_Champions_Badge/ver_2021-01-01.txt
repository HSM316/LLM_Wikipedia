{{short description|Emblem for FIFA national and club world champions}}
{{use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}

The '''FIFA Champions Badge''' is a jersey-emblem in the shape of a gold and white shield, awarded by [[FIFA]] to the reigning world champions of FIFA competitions, both at national team level (e.g. [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA Futsal World Cup|Futsal World Cup]], and [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]), and at club team level (e.g. [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]]).

FIFA owns, makes and licenses-out the physical badge, which can only be worn on first-term jerseys (not on derivative versions, or on training clothing), of the reigning titleholders, and is thus a temporary award. FIFA awarded the first badge in February 2008 to [[A.C. Milan]], the then reigning [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]] champions.

This official FIFA badge contrasts with informal symbols worn by various teams to signify important victories or trophies, such as [[Star (football badge)|stars]].

===Badge rules===

The {{convert|78|by|58|mm|in|abbr=on}} badge is shaped like a shield,{{efn|The "2015 FIFA Equipment Regulations" notes that the dimensions are {{convert|80|by|55|mm|in|abbr=on}}, but notes that FIFA can change the dimensions at its discretion.<ref name=2015ER>{{cite web|url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/equipment-regulations-515430.pdf?cloudid=q3drmdesvc8bbmanff8d | title=2015 FIFA Equipment Regulations | website=[[FIFA]] | date= September 2015 | accessdate=5 January 2020 | quote=FIFA World Champions Badge (Chapter 14, page 81)}}</ref>}} and displays the image of the relevant trophy, with the inscription ''FIFA WORLD CHAMPIONS'', next to the year in which the relevant FIFA competition had been won.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/y=2013/m=12/news=bayern-join-elite-group-badge-winners-2249190.html |title=Bayern join elite group of badge-winners |access-date=March 30, 2018 |last= |first= |date=December 21, 2013 |publisher=FIFA |location=Zurich |language= |quote=The badge, featuring an image of the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and the text ‘FIFA World Champions 2013’, will act as a physical reminder of the team’s successful 2013 in which they first won the UEFA Champions League in May before being crowned World Champions in Morocco.}}</ref><ref name=lfc/>  The badge only comes in two colour schemes – gold letters on a white background, and white letters on a gold background.<ref name="fifa2"/>  The winning national team or club team carries the badge on their shirt until the end of the next edition of the relevant FIFA tournament; thus, it is only worn by reigning champions.<ref name=marca/><ref name=lfc>{{cite web|url= https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/379592-explained-liverpool-earn-gold-fifa-champions-badge| website=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | date=21 December 2019| accessdate=22 December 2019 | author=Glenn Price | title= Explained: Liverpool earn gold FIFA Champions Badge }}</ref><ref name=FH3>{{cite web | url=https://www.footyheadlines.com/2018/07/germany-to-loose-2014-world-cup-winners-badge.html | title=Germany to Loose 2014 World Cup Winners Badge | date=15 July 2018 | accessdate=5 January 2020 | website=Footy Headlines}}</ref>

The badge can be displayed on jerseys from the day the team becomes FIFA world champions, up to and including the day of the final of the next staging of the competition (e.g. if the team wins the competition again, they can hold the badge uninterrupted).<ref name=LFC2/><ref name=mirror>{{cite newspaper | url= https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/liverpool-wont-wear-golden-badge-21145176 |title= Liverpool won't wear golden badge for winning Club World Cup in Premier League |newspaper=Irish Mirror |date=22 December 2019 | accessdate=22 December 2019 | author=Sports Editor | quote=A FIFA spokesperson said: "As per the usage guidelines, the winning team can wear the FIFA World Champions Badge from the day it becomes champions up to and including the final of the next edition of the tournament."

It will only be permitted on current first-team shirts - not retro shirts or training attire.}}</ref> The badge can only be worn on the club's official first-team jerseys (both home and away versions) – being the team that won the relevant FIFA world competition – and cannot be worn on any derivative or retrospective form of these jerseys, or on any related club training clothing, or by the club's reserve teams/any other of the club's teams.<ref name=LFC2>{{cite web | url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/379592-explained-liverpool-earn-gold-fifa-champions-badge | title=Explained: Liverpool earn gold FIFA Champions Badge | author=Glenn Price | date=21 December 2019 | accessdate=5 January 2020 | website=Liverpoolfc.com}}</ref><ref name=mirror/>[[File:Ronaldo vs. FC Schalke 04 (16854146922, cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] wears the FIFA Champions Badge (upper left) on his [[Real Madrid]] jersey; Madrid held a FIFA badge continuously for 1,098 days, a record by any club team.<ref name="marca" />]]

===Commercial aspects===

The physical badge is manufactured by a third party on behalf of FIFA (it was Unisport in 2019),<ref name=USNWT2/> and orders for the physical badge from jersey manufacturers must go through FIFA; a logistical situation that created delays in consumers being able to purchase [[Nike Inc.|Nike]]-made jerseys of the [[United States women's national soccer team]] (USWNT) with the badge in 2019.<ref name=2015ER/><ref name=USNWT2>{{cite web | url=https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/2019/5/15/18555795/ussf-nike-uswnt-world-cup-jersey-sales-problems | title=Show me the merch: what's going on with the USWNT's World Cup jersey sales? | author=Stephanie Yang | date=15 May 2019 | accessdate=5 January 2020 | website=Stars and Stripes F.C. | quote=World Cup champion patches are manufactured by Unisport, which adds a layer of logistics obviously, and actually draws FIFA into the mix, as orders reportedly go through them (which makes sense, since it’s their brand).}}</ref>  There have also been concerns that major jersey manufacturers such as Nike and [[Puma (brand)|Puma]], have had issues licensing the FIFA Champions Badge for first-team jerseys that can be sold to the general public.<ref name=FH>{{cite web | url=https://www.footyheadlines.com/2018/09/nike-certainly-wont-sale-france-2-star-jersey-with-world-cup-winners-badge.html | title=Is Nike Not Allowed To Sale France 2-Star Jersey With World Cup Winners Badge? | website=Footy Headlines | date=9 December 2018 | accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>

As well as the prestige, the award brings commercial benefits to the recipients through sales of jerseys that include the new FIFA badge.<ref name=FH/><ref>{{cite newspaper| url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/new-balance-set-liverpool-kit-21174050 | title=New Balance set for Liverpool kit boost following Club World Cup despite Nike deal| date=28 December 2019 | accessdate=5 January 2020 | newspaper=Irish Mirror | quote=Sports marketing expert Tim Crow wrote on Twitter: "After losing Liverpool’s licensing rights to Nike from next season, this is a big bonus for New Balance in the final few months of their LFC contract. FIFA Champions badge is a big sales driver as Real Madrid has shown."}}</ref>

===Non-FIFA competitions===

A separate agreement is required to wear the badge in non-FIFA organised competitions; for example, in 2009, the [[The Football Association|English FA]] granted [[Manchester United]], the reigning [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]] holders, permission to wear the badge during [[FA Cup]] fixtures but not in the [[Premier League]],<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/4974806/Manchester-United-world-champions-crest-rebuffed-by-Premier-League.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| title=Manchester United 'world champions' crest rebuffed by Premier League | date=12 March 2009| accessdate=21 December 2019 | author=Rory Smith | quote=The Premier League have risked a potential diplomatic row with Fifa by refusing Manchester United permission to wear a crest denoting their status as world champions on their shirts for the rest of the year.}}</ref> and a similar arrangement was sought for [[Liverpool F.C.]] when they became [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup]] holders;<ref name=lfc/><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fifa-champions-badge-rules-17460682|title=Liverpool get gold FIFA Champions badge but it won't be seen on Premier League shirts|author=Sean Bradbury|date=22 December 2019|accessdate=22 December 2019|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref> however, the English FA granted Liverpool the right to use it for one home premiership fixture against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.]] on 29 December 2019.<ref name=Telegraph.Liverpool>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/25/liverpool-granted-permission-wear-gold-badge-one-premier-league/ |title=Exclusive: Liverpool granted permission to wear gold badge for one Premier League game after Club World Cup victory | date=25 December 2019 | accessdate=25 December 2019 | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | author= Chris Bascombe | quote=The domestic governing body has accepted an application by the Merseysiders enabling them to celebrate their Club World Cup success with supporters; the home fixture with Wolves on December 29 being the designated date.}}</ref><ref name=LE>{{cite newspaper | url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-confirm-wear-gold-fifa-17481471 |title=Liverpool confirm they will wear Gold FIFA Champions badge against Wolverhampton Wanderers | author=Chris Beesley | accessdate=1 January 2020 | date=27 December 2019 | quote=Liverpool are only the second English club to lift the trophy following Manchester United in 2008 but back then the Premier League refused to allow them to sport the badge in their competition. | newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref>  In contrast, [[Real Madrid]] were allowed to wear their FIFA Champions Badge on their jerseys during all of their Spanish [[La Liga]] fixtures.<ref name=marca/>

===Club teams===
The first official award of the badge was made in February 2008 to the reigning holders of the [[FIFA Club World Cup]], Italian club [[A.C.

===National teams===
In September 2008, the badge was extended to the [[FIFA World Cup]] and was presented to the defending champions from 2006, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], thus becoming the first national team to wear the badge.{{efn|Even though FIFA presented A.C. Milan with the first "Champions Badge" seven months earlier in February 2008 as titleholders from the 2017 Club World Cup, because Italy were the reigning champions from the earlier 2006 World Cup, sometimes FIFA refers to Italy as being the "first recipient" of the badge in various press releases.<ref name=FIFA.RM/>}}<ref name="fifa2">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/first-fifa-world-champions-badge-presented-italy-868119|title=First 'FIFA World Champions Badge' presented to Italy|website=[[FIFA]]|date=2 September 2008|accessdate=22 December 2019|quote=FIFA President Joseph S.
