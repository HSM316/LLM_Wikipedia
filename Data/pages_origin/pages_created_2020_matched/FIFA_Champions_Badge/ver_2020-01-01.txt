The '''FIFA Champions Badge''' is a jersey-emblem in the shape of a gold and white shield, awarded by [[FIFA]] to the reigning world champions of FIFA competitions, both at national team level (e.g. [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA Futsal World Cup|Futsal World Cup]], and [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]), and at club team level (e.g. [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]]). 

The badge can only be worn on the first-term jerseys (not on reserve team jerseys, or on training clothing), of the reigning titleholders, and is thus a temporary award.  FIFA made the first award of the badge in February 2008 to [[A.C. Milan]], the then reigning [[2007 FIFA Club World Cup]] champions.

This official FIFA badge contrasts with informal symbols worn by various teams to signify important victories or trophies, such as [[Star (football badge)|stars]]. 

==Award==

The badge has the shape of a shield measuring 78 millimetres by 58 millimetres, and shows the image of the relevant trophy, with the inscription ''FIFA WORLD CHAMPIONS'', next to the year in which the relevant FIFA competition had been won.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/y=2013/m=12/news=bayern-join-elite-group-badge-winners-2249190.html |title=Bayern join elite group of badge-winners |access-date=March 30, 2018 |last= |first= |date=December 21, 2013 |work= |publisher=FIFA |location=Zurich |language= |quote=The badge, featuring an image of the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and the text ‘FIFA World Champions 2013’, will act as a physical reminder of the team’s successful 2013 in which they first won the UEFA Champions League in May before being crowned World Champions in Morocco.}}</ref><ref name=lfc/>  The badge comes in two colour schemes – gold letters on a white background, and white letters on a gold background.<ref name="fifa2"/>  The winning national team or club team carries the badge on their shirt until the end of the next edition of the relevant FIFA tournament; thus, it is only worn by reigning champions.<ref name=lfc>{{cite website|url= https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/379592-explained-liverpool-earn-gold-fifa-champions-badge| website=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | date=21 December 2019| accessdate=22 December 2019 | author=Glenn Price | title= Explained: Liverpool earn gold FIFA Champions Badge }}</ref>

The badge can be displayed on jerseys from the day the team becomes FIFA world champions, up to and including the day of the final of the next staging of the competition (e.g. if the team wins the competition again, they can hold the badge uninterrupted).<ref name=mirror>{{cite newspaper | url= https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/liverpool-wont-wear-golden-badge-21145176 |title= Liverpool won't wear golden badge for winning Club World Cup in Premier League |newspaper=Irish Mirror |date=22 December 2019 | accessdate=22 December 2019 | author=Sports Editor | quote=A FIFA spokesperson said: "As per the usage guidelines, the winning team can wear the FIFA World Champions Badge from the day it becomes champions up to and including the final of the next edition of the tournament."  Liverpool will be presented with the badge - which is 78 millimetres by 57mm - at an official ceremony.  It will only be permitted on current first-team shirts - not retro shirts or training attire.}}</ref> The badge can only be worn on the club's first-team jerseys – being the team that won the relevant FIFA world competition – and cannot be worn on any derivative or retrospective form of the club's current first-team jersey, or on any related club training clothing, or by the club's reserve teams/any other of the club's teams.<ref name=mirror/>

===Non-FIFA licensing===

Separate agreement can be required to wear the badge in non-FIFA organised competitions; for example, in 2009, the [[The Football Association|English FA]] granted [[Manchester United]], the reigning [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]] holders, permission to wear the badge during [[F.A. Cup]] fixtures but not in [[Premier League]] fixtures,<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/4974806/Manchester-United-world-champions-crest-rebuffed-by-Premier-League.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| title=Manchester United 'world champions' crest rebuffed by Premier League | date=12 March 2009| accessdate=21 December 2019 | author=Rory Smith | quote=The Premier League have risked a potential diplomatic row with Fifa by refusing Manchester United permission to wear a crest denoting their status as world champions on their shirts for the rest of the year.}}</ref> and a similar arrangement was sought for [[Liverpool F.C.]] when they became [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup]] holders;<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fifa-champions-badge-rules-17460682|title=Liverpool get gold FIFA Champions badge but it won't be seen on Premier League shirts|author=Sean Bradbury|date=22 December 2019|accessdate=22 December 2019|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref><ref name=lfc/> however, the English FA granted Liverpool F.C. the right to use it for one home premiership fixture against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.]] on 29 December 2019.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/25/liverpool-granted-permission-wear-gold-badge-one-premier-league/ |title=Exclusive: Liverpool granted permission to wear gold badge for one Premier League game after Club World Cup victory | date=25 December 2019 | accessdate=25 December 2019 | newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] | author= Chris Bascombe | quote=The domestic governing body has accepted an application by the Merseysiders enabling them to celebrate their Club World Cup success with supporters; the home fixture with Wolves on December 29 being the designated date.}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper | url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-confirm-wear-gold-fifa-17481471 |title=Liverpool confirm they will wear Gold FIFA Champions badge against Wolverhampton Wanderers | author=Chris Beesley | accessdate=1 January 2020 | date=27 December 2019 | quote=Liverpool are only the second English club to lift the trophy following Manchester United in 2008 but back then the Premier League refused to allow them to sport the badge in their competition. | newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]}}</ref>  In contrast, [[Real Madrid]] were allowed to wear their FIFA Champions Badge on their jerseys during all of their Spanish [[La Liga]] fixtures.<ref name=marca/>
