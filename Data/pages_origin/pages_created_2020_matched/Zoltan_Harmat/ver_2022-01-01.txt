==Biography==
Zoltan Harmat was born in the town of Máramarossziget, Hungary (today [[Sighet]] in [[Romania]]). Harmat's parents provided him with a rich education and cultural experience. His father served as a teacher and director of a local Jewish school.

At the end of high school, Harmat decided to study architecture at the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest Faculty of Architecture]] and completed his degree in 1924.<ref name=IZ/>

After graduation Harmat worked for one year in his profession, before immigrating to [[Mandate Palestine]].<ref name=IZ/> In the following years he went back several times to visit his relatives, the last time just days before the [[Invasion of Poland|outbreak]] of the [[Second World War]], Harmat making it back to Palestine on the last ship to cross in peacetime.<ref name=IZ/> After the war there was no one left of his family in Sighet, all having been killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz extermination camp]].<ref name=IZ/>

In Palestine Harmat joined a firm lead by the renowned British architect [[Albert Clifford Holliday]] and worked there for the next five years.<ref name=IZ/> During this period, he participated in the planning of many projects in Jerusalem, including [[St Andrew's Church, Jerusalem|St Andrew's Church]] (the "Scottish Church"; 1927), the [[Jerusalem Old Town Hall|Town Hall]] on Jaffa Street 22 (1930), the Bible Society House on 7 Yohanan MeGush Halav ([[John of Giscala]]) Street (1926–28), and two new wings for the outpatient [[Saint John Eye Hospital Group|Saint John Eye Hospital]], separated by the Hebron Road - one wing is currently the Mt Zion Hotel, and the other the Jerusalem House of Quality.<ref name=IZ/><ref>[http://allaboutjerusalem.com/article/mount-zion-hotel-history Mount Zion Hotel History], allAboutJerusalem.com.

I found a source for the year of the Bible Society House, but that's all.|date=November 2020}}

After the departure of Holliday, Harmat contributed in one way or another to other important projects, such as the [[Central Post Office Building (Jerusalem)|Central Post Office]], the National Bank{{dubious|No such thing in Mandate times. The Anglo Palestine Bank from Jaffa St. (c. 1939), directly next to Post Office and Town Hall, was designed by Erich Mendelsohn. So?|date=November 2020}} and the [[Generali Building]].<ref name=IZ/>
{{dubious|Central Post Office, Generali Building are the work of other architects. The VERY poor source used here is attributing to Harmat projects where he might have participated as - what? draughtsman? assistant? MOT as main architect in any case. Should we take this source seriously at all?|date=November 2020}}
Around the 1930s and 1940s, he designed, independently, homes for elite families in Jerusalem.

One of his most famous designs is the [[:he:הולילנד|Holyland]] Hotel near the Malha neighbourhood. The hotel was planned in 1952, built between 1955-1958,<ref name=Hattab>{{cite book |last1= Cohen-Hattab |first1= Kobi |last2= Shoval |first2= Noam |title= Tourism, Religion and Pilgrimage in Jerusalem |page= 118 |publisher= Routledge |year= 2014 |series= Contemporary Geographies of Leisure, Tourism and Mobility |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J4c9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 |isbn= 9781317672111 <!--9781317672104-->}}</ref> and demolished to make place for new hotels and private homes in the 2000s.<ref>Lawrence Rifkin, [https://www.jpost.com/jerusalem-report/holy-corruption ''Holy Corruption''], The Jerusalem Post, 2 May 2010.
