== Biography ==
Zoltan Harmat was born in the city of [[Sighet]], Hungary (1900-1985). Harmat's parents provided him with a rich education and cultural experience. His father served as a teacher and director of a local Jewish school.

At the end of high school, Harmat decided to study architecture at the Technical Institute of Budapest and completed his degree in 1924.<ref name=IZ />
 
A year after graduating, Harmat decided to immigrate to Israel. He joined a firm lead by the renowned British architect [[Albert Clifford Holliday]] and worked there for the next five years.<ref name=IZ /> During this period, he participated in the planning of many projects, including the building near the [[St Andrew's Church, Jerusalem]] Cinematheque (1927), the Jerusalem Municipality building on Jaffa Street 22 (1930), a Biblical Society Building, 7 Yohana Megush Halav Street (1926), and the outpatient eye clinic on Hebron road, currently the Jerusalem House of Quality.

Around the 1930s and 1940s, he designed, independently, homes for elite families in Jerusalem.

One of his most famous designs is the [[:he:הולילנד|Holyland]] residential complex (Hotel) located near the Malha neighborhood. The Hotel was planned in 1952 and completed in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4c9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118 |title=Tourism, Religion and Pilgrimage in Jerusalem |page=118 |first1=Kobi |last1=Cohen-Hattab |first2=Noam |last2=Shoval |publisher=Routledge |date=2014 |isbn=9781317672111}}</ref>
