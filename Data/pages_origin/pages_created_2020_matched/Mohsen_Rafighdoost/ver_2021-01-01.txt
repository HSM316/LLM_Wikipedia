==Background==
Rafighdoost's background is that of a ''[[bazaari]]'', the traditional class of people who work in the [[bazaar]].<ref name="Kaplan, 1996 p.201">Kaplan,  ''The Ends of the Earth, (1996), p.201</ref> His father was a fruit and vegetable merchant at the Tehran bazaar.<ref name="Klebnikov">[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0721/056_3.html Millionaire mullahs] by Paul Klebnikov. ''Forbes'', July 7, 2003, accessed 15-May-2009</ref>

==Military career==
Mohsen Rafighdoost was the chief of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s security detail in 1979 during the [[Iranian Revolution]], and helped found the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] who helped [[Consolidation of the Iranian Revolution#Suppression of opposition|eliminate opposition]] to theocratic rule in the [[Islamic Republic]].

He is noted for having driven Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the leader of the Revolution, from the [[Tehran]] international airport into Tehran, during Khomeini's triumphant return to Iran from exile, while millions of Iranians crowded the road to welcome Khomeini back. He has told journalists this was the most important day of his life and "crowds were all over the car, touching and hanging on to it."<ref>Kaplan, ''The Ends of the Earth'', (1996), p.200</ref>

He served from 1982 to 1989 as Minister of the Revolutionary Guards<ref>[http://www.iricrimes.org/wanted.asp Islamic Republic of Iran Crimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026212758/http://www.iricrimes.org/wanted.asp |date=2006-10-26 }}</ref> where he quashed internal dissent and obtained weapons from abroad for the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Rafighdoost said in a 2014 interview that he twice suggested to Khomeini that Iran develop [[weapons of mass destruction]] to counter their [[Iraqi chemical weapons program#Use in the Iran–Iraq War, 1983–1988|use by Saddam Hussein]]. Rafighdoost claimed that both times Khomeini rejected the idea, reasoning that it would be against Islam.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Gareth|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/16/when_the_ayatollah_said_no_to_nukes_iran_khomeini|work=Foreign Policy|date=17 October 2014}}</ref>

==Business career==
With the election of [[Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] he was appointed head of the Mostazafan Foundation or ''[[Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan]]'' (Foundation of the Oppressed), "the second-largest commercial enterprise" in Iran behind the state-owned [[National Iranian Oil Company]]<ref name="Klebnikov"/> where he remained until 1999.

Since 1999, Mohsen Rafighdoost has been the Director of the Noor Foundation. The Foundation reportedly owns apartment blocks and "makes an estimated $200 million importing pharmaceuticals, sugar and construction materials."<ref>http://rand.org/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG821.pdf</ref>

==Controversy==
In 1995, Mohsen Rafighdoost's brother, Morteza Rafighdoost, was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for bank fraud.<ref>[http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles/bonyad_2379923.html THE CHANGE AT THE DEPRIVED FOUNDATION A CONCESSION TO KHATAMI?]</ref> After this, Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] appointed a board of trustees and made the Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan subject to [[Majlis|parliamentary]] scrutiny.<ref>[http://iranpoliticsclub.net/library/english-library/lori%27s-song1/index.htm#On%20Mohammad%20Forouzandeh On Mohammad Forouzandeh]</ref>

Rafighdoost's personal fortune is said to be worth the equivalent of many millions of dollars.<ref name="Kaplan, 1996 p.201" /> When asked about his personal wealth, Rafighdoost has responded: "I am just a normal person, with normal wealth, but if Islam is threatened, I will become big again."<ref name="Klebnikov" />
