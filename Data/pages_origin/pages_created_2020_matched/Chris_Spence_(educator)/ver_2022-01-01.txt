==Biography==
Born in [[England]] to [[Jamaica]]n parents, Spence has lived in Canada since he was three years old and received his early education in [[Windsor, Ontario]].<ref name=Spec>{{cite web|title=Former B.C.

Spence received a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree from [[York University]], an [[Master of Education|M.Ed.]] degree from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1993, and an [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] degree from the University of Toronto's [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] in 1996, which was later revoked due to plagiarism.<ref name="tdsb.on.ca"/><ref name="Spec"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/About_OISE/In_the_Media.html|title=OISE In the News|publisher=OISE|access-date=January 1, 2013}}</ref>

He became Director of Education for the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board on September 1, 2004, and served until July 2009, when he became the Director of Education for the Toronto District School Board.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/making-every-head-count/article1276775/ |title=Making every head count|last=Gee |first=Marcus |date=2009-09-04 |newspaper=Globe and Mail |access-date=September 6, 2009 |location=Toronto}}</ref>

==Plagiarism, resignation and revoking of teaching license==
On January 9, 2013, Spence apologized for plagiarizing several passages in an op-ed piece he wrote for the ''Toronto Star'' on extracurricular activities. The plagiarism was verified by the ''Star'''s [[public editor]]. Among the plagiarized material was this paragraph lifted from a 1989 opinion piece in the ''New York Times'': "We are challenged through sport to use our minds in guiding our bodies through the dimensions of time and space on the field of play. Learning the skills of sport provides opportunity to experience success."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thestar.com/living/parent/article/1312380--toronto-school-board-director-admits-plagiarism-in-star-article | title=Toronto school board director admits plagiarism in Star article | newspaper=Toronto Star | date=January 9, 2013 | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | author=Rushowy, Kristin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/sports/l-an-open-letter-to-president-bush-756789.html | title=An Open Letter to President Bush | newspaper=New York Times | date=February 19, 1989 | accessdate=January 11, 2013 | author=Defrantz, Anita L.}}</ref> On January 10, 2013, Spence tendered his resignation as director effective immediately after additional incidents of plagiarism in earlier articles and blog entries were uncovered.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2013/01/10/toronto-plagiarism-chris-spence-school326.html|title=Toronto school board head resigns, plagiarism allegations grow| work=CBC News}}</ref>

Passages from his 1996 Ed.D. dissertation were also revealed to have been copied from other sources without attribution: sentences, paragraphs, whole pages were meticulously edited so as to obscure his plagiarism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Andrea |title=Tribunal recommends Chris Spence be stripped of doctorate |url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2017/06/20/tribunal-recommends-chris-spence-be-stripped-of-doctorate.html |website=thestar.com |publisher=Toronto Star |access-date=12 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TDSB director resigns over plagiarism, PhD dissertation includes unattributed passages|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/tdsb-director-resigns-over-plagiarism-phd-dissertation-includes-unattributed-passages/article7167752/|accessdate=January 10, 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 10, 2013|location=Toronto}}</ref> On June 20, 2017, the [[University of Toronto]] investigated the allegations, found him guilty of academic dishonesty, and rescinded his degree.<ref>{{cite news|title=U of T checking Chris Spence's dissertation for plagiarism|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/parent/article/1313707--u-of-t-reviewing-chris-spence-s-dissertation-for-plagiarism|access-date=February 11, 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>

On December 20, 2016, the [[Ontario College of Teachers]] announced that Spence's teaching license had been revoked as a result of the findings of the investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/19/chris-spence-former-tdsb-education-director-stripped-of-teaching-licence.html|title=Chris Spence, former TDSB education director, stripped of teaching licence|first=Alicja|last=Siekierska|date=December 19, 2016|publisher=|access-date=January 1, 2018|via=Toronto Star}}</ref> 

In 2018, Spence lost his fight to keep his Ed.D. The appeals tribunal stated that the "nature and extent [of plagiarism] found in Spence's thesis is a very serious offence." The matter, however, is not yet settled. His lawyer, Darryl Singer, wrote in an email that Spence intends to seek judicial review of the decision in Ontario divisional court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/02/07/chris-spence-loses-appeal-to-keep-phd-amid-plagiarism-findings.html|title=Chris Spence loses appeal to keep PhD amid plagiarism findings|last=Gordon|first=Andrea|date=2018-02-07|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}</ref>

Spence successfully appealed the revocation of his teaching licence in 2018 on the grounds that his "'precarious' mental state was not adequately accounted for."  A psychiatric report stated that Spence's ability to function had been affected by "depression and suicidal ideation related to the evaporation of his marriage and career."<ref>{{cite news | last = Gignac | first = Julien | date = May 30, 2018 | title = Disgraced Former TDSB Executive Chris Spence Successfully Appeals Revocation of Teaching Licence | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/05/30/disgraced-former-tdsb-executive-chris-spence-successfully-appeals-revocation-of-teaching-licence.html | work = Toronto Star}}</ref>
