An assertion that the name ''Nymphalis l-album'' is in fact the correct name over the widely used ''Nymphalis vaualbum'' proved to have backing when it was discovered the description covering ''vaualbum'' did not include a description or type specimen. Thus ''vaualbum'' can be considered ''[[nomen nudum]]'', giving ''Nymphalis l-album'' priority.<ref>{{cite web |title = Species Nymphalis l-album - Compton Tortoiseshell - BugGuide.Net |url= http://bugguide.net/node/view/12877 |accessdate =2015-07-18}}</ref>

==Description==

Wingspan: 2 1/2 - 3 1/16 inches (6.4 - 7.8&nbsp;cm). The Upper side is orange-brown with
darker wing bases and black patches. There is a single white costal spot on both  the forewing and the hindwing. The verso is mottled grey and brown, with dark bases and borders. Regardless of the ground colour (grey-brown or a buff brown), there is great contrast between the dark chocolate-brown discal region and the paler postdiscal area in males, less so in females. The hindwing verso  has a ‘V’-shaped white mark adjoining the cell at S4. In some specimens this ‘V’ is replaced by  a dash, an ‘L’,a ‘C’ or a ‘J’ and it may consist of just a  few white scales, or be absent altogether. This marking is far more prominent in males.<ref>Martin Gascoigne-Pees, Colin Wiskin, Milan Đurić and Duncan Trew, 2014 The lifecycle of Nymphalis vaualbum ([Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775) in Serbia including new records and a review of its present status in Europe ''Nachr. entomol. Ver. Apollo, N.F.'' 35 (1/2): 77–96 (2014).[https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/NEVA_35_0077-0096.pdf pdf]</ref>  This V mark is shared with ''[[Polygonia c-album]]'', hence the name false comma.

==Distribution==
It is seen in deciduous and coniferous forest in a wide range throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The nominate subspecies (''N. v. l-album'') is found throughout central Asia. The subspecies, ''N. v. j-album''{{'s}}, range consists of [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]] south into [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]]. They are seen east to [[New England]] and eastern [[Canada]] and south to [[North Carolina]] and [[Missouri]]. They rarely migrate to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Florida]]. The species is also found in the [[Palearctic]]  - Eastern Europe, Romania, Ukraine, the south of Russia to the areas west of the Urals, the southern part of Siberia to the Himalayas and Japan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.butterfly-conservation-armenia.org/species.html|title=Species|website=Butterfly Conservation Armenia}}</ref>

==Life cycle==
The adult female will lay her eggs in a clump on the host plant. Once the eggs hatch the caterpillars will feed together until they pupate. There is one brood that flies from July to November.
