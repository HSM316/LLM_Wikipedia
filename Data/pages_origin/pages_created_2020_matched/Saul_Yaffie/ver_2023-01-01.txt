== Early life ==
Saul Yaffie was born in Blythswood, [[Glasgow]] on 29 April 1898. His mother was Kate Yaffie (née Karkinofski), and his father, Bernard Yaffie, was a master tailor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Like many Russian Jews, Kate and Bernard Yaffie fled persecution in Russia during a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms triggered by the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Saul's father was naturalised as a British citizen by the time that Saul himself was three; a Bernard Yaffie is recorded as living at Abbotsford Place in the old [[Gorbals]], where the young Saul spent the early years of his childhood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> The Yaffies were not unique in their situation: the Gorbals was the centre of Scotland's Jewish community and home to a large proportion of Glasgow's immigrants throughout the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Over time, there was a movement to some of the more affluent communities in Glasgow, such as [[Pollokshields]] and [[Garnethill]], as many Jewish families gradually improved their social and economic situation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jewish community in Scotland|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/higherscottishhistory/migrationandempire/experienceofimmigrants/jewish.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Like these, the Yaffies also experienced a time of good fortune, moving to a more agreeable address on Sinclair Drive, [[Cathcart]] as Bernard's tailoring business prospered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/|website=Scotland's People|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>

== Education and military service ==
Saul attended day classes in drawing and painting, modelling, and life drawing at [[Glasgow School of Art|The Glasgow School of Art]] from 1912 to 1919.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> During the [[World War I|First World War]], he was required to interrupt his studies to serve in the King's Own Scottish Borderers in 1916/17. Although subject to military conscription, Yaffie reached the rank of corporal during his service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Prior to his conscription Yaffie engaged in munitions work, something that was recorded in the GSA's student registers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>

== Later life ==
The post-war economic depression that affected the country during the 1920s, also affected the Yaffie family directly: Bernard Yaffie's business suffered greatly, and the family eventually emigrated to Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Saul did not emigrate with his family, choosing instead to stay in Europe, and relocate to [[Paris]] where he continued his artistic practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Now married, Saul sought to escape persecution in Europe by returning to the UK before the [[World War II|Second World War]] with his wife, Estusia. The two settled in Manchester, but returned to France after the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yaffie, Saul|url=http://www.gsaarchives.net/archon/index.php?p=core/search&subjectid=677|website=Archives and Collections: Glasgow School of Art|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>
