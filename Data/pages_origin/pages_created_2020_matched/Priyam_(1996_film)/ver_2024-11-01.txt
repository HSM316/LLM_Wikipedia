S. Ramanujam of ''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote, "Arun  Kumar and newcomer Manthra make a pleasing pair,  romancing without any inhibition, Ganeshram's camera making the best use of the  seashore  fort  and  its ramparts  in  the  song  and  dance portions. Prakashraj displays a lot of dash in his approach,  the wolf in sheep's clothing effect being brought about without  much sweat".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ramanujam |first=D.
