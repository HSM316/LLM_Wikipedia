__NOTOC__
'''Bithia''' or '''Bitia'''<ref name=h/> was a [[Phoenicia]]n, [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian]], and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town located near [[Chia, Italy|Chia]] in the extreme south of [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

==History==
Bithia was founded by the [[Phoenicia]]ns in the 8th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as '''Bitan''' ({{lang-xpu|ê§Åê§â{{popdf}}ê§ï{{popdf}}ê§è{{popdf}}ê§ç}}, {{sc|byt øn}},<ref name=h>{{harvp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&pg=PA561 561]}}.</ref> "Palace"). It fell under [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] control until the [[Punic Wars]], when it became [[Roman Republic|Roman]]. Punic culture survived well into the Roman period.<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AMc1WQAnRTkC|title = Bilingualism and the Latin Language|last = Adams|first = James Noel|date = 2003-01-09|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521817714|language = en}}</ref> It was abandoned in the early 7th century, when the population fled inland to escape Arab raids.

In 1963, following heavy storms, some ruins of the city came to light. Still observable are the remains of a Punic temple on the island of [[Cardolinu]], on which are also found artifacts that seem to indicate the presence of a [[tophet]]. Additional remains of houses and a second temple dedicated to [[Bes]] are located at the foot of the promontory on which stands the Spanish tower called "Chia", the current name of the modern village.
