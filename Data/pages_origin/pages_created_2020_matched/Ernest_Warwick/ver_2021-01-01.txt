'''Ernest Warwick''' was a British author, prisoner of war and survivor of the [[Burma Railway|Burma to Siam death railway]].

== Biography ==
Ernest Edward Lawrence Warwick was born in [[Brighton]] in 1918 towards the end of the [[World War I|first World War]]. He had a tough upbringing through [[Great Depression#United Kingdom|the slump and poverty of the thirties]]. The eldest of eight children, with four brothers and three sisters, he was forced to leave school at 13 years of age after his father had been killed the day before in a road accident.

At [[World War II#War breaks out in Europe .281939.E2.80.9340.29|the outbreak of World War 2 in 1939]], he was called up and, after eight weeks basic training in the Essex Regiment, he was posted to the Fourth Battalion of the [[Suffolk Regiment]], HQ Company, Intelligence Section for the duration of [[World War II|World War 2]]. This formed part of the [[18th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry (Combat) Division of the British Army]].

Serving as a private soldier, fighting on the streets in the brief and bloody 17-day [[Battle of Singapore|battle for Singapore]] (which ended in the [[Battle of Singapore#Fall of Singapore|ignominious surrender of the Island]] – the 'fortress that never was<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tl9tx4MJYf4C&q=singapore+the+%22fortress+that+never+was%22&pg=PA125|title=Singapore: The Battle that Changed the World|last=Leasor|first=James|date=1 January 2001|publisher=House of Stratus|isbn=9780755100392|language=en}}</ref>'), he was wounded in action and taken [[Prisoner of war#Empire of Japan|Prisoner of War]] on the [[Battle of Singapore#Fall of Singapore|15 February 1942]]. He spent 3 years and 8 months as a [[Japanese prisoners of war in World War II|Japanese Prisoner of War]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roll-of-honour.org.uk/w/html/warwick-ernest-edward-lawrence.htm|title=Warwick-Ernest-Edward-Lawrence|publisher=roll-of-honour.org.uk|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> the majority of this on the infamous "[[Burma Railway|railway of death]]" in [[Thailand]]. Saved from virtually certain death by the timely dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atom Bomb on Japan]], which led to the almost immediate unconditional [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of the Japanese]]. In August 1945 he was flown to a hospital in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[Myanmar|Burma]] weighing just over 6 stone (84lbs).

He was awarded [[1939–1945 Star|The 1939–1945 Star]], [[Pacific Star|The Pacific Star]] (for the 17-day bloody [[battle of Singapore]]) and the [[War Medal 1939–1945|1939–1945 War Medal]].

Throughout the post-war years he had a variety of jobs in industry, culminating in his position as deputy head porter at the General Hospital in [[Rochford]] for eight years until his retirement in 1983. He lived with his family in the village of [[Ashingdon]] in Essex.

Ernest was haunted by his years in captivity all his life and was confined to a wheelchair as a direct result of brutal torture and ill-treatment at the hands of the Japanese in the [[Burma Railway|grim jungle death camps alongside the River Kwai]]. <blockquote>"Mr. Ernest Warwick, suffered badly at the hands of the Japanese and came out of a Japanese camp, as my right hon. Friend has described, broken in health. But the remarkable thing about such men is that they were not broken in spirit and managed to survive because their spirit was not broken."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/jun/06/prisoners-of-war-compensation#S6CV0192P0_19910606_HOC_432|title=Prisoners of War (Compensation)|last=Clark|first=Dr. Michael|date=6 June 1991|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref></blockquote>In no way did he glorify war, but felt that as a proud nation we should always remember and honour our dead, who gave so much that we might live.

Between 1985 and 1987 Ernest wrote, and then in 1987 published, his first and only book ''Tamajao 241 : A POW camp on the River Kwai''. It is based solidly on his own experiences in captivity. His story was written as a tribute to his dead comrades and to expose to the world the appalling [[Japanese war crimes|inhumanity of the Japanese and Koreans]] during [[World War II|World War 2]].

== Incident at the docks ==

''Daily work parties were sent from [[Changi Prison|Changi]] to the city of Singapore in overcrowded lorries, to work on the docks loading and unloading ships.''

''At the docks Ernest witnessed an armed guard force an old Chinese lady, who had been giving cakes to Ernest and some of the other prisoners, to hold a metal bar above her head while he beat her about the face with his belt until she bled.''

''Ernest intervened by striking the guard, which subsequently resulted in him being punished by being roped to a tree for 5 days and 5 nights''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/local_news/4077355.Tributes_to_war_veteran_Ernest__90/|title=Tributes to war veteran Ernest, 90|website=Echo|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> ''without food or water. At sunrise every day the Japanese guards would pray to [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] and then beat Ernest into unconsciousness.''

''They threatened to behead Ernest by a sword, but changed their minds and instead sentenced him to 28 days in a metal tomb at the Japanese punishment centre.''
