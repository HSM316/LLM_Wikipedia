The album received positive reviews from critics. ''JRock News'' gave a positive review and saying: "''The Sign'' is a solid and loud metal album! It's catchy as hell and makes you long for your next metal concert. Crystal Lake was able to create something unique with a pleasant twist to their typical style, each song containing their own individual characteristics, ensuring an energetic and exciting listening experience throughout the entire album."<ref name="jrocknews"/> Alex Sievers from ''KillYourStereo'' gave the album 80 out of 100 and said: "Yes, one listen to Crystal Lake and it's clear that [[The Ghost Inside (band)|The Ghost Inside]] have been a very BIG influence on this band's sound, but they have just the right amount of added groove, heaviness and outside influences to differentiate themselves from The Ghost Inside/Hundredth sounding crowd. Despite the odd misstep, ''The Sign'' is the first big chance that Crystal Lake have towards conquering the musical world beyond the shores of their home country. With the reception the record has gotten so far, this could very well be the beginning of something beautiful. Just please don't screw it up, boys."<ref name="killyourstereo"/>
