'''Vázquez de Molina Square''', situated in [[Úbeda]] ([[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]]), in the Autonomous Region of [[Andalusia]] ([[Spain]]), is one of the best examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Spain. The [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|Spanish Renaissance]] architectural value of this square was one of the motives for [[UNESCO]]'s decision to declare Úbeda a [[World Heritage]] site in July 2003.

Prominent buildings in this square are:

*'''Deán Ortega Palace (''Palacio del Deán Ortega'')''': a Renaissance palace designed by the Spanish architect [[Andrés de Vandelvira]] in the 16th century. Presently, it is a [[Parador]] hotel, one of the oldest in Spain.
*'''[[Vázquez de Molina Palace]] (''Palacio de Vázquez de Molina''):''' another building in the Renaissance style designed by Vandelvira, also known as the Palace of the Chains (''Palacio de las Cadenas'') because of the decorative chains which once hung from its façade. [[Juan Vázquez de Molina]], [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]’s Secretary of State, ordered its construction. It currently serves as the seat of [[Úbeda]]'s municipal government.
*'''[[Basílica de Santa María de los Reales Alcázares]]:''' a [[church architecture|church]] built on the ruins of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] Úbeda's mosque. It incorporates several styles, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]].

*'''Holy Chapel of the Savior (''Sacra Capilla del Salvador''):''' [[Francisco de los Cobos]], [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]]’s secretary, had this chapel built as his own [[Temple|pantheon]]. It was designed by the architect [[Diego de Siloé]], and Vandelvira carried out its construction. This chapel is one of the town's most characteristic architectural monuments. Its façade, sculpted in stone by Esteban Jamate, is one of the most beautiful in [[Andalusia]].
