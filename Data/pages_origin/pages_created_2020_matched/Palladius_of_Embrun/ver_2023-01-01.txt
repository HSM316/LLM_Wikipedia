'''Saint Palladius of Embrun''' ({{lang-fr|Pallade, Pélade}}, {{lang-ca|Patllari, Pal·ladi}}) (d. ca. 541 AD) was a 6th-century [[bishop of Embrun]].  Born to a [[Christians|Christian]] family, he studied under Catulin, bishop of [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], who had attended the [[Council of Épaone]] in 517.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.forum-orthodoxe.com/janv2.php Forum Orthodoxe Francophone<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  When the [[Arianism|Arians]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy]] opposed the council, Catulin was exiled to [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Palladius accompanied him there, and took the opportunity to extensively study Scripture.<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Palladius was ordained a priest and, according to legend, gained the gift of [[prophecy]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />  He is said to have predicted the fall and death of Sigismund.<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Catulin died around 518, and Palladius would later be elected bishop of Embrun.  During his episcopate he built numerous churches, in [[Chorges]], [[Sauze, Alpes-Maritimes|Sauze]], and [[Rama (Gaul)|Rama]], as well as sanctuaries dedicated to [[Saint Martin of Tours]], and [[Saints Vincent, Orontius, and Victor]], as well as to [[Genesius of Arles]].<ref name=autogenerated4 />  One source states that Palladius "possessed an exceptional efficacy in obtaining whatever he petitioned God for."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.catholiconline.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5813 St. Palladius - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Many miracles were attributed to him, and, besides the gift of prophecy, he enjoyed a "mystical familiarity with the [[angels]]... [and] successfully defeated the machinations of the [[devil]] simply by making the [[sign of the cross]]."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Veneration==
In [[Catalonia]], he is known as ''Patllari'' or ''Pal•ladi''.  According to a legend associated with his [[relics]], some [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monks decided to go to Embrun to steal Palladius' relics to take them with them to [[Spain]].  Once they were in possession of the relics, the monks placed them in a container, which was carried by a donkey.  When the travelers reached the outskirts of the town of [[Camprodon]], the animal refused to travel any longer and did not move.  The monks tried to get the donkey to budge, but the animal refused.  It stamped its feet against the ground: miraculously, three springs of water gushed out from the ground where the donkey had stamped its feet.<ref>Compare [[Pegasus]] and the spring of [[Hippocrene]].</ref>  The monks let the donkey go free.  The animal wandered into the town, passing the churches of Carme, Santa Maria, entering the monastery of Sant Pere, where it remained.  The monks decided to leave the relics at Camprodon, at Sant Pere.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://webspobles.ddgi.cat/sites/camprodon/Pages_LeftMenu/llegenda_st_patllari.aspx Llegenda de Sant Patllari<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Contrary to the legend, the relics can actually be found at the church of Santa Maria de Camprodon, a church of mixed [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], and [[Baroque]] architectural styles.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref>[http://grandesrutas.huescaenbtt.es/TRANSPIRENAICA_1/2_trans_albanya_campodron_1.htm Albanya - Camprodón<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

However, the 14th century [[reliquary]] of Saint Palladius (''Arqueta de Sant Patllari'') may have proceeded from the monastery of Sant Pere before being moved to Santa Maria.<ref>Núria de Dalmases, Antoni José i Pitarch.

In Camprodon, the [[feast day]] of Palladius is celebrated with dances (such as the [[sardana]]), music, and a procession of “giants” (''Cercavila de gegants''), which are sculptures of giant historical figures.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>[http://www.festacatalunya.cat/articles-mostra-1149-cat-festa_major_de_sant_patllari_de_camprodon.htm festacatalunya – Festes – Festes majors de municipis – Festa Major de Sant Patllari de Camprodon<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915150944/http://www.festacatalunya.cat/articles-mostra-1149-cat-festa_major_de_sant_patllari_de_camprodon.htm |date=2007-09-15 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.naciodigital.cat/elripolles/?seccio=noticies&accio=veure&id=6478 ElRipolles.info : Sant Patllari a l'equador<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
