'''PureSolo''' is an application creation company specialising in music and vocal recording technology for a range of mobile devices.

Once users download their chosen PureSolo app from their preferred store, they gain access to a catalogue containing thousands of professionally produced backing tracks and accompaniments. Once a track has been selected, users can record their performance using the app’s own built-in recorder.

Once completed, a recording can then be exported to social and video networks such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. User profiles can also created on PureSolo apps where members can upload a photo, share feedback, follow favourite artists and promote their tracks.

The current catalogue contains recordable versions of songs for karaoke, guitar, and accompaniment.  With 35 different genres of music, from [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] through to [[jazz]] and [[Classical music|Classical]], there is a wide variety of tracks to choose from for over 20 different instruments.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jul/02/behind-music-karaoke "Behind the music: PureSolo gives Karaoke a revamp"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2010</ref>

PureSolo has also formed a partnership with the UK government's [[Sing Up]] campaign. Sing Up is a not-for-profit organisation promoting singing in the classroom.<ref>[http://www.singup.org www.singup.org]</ref> The resource, in the form of backing tracks, lyrics and accompanying notes, provides teachers the means to encourage students to get involved with singing songs from the new UK songbook. At the end of January 2010, they added a new ‘Sing & Share’ functionality which enables individual pupils, classrooms or whole schools to record and share their efforts. This functionality is powered and hosted by PureSolo.
