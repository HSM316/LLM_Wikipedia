==Badhan==
A 1997 survey of students at the [[University of Dhaka]] had found a generally favourable attitude towards voluntary blood donation, and an overwhelmingly unfavourable attitude to paid blood donation, and recommended that a campaign should be started immediately to increase awareness and participation in voluntary blood donation among the student population.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Hosain, G.M.M. |author2=Anisuzzaman, M. |author3=Begum, A. |year=1997|title=Knowledge and attitude towards voluntary blood donation among Dhaka University students in Bangladesh|journal=East African Medical Journal|volume=74|issue=9|pages=549–553|pmid=9487428}}</ref>

The blood provided is fresh rather than stored,<ref name=website>{{cite web |url=http://badhan.org |title=BADHAN (A Voluntary Blood Donor's Organization): Official Web Site |accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref> using a database of people whose blood type has been previously established.

Other activities include raising awareness about donating fresh blood, donating blood voluntarily for patients and helping poor people in time of natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.du.ac.bd/main_menu/co_curricular |title=Co-curricular activities |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210131500/http://www.du.ac.bd/main_menu/co_curricular |archivedate=10 February 2016 |accessdate=10 February 2016 }}</ref>

Financing comes primarily from individual members and ex-members, as well as from the universities and colleges administration, from donations.<ref name=website/> The California non-profit organisation SpaandanB has been a significant contributor from outside Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaandanb.org/projects/badhan/badhan1.html#3|title=SpaandanB project: Badhan Blood Transfusion Centre|access-date=11 December 2012|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003737/http://www.spaandanb.org/projects/badhan/badhan1.html#3|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Badhan wants to make blood donation as a social movement. Its ultimate goals are (a) none should die from lack of blood, (b) every person knows his/her blood group. The head office of Badhan is located on the ground floor of TSC, Dhaka University.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}
