'''TeleNorba''' or '''Telenorba Shqiptare''' or simply '''TNSH''' (now '''ABC News''')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kkrt.gov.al/sq/rreth-kkrt/njoftim-per-shtypin/160-24092010-njoftim-per-shtyp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010143531/http://www.kkrt.gov.al/sq/rreth-kkrt/njoftim-per-shtypin/160-24092010-njoftim-per-shtyp |archivedate=2010-10-10 }} Njoftim per Shtyp, KKRT, September 24, 2010</ref> is a defunct private Albanian TV channel from Tirana, Albania owned by the [[Bari]] based TeleNorba Italia broadcaster. At first, it was owned by Italian businessmen, then a Greek businessman and finally by Albanian media mogul Aleksander Frangaj. The channel launched in 1998 in Albania and used to be available via analogue in central Albania and later on satellite in Europe on the Albanian TV package [[DigitAlb]].

Traditionally, the channel broadcast a variety of programming but its core focus remained news programming and soap operas from Italy. In 2002, it was ranked fourth with 11.3% audience share. TeleNorba was the only affiliated channel to [[TV Klan]] which had the right to broadcast Njerez te humbur (Missing people) but did not hold the rights to broadcast the program live. Indeed, the program debuted on TNSH.<ref>http://tvklan.blogspot.com/2009/04/njerez-te-humbur.html TV Klan Blog</ref> On October 25, 2010, after some successful take overs from imminent bankruptcy, the channel was rebranded to [[ABC News (Albania)|ABC News]].

== History ==
Due to the success of Italian media worldwide and their reach in Albania, the broadcaster decided to launch a new channel called Telenorba which would broadcast Italian programming to Albanian audiences. The ownership was made up of Italian and Albanian businessmen and a private company. Afterwards, it rebranded to "TeleNorba Shqiptare or TNSH" while programmes started to be subtitled in the [[Albanian language]]. Colpo Grosso, a late night adult show became a huge success together with soap operas from Latin America. The channel gained popularity and was able to expand its range of programing to include many Albanian programs and a high-profile news bulletin. At midnight, TNSH used to simulcast the Italian version of the channel.

== Satellite broadcasting ==
Despite having been one of the youngest channels created by the TeleNorba company, TeleNorba Shqiptare was the only channel to broadcast by satellite in Europe.

==Logo==
The first logo was a white 'TN' symbol taken from the original Telenorba channel in Italy. An amber version followed, while later the letters 'SH' denoting "Shqiptare" were added as the colors were changed to transparent blue letters on white background. Finally, the logo was replaced with the transparent logo of the existing Italian channel.
