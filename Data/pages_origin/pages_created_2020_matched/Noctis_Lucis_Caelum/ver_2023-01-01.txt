{{nihongo|'''Noctis Lucis Caelum'''|ノクティス・ルシス・チェラム|Nokutisu Rushisu Cheramu}}, {{nihongo|"Noct"|ノクト|Nokuto}} for short, is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] from [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' video game series. Noctis is a playable character and the [[main protagonist]] of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', which was originally a spin-off titled ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII''. The crown prince and protector of Lucis, Noctis, and his allies must reclaim their country when the empire of Niflheim attacks Lucis in an attempt to take control of its magical crystal. Noctis has also appeared in the game's expanded media, including ''Final Fantasy'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] titles and other games, including ''[[Puzzle & Dragons]]'' and the fighting game ''[[Tekken 7]]''.

Noctis was created and co-designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and his design was later revised by [[Yusuke Naora]]. Nomura created Noctis as a type of protagonist that had not before been used in a leading role in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, focusing on realism. Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house [[Roen]], designed Noctis' clothes to be asymmetric, mirroring the fashion house's trademark style, and indicative of the game's themes and atmosphere. Before his design was finalized, Noctis was given a story-inspired, temporary outfit that was used in early trailers.

Since being revealed, Noctis's appearance has been compared with those of other asocial characters in the series. Journalists have positively received Noctis, many of whom noted his growth during the story and contrasted him with other ''Final Fantasy'' protagonists. His appearances in the expanded media of ''Final Fantasy XV'' and other games have prompted multiple types of responses.

==Creation==
===Design===
[[File:FF Versus XIII first trailer screenshot.png|thumb|left|Noctis in the ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'' trailer from 2006; the placeholder outfit was designed by original director [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]
Noctis was created and designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], the original director of ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', which was originally titled ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'' and was planned as a series [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] within the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' sub-series and companion to ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''.<ref name= "XVsummary1"/><ref name="QJnotes"/> Nomura did not want Noctis to look strong but to be used to communicate the story's darkness, which caused some difficulties for the team.<ref name="QJnotes"/> His full name loosely translates from [[Latin]] into "Light of [the] Night Sky";<ref name= "IGNnoctis"/><ref name= "FinalandNomura"/> his nickname ''Noct'' translates as "of the Night".<ref name= "KotakuNoct"/> Noctis' name was not going to be based on the sky or weather, as with previous protagonists Nomura designed. The character was named after [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]], the main protagonist of ''Final Fantasy XIII'', was given a weather-based name.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> This name was a reference to [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], the main protagonist of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series; ''Sora'' and ''Caelum'' both mean "sky" in their respective languages, and Nomura considered Noctis to be his latest "son".<ref name= "FinalandNomura"/>

The character's clothing was designed by Hiromu Takahara, the main designer at Japanese fashion house Roen.<ref name= "FamRoen1"/> Takahara's key inspiration for the clothing's style and coloring was "jet black", which was meant to exemplify and represent of the game's atmosphere. Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the asymmetrical designs that are common to Roen's clothing lines.<ref name= "GemClothing"/> His outfit was designed to make Noctis look as though he went to a high-class [[public house]].<ref name="FamRoen2"/> Roen created a set of real clothes and kept them in the office for reference by the developers; Nomura had been constantly asked by graphic artists which materials his characters' outfits were made from.<ref name= "FinalandNomura"/> A ring later known as the {{nihongo|Ring of the Lucii|光耀の指輪|Kōyō no Yubiwa|lit. "Ring of Radiant Light"}} is central to the game's story; Noctis wears this on his right hand, whereas the gloves he wears are simply for "design purposes".<ref name= "GemClothing"/><ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/> When the game was first revealed, Noctis wore a temporary outfit while his final look was being created.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> The character's temporary clothing was based on the game's script to give a visual impression in trailers.<ref name="FamRoen2"/> Takahara also designed a formal suit for Noctis, which he wears in the original opening section of the game.<ref name= "FamRoen3"/> All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when ''Versus XIII'' was rebranded as ''Final Fantasy XV'' because the team felt the looks should not be changed.<ref name="NovCrysInterview"/>

While the game changed names, platforms and eventually directors, Nomura worked with new director [[Hajime Tabata]] to ensure  Noctis remained as unchanged as possible in the final product.<ref name= "GemTabataInterviews"/> Naora supervised changes to his character model. The main goal was to make Noctis appear realistic; his skin texture was enhanced and subtleties were added to its depiction and the effect of different lighting on it, and elements such as subtle birthmarks and skin blotches were added. One of the major goals was keeping the same character impression while making adjustments and enhancements because series fans already had a concept of the character. His hair shadow effects needed to be adjusted after an upgrade in technology so they did not cast too much shade on his face, while the hairstyle was kept consistent.<ref name="IGNcharacterBehind"/> His hairstyle was meant to look ordered from the front but wild from the rear.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> To make his hair movements realistic, the team worked with a professional hairstylist to create the design using a mannequin's wig, then used the [[Luminous Engine]] to render it in real-time—a technique that was first used for the characters in the engine's 2012 tech demo ''[[Luminous Engine#Agni's Philosophy|Agni's Philosophy]]''.<ref name= "NoctisHair"/>

Noctis's aging during the course of ''Final Fantasy XV'' was major departure from previous Japanese role-playing game protagonists. The developers made the change despite fearing a poor reception from fans; Tabata said it "felt that it was important in communicating [the party's] development and wanting to express it in a way that we only can with the current generation of consoles".<ref name="IGNtenyears"/> When creating the development of Noctis' facial features over time, the team used photographs of war veterans and actors to add fine details to mature the character's expressions. His features were designed to be similar to Regis, reflecting the game's theme of the father-son relationship.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/> Noctis' mature appearance was designed by art co-director [[Yusuke Naora]].<ref name="JPNoctAdult"/><ref name="IGNcharacterBehind"/> A version of Noctis was incorporated into a new post-game version of the [[Yoshitaka Amano]]-designed logo. The logo was included based on a request by Noctis's Japanese voice actor [[Tatsuhisa Suzuki]] to include him.<ref name="book">{{cite book|title=Final Fantasy XV Ultimania Scenario|publisher=Square Enix|year=2017|page=596}}</ref> This combined logo was described as representing both the beginning of a new journey, and the game's development history.<ref name="EuroInterviewPPF"/>

===Attributes===
Since the reveal of ''Versus XIII'', Nomura said the team mainly focused on developing the then-unnamed protagonist's weaponry, later dubbed the {{nihongo|Engine Blade|エンジンブレード|Enjin Burēdo}}, as well as his pose while sitting in the throne.<ref name="FabulaUnveiled"/> Noctis was originally one of four controllable characters in ''Versus XIII'', and is the sole playable character in ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name="Andriasang Nomura"/><ref name= "GemTabataGameplay"/> He is the only character who can use [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning|summoned monsters]], recurring elements in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name= "PolySummons"/> Noctis can manipulate multiple weapons at once; his special technique {{nihongo|"Armiger"|ファントムソード召喚|Fantomu Sōdo Shōkan|lit. "Summon Phantom Swords"}} also enables him to summon crystalline weapons known as {{nihongo|"Royal Arms"|ファントムソード|Fantomu Sōdo|lit. "Phantom Sword"}} into battle.<ref name= "GemTabataGameplay"/><ref name= "XVDuscaeDemo"/> In the story, these powers are passed down through the royal line of Lucis.<ref name= "GemClothing"/> Nomura said while Noctis was overpowered in the first E3 trailer, by the time''Versus XIII'' was drafted, the character was weakened until the player grants Noctis several weapons.<ref name="NomuraRoundup"/> Early in the game's development Noctis was the only character in the world of ''XV'' that could use magic, which would not have worked from a gameplay standpoint so the team engineered it so Noctis' companions could share Noctis' magical abilities.<ref name= "KotakuJump"/> At some points during both story scenes and gameplay, Noctis' eyes, which are normally blue, turn red. This feature was present in both ''Versus XIII'' and ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name= "GemClothing"/><ref name="FamitsuRed"/>

===Personality===
Nomura did not want Noctis to have a personality like [[Squall Leonhart]] or [[Cloud Strife]], the respective protagonists of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII|VII]]'', defining their personality type as that of "a silent, gloomy little boy". Nomura wanted to create a realistic character type that had not yet been seen in the ''Final Fantasy''. Nomura was wary about the character because he was new to the series and might fall "out of bounds". To avoid interfering with player empathy, earlier protagonists did not have strong personalities. Nomura wanted Noctis to have "an overabundance of idiosyncrasy" so he would leave an impression on the player.<ref name="Famitsu1001"/> Nomura also wanted the character to perform actions that bore both heroic and villainous traits, creating someone akin to an [[anti-hero]]. He thought these qualities would match the game's themes very well.<ref name="XVthemes"/> Noctis hides his shyness under a cold exterior, through which his close friends can see.<ref name= "IGNnoctis"/> A key scene in ''Versus XIII'' that demonstrates his personality  is his first meeting with Stella Nox Fleuret, the game's original hero.<ref name="NoctisScene"/> Tabata wanted gamers to immerse themselves in Noctis' character by learning everything from his point of view. Some scenes might be confusing to both the player and his avatar.<ref name="XVpolygonSeason2"/> The choice of the game's theme song, a cover of [[Ben E. King]]'s "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" performed by [[Florence and the Machine]], was meant as a message of gratitude from Noctis, which he is unable to express in words.<ref name="JPstand"/> While also caring for his teammates, Noctis relates to Talcott Hester, a side character in the narrative, due to their parallels.<ref name="interkot"/>

The bond between Noctis and his father, and the Regalia and its representation in the story of ''Final Fantasy XV'', was important to Tabata, according to whom children in Japan are proud of their father's car; it is a "big thing" to go on a ride and have one's father explain the car's functions. Tabata listed this as a wonderful experience from his childhood and wanted to present it in the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spieletester.com/specials/final-fantasy-xv-interview-mit-hajime-tabata/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601052949/http://www.spieletester.com/specials/final-fantasy-xv-interview-mit-hajime-tabata/|archivedate=June 1, 2016|accessdate=February 12, 2022|title=FINAL FANTASY XV – INTERVIEW MIT HAJIME TABATA}}</ref> According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and reserved exterior stem from his lonely childhood and a fear of losing those closest to him. His words and actions stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to fulfill expectations and bring people happiness.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/> When comparing the personalities of Noctis and [[Lunafreya Nox Fleuret]], Tabata said Noctis as the weaker of the two, and that Noctis needs protection instead of her.<ref name= "GIpersonality"/> Noctis' transition from prince to king is a key part of the narrative.<ref name="XVtabataBits"/> According to scenario writer Saori Itamuro, Noctis faces the future as king with both dread and acceptance, having been raised to expect such an event. This part of his story influenced aspects of his appearance.<ref name="XVguideCollect2"/> Noctis' fate to battle the antagonist is a major tragedy because while Noctis defeats his nemesis, he dies in the aftermath, reuniting with Luna in the afterlife.<ref name="interkot"/> Accordin to the developers, the rivalry between Noctis and Ardyn rivalry is unusual in the franchise because the two initially are on friendly terms despite the development of their hatred for each other.<ref name="book"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Final Fantasy XV: The Complete Official Guide Collector's Edition|publisher=Piggyback Interactive|year=2016|page=330|isbn=978-1-9110-1500-0}}</ref>

===Voice actors and localization===
Suzuki voiced Noctis as an adult, with Miyuki Satō  portraying him as a child.<ref name="BtVAnoctis"/> Suzuki was cast in 2009, seven years before the game's final release, when the project still had the ''Versus XIII'' name.<ref name="XVsuzuki"/><ref name="GWIsuzuki"/> When he was first voicing the character, Suzuki said Noctis was far more introverted, speaking with a gruff manner and showing little sympathy for those beyond his immediate circle. When the project was retitled ''Final Fantasy XV'', Suzuki worked with the production team to create a new persona for Noctis, who became more outgoing and emotional.<ref name="FamitsuSuzuki"/> Suzuki recorded his lines for the game with the rest of the main cast.<ref name="BrotherhoodSuzuki"/> Suzuki modeled Noctis' persona on the stage mannerisms of [[Kurt Cobain]], former lead singer of the grunge band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name="VentureNoctis"/> While he did not do continuous work on the game due to the production's "twists and turns", he found himself constantly keeping Noctis in mind so he could easily portray him in recording sessions.<ref name="XVsuzuki"/> According to Suzuki, some of the recordings he made for ''Versus XIII'' were used in ''Final Fantasy XV''.<ref name="GWIsuzuki"/>  When playing Noctis for the anime series ''[[Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV]]'', Suzuki talked with the main cast, with whom he had established a good rapport, about shifting their portrayals for the altered storytelling medium.<ref name="BrotherhoodSuzuki"/>

Localization lead writer Dan Inoue's English-language interpretation of the character is based by Suzuki's influence.<ref name="VentureNoctis"/> Inoue wanted to avoid creating a generic "emo" role-playing lead but he knew Noctis was struggling with his role in the world. Inoue used musician [[Kurt Cobain]] as a model for Noctis, who would act like "a rockstar who spurns the spotlight". Inoue said Square Enix devised a model for conversational chemistry between the group of friends who are the main party in ''Final Fantasy XV''. This model included a complex diagram of the characters' relationships with each other and a series of linguistic techniques to make the dialogue between them feel natural, including [[nonverbal communication]] and what Inoue calls "Sorkinization"—each line picking up on the words of the previous one, which he compared to dialogue written by [[Aaron Sorkin]].<ref name="PolyCorbin"/>

For the English localization, Noctis is voiced by [[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]] as an adult and by Hyrum Hansen as a child.<ref name="BtVAnoctis"/> Speaking about his role, Chase was told rather than create an English version of the Japanese performance outside a few select scenes, Chase was to make a performance that would resonate with Western audiences, resulting in Noctis' English version being noticeably different from the Japanese one.<ref name="DTnoctis"/> If anything seemed wrong, localization directors Inoue and Keythe Farley would have Chase re-record his dialogue.<ref name="DTnoctis"/><ref name="RPGFchase"/> Noctis was Chase's first ''Final Fantasy'' character and his first lead role in a video game project. He was initially shocked when he was told what character he would be voicing.<ref name="RPGFchase"/> Group recording sessions were discontinued because developers needed to match the timings of English dialogue and the Japanese performances.<ref name="DTnoctis"/> The game's opening scene, in which Noctis sets out on his journey, is the only one that was recorded with several English-speaking actors together.<ref name="RPGFchase"/>

English voice work was included for ''Episode Duscae'' but it was cut close in terms of production scheduling. During the [[Read only memory|ROM]]-checking stage, Tabata felt the performance was wrong for the character, an opinion reflected in player feedback after the demo's release, but it was too late to re-record. Tabata said the original performance made the character sound too old, comparing it negatively to [[Batman]]. After release, the voice work was redone to show the character's youth and charm, along with his "sense of ennui".<ref name= "NoctisEnglish"/> Due to the feedback from ''Episode Duscae'' recasting Noctis was considered, but instead Chase worked with the localization team to find a different voice for Noctis. After putting together a demo reel of Chase performing a variety of lines, Tabata chose the one he thought best suited the character. According to Chase, the most emotional part of the original recording was Noctis's final farewell to his comrades during a post-credit scene, which for him symbolized saying goodbye to the localization team. Noctis's scene on his throne at the end of the game needed re-recording; originally sounding on the point of tears, the dialogue was re-recorded to emphasize Noctis's resolve.<ref name="LifestreamChase"/>

== Appearances ==
===''Final Fantasy XV''===
Noctis Lucis Caelum is the only son and heir of King Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII of Lucis. The Caelum dynasty safeguards the Crystal, a artifact connected to the Astrals, god-like protectors for the world of Eos.<ref name="Famitsu 1281"/><ref name="KingsglaivePromotional"/> When he was five years old,<ref name="XVguideCollect1"/> the Crystal chose Noctis as the "True King", a prophesied figure who would purge Eos of the Starscourge, a plague that will trigger eternal darkness on Eos and turns living things into monstrous Daemons. At eight years old, Noctis is attacked by a Daemon and is sent to the nation of Tenebrae for healing, where he meets and bonds with its princess Lunafreya. Noctis and Regis are forced to flee Tenebrae when it is attacked by the Niflheim Empire. By the time of the events of ''Final Fantasy XV'', Niflheim has besieged Lucis and Regis agrees to a ceasefire. As part of the treaty, Noctis will marry Lunafreya; Regis dispatches him to Altissia where they are to be married. Following Noctis' departure, Niflheim attacks Lucis' capital Insomnia, steals the Crystal and kills Regis. Noctis, with his companions and sworn protectors [[Characters of Final Fantasy XV#Gladiolus Amicitia|Gladiolus Amicitia]], [[Prompto Argentum]] and [[Ignis Scientia]], sets out on a quest to retrieve the Crystal and defeat Niflheim.<ref name= "XVsummary1"/><ref name="XVsummary2"/>

To fulfill his role, Noctis collects the Royal Arms—weapons of the ancient Lucian monarchs—from tombs across Lucis, and gains the blessing of the Astrals. He is in turn aided remotely by Lunafreya, and in person by her attendant Gentiana, and Niflheim's chancellor [[Ardyn Izunia]].<ref name="QUOTEXVchap2"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap4"/> Ardyn is later revealed to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, immortal older brother of Noctis's ancestor Somnus, who swore revenge on both the Crystal and Somnus's bloodline when corrupted by the Starscourge.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap13"/> Noctis gains the favor of the Astrals Titan and Ramuh,<ref name="QUOTEXVchap4"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap5"/> but Ardyn mortally wounds Lunafreya and disrupts the ritual to summon Leviathan. With a last effort, Lunafreya helps Noctis subdue the rampaging Leviathan before giving him the Ring of the Lucii, an artifact through which he can access the Crystal's magic.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap9"/> Burdened by the loss of Lunafreya and tormented by Ardyn, Noctis heads for Niflheim's capital Gralea.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap10"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap11"/><ref name="QUOTEXVchap12"/>

Arriving in Gralea to find its population turned into Daemons, Noctis finds and is pulled into the Crystal, where he learns from the Astral Bahamut that he combine his power with the Astrals and the Crystal to destroy the Starscourge, the price being his life.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap13"/> Ten years later, Noctis awakens and reunites with his companions; they travel to Insomnia where they defeat the rogue Astral Ifrit and the enslaved Lucii before facing Ardyn. After defeating Ardyn in the physical world, Noctis sacrifices himself to fulfill his role as the True King by purging the Starscourge, destroying Ardyn's spirit in the afterlife with the aid of the Lucii. In the game's mid-credits and post-credit scenes, Noctis confesses his feelings for his friends during a rest before the final battle, and reunites with Lunafreya in the afterlife.<ref name="QUOTEXVchap14"/>

===''Final Fantasy XV''-related appearances===
Noctis is one of the main characters in ''Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV'', an [[original net animation]] that follows his early life and the story of his companions.<ref name="FamEngBrotherhood"/> The animation tells the story of Noctis and those of his companions from his childhood to the game's opening.
