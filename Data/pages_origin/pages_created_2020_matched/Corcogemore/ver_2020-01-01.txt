==Naming==

{{lang-ga|Corcóg}} is the Irish name for a "beehive", although it can also mean cone (the shape of a traditional beehive).<ref name="peak"/>

Cartographer [[Tim Robinson (cartographer)|Tim Robinson]] noted that "the Ordnance Survey has been incorrectly calling this mountain 'Leckavrea' for a hundred and fifty years", with [[Lackavrea|Leckavrea]] ({{lang-ga|Leic Aimhréidh}}) being a mountain to the east of Corcogemore.<ref name="peak"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Corcogemore (l), Mullach Glas (c) & Binn Mhor (r) from the North.jpg|thumb|Corcogemore (l), [[Mullach Glas]] (c), and [[Binn Mhor]] (r) from the North]]
Corcogemore  lies on a small massif in the southeast sector of the Maumturks range, which is separated from the main range by a deep east-west mountain pass called [[Máméan]], a site of pilgrimage dedicated to [[Saint Patrick]] since the 5th-century.<ref name="Dillon49"/><ref name="it1">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/pilgrims-head-to-connemara-hills-for-annual-walk-1.2746287|title=Pilgrims head to Connemara hills for annual walk|author=Éanna Ó Caolla | date=5 August 2016 | accessdate=2 August 2019| quote=The site, which is also associated with the pagan Lughnasa Solstice festivals, features a holy well and a Mass Rock (Carraig an Aifrinn) which was used during the repressive penal times when isolated locations were used to host religious ceremonies.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ouririshheritage.org/content/archive/place/miscellaneous-place/mamean-pilgrimage|title=Máméan Pilgrimage|publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]]|quote=High up the slopes of the Maum Turk Mountains in Connemara there is a natural passage-way known as Máméan (pass of the birds).  At the summit of this rugged track you will find an ancient pilgrim site dedicated to St. Patrick.}}</ref>

To the west, along a high winding ridge across this massif is [[Mullach Glas]] {{convert|432|m|ft}}, and then [[Binn Mhór]] {{convert|661|m|ft}}.<ref name="Paul16"/>

To the east of Corcogemore, apart from the massif and across the [[R336 road (Ireland)|R336 road]], which runs through the pass of {{lang-ga|Mám Aodha}}, is the isolated Maumturk peak of [[Lackavrea]] {{convert|396|m|ft}}.<ref name="peak"/><ref name="Paul16" />

==Hill walking==

The most straightforward route to the summit Corcogemore is the 5-kilometre 2-3 hour roundtrip route from the R336 road, just after [[Maam Cross]], and back; however, because of its positioning on a high ridge of its own small massif, it can also be climbed as an alternative 10-kilometre 4–5 hour route from Corcogemore in the west, across Mullach Glas, to the summit of Binn Mhór, and then finishing down at Máméan (i.e. the route requires two cars).<ref name="Paul16"/>

Corcogemore is also climbed as part of the ''Maamturks Challenge'', a 25-kilometre 10–12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from [[Maam Cross]] to [[Leenaun]]), which is considered one of the "great classic ridge-walks of Ireland",<ref name="Dillon49">{{cite book | last1 = Dillion | first1 = Paddy | title = The Mountains of Ireland: A Guide to Walking the Summits | publisher = Cicerone | isbn = 978-1852841102 | year = 1993 |quote="Walk 49: Corcogemore, Mullach Glas, Binn Mhór, Binn Chaonaigh, Binn idir an Dá Log, Letterbreckaun, Leenaun Hill}}</ref><ref name="Helenf">{{cite book | last1 = Fairbairn | first1 = Helen | url=https://www.amazon.com/Irelands-Best-Walks-Walking-Guides/dp/184889211X | accessdate=1 August 2019 | title = Ireland's Best Walks: A Walking Guide | publisher = Collins Press | isbn = 978-1848892118 | year = 2014 | quote=Route 36: The Central Maumturks – South}}</ref> but of "extreme grade" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent.<ref name="Paul16">{{cite book | author=Paul Phelan | year=2011 | title=Connemara & Mayo - A Walking Guide: Mountain, Coastal & Island Walks | publisher=Collins Press | isbn=978-1848891029 | quote=Route 16: Corkóg}}</ref>  Since 1975, the [[University College Galway]] Mountaineering Club has run the annual "Maamturks Challenge Walk" (MCW),<ref name="UCG">{{cite web|url=http://nuigmc.com/maamturks/about/|title=The Maumturks Challenge | publisher=[[University College Galway]] Mountaineering Club (UCGMC) | accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref> and mans a checkpoint on Corcogemore, which is the first major checkpoint on the Maumturks range.<ref name="simon">{{cite web|url=http://www.simonstewart.ie/Turks/mt1.htm | publisher=[[MountainViews Online Database]]|author=Simon Stewart|accessdate=2 August 2019|title=Maumturks Challenge Section 1: Corcog to Mamean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nuigmc.com/maamturks/route/|title=Maaumturks Challenge: The Route | publisher=[[University College Galway]] Mountaineering Club (UCGMC) | accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>
