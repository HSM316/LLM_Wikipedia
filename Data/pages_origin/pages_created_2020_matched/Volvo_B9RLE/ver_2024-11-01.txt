The '''Volvo B9RLE''' is a 9.4-litre engined [[multi-axle bus|tri-axle]] [[low-entry bus|low-entry]] [[single-decker bus]] and [[double-decker bus]] chassis manufactured by [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]] between 2010 and 2013. The double-decker was available in either closed top or [[open top bus|open top]] form. It was introduced as an interim replacement for the soon to be discontinued [[Volvo B12BLE|B12BLE]] in the short gap of years before they had the [[Euro VI]] compliant [[Volvo B8RLE|B8RLE]] ready. At the same time they introduced a tri-axle variant of the [[Volvo B7RLE|B7RLE]], but in Volvo's home markets the 290&nbsp;bhp that the D7E produces is considered insufficient for a 15-metre bus.

The most likely reason for introducing the B9RLE a whole year before the end of production for the B12BLE was for the introduction of the first prototypes of the [[Volvo 8900|Volvo 8900LE]] in late 2010, which was also the body that most B9RLE received. Some were also bodied as [[open-top bus|open top]] [[double-decker bus|double-decker]] [[sightseeing bus]]es with the [[Unvi Urbis 2.5 DD]] body.

In [[Sweden]]<ref>[http://www.svenskbusshistoria.se/asp/search/dosearch.asp?svalue=volvo+b9rle&SearchView=advView&orderby=arsmodell&OrderByDir=1&maxhits=25 Volvo B9RLE (search result)] Svensk Busshistoria</ref> a total of 145 were built as [[Volvo 8900|8900LE]] [[Low-entry bus|low-entry]] [[city bus]]es to various customers, like [[Nettbuss]] and [[Nobina Sverige]], and 7 Unvi-bodied sightseeing buses. In Norway [[Boreal Transport]] received 10 as [[Volvo 8900|8900LE]] for [[Stavanger]] and [[Nobina Norge]] received 27 (including a prototype from 2010) for [[Tromsø]]. Also a Unvi-bodied [[open-top bus|open top sightseeing bus]] was delivered to [[Oslo]].
