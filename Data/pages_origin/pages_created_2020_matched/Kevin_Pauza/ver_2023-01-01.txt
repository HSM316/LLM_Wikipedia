===Disciplinary actions and charges of malpractice===
In 2013 Pauza was reprimanded by and entered into a disciplinary agreement with the Texas State Medical Board. The Medical Board found that Pauza failed to meet expected standards of care, failed to follow the board's guidelines for the treatment of pain, failed to keep adequate medical records and failed to cooperate with board staff.<ref>{{Cite news|title=2 local doctors reprimanded by state board|work=Tyler Morning Telegraph|date=2013-09-13|url=https://tylerpaper.com/news/local/2-local-doctors-reprimanded-by-state-board/article_ab599338-6d2c-5dad-a8fc-c542f21ba082.html|language=en|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref> Two years later the Board extended the order, after it "found Dr. Pauza’s medical records for the patient at issue were inadequate and that Dr. Pauza’s stated rationale for prescribing a medication as a sleep aid and for treating the patient with corticosteroid injections after a five-year treatment hiatus were inadequate."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tyler doctor among 40 disciplined by medical board|work=Tyler Morning Telegraph|date=2015-06-25|url=https://tylerpaper.com/news/local/tyler-doctor-among-disciplined-by-medical-board/article_86f30778-bb63-5850-bf7c-fdc7c250affd.html|language=en|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref> In 2018 he was reprimanded again for failing to document his rationale behind a diagnosis of lumbar disc pain and lumbar radiculopathy, and for failing to document either that he had considered simpler and less invasive treatment options for the patient than the procedure he performed, or that his patient had chosen to forego conventional treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmb.state.tx.us/dl/547A504C-2D9B-C84D-8E9B-9D8306FA9877|title=TMB disciplines 35 physicians at August meeting, adopts rules changes|last=Schneider|first=Jarrett|date=September 10, 2018|website=Texas Medical Board|access-date=2020-07-11|page=3}}</ref> In both incidents he was required to take remedial education in risk management and related subjects.
