'''Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland''' ({{lang-da|Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank}}) is a [[Listed buildings in Aarhus Municipality|listed]] building and a former Danish [[bank]] in [[Aarhus]].

== History ==
In 1870 the firm [[David B. Adler|D.B. Adler & Co.]], based in [[Copenhagen]] acquired the business and bank company ''Adler, Wulff & Meyer'', based in Aarhus. The new company was turned into a [[Kommanditselskab]] structure and in October 1874 the Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank A/S company was formed with Christian Ludvig Kier as president until 1876 when it became a subsidiary of the Copenhagen Business Bank, under its own name for many years, effectively functioning as a branch. From 1921 NIels Jensen became director of the branch and later the assistant director of Copenhagen Business Bank in 1934 and the vice-president in 1948.<ref name="XUwop" />

In 1944 the branch was moved to ''Rådhuspladsen'' and in 1990 the Copenhagen Business Bank, ''Danske Bank'' and ''Provinsbanken'' merged to form [[Danske Bank]]. The logo of the Copenhagen Business Bank was in use until the year of 2000 but the name and logo of Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank was decommissioned.

== Architecture ==
Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank was situated on [[Lille Torv]] in Aarhus, in a building drawn by architect [[Sophus Frederik Kühnel]], constructed in 1899–1900 and [[Listed buildings in Aarhus Municipality|listed]] in 1996 by the [[Danish Heritage Agency]]. The building is mainly inspired by Italian [[renaissance architecture]] with elements of the [[national romantic style]].<ref name="KultLand" />

The building is in 3 floors and sits on an inwardly leaning base of quarried granite [[ashlar]] topped with a bright profile strip. The outer walls of the ground floor is also granite ashlar but in different colors while red bricks are used on the upper floors and the low roof. The ashlar and brick sections are broken by a [[cornice]] and the brick section is topped with a heavy [[corbel]] cornice. The windows are framed in [[sandstone]] with twin arches above and rope ornaments on the [[Window sill|sills]] below. The roof is [[Hip roof#Half-hip roof|half-hipped]] and topped with glazed tile. The interior features a marble stairwell with wrought iron railing and patterned masonry.<ref name="MhZN8" /><ref name="KultLand" />

The building remains close to original condition with the only major change being a new the window towards [[Vestergade, Aarhus|Vestergade]] being changed to a door when a shop moved in, in 2008, and ground floor windows having been replaced. The walls, columns, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], panels and decorations are generally intact and original.<ref name="KultLand" />
