In [[predicate logic]], '''existential generalization'''<ref>{{cite book |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |url=https://archive.org/details/studyguidetoacco00burc |url-access=registration |last=Hurley |first=Patrick  |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing }}</ref> (also known as '''existential introduction''', '''âˆƒI''') is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] that allows one to move from a specific statement, or one instance, to a quantified generalized statement, or [[existential quantification|existential proposition]]. In [[first-order logic]], it is often used as a rule for the [[existential quantifier]] (<math>\exists</math>) in formal proofs.

Example: "Rover loves to wag his tail. Therefore, something loves to wag its tail."

In the [[Fitch notation|Fitch-style calculus]]:

:<math> Q(a) \to\ \exists{x}\, Q(x)</math>

Where <math>a</math> replaces all free instances of <math>x</math> within <math>Q(x)</math>.<ref>pg. 347. [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]], ''Language proof and logic'' Second Ed., CSLI Publications, 2008.</ref>

== Quine ==
According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[universal instantiation]] and existential generalization are two aspects of a single principle, for instead of saying that <math>\forall x \, x=x</math> implies <math>\text{Socrates}=\text{Socrates}</math>, we could as well say that the denial <math>\text{Socrates} \ne \text{Socrates}</math> implies <math>\exists x \, x \ne x</math>. The principle embodied in these two operations is the link between [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]]s and the singular statements that are related to them as instances. Yet it is a principle only by courtesy. It holds only in the case where a term names and, furthermore, occurs [[Reference#Semantics|referentially]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Willard Van Orman Quine |author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|author2=Roger F.
