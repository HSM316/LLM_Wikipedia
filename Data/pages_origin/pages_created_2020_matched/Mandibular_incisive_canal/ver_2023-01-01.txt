The '''mandibular incisive canal''' is a [[bone|bony]] canal within the anterior [[human mandible|mandible]] that runs [[Bilateral symmetry|bilateral]]ly from the [[mental foramen|mental foramina]] usually to the region of the [[ipsilateral]] [[lateral incisor]] teeth. After branching into the [[mental nerve]] that exits the foramen of the same name, the [[inferior alveolar nerve]] continues anteriorly within the mandibular incisive canal as the incisive nerve, providing innervation to the mandibular first [[premolar]], [[canine tooth|canine]] and lateral and [[central incisor]]s.<ref name="Greenstein">Greenstein, G; Cavallaro, J; [[Dennis Tarnow|Tarnow, D]]. "Practical Application of Anatomy for the Dental Implant Surgeon," ''J Perio'' 2008;79:1833-1846</ref>  The mandibular incisive nerve either terminates as nerve endings within the anterior teeth or adjacent bone, or may join nerve endings that enter through the tiny [[lingual foramen]].

The incisive canal is typically found within the middle third of the mandible in an [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|apico-coronal]] dimension, reaching the midline 18% of the time.<ref>Mraiwa, N.
