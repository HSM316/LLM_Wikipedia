'''SM ''UC-74'''''{{#tag:ref|"SM" stands for "Seiner Majestät" ({{lang-en|His Majesty's}}) and combined with the ''U'' for ''Unterseeboot'' would be translated as ''His Majesty's Submarine''.|group=Note}} was a German [[German Type UC II submarine|Type UC II]] [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] in the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. The U-boat was ordered on 12 January 1916 and was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launch]]ed on 19 October 1916. She was [[Ship commissioning|commission]]ed into the German Imperial Navy on 26 November 1916 as SM ''UC-74''. In ten patrols ''UC-74'' was credited with sinking 37 ships, either by torpedo or by [[naval mines|mines]] laid. ''UC-74'' was interned at [[Barcelona]] on 21 November 1918 when she ran out of fuel. The U-boat was surrendered to France on 26 March 1919 and was [[ship breaking|broken up]] at [[Toulon]] in July 1921.<ref name=UC-74 />

==Design==
A [[German Type UC II submarine]], ''UC-74'' had a displacement of {{convert|410|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|493|t|LT}} while submerged. She had a [[length overall]] of {{convert|50.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (ship)|beam]] of {{convert|5.22|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|3.65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines each producing {{convert|290|-|300|PS|kW shp}} (a total of {{convert|580|-|600|PS|kW shp}}), two [[electric motor]]s producing {{convert|620|PS|kW shp}}, and two [[propeller shaft]]s. She had a dive time of 30 seconds and was capable of operating at a depth of {{convert|50|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=31-32}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|11.8|kn}} and a submerged speed of {{convert|7.3|kn}}. When submerged, she could operate for {{convert|52|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8660 to 10230|nmi}} at {{convert|7|kn}}. ''UC-74'' was fitted with six {{convert|100|cm}} mine tubes, eighteen UC 200 mines, three {{convert|50|cm}} [[torpedo tube]]s (one on the stern and two on the bow), seven torpedoes, and one [[8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} Uk L/30]] [[deck gun]]. Her [[Ship's company|complement]] was twenty-six crew members.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=31-32}}
