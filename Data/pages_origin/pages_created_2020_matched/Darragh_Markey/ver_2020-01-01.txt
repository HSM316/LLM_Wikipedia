===St Patrick's Athletic===
====2015 season====
Ahead of the [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] senior team's [[2015 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2015 season]], Markey was called up to the first team for the season, given the number 21 shirt, he would also remain with the under 19's while still eligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=6600|title=2015 Squad No's Announced|website=www.stpatsfc.com}}</ref> He made his first team debut on 9 February 2015, aged just 17 years old, when he came off the bench in a 7–0 win at home to [[Tolka Rovers F.C.|Tolka Rovers]] in the [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/matches/detail/27414/2/|title=Extratime.ie - Live Updates - 2015 Leinster Senior Cup Fourth Round - St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Tolka Rovers|website=www.extratime.ie}}</ref> Markey made late substitute appearances in the [[President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] away to [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] and the first game of the [[2015 League of Ireland Premier Division]] season away to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], his first [[Derbies in the League of Ireland|Dublin Derby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/report.php?report=668|title=Dundalk (2) - St Patrick's Athletic (1)|website=www.stpatsfc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/matches/detail/27207/2/|title=Extratime.ie - Live Updates - 2015 League of Ireland Premier Division - Shamrock Rovers -v- St. Patrick's Athletic|website=www.extratime.ie}}</ref> Markey went on to make a further 5 appearances in the first team that season.

====2016 season====
In January 2016, Markey went on trial with [[Scottish Premier League]] champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], scoring in a trial game vs [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/other-soccer/st-pats-teen-darragh-markey-18-scores-on-celtic-trial-34350418.html|title=St Pat's teen Darragh Markey (18) scores on Celtic trial|website=Independent.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3909/airtricity-premier-division/2016/01/11/19203512/st-patricks-athletic-youth-darragh-markey-impresses-in|title=St Patrick's Athletic youth Darragh Markey impresses in Celtic trial - Goal.com|first=Ryan|last=Kelly|website=www.goal.com}}</ref> Nothing came of the move as Markey decided to take up the scholarship offer between St Pat's and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUI Maynooth]], taking up a degree in finance at the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/league-of-ireland-u21-player-of-the-year-interview-2986356-Sep2016/|title=One of Irish football's most promising youngsters on studying finance and trials with Celtic|first=Paul|last=Fennessy|website=The42}}</ref> In order to secure the degree, Markey would have to get the necessary points on his [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Cert]], which he sat in June 2016. With the importance of his studies having to come before his football, the first half of 2016 turned out to be less productive for Markey as he made 7 league appearances and two league cup appearances that season (all 9 coming on from the substitutes bench) as Pat's won the [[2016 League of Ireland Cup|2016 League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.ie/domestic/news/st-pats-retain-ea-sports-cup-after-thrilling-final|title=St Pat's retain EA SPORTS Cup after thrilling final - Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}</ref>

He was nominated for the [[League of Ireland Premier Division Player of the Month]] for May 2017 but just lost out to [[Ryan Delaney (Irish footballer)|Ryan Delaney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/league-of-ireland-swai-player-of-the-month-premier-division-nominees-3442465-Jun2017/|title=The nominees for May's League of Ireland Player of the Month have been announced|first=Aaron|last=Gallagher|website=The42}}</ref> He went on to make a total of 18 league appearances, 22 in all competitions and his form in those games saw him voted as [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] Young Player of the Year by the club's fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=7645|title=2017 Awards Night Winners|website=www.stpatsfc.com}}</ref>
