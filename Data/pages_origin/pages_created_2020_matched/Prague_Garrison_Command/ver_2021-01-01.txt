The '''Prague Garrison Command'''  ({{lang-cz|Pražské velitelství}}) is the primary military area command of the [[Army of the Czech Republic]] tasked for the defense and security of [[Prague]], the capital city of the [[Czech Republic]]. It is currently under the leadership of Colonel Milan Virt, with Captain Eva Cajthamlova acting as its spokeswoman. The Prague Garrison Command currently bears the honorary title of ''Unit of [[Prague Uprising]]''.

==History==
The [[Prague]] garrison's history is closely associated with the city's military history. The first fortified [[Prague]] military garrison was established in 1621, making it the oldest in the area that is now the [[Czech Republic]], and one of the oldest in [[Europe]]. The first commander of this garrison was Generalissimus [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], the [[Waldstein family|Prince of Waldstein]] and the Duke of Frydlant. In centuries that followed, the Prague garrison had become the most important military garrison in the country and since 1918 it was the central seat of the military leadership of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|ČSSR]]. After a military reorganisation of the armed forces took place on April 1, 2004, the Garrison Command of Prague was formed and was made the center of the armed forces garrison commands.<ref name="army">{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/en/ministry-of-defence/newsroom/video-gallery/honours-and-tones/garrison-command-of-prague-39027/|title=Garrison Command of Prague &#124; Ministry of Defence & Armed Forces of the Czech Republic|website=army.cz|accessdate=2018-09-26}}</ref>
