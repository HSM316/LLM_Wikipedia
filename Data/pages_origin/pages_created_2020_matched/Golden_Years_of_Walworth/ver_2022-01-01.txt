==History==
Vic Carbrey began building the Golden Years of Walworth in 1960 at the age of 80. He finished in 1965 and the building was opened as an intermediate care facility with a 26-bed capacity. In 1969, Carbrey sold the facility to Eugene and Margaret Austin. In 1980, their son, Rich Austin, purchased the facility with his wife, Linda, and they currently continue to own and operate the Golden Years of Walworth as a [[privately held company]].<ref name="10-27-11">As of October 27, 2011.</ref>

Golden Years of Walworth added 30 independent living units in 1984, and five years later, increased the number of units to 54. In 1993, they added a skilled nursing wing to accommodate 26 beds. Currently, the Golden Years of Walworth has 60 units for independent living, 27 for assisted living and 28 beds for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] certified skilled nursing care.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Ginny |url=http://walworthcountytoday.com/weblogs/mystery-place/2011/apr/20/golden-years-continues-grow-and-serve/ |title="Golden Years continues to grow and serve" by Mystery Place |publisher=Walworth County Today |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425113028/http://walworthcountytoday.com/weblogs/mystery-place/2011/apr/20/golden-years-continues-grow-and-serve/ |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenyearsofwalworth.com/about/history/ |title=Our Heritage |publisher=Golden Years of Walworth |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>
