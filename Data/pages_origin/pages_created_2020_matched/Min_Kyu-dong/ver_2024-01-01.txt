'''Min Kyu-dong''' (born September 12, 1970) is a South Korean [[film director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer|producer]]. He made his feature directorial debut in horror film ''[[Memento Mori (film)|Memento Mori]]'' (1999), followed by [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]] ''[[All for Love (2005 film)|All for Love]]'' (2005) and ''[[All About My Wife]]'' (2012), queer films ''[[Antique (film)|Antique]]'' (2008) and ''[[In My End Is My Beginning]]'' (2013), melodrama ''The Last Blossom'' (2011), and period drama ''[[The Treacherous]]'' (2015).

==Career==
Min Kyu-dong studied economics at [[Seoul National University]], and upon graduation, he entered the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). In 1999 Min made his first feature ''[[Memento Mori (film)|Memento Mori]]'', alongside KAFA classmate and co-director [[Kim Tae-yong]]. Considered the most influential Korean horror film of the 2000s, ''Memento Mori'' has attained a modern-day classic status among Korean [[cinephile]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=An Interview with Kim Tae-yong|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kimty.html|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=Koreanfilm.org|date=23 May 2007}}</ref>

After pursuing further film studies in France, Min returned in 2005 with his sophomore effort and solo directorial debut ''[[All for Love (2005 film)|All for Love]]''. Similar to [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Short Cuts]]'' and [[Richard Curtis]]'s ''[[Love Actually]]'', Min utilized a large ensemble cast to weave a multitude of stories into a single narrative. About a diverse group of couples and singles who experience love or tragedy in the span of one week in Seoul (the Korean title translates to "The Most Beautiful Week of My Life"), the film was a box office success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=All for Love|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm05.html#allforlove|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> 
 
In 2008, Min explored [[homoeroticism|homosexual eroticism]] in ''[[Antique (film)|Antique]]'', a screen adaptation of the popular Japanese [[manga]] ''[[Antique Bakery]]'' by [[Fumi Yoshinaga]]. The film, about four pretty boys with hidden pasts working in a [[Pâtisserie|French pastry shop]], was invited to the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Antique |url=http://www.finecut.co.kr/renew/library/director.asp?num=83 |work=Finecut |accessdate=2012-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413143738/http://www.finecut.co.kr/renew/library/director.asp?num=83 |archivedate=2014-04-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Film Antique to Visit Berlin Film Festival|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/01/141_38158.html|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=20 January 2009}}</ref>

For his segment in the 2009 [[anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Five Senses of Eros]]'', Min continued his fascination with [[queer cinema]]. Using illusive and phantasmal cinematography, he brought a more experimental and dramatically edgy take on two women involved in a mild [[sadomasochism|S&M]] relationship after the death of the man they both loved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=5 Directors Explore Sensuality in Eros|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/07/141_47842.html|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=2 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shin|first=Hae-in|title=A mixed bag of pleasures in omnibus Eros film|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2009/07/01/17/0703000000AEN20090701000900315F.HTML|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Yonhap]]|date=1 July 2009}}</ref> A feature-length [[director's cut]] of ''[[In My End Is My Beginning]]'' was later screened at the 2009 [[Busan International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=In My End is My Beginning|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941477/|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=27 October 2009}}</ref> then released in theaters in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Hyun-min|title=Fatal Love, Hatred and Sympathy - In My End Is My Beginning|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=2331|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2013-03-22|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Film adaptation|Based]] on the semi-[[autobiographical]] [[Korean drama|TV series]] by writer [[Noh Hee-kyung]] (previously adapted into a [[novelization|novel]] and a [[stage play]], the Korean title translates to "The Most Beautiful Goodbye/Farewell in the World"), Min confessed that he "cried a lot while writing the screenplay" of ''The Last Blossom''. A moving story of a devoted mother diagnosed with a terminal illness whose family comes together for the first time to give her the support they've always denied her, the film received rave reviews from moviegoers and critics for its delicate depiction of family love.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Hyo-jin|title=The Most Beautiful Farewell in the World|url=http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1506|work=Worldyan News|accessdate=2013-02-10|date=6 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125326/http://www.worldyannews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1506|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ki|first=Sun-min|title=Portrait of iconic mother still resonates|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2936314|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=19 May 2011|url-status=usurped|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130126215207/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2936314|archivedate=26 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, Min wrote and directed a [[remake]] of the [[Argentinean]] film ''[[Un novio para mi mujer]]'' ("A Boyfriend for My Wife"), which centers on a timid husband who hires a professional Casanova to seduce his seemingly perfect but fearsome wife. The romantic comedy ''[[All About My Wife]]'' became Min's biggest commercial hit yet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jung |first=Hyun-mok |title=Director Min Kyu-dong says it's all about communication |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2954200 |accessdate=2012-11-19 |work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]] |date=11 June 2012 |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617185017/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2954200 |archivedate=17 June 2012 }}</ref>

Inspired by the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', Min directed the wrap-around sequences that "introduce" each segment by bridging the four [[short film]]s of [[anthology film|omnibus]] ''[[Horror Stories (film)|Horror Stories]]'' with a tale about a kidnapper who can go to sleep only when he listens to scary stories from his young female victim.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hye-ji|title=PREVIEW: ''Horror Stories'' Return of authentic Korean horror film|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012072022244577997|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=10Asia|date=20 July 2012}}</ref> ''Horror Stories'' was the opening film of the 2012 [[Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwaak|first=Je-yup|title=Horror takes stage as PiFan opens|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2012/07/141_115374.html|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=18 July 2012}}</ref> For the sequel ''[[Horror Stories 2]]'', Min again directed the wrap-around sequences, this time structured around three mysterious insurance claim cases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jang|first=Sung-ran|title=Return of Horror Film Geniuses, HORROR STORIES 2|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=2480|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2013-06-19|date=13 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, Min directed the [[historical drama|period drama]] ''[[The Treacherous]]'' (2015), set during the reign of [[Joseon]] king [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsan]], considered the cruelest tyrant in Korean history. Min said he had always been interested in historical events, and that he wanted to talk about current social issues through them; he also said he wanted to feature Yeonsan from a new perspective by focusing on the relationship between the king and "treacherous subjects who wear the mask of faithfulness."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baek|first1=Byung-yeul|title=Historical film tells story of Joseon tyrant|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2015/04/141_177329.html|website=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2015-04-30|date=19 April 2015}}</ref>

In 2020, he created the anthology science fiction project ''[[SF8]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/from-moon-so-ri-to-hani-drama-and-movie-blending-project-sf8-is-gathering-its-troops-140122.html|date=April 1, 2020|work=[[HanCinema]]|title=From Moon So-ri to Hani, Drama and Movie Blending Project "SF8" is Gathering Its Troops|accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>
