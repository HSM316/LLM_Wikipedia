==Plot==
[[North-West Mounted Police]] sergeant David Carrigan (Antonio Moreno) fights Indians and woos Jeanne-Marie (Renée Adorée). As described in a film magazine review,<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=''The Flaming Forest'' |journal=The Film Daily |volume=38 |issue=49 |date=November 28, 1926 |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/filmdaily3738newy/page/1330/mode/1up |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folks, Inc. |location=New York City |accessdate=24 December 2023}} {{Source-attribution}}</ref> the parents of Jeanne-Marie are killed when the renegade Indian Jules Lagarre raids the village. Lagarre continues his attacks and forces the people to quit their homes and property and Lagarre moves his forces into the hamlet. At this time, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] is just being organized, and in the detachment sent to the village is Sergeant David Carrigan. They arrive and drive off Lagarre and his men, but only temporarily. David falls in love with Jeanne-Marie. Her brother Roger, who is sort of a weakling, kills two of Lagarre's men, but the "justice for all" order forces David to arrest Roger, even though he is a relative of the woman he loves. For this, Jeanne-Marie vows her hate for David. Lagarre leads an Indian attack on the hamlet and a terrific battle is waged. Lagarre kidnaps Jeanne-Marie and David is killed trying to save her. David races through a blazing forest fire to her rescue and eventually the insurrection is quelled. David and Jeanne-Marie are now happy together.
