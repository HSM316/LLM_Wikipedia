'''Dadabhoy Rustomji Havewala''' (sometimes spelt '''Havewalla''') (27 November 1908 – 21 July 1982) was an [[India]]n cricketer who played [[first-class cricket]] from 1934 to 1941.

Havewala became famous in India before he played first-class cricket. In the final of the Times of India Shield in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in December 1933, he scored 515 (with 32 sixes and 55 fours)<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1983, p. 1245.</ref> as well as taking 11 wickets.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/168/168078.html Bombay Baroda & Central India Railways v St Xavier's College, Mumbai 1933-34]</ref> It was the highest score in Indian cricket until 2013, when [[Prithvi Shaw]] made 546.<ref>[http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/prithvi-shaws-546-lights-harris-shield/86608 Prithvi Shaw's 546 lights up Harris Shield]</ref>

He made his first first-class century in 1935-36, playing for [[Mumbai cricket team|Bombay]] against [[Western India cricket team|Western India]].<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15655.html Bombay v Western India 1935-36]</ref> Earlier in the season he had scored 71 against the touring Australian side, prompting [[Charlie Macartney]] to write, "I have seldom seen finer hitting than that by Havewalla."<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1983, p. 1246.</ref>

He made another century in 1937-38 for Maharaja of Patiala's XI against the strong touring English team Lord Tennyson's XI<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16485.html Maharaja of Patiala's XI Lord Tennyson's XI 1937-38]</ref> and was selected to play for [[India cricket team|India]] in the last two matches India played against Lord Tennyson's XI. He made 44 in the first match, India's second-top score in an innings victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=India v Lord Tennyson's XI 1937-38|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16500.html|website=CricketArchive|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>
