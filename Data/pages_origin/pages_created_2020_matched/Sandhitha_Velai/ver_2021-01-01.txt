==Plot==
Aadalarasu (Karthik) is an unemployed youth looking for a job. He is constantly taunted on this account by his father, Gurumoorthy (Vijayakumar), while his mother (Sujatha) comes to his support. In Madras for a job interview, he stays with his father's friend Sivaraman (Moulee). Aadalarasu has run-ins with Sivaraman's daughter Thilaka (Roja) and she develops a dislike for him. However, she bows to her father's wishes and weds Aadalarasu. Just when she starts liking him, he has to travel again. In the train, he meets Thirunaavukkarasu (Karthik again), who asks him for a favour. Instead of the usual comedy, the mistaken identity is then played for sentiment. With Thirunaavukkarasu dying and being mistaken for Aadalarasu, Aadalarasu's family think that he is dead while he takes Thirunaavukkarasu's place and helps them, but he has to do so without arousing the suspicions of his wife Akalya (Kausalya) and the rest of his family.

==Production==
The filming began in 1998 and was the second directorial work by Ravichandran. It was briefly delayed due to the selection of heroines. [[Isha Koppikar]] and then [[Suvalakshmi]] were selected for a role, but their refusal meant that Roja was signed. For another lead role, [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] was selected but due to date clashes, she too was replaced by Kausalya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818181632/http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml|archivedate=18 August 2000|title=Simran replaced by Suvalaxmi|work=Tamil Star|accessdate=2 December 2020}}</ref> There were rumours that the film was delayed because of Karthik experiencing trouble due to his health.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |title=Tamil New Year Special 2000 |work=Indolink Tamil |accessdate=2012-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210005955/http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104192522/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4|archivedate=November 2004|website=Dinakaran|title=Karthik teams with Simran and Isha Gopigar in a new film|accessdate=2 December 2020}}<br>- {{cite web|url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022225524/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm|archivedate=22 October 2010|website=Dinakaran|title=It's Kausalya Now!|accessdate=2 December 2020}}</ref>
