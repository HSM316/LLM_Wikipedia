== Plot ==
Aadalarasu is an unemployed graduate living with his parents Gurumoorthy and Sujatha. Aadalarasu is kind-hearted; however, luck does not favour him in finding a suitable job. Gurumoorthy frequently scolds Aadalarasu for his unemployment. But Aadalarasu's mother remains supportive. Aadalarasu goes to Chennai for an interview and stays in his father's friend Sivaraman's home where he meets Thilaka, the only daughter of Sivaraman. Gurumoorthy and Sivaraman decide to have Aadalarasu and Thilaka marry, hoping that Aadalarasu would become responsible after the wedding. Thilaka agrees to this wedding as she could not refuse her father's request, however she does not like Aadalarasu. After the wedding, Thilaka discovers Aadalarasu's kind heart.

One day, Aadalarasu misses a train for an interview, irritating Gurumoorthy, and he scolds him for his irresponsibility. So Aadalarasu feels dejected, and leaves the house hoping to catch the train at some other station. However, in the train, Aadalarasu meets his doppelganger Thirunavukarasu whose health condition looks worse. Thirunavukarasu tells his story to Aadalarasu. Thirunavukarasu hails from a rich business family, however, he is usually lazy, which led to poor performance of his company. Also, Thirunavukarasu's sister's wedding is cancelled due to this. Thirunavukarasu gets drunk and meets with an accident. Later, Thirunavukarasu transforms and understands his responsibilities and decides to turn around the company. He also married Akalya. However, to his shock, it is revealed that the car accident had created some problem in health which was left unnoticed by the doctors earlier and it is too late to save him. Thirunavukarasu hides this truth from his family members. The story comes to present.

Thirunavukarasu asks Aadalarasu to take care of his family in his place if possible and dies in the train. Aadalarasu decides to fulfil Thirunavukarasu's final wish and goes to Chennai as Thirunavukarasu. Meanwhile, Thirunavukarasu's corpse is brought to Aadalarasu's home, startling Aadalarasu's family. They suspect that Aadalarasu killed himself. Aadalarasu’s mother dies as she could not accept the death of her son. Thilaka feels sad. However, she is convinced by Gurumoorthy to go to Chennai and start a fresh life by finding a job. Thilaka comes to Chennai and attends some interviews.

Aadalarasu substitutes Thirunavukarasu and turns around his company. Thirunavukarasu's transformation pleases his family. He also takes Akalya into the business and trains her. Aadalarasu requests his father to transfer all the properties and businesses to Akalya's name. One day, Akalya meets Thilaka who was her classmate during college days. Akalya feels sorry for the death of Thilaka's husband and offers her a job in their company. Thilaka visits Akalya's company hoping to be hired but is surprised that Aadalarasu is the MD. Aadalarasu is also shocked to see Thilaka. Aadalarasu reveals his identity to everyone. Thilaka cries because her husband has died.

For another lead role, [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] was selected but due to date clashes, she too was replaced by Kausalya.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Simran replaced by Suvalaxmi |url=http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818181632/http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml |archive-date=18 August 2000 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=Tamil Star}}</ref> There were rumours that the film was delayed because of Karthik experiencing trouble due to his health.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sandya |title=Sandhiththa VaeLai: Sandhitha + VaeLai = Karthi + Kausi + Roja |url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210005955/http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |archive-date=10 February 2012 |access-date=16 February 2012 |website=Indolink}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 1999 |title=Karthik teams with Simran and Isha Gopigar in a new film |url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104192522/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4 |archive-date=4 November 2004 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=[[Dinakaran]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 July 1999 |title=It's Kausalya Now! |url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022225524/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm |archive-date=22 October 2004 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=[[Dinakaran]]}}</ref>

Krishna Chidambaram of ''[[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]]'' was critical of illogical sequences and was critical of Vijayakumar and Roja's acting but called Vivek's comedy the film's only positive aspect.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=சிதம்பரம் |first=கிருஷ்ணா |date=30 April 2000 |title=சந்தித்த வேளை |url=https://archive.org/details/kalki2000-04-30/page/32/mode/2up |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230622145642/https://archive.org/details/kalki2000-04-30/page/32/mode/2up |archive-date=22 June 2023 |access-date=22 June 2023 |magazine=[[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]] |page=32 |language=ta |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> S.
