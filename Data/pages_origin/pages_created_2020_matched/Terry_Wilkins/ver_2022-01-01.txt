'''Terry Wilkins''' is an Australian-born Canadian musician, composer and producer.

==Career==
A native of Sydney, Australia,<ref name="fyimusicnews1">{{cite web|url=https://www.fyimusicnews.ca/articles/2018/03/01/conversation-terry-wilkins |title=A Conversation With.. Terry Wilkins &#124; FYIMusicNews |publisher=Fyimusicnews.ca |date=2018-03-01 |accessdate=2019-09-30}}</ref> Terry's early performances saw him playing guitar in a folk group at University in 1965 (following his graduation from Parramatta Marist High in 1964). 
Within a couple of years he had dropped out of Academia and found himself in Taylor Square, Darlinghurst.
The Taylor Square scene was a breeding ground in the late 60s.
Various bands playing jug band, blues, psychedelic, folk, country and other styles co-existed there for a few years.

Terry discovered the bass at this time playing with The Starving Wild Dogs featuring New Zealander [[Red McKelvie]] on guitar, Daryl McKenzie on drums and Wally Mudd singing and playing harmonica.
The Starving Wild Dogs loom large in the mythology of that Taylor Square scene.

By 1969, they had evolved into The Quill which was a little more focused on original material. They supported country rock band [[The Flying Circus (band)|The Flying Circus]] in September 69 at a time when that band had just lost their bass player.

Terry was invited to join Flying Circus<ref name="fyimusicnews1"/> and gave them extra muscle with songwriting and vocal harmonies. Red McKelvie was also recruited to Flying Circus soon after, making them one of Australia's most polished stage bands. They produced beautiful albums like "Prepared In Peace".

In 1970, they won the Battle of the Sounds which for years had become an established launch pad for Australian bands like The Masters Apprentices to travel overseas. P & O ocean liners offered the winners a trip to the UK or the USA.

The Flying Circus were trying to break into the American scene, based in San Francisco, but gigs were hard to find.
A connection with Toronto band McKenna Mendelson Mainline (who they had met in Australia) steered the Flying Circus north and they fitted in there very well.

Terry has remained in Toronto since 1971, and since then has worked with many Canadian and international artists from [[Lighthouse]]<ref name="fyimusicnews1"/> to [[Big Sugar (band)|Big Sugar]] as well as [[Rough Trade (band)|Rough Trade]] and [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]]. He has also backed many visiting artists such as [[Dr. John]], [[Eddie Cleanhead Vinson]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond]], [[Levon Helm]] and [[Son Seals]]. His musical range is wide and varied with an emphasis on roots music especially blues and swing with some interesting adventures in Caribbean styles.<ref>Billboard - 9 Apr 1994 - Page 43 Vol. 106, No. 15 "Also on hand are two members of the Band, Richard Bell (keyboards) and Rick Danko (vocals), ex-Sharks guitarist David Baxter, and bassist Terry Wilkins. The album was produced by Colin Linden and John Whynot.</ref>
