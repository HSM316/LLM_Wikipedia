'''''The Philosophy Gym: 25 Short Adventures in Thinking''''' is a book by [[Stephen Law]]. It is an introduction to philosophical thinking aimed at adults. It covers twenty-five philosophical questions, chosen for their relevance to today's society. The book aims for accessibility. This is often done, as in "What's wrong with gay sex?", by putting the question into a theatrical script.

The German version of ''The Philosophy Gym'' won the first Mindelheim Philosophy Prize in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blackham Lecture 2013: How do we raise moral children? |url=https://humanism.org.uk/events/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/event/info&reset=1&id=16 |website=Humanists UK |accessdate=12 September 2018 |language=en |date=16 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=I win the Mindelheim Philosophy Prize |url=http://stephenlaw.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-win-mindelheim-philosophy-prize.html |accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>
