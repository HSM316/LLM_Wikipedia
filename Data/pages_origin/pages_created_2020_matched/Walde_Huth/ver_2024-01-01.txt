'''Walde Huth''' (January 29, 1923 - November 11, 2011) was a German photographer, known especially for her work in the fashion industry and for her street-style composition.

== Early life ==
Huth was born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. At seventeen years of age, she began attending the State School of Applied Arts in [[Weimar]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Walde Huth gestorben|url=http://www.kunstmarkt.com/pagesmag/kunst/_id247351-/news_detail.html?_q|website=kunstmarkt|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> where she studied under esteemed photographer and professor Walter Hege. His pupil for three years (1940-1943), Huth then began working for Agfa Wolfen, a film distribution plant contemporarily known as [[ORWO]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.orwona.com/about-us/|website=Orwona|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> There, she worked until 1945 as a color photography developer. Post-[[World War II]], Huth became interested in freelance work, and started her own business alongside her husband.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walde Huth Photographer|url=http://www.waldehuth.de/portrait_bio_wh.php?lang=en|website=Walde Huth|publisher=GmbH, Köln|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Huth was a member of the [[German Society for Photography]] and the [[w:de:Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler|Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler]].

=== Esslingen Gallery ===
After working and learning at Agfa, Huth founded a studio of her own in [[Esslingen (district)]], called the "Artistic Photo Workshop". Here, she would display her portrait, art, and theater photography.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walde Huth gestorben|url=http://www.kunstmarkt.com/pagesmag/kunst/_id247351-/news_detail.html?_q|website=kunstmarkt|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> However, her most prized work, perhaps, was her [[fashion photography]]. Huth got the chance to travel the world this way, her most iconic work coming from her adventures in [[Paris, France]]. Working out in the cities and on the streets instead of in the studio, Huth attracted a lot of attention from big-name magazines like ''Vogue''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=von Kories|first1=Galerie Hilaneh|title=Walde Huth: Austere. Empathic. Playful.|url=http://www.galeriehilanehvonkories.de/en/huth/ses/|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

=== Working Couple ===
Rejecting an offer of contract by ''Vogue'', Huth instead co-founded "Schmölz and Huth" with her husband, Karl Hugo Schmölz. Schmölz, also a photographer, was a member of the same Photographer's society that Walde was. Perhaps due to Karl's interest in Architectural photography, the two built their business into a furniture and interior architecture and design studio. Schmölz and Huth quickly became prominent in the furnishing industry, for which it became the photography and advertising leader.<ref>{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.vandergrintengalerie.com/schmoelz-vita.html|website=Van Grinten Der Galerie|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref> The space would serve as an advertising and public relations hub in [[Cologne, Germany]]. It stayed in business until closing in 1986, and remains one of Walde Huth's biggest successes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brancia|first1=Annapaola|title=Fashion Photographers: Walde Huth|url=http://www.scostumista.com/2013/05/fashion-photographerswalde-huth.html|website=Scostumista|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>
