==Plot==
Following a disastrous flood of the Green River, the ranchers of the valley are forced to abandon their land and migrate to neighboring Rand County. They are met with hostility by the citizens of Randville, who feel threatened by the influx of the dispossessed. The Green River ranchers find a friend in Gene Autry ([[Gene Autry]]), a cowboy who accepts a job singing on the local radio station in order to finance relief efforts.

Unknown to Gene and the migrant ranchers, Stephen Holloway ([[Douglass Dumbrille]]), the owner of the Rand Development Company, is conspiring with Congressman Fuller (Gordon Hart) to block a flood control bill in Congress until he can drive the ranchers out and buy up their land. When the citizens of Randville become disenchanted with Fuller, Holloway persuades an unwitting Gene to run for Congress on a flood control platform. After being elected, Gene goes to Washington, accompanied by his sidekick Frog Millhouse ([[Smiley Burnette]]) and Mary Ford ([[Mary Carlisle]]), the radio station reporter who quit her job to become Gene's secretary.

Six months later, tensions increase between the migrant ranchers and the citizens of Randville. In Washington, Gene finds it difficult to accomplish anything, stymied by the red tape of Congressional procedures and the secret efforts of Holloway's lobbyist. After his efforts to pass a flood control bill are defeated, Gene returns to Randville in the midst of another torrential downpour. The valley narrowly avoids disaster when Gene rallies the migrants to fight the raging river. Holloway finally realizes the importance of flood control and agrees to support Gene's bill.
