==Activism==
Pedroso was heavily involved in activism. She aided other black Cubans in forming La Sociedad Libres, along with her husband. The group was formed to arm rebels against the Spanish government for the liberation of Cuba.<ref name=TRW /><ref name=FCW /> This organization eventually became the Sociedad La Union Marti-Maceo.<ref name=TRW />

Pedroso also worked for racial equality in North America, and she collaborated with Marti on this matter.<ref name=TRW /> The two famously strolled arm-in-arm in the city, during a time of extreme racial tension. Pedroso was Afro-Cuban, and Marti was White-Hispanic.<ref name=TRW /><ref name="HN">{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Anthony|title=Jose Marti and Paulina Pedroso|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/2602/discussions/11281/jose-marti-and-paulina-pedroso|website=H-Net: Humanities & Social Sciences Online|publisher=H-Net: Humanities & Social Sciences Online|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=USFC /><ref name=HAB /> After Cuban independence was won in 1898, she eventually returned to Cuba when a 1910 workers' strike in the tobacco factories was underway.<ref name=TRW /><ref name=CB /> The Cuban government honored her service during that time, and in appreciation, Pedroso and her husband lived rent-free in Cuba for the rest of her lives. She was inducted into the [[Florida Women's Hall of Fame]] by Governor [[Lawton Chiles]] in 1993, and on her first nomination, which is something that is not achieved often.<ref name=TRW />
