==History==

San Francisco City Football Club was founded in 2001 by Jonathan Wright. The club entered the [[San Francisco Soccer Football League]] beginning with the 2002 season. After a decade in the competition, the club won back-to-back promotions to reach the SFSFL Premier Division in 2012. On the heels of the club's SFSFL success, and with enthusiasm for soccer mounting in the buildup to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], former SF City player and current club president Jacques Pelham began discussions with members of the San Francisco Football Supporters Association and the San Francisco chapter of [[The American Outlaws]] about building a grassroots, supporter-owned professional soccer club in the city.<ref name=FootySF>{{cite web|title=New Club on the Block: SF City FC!|url=http://www.footysf.com/new-club-on-the-block-sf-city-fc/|website=FootySF|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref>

The club began offering membership in August 2014, but a bid to join the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL) for the spring 2015 campaign was blocked by [[San Francisco Stompers FC]], who claimed territorial exclusivity in the league. SF City filed a grievance with US Soccer contesting the Stompers' claim. An independent arbiter eventually sided with SF City, but by the time the decision was made the club had already agreed to join [[US Club Soccer]]'s NorCal Premier Soccer League.<ref name="MLS Soccer">{{cite web|last1=Rosano|first1=Nicholas|title=US Open Cup: San Francisco City FC bring supporter-owned soccer to the City by the Bay|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/04/24/us-open-cup-san-francisco-city-fc-bring-supporter-owned-soccer-city-bay|website=MLS Soccer|access-date=April 25, 2015}}</ref>

The merger was executed on the eve of the semifinal of the regional US Open Cup qualifying tournament.<ref name="Meet The Underdogs">{{cite web|last1=Ream|first1=Evan|title=Meet The Underdogs: Fan-owned San Francisco City brings US Open Cup, professional aspirations back to city|url=http://thecup.us/meet-the-underdogs-fan-owned-san-francisco-city-brings-us-open-cup-professional-aspirations-back-to-city/|website=The Cup.us|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref>

The new-look SF City went on to qualify for the opening round of the US Open Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/2015/1/31/7957827/sf-city-fc-usoc-2015-open-cup-qualifying-club-soccer-championship-gabriel-silviera-earthquakes-pdl#4658446|title= SF City FC tops Stanislaus United to earn berth in 2015 U.S. Open Cup|publisher=SB Nation|date=January 31, 2015|access-date=March 26, 2015}}</ref> They became the first team from San Francisco to qualify for the competition since the 2007 [[California Victory]], and the first amateur San Francisco side to do so since the reintroduction of professional clubs to the tournament in 1995.<ref name=SFGate>{{cite web|last1=Barbeau|first1=Mark|title=Footy SF — Bay Area Soccer Round-up|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/soccer/2015/04/24/footy-sf-bay-area-soccer-round-up/|website=SFGate|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> The April 25 play-in match between SF City and [[Cal FC]] set a US Open Cup preliminary round attendance record, with 1,519 spectators in the stands of the newly refurbished Kezar Stadium.<ref name="Play In Round Winners">{{cite web|title="Play In" Round Winners Advance to U.S. Open Cup First Round|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2015/04/25/22/43/150425-usoc-play-in-round-games-recap|website=US Soccer|access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref>

At the start of the 2016 season, SF City made their debut in the USL's Premier Development League. The club won six and drew two of their fourteen matches in that inaugural season, finishing third in the five-team Central Pacific Division.

For 2017, the club realigned to the Southwest Division. Eight wins and one draw put SF City in third place out of nine teams, just missing qualification for the playoffs.

In 2018, the team entered their second US Open Cup following their strong showing the previous season. At [[Raimondi Park]] in Oakland, SF City defeated [[CD Aguiluchos USA|CD Aguiluchos]] 4-0 to advance to the second round, where they fell to the [[USL Championship]]'s [[Sacramento Republic FC|Sacramento Republic]]. The PDL season was uneven, as the team finished sixth in the tightly contested Southwest.

In 2019, the PDL was renamed [[USL League Two]] and the Southwest Division shrank to eight teams. SF City finished in sixth place for the second consecutive season.

SF City, in conjunction with the rest of the division, canceled their 2020 season due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE 2020 USL LEAGUE TWO SEASON|url=http://sfcityfc.com/blog/2020/4/17/special-announcment-about-the-2020-usl-league-two-season|access-date=2021-02-01|website=SAN FRANCISCO CITY FC|language=en-US}}</ref> The club instead focused on engaging their fans and supporting charitable causes online. In 2021, the League Two campaign was again called off, leading the club to call greater attention to their team in the [[San Francisco Soccer Football League|SFSFL]]. That team won ten of their eleven matches to finish atop the Majors Division and earn promotion to the Premier Division in 2022.
