'''Samuel Sutton''' (1760 &ndash; June 1832) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]]. He entered the service shortly after the start of the American War of Independence, and spent most of his early career serving with Captain and later Admiral [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]]. He saw action at several engagements with the French fleets in the [[West Indies]], and ended the war as a lieutenant. Left without active employment by the following years of peace, Sutton briefly returned to service during the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790, but the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793 brought him steady work. After serving in a number of ships and being present at [[First Battle of Groix|Cornwallis's Retreat]] in 1795, Sutton received command of a sloop, and with it the opportunity to render a service to a member of the French aristocracy, and the future [[Charles X of France]]. Promoted for his good service, Sutton served as a [[flag captain]] to several admirals, including [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]. He briefly commanded {{HMS|Victory}}, before surrendering her to [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]], who would go on to command ''Victory'' at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and be present at Nelson's death. Sutton instead took command of a frigate, and in 1804 was involved in a controversial action that saw the capture of three Spanish frigates and the destruction of a fourth. Made wealthy from the spoils, Sutton nevertheless remained in the navy, taking part in the chase of the French fleet to the West Indies in 1805. His health declined during this period, and he went ashore in October that year. He retired from active service, and served as a magistrate and local official for his community, being promoted to [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|rear-admiral]] in 1821 and dying in 1832.

==Early life==
Sutton was born in 1760 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]],<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fyoeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=samuel+sutton+scarborough&source=bl&ots=AABP4SCMbg&sig=PAH5CF0LGRzVcIQyqqIDWIbtrHE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtqq_U9JLQAhVgOMAKHToxCrIQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=samuel%20sutton%20scarborough&f=false Nelson's Band of Brothers: Lives and Memorials - Captain Peter Hore - Google Books] Retrieved 2016-11-05.</ref> and entered the navy on 9 April 1777 as an [[able seaman]] and later a [[midshipman]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, which was under the command of Captain [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]].<ref name="Tracy336">{{Cite book|last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=336}}</ref> Sutton and Rowley served in the [[English Channel]] until Rowley's promotion to rear-admiral in December 1778 and his shifting his flag to the 74-gun {{HMS|Suffolk|1765|6}}, with [[Hugh Cloberry Christian]] as his [[flag captain]].<ref name="Tracy336"/><ref name="GM83">{{Cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine |page=83}}</ref> Sutton accompanied Rowley to the ''Suffolk'', and moved with him again when Rowley raised his flag aboard Captain Thomas Watson's 74-gun {{HMS|Conqueror|1773|6}} in December 1779.<ref name="Tracy336"/><ref name="GM83"/> During this time Sutton saw action at the [[Battle of Grenada]] on 6 July 1779, and the [[Battle of Martinique (1780)|Battle of Martinique]] on 17 April 1780.<ref name="GM83"/>

Sutton was with Rowley on his next two flagships, the 74-gun {{HMS|Terrible|1762|6}} from June 1780 and the 98-gun {{HMS|Princess Royal|1773|6}} from July, both times serving under Captain [[John Thomas Duckworth]].<ref name="Tracy337">{{Cite book|last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=337}}</ref> Sutton became an acting-lieutenant while on board ''Princess Royal'', retaining the position after being transferred to the 16-gun [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Jamaica|1779|6}} under Captain [[Manley Dixon]].<ref name="Tracy337"/> He was next aboard the 18-gun ex-French {{HMS|Duguay Trouin|1780|6}} under commander Benjamin Hulke from December, though in May 1782 he returned to Rowley when he joined him aboard his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}} under Captain James Kempthorn.<ref name="Tracy337"/> He stayed at Rowley's side when the admiral moved to the 74-gun {{HMS|Ajax|1767|6}} under Captain N.

He was confirmed as lieutenant on 21 April 1783, despite never having formally been examined, but was in poor health and had to return to Britain aboard the 14-gun [[brig-sloop]] {{HMS|Childers|1778|6}}.<ref name="GM83"/><ref name="Tracy337"/> He recovered and received an appointment in March 1785 to the sloop {{HMS|Merlin|1780|6}}, under Commander Edward Pakenham, with whom he went out to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the rest of the year.<ref name="Tracy337"/> The end of the war left Sutton without a ship, and he spent four and a half years ashore after leaving ''Merlin''.<ref name="Tracy337"/>

==Return to service==
The [[Nootka Crisis|Spanish Armament]] in 1790 led to the [[Admiralty]] ordering the manning and storing of a large number of ships in preparation for war. Sutton was posted to the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Iphigenia|1780|6}} on 22 June 1790 as signal officer to Captain Patrick Sinclair, and served for a while with [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] fleet.<ref name="GM83"/><ref name="Tracy337"/> The easing of tensions after the crisis passed led to a draw-down in the navy, and Sutton came ashore again on 7 February 1791.<ref name="Tracy337"/> The tensions leading up to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars provided another opportunity for employment, and Sutton joined the 74-gun {{HMS|Culloden|1783|6}} on 3 January, which was serving in the Channel as the flagship of Sir Thomas Rich.<ref name="Tracy337"/> Sutton transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Mars|1794|6}} under Captain [[Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Cotton]] in November 1794, and in June 1795 was involved in Admiral [[William Cornwallis]]'s [[First Battle of Groix|successful retreat]] from a superior French force led by [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse]]. The ''Mars'' as the rear-most ship bore the brunt of the French fire, but suffered only 12 wounded.<ref name="GM83"/> Cornwallis brought his fleet about to rescue Cotton, causing Villaret de Joyeuse to believe that Cornwallis had reinforcements nearby, and so broke off the pursuit.<ref name="Tracy337"/>

==Copenhagen and Nelson==

''Alcmene'' was one of the ships assigned to Admiral [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker's]] expeditionary force to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in 1801. Sutton commanded her as part of Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson's]] force at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref name="Adkin463">{{Cite book|last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion|page=463}}</ref><ref name="Barnes83">{{Cite book|last=Fremont-Barnes |title=The Royal Navy: 1793-1815|page=83}}</ref> The frigates engaged the Trekroner fortress during the battle, before obeying Parker's signal to withdraw, an order Nelson ignored.<ref name="Adkin468">{{Cite book|last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion|page=468}}</ref> After the battle Nelson appointed Sutton to command the 38-gun {{HMS|Amazon|1799|6}}, whose captain, [[Edward Riou]], had been killed in the battle.<ref name="Tracy337"/><ref name="Winfield141">{{Cite book|last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail: 1794&ndash;1817 |page=141}}</ref> Sutton remained serving in the Baltic as Nelson's flag captain, returning him to Britain and continuing to serve under him during Nelson's period in charge of the anti-invasion defences.<ref name="Tracy337"/><ref name="Goodwin284">{{Cite book|last=Goodwin|title=Nelson's Ships|page=284}}</ref> Nelson went ashore in October 1802, after which Sutton took Rear-Admiral [[Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet|John Borlase Warren]] to [[St Petersburg]].<ref name="Goodwin284"/>

==HMS ''Victory''==
Sutton stepped down from the command of ''Amazon'' in November 1802, and by early 1803 had been assigned to take over the command of the 100-gun [[first rate]] {{HMS|Victory}}.<ref name="Tracy337"/><ref name="Goodwin284"/><ref name="Goodwin249">{{Cite book|last=Goodwin|title=Nelson's Ships|page=249}}</ref> Nelson arrived at [[Portsmouth]] on 18 May and hoisted his flag aboard her, but ''Victory'' had been assigned to Admiral William Cornwallis in the Channel, and was not ready for sea. Nelson struck his flag two days later, and immediately took passage for the Mediterranean aboard [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy's]] {{HMS|Amphion|1798|6}}, leaving Sutton to finish preparing ''Victory'' and deliver her to Cornwallis.<ref name="Goodwin249"/> Nelson left orders that if Cornwallis did not want her for his flagship, Sutton was to proceed onwards to join him in the Mediterranean.<ref name="Goodwin249"/> Sutton joined Cornwallis off [[Ushant]], whereupon Cornwallis ordered him on to Nelson. Sutton and the ''Victory'' sailed to rendezvous with Nelson off Cape Sicie, and while doing so, came across the French frigate [[HMS Ambuscade (1773)|''Embuscade'']] on 28 May as the latter was entering the [[Bay of Biscay]] after a journey from the West Indies.<ref name="Henderson79">{{Cite book|last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs |page=79}}</ref> ''Embuscade'', a former British ship, attempted to escape, but could not outrun the newly refitted ''Victory'' and was forced to surrender without a shot being fired.<ref name="Henderson79"/> Sutton took possession of her, and then continued on his way, joining the Mediterranean Fleet in late July, whereupon Nelson hoisted his flag on her.<ref name="Goodwin249"/> He brought Hardy with him as his flag captain, while Sutton took command of Hardy's former ship, ''Amphion''.<ref name="Goodwin249"/>

Sutton remained in the Mediterranean with Nelson's fleet, initially patrolling off [[Toulon]], before transferring to [[Cadiz]].<ref name="Goodwin230">{{Cite book|last=Goodwin|title=Nelson's Ships|page=230}}</ref> On 3 October 1804 ''Amphion'' was one of four frigates sent to intercept four Spanish frigates approaching Cadiz with a large cargo of specie.<ref name="James280">{{Cite book|last=James|title=The naval history of Great Britain|page=280}}</ref> The British ships, consisting of ''Amphion'', {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|6}}, {{HMS|Lively|1804|6}} and {{HMS|Medusa|1801|6}}, sighted the Spanish early on the morning of 5 October, and gave chase.<ref name="James281">{{Cite book|last=James|title=The naval history of Great Britain|page=281}}</ref> The Spanish were hailed, but refused to surrender to the British, and fighting broke out.

==West Indies, retirement, and later life==
Sutton and the ''Amphion'' remained with Nelson's fleet into 1805, and took part in the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], chasing [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve's]] forces to the [[West Indies]] and back.<ref name="Goodwin230"/> Sutton was in poor health by the time the fleet returned to anchor off [[Lisbon]] in October, and Nelson sent Sutton ashore to recuperate, replacing him with [[William Hoste]] as commander of ''Amphion''.<ref name="Goodwin230"/> Sutton was rich from the prize money of the captured Spanish ships, and appears to have retired ashore, never serving at sea again.<ref name="Tracy337"/> He served as a magistrate and a deputy lieutenant for the counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], and was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821.<ref name="GM83"/> Samuel Sutton died at [[Ditchingham]], [[Norfolk]] in June 1832 at the age of 72.<ref name="Tracy337"/>
