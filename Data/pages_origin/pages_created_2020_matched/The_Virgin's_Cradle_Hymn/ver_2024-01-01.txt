[[File:Dormi Jesu Wierix.jpg|thumb|upright|The engraving by [[Hieronymus Wierix]] which Coleridge encountered in 1799.]]

"'''The Virgin's Cradle Hymn'''" is a short [[lullaby]] text. It was collected while on a tour of Germany by the English poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], and published in his ''[[Sibylline Leaves]]'' of 1817.<ref name=STC>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i04JAAAAQAAJ&q=Sibylline+Leaves Sibylline Leaves]'' (Rest Fenner, 1817), 260</ref> According to his own note, Coleridge copied the Latin text from a "print of the Blessed Virgin in a Catholic village in Germany", which he later translated into English.<ref name=STC/><ref>Paulist Fathers, ''Catholic World'', Volume 4, 1867, 388</ref> The text, actually from a collection of devotional Flemish engravings by [[Hieronymus Wierix]], has inspired a number of modern choral and vocal musical settings.<ref name=bachlund/><ref name=lied/>

==Background==
Coleridge embarked upon his tour of Germany with his close friend [[William Wordsworth]] in 1798 shortly after the publication of their ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' of 1798. It was in May 1799, the eleventh month of his tour, that he encountered the print in a village inn. His diary records that it was either Womarshausen or Giebaldhausen, both Roman Catholic villages in the vicinity of [[Mainz]].<ref name=kaldis>Cynthia Kaldis, "The Virgin's Cradle Hymn" in ''Latin Music Through the Ages'', Volume 1 (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1991) {{ISBN|978-0-86516-242-6}}</ref>

The print itself was of Dutch origin, from a book entitled ''Jesu Christi Dei Domini Salvatoris nostra Infantia'' ("The Infancy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"), a collection of prints and accompanying verse by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] engraver [[Hieronymus Wierix]] (1553–1619).<ref name=bachlund>Gary Bachlund, [http://www.bachlund.org/The_Virgin's_Cradle_Hymn.htm The Virgin's Cradle Hymn], Retrieved 20 December 2010</ref> The verse accompanied an image titled "The Virgin Sewing While Angels Rock Her Son to Sleep", a woodcutting of the infant Jesus asleep in a cradle, rocked by two angels, while the Virgin Mary sits alongside engaged in needlework.<ref>Anna Jameson, ''Legends of the Madonna, as Represented in the Fine Arts'', ''Sacred and Legendary Art'' book 3, Volume 25 (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1852), 286–287</ref>

Coleridge sent the Latin copy to be printed in the ''Courier'' in 1801 as "A Correspondent in Germany". Despite having made a translation in [[Coleridge's notebooks|his notebook]], Coleridge did not consider publishing his English version of the short poem for almost ten years. He first published the two side-by-side in the ''Courier'' in 1811. Coleridge retold the story of his collection of the text and suggested that it could be sung to the tune of "the famous Sicilian Hymn ''Adeste Fideles laeti triumphantes''", nowadays better known as "[[Adeste Fideles|O Come All Ye Faithful]]".<ref name=kaldis/> He later published the poem and his translation in his collection ''Sibylline Leaves'' of 1817.

{{Verse translation|lang=la|
Dormi, Jesu! Mater ridet
Quae tam dulcem somnum videt,
        Dormi, Jesu! blandule!
Si non-dormis, Mater plorat,
Inter fila cantans orat,
        Blande, veni, somnule.

Sleep, sweet babe! my cares beguiling:
Mother sits beside thee smiling;
        Sleep, my darling, tenderly!
If thou sleep not, mother mourneth,
Singing as her wheel she turneth:
        Come, soft slumber, balmily!|attr2=Translation by S. T. Coleridge<ref name=STC/>}}


{{blockquote|<poem>
Holy Infant in Thy cradle,
With thy mother watching o'er Thee,
Slumber softly, slumber gently,
In her loving care, rest sweet Babe, peacefully.

As she bends to gaze upon Thee,
From her lips a prayer falls softly;
Is there in her heart a sorrow?
For she, weeping, rocks Thee tenderly.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Virgin's Cradle-Hymn |url=https://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=18192 |website=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref></poem>

==Musical settings==
Further to Coleridge's own musical suggestion, the short text has inspired a number of modern composers, and is usually titled "The Virgin's Cradle Hymn" or "Dormi, Jesu". These are mostly choral compositions, although occasionally rendered as [[art song]]s (''[[lieder]]'').  These settings include:<ref>Ezust, Emily.
