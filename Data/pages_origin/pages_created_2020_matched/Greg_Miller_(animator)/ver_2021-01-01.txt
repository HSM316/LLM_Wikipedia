==Early life and education==

Miller grew up in [[Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Upper St. Clair]], [[Pennsylvania]] near [[Pittsburgh]]. He graduated from [[Upper St. Clair High School]] in 1992 and went on to attend the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts in Philadelphia]].  While there, he earned an internship at [[Hanna-Barbera]] that would eventually lead him to drop out of college after receiving a job offer to work on ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]''.<ref name="Pitt"/>

==Career==

Miller began his career at Hanna-Barbera as a writer and storyboard artist for ''Dexter's Laboratory'' which aired on Cartoon Network.<ref name="Pitt"/> He also later worked on ''[[Cow and Chicken]]''<ref name="NYT"/> and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' as a member of the production company. In between stints at Hanna-Barbera, he worked for [[Nickelodeon]] (on ''[[CatDog]]'' and ''[[The Angry Beavers]]'') and at [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] (on ''[[Nightmare Ned]]'').<ref name="Pitt"/>

While working at Hanna-Barbera, he pitched the company a new show called ''Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?''. Hanna-Barbera declined, prompting Miller to take the pitch directly to Cartoon Network. Cartoon Network purchased the pilot along with the pilots of 9 other shows with the intent of trying them all out over one summer. Cartoon Network executives chose 3 (including ''Robot Jones'') to be voted on by viewers in August 2000<ref name="Pitt"/> in an event known as ''The Big Pick'' or ''Big Pick Weekend''. ''Robot Jones'' received 23% of the vote, finishing second and losing out to ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' created by [[Maxwell Atoms]].<ref name="Variety">{{cite magazine | last=Dempsey| first=John| title =Toon net Oks series based on aud votes| magazine =Variety| date =August 29, 2000 | url =https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/toon-net-oks-series-based-on-aud-votes-1117785699/| access-date =February 12, 2018}}</ref>
