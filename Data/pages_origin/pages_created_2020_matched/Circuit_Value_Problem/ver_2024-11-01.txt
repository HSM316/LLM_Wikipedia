The '''Circuit Value Problem''' (or Circuit Evaluation Problem) is the computational problem of computing the output of a given [[Boolean circuit]] on a given input.

The problem is complete for [[P (complexity)|P]] under uniform [[AC0|AC{{sup|0}}]] reductions. Note that, in terms of [[time complexity]], it can be solved in [[linear time]] simply by a [[topological sort]].

The [[Boolean Formula Value Problem]] (or Boolean Formula Evaluation Problem) is the special case of the problem when the circuit is a tree. The Boolean Formula Value Problem is complete for [[NC (complexity)|NC{{sup|1}}]].<ref>{{cite conference | url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/28395.28409 | author=Samuel R.

The problem is closely related to the [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean Satisfiability Problem]] which is complete for [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and its complement, the [[Tautology (logic)|Propositional Tautology Problem]], which is complete for [[co-NP]].
