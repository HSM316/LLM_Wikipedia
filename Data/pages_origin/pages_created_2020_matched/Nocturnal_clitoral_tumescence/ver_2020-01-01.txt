'''Nocturnal clitoral tumescence''' ('''NCT''') is a spontaneous [[Clitoral erection|swelling of the clitoris]] during sleep or when waking up. Similar to the process in males, [[nocturnal penile tumescence]], females experience clitoris tumescence or engorgement of the [[vagina]] mainly during [[REM sleep]] phase.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiZsAAAAMAAJ&q=nocturnal+clitoral+tumescence&dq=nocturnal+clitoral+tumescence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YsDpUdz5AomHONXegYAE&redir_esc=y |title=Psychiatry|volume=1|author=Robert Michels|editor=Robert Michels|publisher=Lippincott |year=1985|isbn=9780397506866 |accessdate=2013-10-14|page=139}}</ref>

According to Fisher et al., the increase in vaginal blood flow accociated with NCT during REM sleep is similar to the process in man in frequency, i.e. 95% of REM phases. It does occur a bit more often in non-REM sleep, and each episode appears shorter in duration. In terms of magnitude, NCT is similar to that induced by erotic stimulation when awake.<ref name=Fisher>{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=C. |last2=Cohen |first2=H. D. |last3=Schiavi |first3=R.
