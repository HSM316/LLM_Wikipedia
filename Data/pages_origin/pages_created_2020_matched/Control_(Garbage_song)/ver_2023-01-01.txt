"'''Control'''" is the second [[North America]]n and fourth overall single released from alternative rock band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]'s fifth studio album, ''[[Not Your Kind of People]]'', and was sent to radio stations across [[United States]] in October 2012. 

==Background and composition==
"Control" was written and recorded during the 2010-2011 sessions for ''Not Your Kind of People'' in Los Angeles and is one of the examples of the "guerrilla style" approach the band took with the sound on the album.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Kevin & Bean |date=May 7, 2012 |title=Butch Vig KROQ interview |url=https://www.garbagediscobox.com/2012/05/kroq-interview/ |website=garbage disco}}</ref> 

"Control" was mostly composed by drummer [[Butch Vig]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |author1=Joe Bosso |date=2012-06-04 |title=Interview: Garbage talk Not Your Kind Of People track-by-track |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/interview-garbage-talk-not-your-kind-of-people-track-by-track-547163 |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=MusicRadar |language=en}}</ref> who also plays [[harmonica]] on the track. Vig explained "[m]y six-year-old daughter has a harmonica and she left it in my home studio. We were working on the song one morning and I picked it up and started blowing on it. I can’t really play harmonica, the part is dead simple, anyone could figure it out. I didn’t think we would actually use it and then we left it in the song, we mixed it.<ref name=":0" /> The band were inspired by the song "[[When the Levee Breaks]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]] and used it as a reference point to bring [[guitars]] into the mix and seeing how far they could push their sound and channel the groove.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |last=Garbage |date=May 7, 2012 |title="Control" Mini-film |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L63cZAc2uH0 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |work=youtube.com}}</ref> Guitarist [[Duke Erikson]] came up with the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] idea and added "we wanted to make the last chorus totally chaotic, so I opened up the gate and ran a pulse through it. The whole song sounded like it was out of control." Erikson recalls playing a [[Fender Telecaster]] on the verses and a [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] on the second chorus, although "there might have been a [[Gibson SG|SG]] involved".<ref name=":2" /> 

Lyrically, "Control" is about giving up any control in your life, surrendering yourself to whatever is going on," explained singer [[Shirley Manson]], "...and committing yourself to it in that moment."<ref name=":3" /> Manson added that "Control" is about facing the fact that we are all ultimately gonna die and why are we holding on to these weird, fixed ideas of who we are, what we are, what we’re capable of. It’s about urgency. It’s about vigor, about life and letting things move through you instead of holding on tight."<ref>''Faceculture''. {{Citation |title=Garbage interview - Shirley Manson and Steve Marker (part 4) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbA3t3j_wN4 |language=en |access-date=2022-09-23}}</ref>

The single cover designed by the band's graphic artist Ryan Corey features a [[cat]]'s skull. 

== Release and promotion ==
The song was first teased ahead of its release on August 30, 2011, when the band posted a video of Vig recording drums on their [[Facebook]] page.<ref>{{Citation |title=BV at work... {{!}} BV at work... {{!}} By Garbage {{!}} Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/GarbageOfficial/videos/bv-at-work/10150775012380013/ |language=en |access-date=2022-09-23}}</ref> A second teaser of the song was posted on February 1, 2012.<ref>{{Citation |title=We made something pretty for our new album title to wear...... {{!}} By Garbage {{!}} Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/GarbageOfficial/videos/we-made-something-pretty-for-our-new-album-title-to-wear/201068813325132/ |language=en |access-date=2022-09-23}}</ref>

"Control" was released as second North American and fourth overall single from [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]'s fifth studio album, ''[[Not Your Kind of People]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=2012-10-04 |title=Garbage Take "Control" & "Blood For Poppies" To 'Kimmel': Watch |url=https://www.idolator.com/7001622/garbage-control-kimmel-blood-for-poppies-video?view-all |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=idolator}}</ref>'' The band mastered a radio version of the song for [[airplay]] featuring a third chorus in place of the breakdown that marks the album version of the song. Garbage later pressed a limited edition [[Gramophone record|7" vinyl]] single for "Control" and released it through their [[website]]. It was [[A-side and B-side|backed with]] a remix of the lead single "[[Blood for Poppies]]".<ref name="disco">{{cite web |title=Garbage - Control (Discography) |url=http://www.garbage-discography.co.uk/singles/control/ |accessdate=2013-02-09 |work=Garbage Disco}}</ref>

On October 3, 2012, "Control" was performed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''<ref name=":4" /> The song was also performed heavily during the [[Not Your Kind of People World Tour]] and was used to open concerts in the band's 2019 headline tour. 

In 2022, the song was remastered by [[Heba Kadry]] and included in Garbage's third [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Anthology (Garbage album)|Anthology]]'', out October 28.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Skinner |first=Tom |date=2022-09-21 |title=Garbage announce new 'Anthology' compilation: "It's testimony to almost three decades of creative work" |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/garbage-announce-new-anthology-compilation-album-pre-order-tracklist-3314281 |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=NME |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Reception to the song was greatly positive, with critics often praising the track as a highlight on ''Not Your Kind of People''. 

Carl Williott of ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'' described the song as "a ferocious, fuzzed-out rocker with a driving bass line and a harmonica-on-[[Doping in sport|steroids]] train whistle effect that demands your listening attention."<ref name=":4" /> Tom Hocknell in his interview for ''[[BBC Music]]'' compared the song to "[[The Smiths]] on steroids" and complimented it for demonstrating "the joyful abandonment in surrendering yourself to sing-along industrial pop angst."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hocknell |first=Tom |title=BBC - Music - Review of Garbage - Not Your Kind of People |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/gwhf/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |language=en-GB}}</ref> In his 4/5 stars review of ''Not Your Kind of People'', Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commended the song's "[s]tadium-sized hooks".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-05-10 |title=Garbage: Not Your Kind of People – review |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/10/garbage-not-your-kind-review |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> Emma Smith of ''[[The Line of Best Fit]]'' was also positive, praising the song as "immediately arresting and [[Anthem|anthemic]]".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Garbage – Not Your Kind of People |url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/garbage-not-your-kind-of-people-96955 |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=The Line of Best Fit |language=en-US}}</ref> In his review for [[Consequence Of Sound|''Consequence of Sound'']], Adam Kivel picked "Control" as one of the essential tracks of the album, writing that "the twinkling waves of piano that open “Control” is pure production mastery, and the sludgy bass and dark, relationship-based lyrics [...] are vintage Garbage." Despite giving the album a lukewarm review and calling it "dated", Jonathan Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' picked "Control" as one of the few "standout tracks" on ''Not Your Kind of People''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Keefe |first=Jonathan |date=2012-05-21 |title=Review: Garbage, Not Your Kind of People |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/garbage-not-your-kind-of-people/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=Slant Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> Similarly, Jason Heller of The AV Club gave the album a C+ review but praised "Control" as one of "the bright spots", describing it as "a propulsive slab of clattering, industrial melancholia in which Manson morphs from chanteuse to tsunami at the drop of a beat." ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' also praised the track for its Garbage signature sound.<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 2012 |title=''Not Your Kind of People'' album review |pages=114 |work=[[Q Magazine]]}}</ref>

On a negative note, in his review for ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', Sean Thomas criticized the lyrics of the chorus for their "faux-angst content".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Album Review: Garbage - Not Your Kind of People |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16998/reviews/4144924 |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=DrownedInSound |language=en}}</ref>
