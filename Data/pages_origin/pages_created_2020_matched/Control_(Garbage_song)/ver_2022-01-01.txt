"'''Control'''" is the second [[North America]]n single released from alternative rock band [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]'s fifth studio album, ''[[Not Your Kind of People]]'', and was sent to radio stations across [[United States]] in October 2012. The band mastered a radio version of the song for [[airplay]] featuring a third chorus in place of the breakdown that marks the album version of the song. Garbage later pressed a limited edition [[Gramophone record|7" vinyl]] single for "Control" and released it through their [[website]]. It was [[A-side and B-side|backed with]] a remix of the lead single "[[Blood for Poppies]]".<ref name="disco">{{cite web |url=http://www.garbage-discography.co.uk/singles/control/ |title=Garbage - Control (Discography) |work=Garbage Disco |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref>

On June 26, 2012, "Control" became the soundtrack to the [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

==Background==
"Control" is about giving up any control in your life, surrendering yourself to whatever is going on," explained [[Shirley Manson]], "...and committing yourself to it in that moment." The band were inspired by the song "[[When the Levee Breaks]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]] and used it as a reference point to bring [[guitars]] into the mix and seeing how far they could push their sound and channel the groove. "Control" features a [[harmonica]] part performed by [[Butch Vig]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L63cZAc2uH0 |title=Garbage - Big Bright World (Official Video) |work=youtube.com |date=May 7, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>
