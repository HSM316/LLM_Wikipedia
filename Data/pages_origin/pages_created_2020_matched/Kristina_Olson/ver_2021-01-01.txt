== Biography ==
Kristina Olson received her B.A. in Psychology and African and African-American Studies from [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in 2003. She completed her PhD from [[Harvard University]] in 2008, where she worked with [[Elizabeth Spelke]], [[Mahzarin Banaji]], and [[Carol Dweck|Carol S. Dweck]]. After graduating from Harvard, Olson joined the faculty of [[Yale University]]. In 2013, she subsequently moved to the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington where she directs the Social Cognitive Development Lab. Olson's research has been funded through the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], and the [[Arcus Foundation]]. In 2020, Olson joined Princeton University to lead the Human Diversity Lab as a Professor in the department of Psychology.

== TransYouth Project ==
Olson directs The TransYouth Project, which is the largest-to-date [[Longitudinal Research|longitudinal research]] study of transgender children, with over 350 children enrolled from across the United States and Canada. The TransYouth Project "aims to help scientists, educators, parents, and children better understand the varieties of human gender development."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/transyp/|title=TransYouth Project {{!}} Changing Lives Through Science and Service|website=depts.washington.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> Recent findings from this project indicate that transgender children are not confused, delayed, pretending, or oppositional with regards to their [[gender identity]]. On tasks, such as the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]] (IAT), which measure social knowledge, attitudes, and stereotypes about gender, transgender children respond similarly to "typical" [[cisgender]] children who match their gender identity (i.e., their expressed gender).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Kristina R.|last2=Key|first2=Aidan C.|last3=Eaton|first3=Nicholas R.|date=2015-03-05|title=Gender Cognition in Transgender Children|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=467–474|doi=10.1177/0956797614568156|pmid=25749700}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fast|first=Anne A.|last2=Olson|first2=Kristina R.|title=Gender Development in Transgender Preschool Children|journal=Child Development|volume=89|issue=2|language=en|pages=620–637|doi=10.1111/cdev.12758|pmid=28439873|issn=1467-8624|year=2018|doi-access=free}}</ref> Such findings suggest that the gender identity of transgender children is stable and deeply held.

In research examining mental health outcomes, Olson and colleagues have observed typical rates of depression and only marginally elevated rates of anxiety in transgender children when compared to control groups of children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durwood|first=Lily|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Katie A.|last3=Olson|first3=Kristina R.|title=Mental Health and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=56|issue=2|pages=116–123.e2|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2016.10.016|pmid=28117057|pmc=5302003|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Kristina R.|last2=Durwood|first2=Lily|last3=DeMeules|first3=Madeleine|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Katie A.|date=2016-03-01|title=Mental Health of Transgender Children Who Are Supported in Their Identities|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/3/e20153223|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=137|issue=3|pages=e20153223|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3223|issn=0031-4005|pmid=26921285|pmc=4771131}}</ref> Such findings contrast with reports of poor mental health outcomes among transgender adults, who frequently experience discrimination and marginalization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bockting|first=Walter O.|last2=Miner|first2=Michael H.|last3=Swinburne Romine|first3=Rebecca E.|last4=Hamilton|first4=Autumn|last5=Coleman|first5=Eli|date=2013-03-14|title=Stigma, Mental Health, and Resilience in an Online Sample of the US Transgender Population|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=5|pages=943–951|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301241|pmid=23488522|pmc=3698807|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> In interviews, Olson has emphasized the importance of supportive parents and families in helping transgender youth feel accepted, safe, and secure, especially as they transition through adolescence to adulthood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transgender-kids-mental-health/|title="Truly stunning" findings on transgender kids' mental health|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/23/471265599/probing-the-complexities-of-transgender-mental-health|title=Probing The Complexities Of Transgender Mental Health|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref>
