'''Edward Pope Andrews''' (born 1908) and '''Stephania Rynak Andrews''' (born 1908) were a married couple who disappeared in 1970 after leaving a party in downtown [[Chicago]]. The couple and their vehicle were last seen in the vicinity of the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]] near the [[Chicago Loop]]. The case was widely publicized by local newspapers and multiple theories have emerged as to the couple's fate. 

==Background==
At the time of their disappearance, the Andrews resided in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]]. Edward Andrews was a manager and bookkeeper for a Chicago manufacturer, and Stephania was a credit investigator. Both were planning to retire within the year.<ref name = "Pratt 1970">{{cite news |last1=Pratt |first1=Steven |title=Missing Suburb Couple's Fate Still a Mystery |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=14 June 1970}}</ref><ref name = "Soll 1971'">{{cite news |last1=Soll |first1=Frederick |title=Curtain of Mystery Cloaks Couple's Disappearance |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=16 May 1971}}</ref>

==Disappearance==
On the evening of May 15, 1970, the Andrews attended a cocktail party at the Sheraton-Chicago hotel, located at 505 North [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].<ref name = 'Police seek'>{{cite news |title=Police Seek Pair Missing for Week |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=22 May 1970}}</ref> About 9:30 PM, the hotel's parking garage [[valet]] and manager observed Edward Andrews "staggering" as he approached his vehicle.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/><ref name = "Soll 1971'"/> When exiting the garage, the Andrews' vehicle sideswiped a door and valet observed Stephania Andrews seated in the front passenger seat, crying.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/> Edward Andrews then proceeded onto the lower deck of Michigan Avenue where he illegally drove south in the northbound lanes toward the Michigan Avenue Bridge and [[Wacker Drive]].<ref name = "Soll 1971'"/><ref name = "Pratt 1970"/> This was the last reported sighting of the Andrews and their vehicle, a 1969 [[Oldsmobile]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yabush |first1=Donald |title=Couple's Whereabouts a Mystery |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=17 May 1973}}</ref>

The Andrews failed to attend a scheduled dinner party the next night and neither reported to work the following Monday.<ref name = 'Police seek'/>

==Investigation==
Police theorized that the couple drowned when Andrews attempted a U-turn on the lower level of the Michigan Avenue bridge and accidentally drove into the [[Chicago River]] through an area unprotected by a guardrail.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/> Police searched the river twice during the spring and summer of 1970 using dragging equipment, sonar, and divers, but failed to locate their vehicle.<ref name = "Soll 1971'"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Goodyear |first1=Sara Jane |title=Divers in River Fail to Find Suburb Pair |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=8 August 1970}}</ref>

According to Edward Andrews’ coworkers, he became ill during lunch on the day he vanished and remained sick for the rest of the afternoon.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/><ref name = "Soll 1971'"/> Attendees at the cocktail party reported that Andrews appeared ill, but told his wife that he was hungry and wished to leave the party in order to get a meal.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/><ref name = "Soll 1971'"/> Police speculated that Andrews may have been intoxicated or suffering from a disorienting illness when he drove out of the hotel's garage.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/>

Police discounted robbery as a theory since the couple carried little cash or valuables at the time they vanished and their bank accounts and credit cards showed no activity in the months that followed.<ref name = "Pratt 1970"/>

The Andrews left behind all of their personal belongings in their home. Friends and neighbors described the couple as conscientious and unlikely to leave town without notifying their employers and family.<ref>{{cite news |title=Couple Missing 11 Days Sought |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=25 May 1970}}</ref><ref name = "Pratt 1970"/>

==Later developments==
In 1971, additional searches of the Chicago River and adjacent areas of [[Lake Michigan]] were carried out at which time a [[sonar]] technician stated he was “95% sure” the car was not in the area.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Success in Search for Andrews Couple |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=30 November 1971}}</ref> In 1973, an Arlington Heights detective speculated that a barge might have crushed the Andrews' car into the river bottom or pushed it out into the lake.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Swicklard |first1=Joe |title=Strange Saga of the Andrews Couple |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=16 May 1973}}</ref> In 1974, a tip led police to carry out underwater searches in the harbor near [[Navy Pier]] but no further evidence was found.<ref>{{cite news |title=Search for Andrews Pair Returns to Chicago River |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=5 June 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Police Renew Search for the Andrews |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=20 June 1974}}</ref>

In 1975, a psychic became involved with the case and stated that the couple had been murdered on [[South Side, Chicago|Chicago's South Side]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Steve |title=Irene Looks Into the Future--for 14 |publisher=The Daily Herald (Chicago) |date=31 May 1975}}</ref> In 1976, another psychic claimed that the Andrews were murdered and their bodies and their car were submerged in a lake.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Swickard |first1=Joe |title=Andrews Case Still Shrouded in Mystery |publisher=Arlington Heights Herald |date=15 May 1976}}</ref>

The couple was declared legally dead in 1978.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brodt |first1=Bonita |title=Couple Still Missing; So Are Clues |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1 January 1984}}</ref>

In 1994, the case was revived when a tipster informed police that the couple had been murdered and then submerged with their car in a [[Green Oaks, Illinois]] pond. Police searched the pond and found no evidence of the Andrews or their car.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kates |first1=Michel |title=Police Make New Dive at 1970s Mystery |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=3 August 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kirby |first1=Joseph A. |title=Relatives Hope for the Answer |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=5 August 1994}}</ref>
