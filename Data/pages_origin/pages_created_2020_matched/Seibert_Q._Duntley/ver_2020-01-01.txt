'''Seibert Quimby Duntley''' was born in Bushnell, Illinois on October 2, 1911. He received an SB in physics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1933. Duntley received an MS degree from [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1935 and an Sc.D. in physics from [[MIT]] in 1939. While at [[MIT]], Duntley met and worked with [[Karl Taylor Compton]], [[Harold Eugene Edgerton]], and many other prominent physicists. Duntley's primary interest was in applied physics particularly the optics of turbid media.<ref>S. Q. Duntley Biography from University of California http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1229&context=sio/arch</ref>

He started the Visibility Laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1939/40. It was the brainchild of Duntley and [[MIT]] physics chair Dr. Arthur C. Hardy.  It was focused on applying [[optics]] to such problems as [[camouflage]], misdirection of aerial bombardment, target location, visibility of submerged objects at sea.  In 1952, [[Roger Revelle]] and Quimby Duntley agreed that the laboratory would become part of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[San Diego]], and the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships agreed to pay for the move.<ref>History of the Scripps Visibility Lab http://www.physics.miami.edu/optics/ken/OtherPapers/A25_VA_OOXVI_2002.pdf</ref> The work of the laboratory centered on the transmission of visible light through the atmosphere and water and the related problems of image formation and recognition. The nature of much of the research required measurements of the optical properties of the ocean or atmosphere for which no instruments existed. As a result of these requirements, many unique and very specialized instruments were developed by the laboratory, many of which were based on concepts or optical designs devised by Duntley.  He earned the academic rank of Professor in 1966 and taught at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and at the Department of Applied Physics and Information Science (APIS) at [[UCSD]] until his retirement.

Duntley was an active member of many professional associations, particularly the [[Optical Society of America]] and [[Sigma Xi]]. He was president of the [[Optical Society of America]] in 1965.<ref>Past Presidents of the Optical Society of America http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/leadership/pastpresidents/default.aspx</ref> He was Chairman of the Representatives of the Optical Society on the U.S. National Committee of the [[International Commission on Illumination]]. During the 1960s he was a member of the Armed Forces-National Research Council Committee on Vision. He was a participant in the 1971 JASON Laser Summer Study. He chaired the [[David Richardson Medal]] Committee of the [[Optical Society of America]] from 1972 to 1975.<ref>OSA Richardson Medal http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/davidrichardson/default.aspx</ref>  He received many awards, including the Army-Navy Certificate of Appreciation and, in 1961, the [[Frederic Ives]] Medal, the highest award of the Optical Society of America, "recognizing overall distinction in optics." <ref>Frederic Ives Medal http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/ivesquinn/default.aspx</ref> Quimby Duntley died in La Jolla on October 22, 1999.
