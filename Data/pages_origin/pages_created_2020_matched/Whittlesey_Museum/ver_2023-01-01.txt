== History ==
===The building===
The building in its original form was completed in 1825.<ref name=oldfield>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/discoveringpublications/docs/discoveringwhittlesey-120-jul2014   |title=The Town Hall (part one) |publisher= Discovering Whittlesea |first=Geoff|last=Oldfield|date=1 July 2014| access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref> The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto Market Street; the ground floor, which formed accommodation for the local fire service, featured a central doorway flanked by four openings for use by the horse-drawn fire engine while, on the first floor, there were an assembly room fenestrated by three large windows.<ref name=oldfield/> 

In 1857, the building was remodelled to a design by Richard Reynolds Rowe of [[Cambridge]] in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]]; the work was carried out by Messrs Bennett & Sons at a cost of Â£257.<ref name=oldfield/> The new design was more decorative with [[Faience|faience tiles]] in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the doorway and an arcade of five round headed windows on the first floor.<ref name=oldfield/> Internally, the principal rooms were the fire station and the [[Village lock-up|lock-up]] on the ground floor and the assembly room on the first floor.<ref name=listed/> The assembly room, which was equipped with a horseshoe-shaped table, was used as a courtroom for [[petty session]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Kelly_s_Directory_of_Cambridgeshire_Norf/1Gk4squoNSIC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22&pg=PA124&printsec=frontcover  |title=Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk|page=124|year=1883}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_County_Councils_Municipal_Corporatio/aqsHAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Whittlesea%22+%22Town+Hall%22&dq=%22Whittlesea%22+%22Town+Hall%22&printsec=frontcover |title=The County Council, Municipal Corporations and Local Authorities Companion, Magisterial Directory and Local Government Year Book|year=1914|page=124}}</ref>

Following significant population growth, largely associated with the status of Whittlesey as a market town, the area became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] with the building as its headquarters in 1894;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10108652   |title=Whittlesey|publisher=Vision of Britain| access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Municipal_Year_Book_and_Public_Utili/mpJNAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Town+Hall,+Whittlesey%22&dq=%22Town+Hall,+Whittlesey%22&printsec=frontcover  |title= The Municipal Year Book and Public Utilities Directory |year=1927|page=422}}</ref> as its responsibilities increased, Whittlesey Urban District Council relocated to new offices in Queen Street.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44574|page=4799|date=26 April 1968}}</ref> Following local government reorganisation in 1974,<ref>{{cite book|title=Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70|publisher=The Stationery Office Ltd|isbn=0-10-547072-4|year=1997}}</ref> [[Fenland District|Fenland District Council]] became responsible for the administration of the area, but the local parish council, Whittlesey Town Council, continued the tradition of mayor making in the town hall.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-peterborough-evening-telegraph/20110511/282007553969016  |title=New town mayor set to be revealed today|date=11 May 2011|newspaper=Peterborough Telegraph| access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref>

===The museum===
The museum was founded in 1976 as an independent charitable trust with a mission and purpose of collecting, caring and interpreting the natural and cultural heritage of Whittlesey and the surrounding area ([[Coates, Cambridgeshire|Coates]], [[Eastrea]], [[Pondersbridge]] and Turves) for the benefit and enjoyment of students, local people and visitors.<ref>{{EW charity|274486|Whittlesey Museum Trust}}</ref> 

The museum gained Arts Council Accreditation close to the start of the scheme in 2007, having previously been a Registered Museum. It became a partner in the Greater Fens Partnership as one of the "Fenland Five" museums along with [[Wisbech & Fenland Museum]], [[March, Cambridgeshire#March Museum|March and District Museum]], the Chatteris Museum and [[Octavia Hill]]'s Birthplace House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fensmuseums.org.uk/page_id__77_path__0p2p.aspx |title= Whittlesey Museum|publisher=Fens Museum Partnership|access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref>

==The collection==
The museum collections include local archaeology and archives, costume and textiles, natural sciences, coins, medals and local social and industrial history including the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. Gallery displays are mounted in the former Caretaker's Cottage and the area previously used to house the town's horse-drawn fire engine. Outside in the museum's courtyard there are displays about the local brick industry and railway whilst a forge with wheelwright's bench and agricultural machinery recalls other occupations which supported the local economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/6427 |title= Whittlesey Museum|publisher= Cornucopia|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210534/http://www.cornucopia.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/6427|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-date= 23 September 2015}}</ref>
