The '''Heresy Act 1382''' (5 Ric. II, St. 2, c. 5) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. The Act stated that the Chancellor should issue commissions for the arrest of heretical preachers by the authority of certificates from the bishops. The Act was repealed in a later Parliament of the same year as the knights of the shires claimed it had not passed the House of Commons.<ref>Dudley Julius Medley, ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History.
