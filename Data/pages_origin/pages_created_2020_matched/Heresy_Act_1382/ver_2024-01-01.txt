The '''Heresy Act 1382''' ([[5 Ric. 2. Stat. 2]]. c. 5) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. The Act stated that the Chancellor should issue commissions for the arrest of heretical preachers by the authority of certificates from the bishops.

The Act was repealed in a later Parliament of the same year as the knights of the shires claimed it had not passed the [[House of Commons]].<ref>Dudley Julius Medley, ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History. Sixth Edition'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1925), p. 601.</ref>
