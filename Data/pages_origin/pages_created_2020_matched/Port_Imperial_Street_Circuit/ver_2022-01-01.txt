==Location and design==
[[File:10.7.09BoulevardEast&60thSTByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|left|The junction of Boulevard East and 60th Street, at the circuit's highest point]]
The site of the circuit was made after several years of searching for an appropriate venue in the [[New York Metropolitan Area]] and was chosen for its location near the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]] and [[Hudson Palisades]], offering sweeping skyline views, elevation changes and access to public transportation.<ref name="WSJ"/>

The circuit, designed by German track designer [[Hermann Tilke]], was to have run clockwise. The start line was to be located next to the [[NY Waterway]] ferry terminal, with the pits and paddock located between the ferry terminal and Port Imperial Boulevard. The first sector of the circuit would have run along the [[Hudson River Waterfront Walkway]], designed to allow the cars to race through Port Imperial before climbing the Hudson Palisades along [[Pershing Road (Weehawken)|Pershing Road]]. The circuit was then to follow [[Boulevard East]] north to Donnelly Memorial Park, where it would have turned right and descended Anthony M. DeFino Way to a [[hairpin turn]] adjacent to the West New York sewage treatment plant. The circuit would then have returned south to the ferry terminal via Port Imperial Boulevard.<ref name="WSJ"/><ref>{{Citation |last=Torres |first=Agustin C. |title=Formula One racing is a done deal for Hudson County's 'Monte Carlo' |newspaper=The Jersey Journal |date=25 October 2011 |url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/voices/index.ssf/2011/10/formula_one_racing_is_a_done_d.html |access-date=2011-10-29}}</ref> The elevation change from Port Imperial to the Palisades, some {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/new-jersey-will-host-second-f1-event-in-1934006.html |title=New Jersey will host second F1 event in U.S. |last=Maher |first=John |date=25 October 2011 |work=Austin American-Statesman |access-date=2011-10-26 |location=Austin, TX |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028211728/http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/new-jersey-will-host-second-f1-event-in-1934006.html |archive-date=28 October 2011 }}</ref> would have given the circuit one of the greatest elevation changes on the calendar.<ref name="F1B">{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1blog.com/2011/04/14/vox-certatus-texas-is-flat-so-there-will-be-no-elevation-changes/ |title=Vox Certatus: 'Texas is flat so there will be no elevation changes' |last=Greene |first=Tony |date=14 April 2011 |publisher=Formula1Blog |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152209/http://www.formula1blog.com/2011/04/14/vox-certatus-texas-is-flat-so-there-will-be-no-elevation-changes/ |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Although the circuit would have passed residential areas, residents would not have been cut off from their homes; the organizers planned to provide access to the seven affected residences. The organizers further planned to fund the race without any public money.<ref name="WSJ"/><ref>{{Citation |last=Pope |first=Gennarose |title=Three-day race hits local streets in 2013 |newspaper=Hudson Reporter |date=30 October 2011 |url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/16214733/article-Three-day-race-hits-local-streets-in-2013-Formula-One-cars-in-WNY--Weehawken-could-peak-at-200-MPH-? |access-date=2011-11-05}}</ref>
