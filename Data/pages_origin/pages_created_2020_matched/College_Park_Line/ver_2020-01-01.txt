The '''College Park Line''', designated '''Route 83, 83X, & 86''' is a daily bus route operated by the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] between the [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station|Rhode Island Avenue Station]], which is served by [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]], and the Cherry Hill Park Campground in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park, MD]] (83, 83X) or [[Calverton, MD|Calverton]] (4061 Center Park Office Park Roadway) (86). 83X is a complementary, seasonal Metrobus route that only operates on short trips between the [[College Park–University of Maryland station|College Park - U of MD Metro Station]] & Cherry Hill Campground, via 83's routing. 83 is shortened to only operate on short trips between the [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station|Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station]] and [[Mount Rainier, Maryland|Mount Rainier, MD]], during early morning, rush hour/peak period, and late night commuter times. 83 & 86 mainly operate on the U.S. Route 1 corridor between the [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station|Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station]] in [[Northeast (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Washington D.C.]] & [[College Park, Maryland|College Park, MD]]. Route 83 trips are roughly 50 minutes long, route 83X trips are roughly 10 minutes long & route 86 trips are roughly 70 minutes long.

== Current Route ==

The 83, 83X, and 86 operate out of Landover division 7 days a week. Both 83 and 86 originally operated out of Bladensburg Division from February, 1973, all the way up until July, 2019 when they were shifted to make room for other routes at Bladensburg Division when Northern division closed due to structure failures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dodds |first1=Alex |title=WMATA plans to rebuild its 14th Street bus garage with retail, and keep its diesel fleet for now |url=https://ggwash.org/view/71278/wmatas-redeveloped-bus-garage-is-almost-ready-all-it-needs-is-the-electric-buses |website=Greater Greater Washington |accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> During the week, Route 83 operates every 30-60 minutes between 4:30 AM and 12:35 AM with service continuing until 2:00 AM on Fridays, while Route 86 operates every 30-60 minutes between 5:00 AM and 9:45 PM. On Saturdays, the 83 provides service on a 60-minute headway from 5:30 AM to 2:00 AM, while the 86 provides service also on a 60-minute from 8:25 AM to 7:35 PM. On Sundays, the 83 runs from 6:35 AM until 12:20 AM and the 86 runs from 7:11 AM until 5:00 PM every hour. Route 83X only operates three trips between Cherry Hill Park Campground and College Park station during the morning hours (8:30 AM-10:00 AM) from the third Monday in June through the second Friday of August each year.

The 83 is shortened to operate daily between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and Mt. Rainier terminal only during early morning and late night service. These shortened trips were originally under Route 82 which was renamed the 83 in 2016. Select Route 83 trips operate between Rhode Island and College Park during Friday and Saturday late nights only.

== History ==
=== Background ===
====Route 81====
81 originally operated as part of the North Capitol Street Line, alongside the 80 Metrobus Route, between the Fort Totten Metro Station & West Potomac Park all the way up until September 18, 1999. On September 18, 1999, 81 was rerouted to replace 83's trips on Sundays that were discontinued between the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station & Cherry Hill Campground, via the Greenbelt Metro Station, only with the exception that it would operate on Sundays only and would not serve [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] , but instead, only the[[Greenbelt station]], via C2's routing between the intersection of Baltimore Avenue (U.S. Route 1) & Greenbelt Road (MD 193) and the Greenbelt Metro Station, on Sundays when C2 did not operate. As of September 18, 1999, 83 stopped serving the Greenbelt Metro Station.

====Route 83====
The 81 and 83 operate on portions of the old 82 Maryland Streetcar Line, which ran from [[West Potomac Park]] to Branchville until replaced by buses in 1958. The 82 streetcar line used to operate even further north of Branchville all the way up to [[Laurel, Maryland|Laurel]]. However, the route was truncated to terminate at Branchville during the late 1940s. 82's streetcar route was extended from Branchville to the Seven Springs Apartments and Cherry Hill Campground located on Cherry Hill Road in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] in 1950 when the Cherry Hill Campground in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] opened. The 82 streetcar line was eventually taken over by WMATA and officially became a Metrobus route in 1967 when WMATA bought various streetcar companies. WMATA kept the 82 streetcar line mostly the same with its successor 82 route, with the only exception was the Metrobus Route 82 was rerouted to turn left from Rhode Island Avenue N.E. onto Washington Place N.E. to serve [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] when it opened on March 27, 1976, and then head back onto Washington Place to return to Rhode Island Avenue and continue its routing all the way to West Potomac Park via Downtown Washington D.C.

====Route 86====
86 was created as a brand new Metrobus Route on March 27, 1976 when [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] opened.  The 86 initially operated between the intersection of Dartmouth Avenue & Calvert Road [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] and [[West Potomac Park]], via Dartmouth Avenue, Calvert Road, Rhode Island Avenue, College Avenue, Baltimore Avenue (U.S. Route 1), East-West Highway, Belcrest Road, [[The Mall at Prince Georges|Prince Georges Plaza]], Belcrest Road, Queensbury Road, 42nd Avenue, Oglethorpe Street, 40th Avenue, Hamilton Street, 38th Avenue/ 38th Street, Rhode Island Avenue/ Rhode Island Avenue NE (U.S. Route 1)  and Washington Place N.E to serve [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]]. 86 would then run parallel to 82, [[Rhode Island Avenue-New Carrollton Line|84, 85]], and 88's routing between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[West Potomac Park]] via [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown]] until September 24, 1978.<ref name="1978 change" /> The 86 operates on portions of the old G4 [[Streetcars in Washington, D.C.|Streetcar]] line which ran between [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown]] Washington D.C. and within the city of [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville, MD]] & the G6 [[Streetcars in Washington, D.C.|Streetcar]] Line, which ran from Branchville to [[Beltsville, MD|Beltsville]] until replaced by buses between 1949 & 1958. Route 86 only operated back and forth between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] via Washington Place N.E., Rhode Island Avenue N.E, Rhode Island Avenue, 38th Street, 38th Avenue, Hamilton Street, 40th Avenue, Oglethorpe Street, 42nd Avenue, Queensbury Road, Belcrest Road, [[The Mall at Prince Georges|Prince Georges Plaza]], Belcrest Road, East-West Highway, Baltimore Avenue, College Avenue, Dartmouth Avenue, Calvert Road, Rhode Island Avenue, and College Avenue.

===1978 Changes===
On September 24, 1978, WMATA truncated 82's route from the Cherry Hill Campground only up to Rhode Island Avenue station.<ref name="1978 change">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/09/21/metrobus-routes-change-as-subway-service-increases/e49ed523-b338-44c2-9640-9922d6eb0dfd/ |title=Metrobus Routes Change as Subway Service Increases |first=Douglas |last=Feaver |date=September 21, 1978 |website=Washington Post}}</ref> The reason was WMATA decided to eliminate 82's service between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[West Potomac Park]] was that riders already had the option of getting off at Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood to catch the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] to get [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|downtown]] much faster. Riders also had the option of getting off at other Metro stops downtown where they could catch other routes to get towards [[West Potomac Park]]. While WMATA didn't entirely eliminate Metrobus service between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown]], WMATA launched a brand new new B6 Metrobus route which took passengers all the way from [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] to  [[Metro Center station]] connecting [[Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|Downtown]] which replaced former route 82 service.<ref name="1978 change" /> This changes also affected Routes [[Rhode Island Avenue-New Carrollton Line|84, 85]], 86, and 88.<ref name="1978 change" />

Route 83 was created in September 24, 1978, that would travel parallel to Route 82 except make limited stops and ease crowding during weekday peak hours periods.<ref name="1978 change" />

===1993 Changes===
In December 1993 when the Green Line portion between [[Fort Totten station|Fort Totten]] and [[Greenbelt station|Greenbelt]] opened, Route 82 was truncated to only operate between the [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[Mount Rainier, Maryland|Mount Rainier]] terminal at the intersection of Municipal Place & Rhode Island Avenue being replaced by Route 83 which was extended to [[Greenbelt station]] keeping the same routing.<ref name="1993 change">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1993/12/09/metro-shuffling-its-bus-schedule/29c11358-4cae-44aa-91f7-d1b863257131/ |title=METRO SHUFFLING ITS BUS SCHEDULE |last=Robert E. |first=Pierre |date=December 9, 1993 |website=Washington Post}}</ref>

The 83 operated on mostly the same route as 82 had been using to operate between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and Cherry Hill Campground, remaining straight on Rhode Island Avenue, which eventually makes a sharp turn and becomes Baltimore Avenue in [[Hyattsville, Maryland|Hyattsville]], all the way to the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and Paint Branch Parkway. 83 was then rerouted to divert right onto Paint Branch Parkway and make another right onto River Road to serve [[College Park–University of Maryland station]], and then make a left turn back again onto River Road, another left turn onto Paint Branch Parkway, and make a right turn to once again rejoin Baltimore Avenue. 83 then followed 82's right turn from Baltimore Avenue onto Greenbelt Road. However; the only difference was that 83 would remain on Greenbelt Road past Rhode Island Avenue where 82 and 83 previously made a left turn onto, all the way up to Cherrywood Lane where the bus would then turn left onto and then follow straight until reaching Greenbelt Metro Drive, where 83 would turn left onto to enter and serve [[Greenbelt station]], then turn back around on Greenbelt Metro Drive, make a right onto Cherrywood Lane, make another right onto Greenbelt Road, and make another right to rejoin Rhode Island Avenue once again and follow the rest of 82 and 83's former Metrobus route between the Intersection of Rhode Island Avenue & Greenbelt Road, all the way up to the Cherry Hill Campground in College Park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metroventure.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/81-82-83-86-college-park-line/ |title=81, 82, 83, 86 – College Park Line |date=April 24, 2012 |website=Metro-Venture |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>

Route 86 was extended from its previous College Park terminus all the way to the Centerpark Office Park in [[Calverton, Maryland|Calverton Maryland]], to replace the [[Riggs Road Line|R2]] former routing between [[The Mall at Prince Georges|Prince Georges Plaza]] and [[Calverton, Maryland|Calverton]] operating along Rhode Island Avenue and Powder Mill Road.<ref name="1993 change"/>

The 83 was shortened to operate between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station and [[Mount Rainier, Maryland|Mount Rainier]] terminal early morning and late night only everyday.

===2003 Changes===
Beginning on May 15, 2003, route 86 was rerouted to make a much more straight-forward turn right from Belcrest Road onto East-West Highway when operating in the direction of [[Calverton, Maryland]] and made a much more straightforward left turn from East-West Highway onto Belcrest Road, when operating in the direction of [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] due to a new [[Target Corporation|Target]] store being built at [[The Mall at Prince Georges|Prince Georges Plaza]] which closed the former bus terminals inside the mall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2003/200320/hyattsville/news/158762-1.html |title=Metrobus service suspended at Prince Georges Plaza |date=May 15, 2003 |website=The Gazette |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>

===2004 Changes===
Route 86 managed to keep its original routing in the city of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] via College Avenue, Dartmouth Avenue, and Calvert Road even after [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] opened up. But route 86 didn't directly serve [[College Park–University of Maryland station]], instead having a stop within extremely close proximity to the eastern end of [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] on Calvert Road. Passengers wishing to board and alight at [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] on Route 86, had to board, or alight at the intersection of Dartmouth Avenue & Calvert Road as it was the closest 86 bus stop to the eastern entrance of [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] on Calvert Road.

Beginning June 27, 2004, 86 was permanently rerouted at the request of the city of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]] to serve [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] more directly by following 83's routing via Baltimore Avenue, Paint Branch Parkway, River Road, and [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] instead of operating along College Ave, Dartmouth Ave, and Calvert Road.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metrobus service route changes in Maryland begin the week of June 27 |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=3051 |website=www.wmata.com |accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref>

===2007 Changes===
When the construction of a new curb next to the new Mosaic Apartments built right next to [[Prince George's Plaza station]],  All Metrobus Routes that have previously exited [[Prince George's Plaza station]] from the northbound side, had to do so by exiting the [[Prince George's Plaza station]] via a right turn onto East-West Highway and left onto Belcrest Road. Route 86 was in the direction of [[Calverton, Maryland|Calverton]] to exit [[Prince George's Plaza station]] northbound, right onto East-West Highway and remain straight on East-West Highway to past Belcrest Road but was able to keep its entire routing in the direction of [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] the same as the route was still allowed to turn left from East-West Highway onto Belcrest Road, make a right turn from Belcrest Road to enter [[Prince George's Plaza station]], and make a right turn southbound on Belcrest Road. 

===2014 Proposed Changes===
During WMATA's Fiscal Year of 2015, WMATA proposed to split Route 83 and 86 into four routes . Route 83 and 86 would terminate at [[College Park–University of Maryland station|College Park station]] from [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and be renamed Route 83S and 86S or keep their same names. The second portion was to be named route 83S and 86S or route R6 and R8 and will operate between College Park station and Cherry Hill (83N/R6) and Calverton (86N/R8) keeping the same routing with route 83 and 86. All existing service would still be covered but passengers will have to transfer at College Park station to continue their trips. If the proposal have gone through, it would mark the return of [[Queens Chapel Road Line|R6]] and [[Riggs Road Line|R8]] (unless it was switched to Route 83N/86N) service as they haven't operated since 1993 under the "Queens Chapel Road Line" (R6) and "Riggs Road Line" (R8).<ref>{{cite web |title=MARYLAND PROPOSED BUS SERVICE CHANGES FISCAL YEAR 2015 |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/public-hearings/upload/MD_Docket.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref>

===Route 83X===

During fall 2011, WMATA added a new route to the College Park Line called "83X", which only operated during select times of the year, making short trips between the Cherry Hill Campground and [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] operating three weekdays trips only from 8:30 am to 10:00 am only from the third Monday in June through the second Friday through August.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

===March 2016 changes===
On March 27, 2016, Route 81's service between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and Cherry Hill Campground was discontinued and replaced by route 83.<ref name="3/16 changes">{{cite press release |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=6088 |title=Metro News Release |date=March 25, 2016 |website=WMATA |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref> Route 83 also added Sunday service replacing the 81 but no longer serving [[Greenbelt station]]. Route C2 also added Sunday service to replace Route 81 portion between Greenbelt Road and Greenbelt station.<ref name="3/16 changes" />

===December 2016 changes===
On December 18, 2016, Route 82 was discontinued and was replaced by the 83.<ref name="12/16 changes">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmata.com/service/status/details/Metrobus-Service-Changes-December-18.cfm|title=Metrobus Service Changes, December 18 |date=December 15, 2016 |website=WMATA |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref> Short trips between [[Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood station]] and [[Mount Rainier, Maryland|Mount Rainier]] were made 83 routes instead during late nights and early mornings. Also, due to Metro closing at midnight during that time period because of SafeTrack maintenance, select Route 83 trips were introduced to operate between Rhode Island Avenue–Brentwood and [[College Park–University of Maryland station]] on Friday and Saturday late nights only.<ref name="12/16 changes" />

===September 2019 changes===
Beginning on September 1, 2019 for nine months, the [[College Park–University of Maryland station|College Park]] Metrobus loop was temporarily closed for construction of the [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple line]] at College Park station having all stops located along River Road. As of a result, route 83 and 86 were temporarily rerouted along River Road having to turn around on the roundabout along Haig Drive to return to its regular route going both directions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Temporary Stop Relocation: MDOT MTA Purple Line Construction at College Park Station Bus Loop, September 1 |url=https://www.wmata.com/service/status/details/mdot-mta-purple-line-construction-college-park-sept-1.cfm |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref>
