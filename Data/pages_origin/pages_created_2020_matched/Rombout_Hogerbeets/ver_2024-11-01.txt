'''Rombout Hogerbeets''' ([[Hoorn]], 24 June 1561 &mdash; [[Wassenaar]], 7 September 1625) was a Dutch [[jurist]] and statesman. He was tried for treason, together with [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], [[Hugo Grotius]], and [[Gilles van Ledenberg]] during the political crisis of 1617–18 in the [[Dutch Republic]], and sentenced to life-imprisonment. He shared [[Loevestein]] prison with Grotius.

==Early life and career==
Hogerbeets was the son of Dirk Hendriksz. Hogerbeets, a medical doctor and burgomaster of  Hoorn. When he was seven years old, he went into exile to [[Wesel]] with his parents, because they were persecuted by [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Alba]]'s [[Council of Troubles]]. He attended [[Latin school]] in that city. He studied law under [[Hugues Doneau|Donellus]]<ref>Hogerbeets, ''passim''.</ref> and received his doctorate in law from [[Leiden University]] in 1584. Already in 1590 he was appointed [[pensionary]] of the city of [[Leiden]] and secretary of the [[Board of governors|Board of Regents]] of Leiden University. He resigned these posts when he was made a Justice in the ''[[Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland]]'' (the supreme court of the provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]]) in 1596. As ''hoofdingeland'' (member of the governing board) of the Holland North Quarter [[Water board (The Netherlands)|Drainage District]] he was closely involved in the draining of the [[Beemster]] lake around 1605. In 1611 he was a member of the diplomatic mission of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] to mediate between Denmark and Sweden in the [[Kalmar War]] (which had harmed Dutch commerce). On 8 December 1617 he was again appointed pensionary of Leiden and he therefore resigned his seat in the ''Hoge Raad''.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, pp. 272-274</ref>

Hogerbeets married Hillegonda Wentzen in March, 1591. They had one son and five daughters.<ref>Cf. [http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/Wentzen Wentzen, Hillegonda].</ref>

==Arrest and trial==
{{main|Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets}}
As pensionary of Leiden, Hogerbeets was deeply involved in the political crisis that engulfed the Oldenbarnevelt regime in 1618 and brought about its fall. Leiden was one of the Holland cities whose [[Regenten|regents]] were partisans of the [[Remonstrants]] and had agitated for the [[Sharp Resolution]] of 1617 which authorized city governments to raise private armies, called ''waardgelders''. The Counter-Remonstrants, the enemies of the Remonstrants opposed this, and the [[stadtholder]], [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]] viewed this policy as a challenge to his authority as commander-in-chief of the States Army. In the ensuing rounds of intrigue and counter-intrigue to procure the disbanding of the ''waardgelder'' companies, or to prevent the disbandment, Hogerbeets, together with Grotius and a few other Remonstrant regents from Holland, privately met with a like-minded group of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] regents, led by [[Gilles van Ledenberg]] to discuss strategy in the political struggle with Maurice and the Counter-Remonstrants on 5 July 1618.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, pp. 275-277</ref> This was later construed as a conspiracy.

Maurice went ahead with his plans to disarm the ''waardgelders'' in Utrecht at the end of July, 1618. His show of force thoroughly intimidated the group of regents around Oldenbarnevelt and they were prepared to make concessions. Nevertheless, on 28 August 1618 the States-General, on a secret majority-vote, authorized Maurice to arrest the Remonstrant "ringleaders" and the next day Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius, Ledenberg and Hogerbeets were duly taken prisoner and incarcerated at the [[Binnenhof]].<ref>Levensbeschrijving, p. 281</ref>

As a citizen of Leiden and of Holland, Hogerbeets would normally have been tried by a court of law of that city or that province. This was a civil right, known as the ''[[Jus de non evocando]]''. However, the States-General decided to try the defendants themselves and as the confederation did not have its own judicial branch the matter was eventually delegated to a judicial commission of the States-General (a policy that was not unusual in itself). The pre-trial [[Inquisitorial system|investigation]] in the case was handled by three ''fiscals'' (prosecutors): Laurens Sylla, Pieter van Leeuwen and Anthonie Duyck.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, p. 283</ref>

As an accomplished lawyer, Hogerbeets tried to avail himself of his [[Due process|legal rights]] under Dutch law. However, due process was systematically denied him, though he apparently was not threatened with torture like his colleague Ledenberg. After many interrogations and a long wait (during which his wife was denied access to him, though he was allowed to correspond with her) he finally expected to have his day in court on 18 May 1619. A few days earlier, members of the court had pressed him privately to ask for mercy, but he had refused, protesting his innocence.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, p. 296</ref> When the trial opened he was not allowed to state his defense, but made to listen to the reading of the verdict, that had already been decided upon.<ref>When they told him to be silent he replied with [[Horace]]'s retort, ''Hic murus aheneus esto, nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa'': "Be this thy brazen bulwark of defence, still to preserve thy conscious innocence."; Levensbeschrijving, p. 297</ref> Together with Grotius he was convicted of treason against the federal government and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of his and his wife's assets.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, pp. 296-297</ref>

Like Grotius, Hogerbeets was incarcerated in the fortress of Loevestein. Their wives were allowed to join them in jail. In 1621, Grotius was hidden by his wife, [[Maria van Reigersberch]], in a book chest that was regularly brought for them and escaped.<ref name="Murray">{{cite book |last=Murray |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/ahandbookfortra20firgoog |title=A hand-book for travellers on the continent: being a guide through Holland, Belgium, Prussia |publisher=BIBLIOBAZAAR |year=1838 |isbn=1-117-07017-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ahandbookfortra20firgoog/page/n126 73]}}</ref><ref name="Davies">{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Charles Maurice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9kBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA539 |title=History of Holland, from the beginning of the tenth to the end of the Eighteenth Century, Volume 2 |publisher=General Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-151-01164-0 |pages=539 |authorlink=Charles Maurice Davies}}</ref> Hogerbeets' wife fell ill, however, and after four months she died on 19 October 1620, her birthday. It apparently took three days to remove the body, and it caused him much distress to have to share the cell with his wife's corpse.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, pp. 301-302</ref>

During his incarceration he authored a law manual, entitled: ''Korte inleidinge tot de praktyk voor de Hoven van Justitie in Holland'' (Short introduction to the practice of law before the courts of justice in Holland).<ref>Levensbeschrijving, p. 304</ref>

When Maurice's brother [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]] succeeded the former in 1625, Hogerbeets was allowed to transfer to more pleasant surroundings in Wassenaar, where he was put under house arrest. He died there on 7 September 1625. He was buried in the Groote Kerk in The Hague on 12 September 1625.<ref>Levensbeschrijving, p. 303</ref>
