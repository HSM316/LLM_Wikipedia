'''North Carolina Highway&nbsp;410''' ('''NC&nbsp;410''') is a primary [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[North Carolina]]. It serves as the central north&ndash;south highway in [[Columbus County, North Carolina|Columbus]] and [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen]] Counties.

==Route description==
[[File:Tabor City NC Welcome Arch Jun 10.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tabor City, North Carolina|Tabor City's]] Welcome Arch]]
NC&nbsp;410 is a predominantly two-lane rural highway that begins at the [[South Carolina]] state line and traverses north through downtown [[Tabor City, North Carolina|Tabor City]], mostly along a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 701 Business (Tabor City, North Carolina)|US&nbsp;701 Business]] and briefly with [[North Carolina Highway 904|NC&nbsp;904]]. Heading north, it briefly overlaps with [[U.S. Route 701|US&nbsp;701]] in the East Tabor area before continuing solo along Joe Brown Highway to [[Chadbourn, North Carolina|Chadbourn]]. Along Strawberry Boulevard, NC&nbsp;410 shares a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 74 Business (Whiteville, North Carolina)|US&nbsp;74 Business]], [[U.S. Route 76 Business (Whiteville, North Carolina)|US&nbsp;76 Business]], and [[North Carolina Highway 130|NC&nbsp;130]]. As it continues north it sheds each other highway off as it travels through northern Columbus County, crossing into Bladen County just after passing through [[Hickmans Crossroads, North Carolina|Hickmans Crossroads]].<ref name=google/>

As NC&nbsp;410 approaches [[Bladenboro, North Carolina|Bladenboro]], it begins another concurrency series, starting with [[North Carolina Highway 242|NC&nbsp;242]]. As it enters the Bladenboro [[city limits]], it also joins with [[North Carolina Highway 131|NC&nbsp;131]] before going through Main Street. After crossing over railroad tracks, it meets with [[North Carolina Highway 211 Business (Bladenboro)|NC&nbsp;121 Business]] (Seaboard Street), then soon after splits left from NC&nbsp;242. As NC&nbsp;410 leaves Bladenboro, it crosses paths with [[North Carolina Highway 211|NC&nbsp;211 Bypass]]. {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, it splits from NC&nbsp;131, which continues north to [[Tar Heel, North Carolina|Tar Heel]]. As it approaches [[Dublin, North Carolina|Dublin]], it crosses [[North Carolina Highway 41|NC&nbsp;41]] and passes [[Bladen Community College]]. NC&nbsp;410 enters Dublin along Third Street and ends at [[North Carolina Highway 87|NC&nbsp;87]] (Albert Street).<ref name=google/>

==History==
NC&nbsp;410 was established in 1936 as a new primary routing from [[U.S. Route 74|US&nbsp;74]]/[[U.S. Route 76 in North Carolina|US&nbsp;76]] in Chadbourn to NC&nbsp;41/NC&nbsp;87 in Dublin. By 1938, NC&nbsp;410 was extended south as new primary routing to US&nbsp;701 in Tabor City.<ref>{{cite map |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation|url=http://dotw-xfer01.dot.state.nc.us/imgdot/DOTStateTravelMapHistoric/STM1940.pdf|format=PDF|title=North Carolina Primary Highway System|cartography=NCDOT|year=1940|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref> In 1949, NC&nbsp;410 was extended to the South Carolina state line, replacing US&nbsp;701, and continuing south as [[South Carolina Highway 410|SC&nbsp;410]].<ref>{{cite map|publisher=North Carolina Department of Transportation|url=http://dotw-xfer01.dot.state.nc.us/imgdot/DOTStateTravelMapHistoric/STM1951.pdf|format=PDF|title=North Carolina Official Highway Map|cartography=NCDOT|year=1951|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}</ref>
