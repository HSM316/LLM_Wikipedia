'''Olimpia Cagliari''' is an Italian amateur [[basketball]] club based in [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]].

It is most famous for the period in the 1970s where, under the name Brill Cagliari, the team played in the first division [[Lega Basket Serie A|Serie A]].

==History==
===Early years (1953–1968)===
Olimpia Cagliari was founded on 23 February 1953 when a group of youngsters, led by Bebi Mosca and with members such as brothers Antonio and Carlo Pirastu, split from  Gruppo Sportivo Aquila (founded in 1944, the city's oldest basketball team) to form the club. Its numbers were swelled in the following years by a contingent from Esperia Cagliari, a club that would later become their fierce rivals.
Starting from the regional leagues, the club moved up to the second division Serie B in 1965.
The club would start a collaboration with football club [[Cagliari Calcio|Unione Sportiva Cagliari]] sometime during the second half of the 1960s and change its name to Unione Sportiva Pallacanestro Cagliari.<ref name=OlimpiaStoria>{{cite web |url=http://olimpiacagliari.com/index.php?option=com_joomsport&view=blteam&sid=4&tid=4&Itemid=123 |title=Squadra |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=OlimpiaCagliari.com |access-date=26 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Team}}</ref>

===Amongst the elite, the Brill years (1968–1978)===
Cagliari would beat [[Libertas Brindisi]] 62–56 in Naples during the 1968–69 promotion playoffs to move up to the first division [[Lega Basket Serie A|Serie A]].<ref name=Brindisi>{{cite web |url=http://www.newbasketbrindisi.it/nbb/portale/news/2949/l-avversario-di-domani-dinamo-sassari |title=L'avversario della 6^ giornata: la Dinamo Sassari |last=Guadalupi  |first=Roberto |date=3 November 2012 |website=[[New Basket Brindisi|NewBasketBrindisi]].it |access-date=26 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Round 6 opponent: Dinamo Sassari}}</ref>
Renamed Brill Cagliari with the arrival of major sponsor Brill (a shoe shine brand) and now based in the newly opened PalaRockefeller arena, the Sardinians struggled in their first Serie A season. They won only three games in 1969–70 to go straight back down, obtaining their third win in the last game, against [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Virtus Bologna]], on 12 April 1970 whilst the U.S. Cagliari football team won [[1969–70 Serie A|their league]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegnasport.com/?p=51721 |title=Il giorno di grazia della cenerentola Brill: l'altro 12 aprile 1970 |last=Rubiu |first=Roberto |date=12 April 2015 |website=SardegnaSport.com |access-date=27 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Brill's Cinderella's day of grace: the other 12 April 1970 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094530/http://www.sardegnasport.com/?p=51721 |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}</ref>
They would return in 1972 by beating [[Mens Sana 1871 Basket|Sapori Siena]] after two overtimes for the promotion spot.
Cagliari downed incumbent [[1971–72 FIBA European Champions Cup|European]] and [[1970 FIBA Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental]] champions [[Pallacanestro Varese|Ignis Varese]] 76–75 on 4 March 1973 thanks to [[Mario Vascellari]]'s last minute block on [[Paolo Polzot]], as they managed to avoid relegation that season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,16/articleid,0148_02_1973_0054_0016_5781362/ |title=Sorpresa nel basketball: Ignis k.o. a Cagliari per un punto |last=Tavarozzi |first=Antonio |date=5 March 1973 |website=Archivo[[La Stampa|LaStampa]].it |access-date=24 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Surprise in basketball: Ignis stunned at Cagliari by a point}}</ref>
Led by American [[John Sutter (basketball)|John Sutter]], Brill would upset major teams such as [[Olimpia Milano|Simmenthal Milano]], [[Pallacanestro Cantù|Forst Cantù]] and the beformentioned Varese at home over the course of the next seasons.
The club would play six successive seasons in the league, their best result a fifth place in 1976-77.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/2007/05/17/SD6PO_SD603.html |title=Happening con i campioni del Brill |last=Grazia Pais |first=Maria |date=17 May 2007 |website=[[La Nuova Sardegna|LaNuovaSardegna]].it |access-date=26 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Event with the Brill champions}}</ref>

===Decline and near-disappearance (1978–2001)===
Cagliari lost the relegation play-outs against [[Pallacanestro Vigevano|Mecap Vigevano]] at the end of the 1977–78 season and exited the Serie A for the second division (now [[Serie A2 Basket|Serie A2]]). Brill stopped sponsoring the team and a Sutter-coached squad only ended thirteenth (out of fourteen teams) the next season.
After finishing the 1979–80 season in last place with only 8 points, the club was relegated to the Serie B. In parallel its parent organisation folded that same year because of financial problems.<ref name=Brindisi />
What followed was a succession of name and ownership changes for the club, who only survived through various mergers.<ref name=OlimpiaStoria />

===A modest rebirth (2001–present)===
The club reemerged as an independent organisation in 2001 under president Dario Corsi and from the 2008–09 season started to play in the fifth division Divisione Nazionale C (DNC).
Cagliari stayed in that league for six seasons without earning a promotion until the Sardinia committee of the [[Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro|Italian Basketball Federation]] organised an ad-hoc tournament for the best clubs on the island in order for one of them to promote before the DNC became nearly entirely regional.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fip.it/sardegna/DocumentoDett.asp?IDDocumento=68370 |title=Intervista al presidente del Comitato Regionale Bruno Perra |last=Frongia |first=Fabio |date=21 May 2014 |website=[[Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro|FIP]].it |publisher=SardegnaSport.com |access-date=27 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Interview with regional committee president Bruno Perra}}</ref>
Olimpia beat two other clubs (the tournament was organised as a mini-league) to earn a place in the fourth division [[Serie B Basket|Serie B]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/sport/2014/06/09/news/l-olimpia-cagliari-promossa-in-divisione-b-1.9393858?ref=search |title=L’Olimpia Cagliari promossa in Divisione B |last=Farris |first=Mauro |date=9 June 2014 |website=[[La Nuova Sardegna|LaNuovaSardegna]].it |access-date=26 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Olimpia Cagliari promoted to the Divisione B}}</ref>

Prior to the season, the president was apprehensive over the sufficient funds needed to play in the Serie B (where travel is farther and more expensive), whilst the squad stayed relatively unchanged, though an declared partnership with [[Dinamo Basket Sassari]] saw one of their youth players arrive on loan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegnasport.com/?p=35783 |title=Basket - Olimpia Cagliari pronta all'esordio, Corsi: “Squadra competitiva, vogliamo fare bella figura” |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2 October 2014 |website=SardegnaSport.com |access-date=27 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Basketball – Olimpia Cagliari ready for its debut, Corsi: [It's] a competitive squad, we want to show our good side}}</ref>
The pumas - named after their logo, changed in 2011 from a falcon to a puma – struggled at the higher level, winning only five games in twenty-six encounters over the 2014-15 season to finish dead last and be relegated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/sport/2015/04/20/news/serie-b-l-olimpia-saluta-un-altra-sconfitta-1.11274211?ref=search |title=Serie B, l’Olimpia saluta un’altra sconfitta |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=20 April 2014 |website=[[La Nuova Sardegna|LaNuovaSardegna]].it |access-date=26 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Serie B, Olimpia Cagliari greets another defeat}}</ref>
Plans to ask for an off-court reprieve were mooted over the summer, Olimpia returned to the Serie C – now completely regional except a restricted national finals round – with the aim of starting a multi-year project based on youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/sport/2015/07/13/news/povero-basket-sardo-nessuna-squadra-fara-i-tornei-nazionali-1.11772329?ref=search |title=Povero basket sardo, nessuna squadra farà i tornei nazionali |last=Farris |first=Mauro |date=13 July 2015 |website=[[La Nuova Sardegna|LaNuovaSardegna]].it |access-date=27 August 2015 |language=Italian |trans-title=Sad [state] for Sardinian basketball, no team will play in the national tournaments}}</ref>

==Notable players== 
Olimpia Cagliari's first “foreign” (not from Sardinia) player, Piero Rigucci, was recruited in 1963. Its first genuinely foreign player was American [[Greg Howard (basketball)|Greg Howard]] who arrived in 1969.
