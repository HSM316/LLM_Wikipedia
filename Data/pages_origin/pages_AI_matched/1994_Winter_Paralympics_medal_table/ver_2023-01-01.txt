{{1994 Winter Olympics}}
The '''1994 Winter Paralympics medal table''' is a list of [[National Paralympic Committee]]s (NPCs) ranked by the number of gold [[medal]]s won by their athletes during the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]], held in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]], from March 10 to March 19, 1994.

==Medal table==
{{see also|Olympic medal table}}

The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a "nation" is an entity represented by a [[National Paralympic Committee]]). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by [[List of IOC country codes|IPC country code]].
