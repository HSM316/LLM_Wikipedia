Although she competed in the 400-meter freestyle in the 1928 Olympics, she was truly more suited to longer lengths. In August 1925, McGary established two world records in the 880 yard free, and in December of that same year, she set a world record in the 1,500 freestyle.<ref name=":0" /> She won five AAU titles in long-distance swimming in 1923, 1925–26, and 1928–29 and was the 1925–26 AAU champion in the 1-mile. She also helped the WSA win the team title in same competition in 1927 and 1929–30. With the WSA, McGary won AAU championships in the 4x200-yard relay in 1924–1925 and 1927–1929.<ref name=":0" />
