The '''Sabrewing Rhaegal''' is a proposed American unmanned [[cargo aircraft]] developed by Californian Sabrewing Aircraft.

== Design ==
The hybrid electric [[vertical takeoff and landing]] full-size Rhaegal-A is powered by a {{cvt|600|hp}} turboshaft engine and has [[ducted fan]]s, a {{cvt|30|ft}} wingspan, a {{cvt|3,000|lb}} gross-weight, a VTOL payload of {{cvt|800 or 1,000|lb}} in [[STOL]] mode, a maximum speed of {{cvt|200|knots|km/h}} and a range of {{cvt|360|nmi|km}} at up to {{cvt|22,000|ft}}.<!--ref name=AvWeek27feb2019-->
A larger Wyvern could lift a VTOL payload of {{cvt|4,400 or 5,000|lb}} in STOL configuration.<ref name=AvWeek27feb2019/>

== Development ==
By February 2018, Sabrewing was to fly a 65%-scale vehicle in the fall.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/unmanned-cargo-aircraft-head-toward-flight-tests |title= Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Head Toward Flight Tests |date= Feb 2, 2018 | first = Graham | last = Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>
By February 2019, a one-eighth-scale model was going to be tested while the first full-size aircraft construction had begun, to fly by the end of 2019 and to enter service in 2023.<!--ref name=AvWeek27feb2019-->
By then, the [[Aleut]] Community of [[Saint Paul Island, Alaska]], in the [[Bering Sea]] signed its first order for four Rhaegal and six larger Wyvern aircraft, to resupply [[St. George Island (Alaska)|Saint George Island]], {{cvt|47|mi|km}} south.<ref name=AvWeek27feb2019>{{cite news |url= https://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/sabrewing-s-unmanned-cargo-aircraft-advances |title= Sabrewing’s Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Advances |date= Feb 27, 2019 | first = Graham | last = Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref> The half-scale Rhaegal-B was completed and officially revealed to the public during the U.S. Air Force "Agility Prime" program unveiling.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Agility Prime |url= https://agilityprime.com/#/|access-date=2020-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= You Tube|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q37Qvdo6_JE |access-date=2020-07-07| publisher = Google}}</ref>

At the January 2020 [[Vertical Flight Society]] symposium, Sabrewing announced a larger Rhaegal-B was being completed, to be revealed within weeks.
With an increase in wingspan, fuselage length and maximum gross weight, [[payload]] increases by {{cvt|5000|lb}} in VTOL and over {{cvt|10000|lb}} in conventional take-off/landing.
It should load a single LD1 or LD3 container, or two LD2 containers, through the nose without special cargo handling equipment.
[[FAR Part 23]] certification negotiations were to be completed within weeks, to deliver cargo autonomously in any weather and any [[airspace]].{{ref needed|date=January 2020}}

In July 2020, Sabrewing announced that it had received the first Agility Prime contract from the United States Air Force worth $3.3 million USD for "evaluation" of Sabrewing's Rhaegal RG-1 aircraft. <ref>{{Cite web|title=The Air Force Wants a Flying Car and That Could Be Good for Civilians|url=https://now.northropgrumman.com/the-air-force-wants-a-flying-car-and-that-could-be-good-for-civilians/|date=Jan 20, 2021|publisher= Northrop Grumman|language=en-US}}</ref> In September 2020, Sabrewing announced that it had received a firm order for 102 aircraft from [[Arabian Development and Marketing Company]] (ADMC), a company with IT, telecom, logistics and transportation and media interests, in a deal worth over $600 million.<ref>{{Cite press release |publisher=Sabrewing|date=2020-09-29|title=Sabrewing Aircraft Company Announces an Exclusive Representation Deal and Over $600 Million Dollars In Orders with Arabian Development & Marketing Company In Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/09/29/2100577/0/en/Sabrewing-Aircraft-Company-Announces-an-Exclusive-Representation-Deal-and-Over-600-Million-Dollars-In-Orders-with-Arabian-Development-Marketing-Company-In-Saudi-Arabia.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Arabian Development and Marketing Company |url=http://admc.com.sa/ |language=en-US}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2021}} The deliveries of aircraft are to begin in 2022 to support the air cargo transportation needs of the Saudi Arabian [[Neom]] project.<ref>{{Cite web|title= NEOM|url=https://www.neom.com/index.html }}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2021}}

In October of 2022, Sabrewing  announced that its RH-1-A drone had lifted a payload of 829 pounds (374 kg) on its first hover flight, saying that this was a heavier payload than had previously been “dead-lifted” by any commercial, vertical takeoff, uncrewed air vehicle.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/28/2524280/0/en/Sabrewing-s-Rhaegal-Cargo-UAV-Shatters-World-Record-Payload-on-First-Flight.html |title= Sabrewing’s Rhaegal Cargo UAV Shatters World Record Payload on First Flight |date= September 28, 2022 |author= Sabrewing Aircraft}}</ref>
