The '''Sabrewing Rhaegal''' is a proposed American unmanned [[cargo aircraft]] developed by Californian Sabrewing Aircraft.

== Design ==
The hybrid electric [[vertical takeoff and landing]] Rhaegal is powered by a {{cvt|600|hp}} [[Rolls-Royce Model 250]] turboshaft and has [[ducted fan]]s, a {{cvt|30|ft}} wingspan, a {{cvt|3,000|lb}} gross-weight, a VTOL payload of {{cvt|800 or 1,000|lb}} in [[STOL]] mode, a maximum speed of {{cvt|200|knots|km/h}} and a range of {{cvt|360|nmi|km}} at up to {{cvt|22,000|ft}}.<!--ref name=AvWeek27feb2019-->
A larger Wyvern could lift a VTOL payload of {{cvt|4,400 or 5,000|lb}} in STOL configuration.<ref name=AvWeek27feb2019/>

== Development ==

By February 2018, Sabrewing was to fly a 65%-scale vehicle in the fall.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/unmanned-cargo-aircraft-head-toward-flight-tests |title= Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Head Toward Flight Tests |date= Feb 2, 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>
By February 2019, a one-eighth-scale model was going to be tested while the first full-size aircraft construction had begun, to fly by the end of 2019 and to enter service in 2023.<!--ref name=AvWeek27feb2019-->
By then, the [[Aleut]] Community of [[Saint Paul Island, Alaska]], in the [[Bering Sea]] signed its first order for four Rhaegal and six larger Wyvern aircraft, to resupply [[St. George Island (Alaska)|Saint George Island]], {{cvt|47|mi|km}} south.<ref name=AvWeek27feb2019>{{cite news |url= https://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/sabrewing-s-unmanned-cargo-aircraft-advances |title= Sabrewingâ€™s Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Advances |date= Feb 27, 2019 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>
