In 1976, minerals were found which suggested the presence of [[diamond]]s. A joint venture was set up with [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|CRA Exploration]] which they called the Ashton Joint Venture.<ref name="glns">{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/geologist-left-no-stone-unturned-in-quest-for-glittering-prize-20101125-188zd.html |title=Geologist left no stone unturned in quest for glittering prize |accessdate=14 July 2011 |date=26 November 2010 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=Tony |date=1991-06-07 |title=WOMAN'S WORK |language=en |work=Australian Financial Review |url=https://www.afr.com/companies/womans-work-19910607-k9y4i |access-date=2021-05-12}}</ref> This was masterminded by Rees Towie, managing director of Northern Mining. In 1979, Maureen married Towie's son John, she became pregnant and discovered diamond samples in the flood plains surrounding Smoke Creek, a small stream in East [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] that drained into [[Lake Argyle]].<ref name="glns" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Duffield |first=Robert |date=1980-01-26 |title=Find came after nine years' work |pages=11 |work=The Age |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/77543745/find-came-after-nine-years-work/ |access-date=2021-05-12}}</ref> At the time word had got out that there might be diamonds and rival exploration teams were in the area. To put them off the scent, CRA put it about that Maureen had gone on maternity leave while, in fact, she was tracing the source of the diamonds to the headwaters of Smoke Creek and pegging out the boundaries of her [[Mineral rights|claim]].<ref name="glns" /> This turned out to be the world's largest known diamond deposit, larger than all the rest put together. Today, these diamonds are among the world's rarest gems and the mine produces one-third of global output.<ref name="glns" />

Muggeridge received international recognition for papers on the applications of explosion-sampling techniques.{{cn|date=December 2022}} She directed exploration for Moonstone Diamond Corporation in Perth and then set up her own Paramount Mining Corporation in 2002.<ref name="Maureen Muggeridge"/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ball |first=Yvonne |date=2003-12-13 |title=She's got diamonds on the soles of her feet |language=en |work=Australian Financial Review |url=https://www.afr.com/politics/shes-got-diamonds-on-the-soles-of-her-feet-20031213-jv4fr |access-date=2021-05-12}}</ref> It was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2004.
