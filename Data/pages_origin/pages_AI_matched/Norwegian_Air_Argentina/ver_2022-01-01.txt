==History==
Norwegian Air Argentina was established on 25 January 2017,<ref name=":0"/> in order to access future traffic rights to and from [[Argentina]] and [[South America]] for the parent company. Norwegian Air Shuttle, [[Norwegian Air International]], [[Norwegian Air UK]] and Norwegian Air Argentina share the same branding under the Norwegian Group.

The airline took delivery of its first aircraft, a [[Boeing 737-800]], in mid-January 2018, and gained its [[air operator's certificate]] later that month.<ref name="CFA">{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/news/norwegian-air-argentina-incorporates-its-first-aircraft-757404|title=Norwegian Air Argentina incorporates first aircraft: CAPA Fleet Database|website=CAPA - Centre for Aviation|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flottau|first1=Jens|title=Norwegian Air Argentina is granted AOC|url=http://atwonline.com/airlines/norwegian-air-argentina-granted-aoc|publisher=[[Air Transport World]]|date=29 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130214725/http://atwonline.com/airlines/norwegian-air-argentina-granted-aoc|archivedate=30 January 2018}}</ref> The aircraft was transferred from Norwegian's Irish subsidiary [[Norwegian Air International]], and its [[Anders Celsius]] [[List of Norwegian Air Shuttle tail fin heroes and fleet|tailfin portrait]] was replaced by a portrait of [[Astor Piazzola]], an Argentinian musician.<ref name="CFA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/Boeing/737/EI-FVO-Norwegian-Air-International/E6LxFOgW|title=EI-FVO Norwegian Air International Boeing 737-8JP(WL)|website=Planespotters.net|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref> However, according to [[Bjørn Kjos]], the parent company's CEO, due to delays in Boeing 737 MAX deliveries resulting in further delays to the airline starting service, the aircraft was transferred back to operate on the Norwegian Group's network in Europe while the start of operations was moved from August 2018 to October 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://airlinegeeks.com/2018/04/25/norwegian-air-argentina-returns-its-first-aircraft-before-starting-operations/|title=Norwegian Air Argentina Returns Its First Aircraft Before Starting Operations|last=Diaz|first=Pablo|date=25 April 2018|accessdate=7 September 2018|website=AirlineGeeks.com}}</ref>
