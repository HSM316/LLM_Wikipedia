==Residential vacancies==
In the [[United States]] the [[Census Bureau]] keeps track  of vacancy rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/qtr212/q212press.pdf |title=Census data |date=July 27, 2012 |website=www.census.gov }}</ref>
In [[Canada]] [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] measures vacancy rates of 25 [[metropolitan area]]s and for the 75 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) across the country <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sellmyhouseeasyfast.com/rental-vacancy-rate-whats-likely-to-come-next/|title=Real Estate and Rental Vacancies{{!}}And What's Likely to Come next|date=March 8, 2018}}</ref> and publishes the findings semi-annually in June and December.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/nero/nere/2012/2012-12-13-0815.cfm |title=Canada's Rental Vacancy Rate Increases &#124; CMHC |access-date=2013-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702233129/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/nero/nere/2012/2012-12-13-0815.cfm |archive-date=2013-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Commercial vacancies==
Commercial property vacancy rates can ebb and flow with the shifting economy in various cities, states, and nations. In the United States, for example, according to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' office space was "tight" in [[Seattle]] and [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bhatt |first=Sanjay |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2022060369_officeleasesxml.html |title=Seattle, Bellevue office space tight &#124; Business & Technology |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2018-06-17}}</ref> However, in 2023, the office vacancy rate in the United States had risen to 12.9%, which was seen as the highest ever since one data collection firm began tracking such statistics in the year 2000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Putzier |first1=Konrad |title=Commercial Real-Estate Woes Run Deeper Than in Past Downturns |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/commercial-real-estate-woes-run-deeper-than-in-past-downturns-e0c1f2b3 |access-date=24 April 2023 |work=WSJ |publisher=Dow Jones / Wall Street Journal |date=24 April 2023}}</ref>
