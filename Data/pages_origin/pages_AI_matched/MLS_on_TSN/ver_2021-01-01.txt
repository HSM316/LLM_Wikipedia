==Contract history==

=== 2011 Contract ===
In February 2011, the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] family of networks (in which ESPN owns a 20% interest) announced a six-year deal for national MLS broadcast rights in Canada. TSN and [[TSN2]] would broadcast 24 games during the [[2011 MLS season|2011 season]] and air a minimum of 30 games per season during the subsequent five seasons, all featuring at least one Canadian team. French-language sister networks [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] and [[RDS2]] had similar broadcast rights. The networks also carried the [[MLS Cup]] and select playoff games, the [[MLS All-Star Game]], and additional games not involving Canadian teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|title=TSN Becomes Official Broadcaster of MLS in Canada with Landmark Six-Year Deal|author=TSN|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2011|author-link=The Sports Network|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174603/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> GolTV Canada will also continue to carry selected all-U.S. MLS matchups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|title=GolTV Canada Matches for March 11–17, 2011|author=GolTV (Canada)|author-link=GolTV (Canada)|accessdate=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181933/http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|archivedate=July 6, 2011}} (lists carriage of a Los Angeles vs. Seattle MLS game)</ref>
