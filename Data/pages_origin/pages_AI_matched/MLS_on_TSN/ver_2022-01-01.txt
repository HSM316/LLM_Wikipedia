'''''MLS on TSN''''' is the branding used for [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s telecasts of [[Major League Soccer]] matches. TSN first acquired rights to MLS in 2011.

==History==
In February 2011, [[CTVglobemedia]] announced a six-year deal for national MLS broadcast rights in Canada. TSN and [[TSN2]] would broadcast 24 matches during the [[2011 MLS season|2011 season]] and air a minimum of 30 matches per season during the subsequent five seasons, all featuring at least one Canadian team. French-language sister networks [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] and [[RDS2]] had similar broadcast rights. The networks also carried the [[MLS Cup]] and select playoff matches, the [[MLS All-Star Game]], and additional matches not involving Canadian teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|title=TSN Becomes Official Broadcaster of MLS in Canada with Landmark Six-Year Deal|author=TSN|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2011|author-link=The Sports Network|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174603/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=13481&yyyy=2011|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> [[GolTV (Canadian TV channel)|GolTV]] continued to carry selected all-U.S. MLS matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|title=GolTV Canada Matches for March 11–17, 2011|author=GolTV (Canada)|author-link=GolTV (Canada)|accessdate=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181933/http://www.goltv.ca/assets/1/AssetManager/GolTVCanadaMatches-Mar11-Mar17V3.pdf|archivedate=July 6, 2011}} (lists carriage of a Los Angeles vs. Seattle MLS game)</ref>

Toronto FC regional matches were split between TSN and the [[Sportsnet]] networks (their parent companies, [[Rogers Communications]] and [[Bell Canada]], jointly own a stake in TFC's parent company [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]). In 2014, TSN acquired rights to [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] regional matches.<ref name="bell-mlsprwhitecaps">{{cite web|title=Every Game, All Season Long: MLS ON TSN Kicks Off its Complete Coverage of Vancouver Whitecaps FC This Saturday|url=http://www.bellmediapr.ca/Network/TSN/Press/Every-Game-All-Season-Long-MLS-ON-TSN-Kicks-Off-its-Complete-Coverage-of-Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-This-Saturday-|access-date=April 5, 2014|publisher=Bell Media}}</ref><ref name="tsn-whitecapsdeal">{{cite web|title=TSN to broadcast all Whitecaps FC games beginning in 2014|url=https://www.tsn.ca/soccer/story/?id=439310|access-date=January 21, 2014|work=TSN.ca|publisher=Bell Media}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Bell Media]] reached a five-year extension to its English-language rights to Major League Soccer, with coverage remaining similar to previous seasons (though with French-language rights moving to rival network [[TVA Sports]], and the option for matches to be simulcast on broadcast network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]). TSN also assumed exclusive rights to Toronto FC.<ref name="mls-canadiantv17">{{Cite web|title=Canadian national broadcast schedule for 2017 revealed; CTV to air 7 games|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/02/09/canadian-national-broadcast-schedule-2017-revealed-ctv-air-7-games|access-date=February 22, 2017|website=MLSSoccer.com}}</ref>
