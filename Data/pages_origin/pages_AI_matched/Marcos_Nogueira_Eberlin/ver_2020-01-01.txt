'''Marcos Nogueira Eberlin''' (born 4 March 1959<ref name="urlAcademia Brasileira de Ciências">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.org.br/resultadoPT.php3?codigo=meberlin |title=Academia Brasileira de Ciências |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[chemist]] and professor at the Institute of Chemistry of the [[University of Campinas]]. He is a member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] and received the Brazilian [[National Order of Scientific Merit]] in 2005 and the [[International Mass Spectrometry Foundation#Awards|Thomson Medal]] in 2016.<ref name="urlAcademia Brasileira de Ciências"/>

Eberlin discovered the Eberlin Reaction during his work on [[Gas-phase ion chemistry|gas phase ion]] chemistry, and he and his research group introduced EASI<ref name="pmid18331004">{{cite journal |vauthors=Haddad R, Milagre HM, Catharino RR, Eberlin MN |title=Easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry combined with thin-layer chromatography |journal=Anal.

Eberlin is an advocate of [[intelligent design]] in Brazil, a [[pseudoscience]] on which he also lectures and he has signed the [[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|Dissent From Darwinism]] statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=660|title=A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism (List)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/index.php|title=A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism}}</ref> He is a [[Creationism|creationist]] also, and has said that [[Evolution|evolution theory]] is a [[fallacy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,biologos-querem-reforcar-ensino-da-evolucao,866626|title=Biólogos querem reforçar ensino da evolução - Saúde - Estadão|newspaper=Estadão|access-date=2016-11-04}}</ref>

Eberlin and his daughter have worked together on a different project, using mass spectrometry to detect [[counterfeit money]].<ref name=bradley/>
