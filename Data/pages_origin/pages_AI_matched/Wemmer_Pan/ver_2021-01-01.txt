'''Wemmer Pan''' is a lake and recreational area in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. It's located to the south of the city centre, in the suburb of La Rochelle, at GPS S 26.2308° E 28.0580°.

==History==
"Pan" is an [[Afrikaans]] and [[South African English]] word for a shallow lake.

The Wemmer Pan was named after Mr Sam Wemmer. It was originally a quarry, and was later taken over by the City Deep Mine which required the water for mining purposes.<ref>http://www.wemmer.org.za/Documents/Wemmer-History-1911-1939.pdf</ref>

Wemmer Pan is part of Pioneers' Park, which was built at the turn of the 20th century. Pioneers' Park was formally opened on 26 April 1924 by the Governor General, the Earl of Athlone, on land bought by the City Council. The park is named in memory of the founders of Johannesburg and of the gold mining industry of which it is the centre.<ref>http://www.jhbcityparks.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=28</ref>
