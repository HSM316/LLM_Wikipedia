He was the youngest son of Gautier II de Termonde, Lord of Termonde ([[Flemish]]: [[Dendermonde]]) in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|du Fresne|1971|p=69}}

He was probably as [[Thierry d'Orca]] and [[Aymar de Lairon]] one of the Crusaders who remained in the [[Holy Land]] after the end of the [[Third Crusade]]. In 1204 came from the Holy Land and was with [[Hugh II of Saint Omer]] and his brother [[Ralph of Tiberias|Ralph]] with a contingent of troops to [[Constantinople]], where his compatriot [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin of Flanders]], had just been crowned after the [[Fourth Crusade]] Emperor of the [[Latin Empire]]. Baldwin there named Thierry as constable. According to [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] Thierry died in the spring of 1206 at the [[Battle of Rusion]] (also Roussillon or Rusium) in [[Thrace]] fighting against [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]].{{sfn|du Fresne|1971|p=69}}
