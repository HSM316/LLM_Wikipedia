==Production==
The filming began in 1998 and was the second directorial work by Ravichandran. It was briefly delayed due to the selection of heroines. [[Isha Koppikar]] and then [[Suvalakshmi]] were selected for a role, but their refusal meant that Roja was signed. For another lead role, [[Simran (actress)|Simran]] was selected but due to date clashes, she too was replaced by Kausalya.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Simran replaced by Suvalaxmi |url=http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818181632/http://www.tamilstar.com/topnews/simran2.shtml |archive-date=18 August 2000 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=Tamil Star}}</ref> There were rumours that the film was delayed because of Karthik experiencing trouble due to his health.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sandya |title=Sandhiththa VaeLai: Sandhitha + VaeLai = Karthi + Kausi + Roja |url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210005955/http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/2000/tnyspecial.htm |archive-date=10 February 2012 |access-date=2012-02-16 |website=Indolink}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 1999 |title=Karthik teams with Simran and Isha Gopigar in a new film |url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104192522/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/01-06-99/simran.htm4 |archive-date=2004-11-04 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=[[Dinakaran]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 July 1999 |title=It's Kausalya Now! |url=http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022225524/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/gossip/01-07-99/sunderc.htm |archive-date=22 October 2004 |access-date=2 December 2020 |website=[[Dinakaran]]}}</ref>
