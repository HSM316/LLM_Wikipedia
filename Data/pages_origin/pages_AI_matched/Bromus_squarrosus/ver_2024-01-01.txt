'''''Bromus squarrosus''''', the '''rough brome''', is a [[brome grass]] native to [[Russia]] and [[Europe]]. The [[Botanical name#Components of plant names|specific epithet]] ''squarrosus'' is [[Latin]], meaning "with spreading tips". The grass has a [[diploid number]] of 14.

==Description==

''Bromus squarrosus'' is an annual grass, with [[Culm (botany)|culm]]s growing {{convert|20-60|cm|abbr=on}} high. The culms are hollow and  bear four to five leaves with sheaths shorter than the blades. The leaf sheaths are pubescent and the leaf blades are typically pubescent but occasionally glabrous. The leaf blades are {{convert|5-15|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4-6|mm|abbr=on}} wide. The prominent ragged [[ligule]]s are shaggy and {{convert|1-1.5|mm|abbr=on}} long. The unilateral and lax [[panicle]]s have few spreading or ascending branches that are erect in youth tend to nod at maturity. The [[Raceme|racemose]] panicles are {{convert|7-20|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4-8|cm|abbr=on}} wide, and the branches are typically longer than the spikelets. The [[spikelet]]s are typically solitary, [[lanceolate]] in youth and becoming more ovate at maturity, and are {{convert|2-4|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5-10|mm|abbr=on}} broad. The densely flowered spikelets bear ten to twenty flowers each, with the base of the [[floret]]s hidden at maturity. The [[glume]]s can be smooth or scabrous. The lower glumes are three to five-veined and {{convert|4.5-7|mm|abbr=on}} long, and the upper glumes are seven-veined and {{convert|6-8|mm|abbr=on}} long. The unequal and ovate [[Lemma (botany)|lemma]]s have nine faint nerves and broad [[translucent]] margins measuring as broad as {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}}, and the lemmas do not roll inwards at maturity as other ''Bromus'' species typically would. The lemmas themselves are {{convert|8-11|mm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2-2.4|mm|abbr=on}} wide. The twisted and strongly divergent [[Awn (botany)|awns]] are {{convert|6-10|mm|abbr=on}} long. The small anthers are approximately {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} long and have notches at their ends. The [[caryopsis|caryopses]] are just as long as the [[Palea (botany)|palea]]s, and are flat or slightly rolled inwards.<ref name=Manual>{{cite book |title=Gray's Manual of Botany |author= Merrit Lyndon Fernald |year= 1970 |editor= R.

The long nine-ribbed palea and the oblong spikelets morphologically distinguish the species from most other ''Bromus'' species.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Grasses of Britain |url= https://archive.org/details/grassesofbritain00parn |author= Richard Parnell |publisher= William Blackwood and Sons |year= 1845 |page= 280-281}}</ref>

The grass flowers in June and July.

==Habitat and distribution==

''Bromus squarrosus'' grows in overgrazed pastures, fields, and road verges. It prefers [[loam]]y or [[alluvial]] soils. It is native to central [[Russia]] and southern [[Europe]], but is naturalized throughout southern [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]].<ref name=Flora/><ref>{{cite book |title= CRC World Dictionary of Grasses: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology |author= Umberto Quattrocchi |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |isbn= 9781420003222 |page= 391}}</ref>
