'''Alfred Chapin Clapp''' (June 8, 1903 – May 23, 1988) was an American attorney, politician, and jurist who served as a member of the [[New Jersey Senate]] and as presiding judge of the Appellate Division of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]].

==Early life and education==
Clapp was born on June 8, 1903, in [[East Orange, New Jersey]]. His parents were Alfred Chapin Clapp and Anna Roth Clapp. He graduated from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1923 and from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1927.

== Career ==
He served as counsel to the [[New Jersey Legislature]] during the drafting of the 1944 State Constitution, and was a delegate to the New Jersey Constitutional Conventions in 1947 and 1966. From 1944 to 1953, he was an editor of the ''New Jersey Law Journal''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Joan|title=Alfred C.

===New Jersey Senate===
Following the retirement of two-term State Senator [[Roy V. Wright]] in 1947, Clapp became a candidate for the State Senate. He was re-elected to a second term in 1951.

===1953 gubernatorial election===
{{Main|1953 New Jersey gubernatorial election}}

He secured the organization lines in Essex and Bergen counties, but dropped out of the race on February 28, 1953.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clapp Out of Jersey Race|work=New York Times|date=28 February 1953}}</ref>

===New Jersey Superior Court===

===1959 New Jersey Senate election===
In 1959, Clapp again sought election to the [[New Jersey Senate]]. Essex County Republicans were divided into two factions; Clapp led a slate of reform candidates opposed to the Essex County Republican Chairman, [[William Yeomans]]. Clapp defeated Essex County Prosecutor [[Charles V. Webb, Jr.]] in the Republican primary, 31,551 (72%) to 12,177 (28%). Clapp's "Clean Government" slate of 12 Assembly candidates all won the primary against the organization ticket. His landslide victory in the 1959 primary paved the way for former Congressman [[Robert W. Kean]] to oust Yeomans in a race for Essex County Republican Chairman one week later.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=George Cable|title=REGULAR SWEEP G.O.P. ESSEX VOTE; Clapp Is Victorious -- Other Party Organization Slates Win -- Balloting Is Light|work=New York Times}}</ref> Among the political newcomers who ran on the Clapp ticket was [[C. Robert Sarcone]].

Unable to unify the Republican Party after the primary, Clapp was defeated by Democratic incumbent [[Donal C. Fox]]. He lost by 14,582 votes, 126,800 (51.11%) to 112,218 (45.23%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=744312|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>
