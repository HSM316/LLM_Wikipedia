'''Alfred Chapin Clapp''' (June 8, 1903 – May 23, 1988) was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politician and jurist who served in the [[New Jersey State Senate]] and as Presiding Judge of the Appellate Division of the [[New Jersey Superior Court]].

==Early life==
Clapp was born on June 8, 1903, in [[East Orange, New Jersey]].  His parents were Alfred Chapin Clapp and Anna Roth Clapp.  He graduated from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1923 and from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1927.  He served as Counsel to the New Jersey Legislature for the drafting of the 1944 State Constitution, and  was a delegate to the New Jersey Constitutional Conventions in 1947 and 1966.  From 1944 to 1953, and again from 1970 to 198, he was an Editor of the [[New Jersey Law Journal]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Joan|title=Alfred C.

==New Jersey State Senator==
Following the retirement of two-term State Senator [[Roy V. Wright]] in 1947, Clapp became a candidate for the State Senate.  He was re-elected to a second term in 1951.

==Candidate for Governor of New Jersey==
In 1953, with Governor [[Alfred Driscoll]] term-limited, Clapp sought the Republican nomination for Governor of [[New Jersey]] in 1953.  He secured the organization lines in Essex and Bergen counties, but dropped out of the race on February 28, 1953.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clapp Out of Jersey Race|publisher=New York Times|date=28 February 1953}}</ref>

==Superior Court Judge==
Clapp resigned from the Senate in 1953 after Governor Driscoll nominated him to serve as a Superior Court Judge.  He was the Presiding Judge of the Appellate Division.  He resigned from the bench in 1957.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Jersey Judge Resigns|publisher=New York Times|date=5 December 1958}}</ref>

==Candidate for State Senator==
In 1959, Clapp again sought election to the State Senate.  Essex County Republicans were divided into two factions; Clapp led a slate of reform candidates opposed to the Essex County Republican Chairman, [[William Yeomans]].  Clapp defeated Essex County Prosecutor [[Charles V. Webb, Jr.]] in the Republican primary, 31,551 (72%) to 12,177 (28%).  Clapp's "Clean Government" slate of 12 Assembly candidates all won the primary against the organization ticket.  His landslide victory in the 1959 primary paved the way for former Congressman [[Robert W. Kean]] to oust Yeomans in a race for Essex County Republican Chairman one week later.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=George Cable|title=REGULAR SWEEP G.O.P. ESSEX VOTE; Clapp Is Victorious -- Other Party Organization Slates Win -- Balloting Is Light|publisher=New York Times}}</ref>  Among the political newcomers who ran on the Clapp ticket was [[C. Robert Sarcone]].

Unable to unify the Republican Party after the primary, Clapp was unable to unseat Democratic incumbent [[Donal C. Fox]].  He lost by 14,582 votes, 126,800 (51.11%) to 112,218 (45.23%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=744312|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>

==Legal Scholar==
Clapp was the Dean of the [[Rutgers School of Law–Newark|Rutgers University School of Law]] from 1951 to 1953, and also served as Essex County Bar Association president.  He was the author of a seven-volume work, ''Wills and Administration in New Jersey,'' and the chairman of the New Jersey Supreme Court Civil Practice Committee from 1947 to 1987.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Joan|title=Alfred C.
