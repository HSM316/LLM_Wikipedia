== TransYouth Project ==
Olson directs The TransYouth Project, which is the largest-to-date [[Longitudinal Research|longitudinal research]] study of transgender children, with over 300<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hudl.princeton.edu/research | title=TransYouth Project & Gender Development }}</ref> children enrolled from across the United States and Canada.  The children in the study group underwent social transition between the ages of 3 and 12, with an average of 6.5 years old.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/health/transgender-children-identity.html | title=Few Transgender Children Change Their Minds After 5 Years, Study Finds | newspaper=The New York Times | date=4 May 2022 | last1=Ghorayshi | first1=Azeen }}</ref> The TransYouth Project "aims to help scientists, educators, parents, and children better understand the varieties of human gender development."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/transyp/|title=TransYouth Project {{!}} Changing Lives Through Science and Service|website=depts.washington.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29|archive-date=2017-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205203216/http://depts.washington.edu/transyp/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Recent findings from this project indicate that transgender children are not confused, delayed, pretending, or oppositional with regards to their [[gender identity]]. On tasks, such as the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]] (IAT), which measure social knowledge, attitudes, and stereotypes about gender, transgender children respond similarly to "typical" [[cisgender]] children who match their gender identity (i.e., their expressed gender).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Kristina R.|last2=Key|first2=Aidan C.|last3=Eaton|first3=Nicholas R.|date=2015-03-05|title=Gender Cognition in Transgender Children|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=467–474|doi=10.1177/0956797614568156|pmid=25749700|s2cid=206587706}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fast|first1=Anne A.|last2=Olson|first2=Kristina R.|title=Gender Development in Transgender Preschool Children|journal=Child Development|volume=89|issue=2|language=en|pages=620–637|doi=10.1111/cdev.12758|pmid=28439873|issn=1467-8624|year=2018|doi-access=free}}</ref> Such findings suggest that the gender identity of transgender children is stable and deeply held.

In research examining mental health outcomes, Olson and colleagues have observed typical rates of depression and only marginally elevated rates of anxiety in transgender children when compared to control groups of children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Durwood|first1=Lily|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Katie A.|last3=Olson|first3=Kristina R.|title=Mental Health and Self-Worth in Socially Transitioned Transgender Youth|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=56|issue=2|pages=116–123.e2|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2016.10.016|pmid=28117057|pmc=5302003|year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Kristina R.|last2=Durwood|first2=Lily|last3=DeMeules|first3=Madeleine|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Katie A.|date=2016-03-01|title=Mental Health of Transgender Children Who Are Supported in Their Identities|url= |journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=137|issue=3|pages=e20153223|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3223|issn=0031-4005|pmid=26921285|pmc=4771131}}</ref> Such findings contrast with reports of poor mental health outcomes among transgender adults, who frequently experience discrimination and marginalization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bockting|first1=Walter O.|last2=Miner|first2=Michael H.|last3=Swinburne Romine|first3=Rebecca E.|last4=Hamilton|first4=Autumn|last5=Coleman|first5=Eli|date=2013-03-14|title=Stigma, Mental Health, and Resilience in an Online Sample of the US Transgender Population|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=103|issue=5|pages=943–951|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301241|pmid=23488522|pmc=3698807|issn=0090-0036}}</ref> In interviews, Olson has emphasized the importance of supportive parents and families in helping transgender youth feel accepted, safe, and secure, especially as they transition through adolescence to adulthood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transgender-kids-mental-health/|title="Truly stunning" findings on transgender kids' mental health|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/23/471265599/probing-the-complexities-of-transgender-mental-health|title=Probing The Complexities Of Transgender Mental Health|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref>
