'''"The Last of the Winnebagos"''' is a short story written by American writer [[Connie Willis]].  It was first published in [[Asimov's Science Fiction|''Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'']] in 1988, and reprinted in the short story collections ''[[Impossible Things]]'' (1994) and ''The Best of Connie Willis'' (2013).

==Plot synopsis==
The story, set in [[Arizona]], takes place in a [[dystopian]] future where a [[pandemic]] called newparvo (a virulent strain of [[canine parvovirus]]) has killed all the [[dog]]s.  In the wake of this disaster the [[Humane Society]], referred to somewhat ominously as "the Society", has been given enormous powers within the government. The story's main character, [[photojournalist]] David McCombe, is haunted because despite being a professional photographer, none of the dog portraits he had taken show the personality of the subjects, and of his own dog, Aberfan, he has no pictures at all.
