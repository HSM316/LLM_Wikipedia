'''SM ''UC-28''''' was a German [[German Type UC II submarine|Type UC II]] [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] in the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. The U-boat was ordered on 29 August 1915 and was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launch]]ed on 8 July 1916. She was [[Ship commissioning|commission]]ed into the German Imperial Navy on 6 August 1916 as SM ''UC-28''.<ref group=Note>"SM" stands for "Seiner Majestät" ({{lang-en|His Majesty's}}) and combined with the ''U'' for ''Unterseeboot'' would be translated as ''His Majesty's Submarine''.</ref> In 0 patrols ''UC-28'' sank no ships. ''UC-28'' surrendered to France on 12 February 1919 and was [[ship breaking|broken up]].<ref name=UC-28 />

==Design==
A [[German Type UC II submarine]], ''UC-28'' had a displacement of {{convert|400|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|480|t|LT}} while submerged. She had a [[length overall]] of {{convert|49.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (ship)|beam]] of {{convert|5.22|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|3.68|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines each producing {{convert|260|PS|kW shp}} (a total of {{convert|520|PS|kW shp}}), two [[electric motor]]s producing {{convert|460|PS|kW shp}}, and two [[propeller shaft]]s. She had a dive time of 48 seconds and was capable of operating at a depth of {{convert|50|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=31-32}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|11.6|kn}} and a submerged speed of {{convert|6.7|kn}}. When submerged, she could operate for {{convert|53|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|9410|nmi}} at {{convert|7|kn}}. ''UC-28'' was fitted with six {{convert|100|cm}} mine tubes, eighteen UC 200 mines, three {{convert|50|cm}} [[torpedo tube]]s (one on the stern and two on the bow), seven torpedoes, and one [[8.8 cm SK L/30 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} Uk L/30]] [[deck gun]]. Her [[Ship's company|complement]] was twenty-six crew members.
