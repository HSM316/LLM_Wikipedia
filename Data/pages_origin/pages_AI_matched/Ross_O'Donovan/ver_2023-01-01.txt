'''Ross Kenry O'Donovan''' (born 17 June 1987), also known as '''RubberNinja''' and '''RubberRoss''', is an Australian animator, voice actor, and Internet personality. He is known for his solo work as a [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[Video game live streaming|streamer]], as well as his [[YouTube]] and [[Newgrounds]] cartoons and animations. He co-hosted the internet show ''Steam Train'', a spin-off of YouTube [[Let's Play (gaming)|Let's Play]] series ''[[Game Grumps]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-PYLfduLE Welcome to ''Steam Train''!]</ref>

==Early life==
O'Donovan was born on 17 June 1987 in [[Perth, Western Australia]] to Irish Catholic parents. His sister Rebecca is a journalist in Australia, and is married to [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] cricketer [[Shaun Marsh]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

O'Donovan attended [[Corpus Christi College, Perth|Corpus Christi College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rubberninja/status/499390961823145985|title=@takingbackbeccy yeah I believe it was applecross. I didn't go there though, I was a Corpus Christi boy myself.|first=Ross|last=O'Donovan|date=12 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref> After graduating from college, he studied and instructed animation at the [[FTI (WA)|Film and Television Institute of Western Australia]] in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]].<ref>{{cite news |date=6 April 2009 |title=FTI 2008 Annual Report |url=https://www.fti.asn.au/sites/default/files/documents/FTI%20Annual%20Report%202008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217092130/https://www.fti.asn.au/sites/default/files/documents/FTI%20Annual%20Report%202008.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Career ==
O'Donovan began his career by posting animated shorts to Newgrounds under the name "RubberNinja". He would later establish a YouTube channel and begin uploading content there. His best known work was the series ''[[Good Game (television series)|Gamer Tonight]]'', which was produced for the [[ABC2]] video game-based program ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/gamertonight|title=Newgrounds - ''Gamer Tonight''}}</ref> The series featured a fictitious talk show whose host, voiced by frequent-collaborator [[Arin Hanson]], would interview various types of gamers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2209471.htm|title=''Good Game'' - ''Gamer Tonight''|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=7 April 2008}}</ref>

He also created the show ''Gameoverse'', which featured Hanson in every speaking role. ''Gameoverse'' has since been put on hiatus, though O'Donovan has confirmed the series will return.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/33bd6q/gameoverse_reboot_confirmed/|title=''Gameoverse'' Reboot Confirmed}}</ref>

In August 2014, O'Donovan uploaded a video expressing his concerns with animation videos on YouTube. Discussing the changes made to YouTube's algorithms, he stated that the website was now accommodating live-action videos over animated videos due to the algorithm's emphasis on retention time and upload frequencies which would impede animation channels.<ref name="CartoonBrew">{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/is-youtube-making-it-harder-for-animators-to-make-money-102408.html|title=Is YouTube Making It Harder for Animators To Make Money?|first=Amid|last=Amidi|work=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=2 August 2014|access-date=February 20, 2022}}</ref>

In 2013, after [[Jon Jafari]]'s departure from the YouTube Let's Play series ''[[Game Grumps]],'' co-host Arin Hanson launched a second show on the ''Game Grumps'' platform. Originally conceptualized by O'Donovan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1kiiil/a_personal_message_from_ross/|title=A Personal Message From Ross|website=[[reddit]]|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> the show ''Steam Train'' had O'Donovan joined by [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]], where both would play [[Personal computer|PC]] games (the title referencing online retailer [[Steam (service)|Steam]]).<ref>{{Citation |title=Welcome to Steam Train! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-PYLfduLE |language=en |access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-06-26 |title=Fans Are Upset Over YouTube Duo 'Game Grumps' Break-Up |url=https://kotaku.com/fans-are-upset-over-youtube-duo-game-grumps-break-up-585225892 |access-date=2022-09-17 |website=Kotaku |language=en-us}}</ref> Later episodes of the series would see O'Donovan paired with other members of the ''Game Grumps'' channel and other content creators.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In June 2015, O'Donovan launched a 5-episode miniseries on the ''Game Grumps'' channel called ''Guild Grumps''. O'Donovan mentored 4 members of the ''Game Grumps'' crew in a 5-day race to advance from Level 90 to Level 100 in the ''[[Warlords of Draenor]]'' expansion of ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guild Grumps Trailer | website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXieO5qz4jE |accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref>

=== After ''Game Grumps'' ===
In 2020, O'Donovan left ''Game Grumps'' while keeping a friendly relationship with Hanson and Avidan to prioritize making his own content.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=2 years ago I left Game Grumps to go do my own thing...|url=https://twitter.com/rubberninja/status/1545162777924292608 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=Twitter |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Dan said I'm doing a good job :) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QVNiM9mqz0 |language=en |access-date=2022-07-19}}</ref> He has returned on multiple occasions as a guest and made a brief cameo in a video commemorating the series' 10th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Today is the 10 year anniversary of Game Grumps.

In August 2020, O'Donovan was the target of a controversial advertising campaign by [[Burger King]] and the ad agency [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]]. The companies used a feature on Twitch that allows viewers to donate small amounts of money in order to broadcast unsolicited advertisements. Clips from these streams were later used in a video advertisement.<ref>{{Citation |title=Ogilvy - Title: The King of Stream Client: Burger King... {{!}} By Ogilvy {{!}} Title: The King of Stream Client: Burger King Team: DAVID Madrid Burger King turned Twitch's donation feature into a marketing campaign.

==Personal life==
On 29 September 2012, O'Donovan married Holly Conrad, a [[cosplay]]er, propmaker, and [[Special effect|special effects artist]] who was featured in ''[[Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Cosplay]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whengeekswed.com/blog/2012/11/20/holly-ross-space-and-time-wedding/|title=Holly + Ross' Space and Time Wedding - When Geeks Wed|last=Cassandra|website=When Geeks Wed|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330011952/http://whengeekswed.com/blog/2012/11/20/holly-ross-space-and-time-wedding/|archivedate=March 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3786920/|title=Ross O'Donovan|website=IMDb}}</ref> On 19 September 2018, Conrad and O'Donovan announced on their respective [[Twitter]] pages that they would be splitting up amicably, citing Conrad's decision to move to [[Seattle]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-09-19 |title=Ross O'Donovan en Twitter: "Sometimes life drags you in separate directions, today that is the case. @HollyConrad and I have decided to split.

On 9 April 2021, O’Donovan announced on Twitter that his mother had died due to [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://twitter.com/RubberNinja/status/1380377242216198146|title= This morning my mother passed peacefully surrounded by family.

==Philanthropy==
During production of the series ''Guild Grumps,'' each participant had $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice if they reached the goal. If they did not, their donation would be split between those who won. In the end, O'Donovan was the sole winner and, combined with the participants' distributed funds, donated $5,000 to [[cancer research]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

As of 2015, O'Donovan and ''Game Grumps'' have raised over $70,000 by hosting charity [[streaming media|livestreams]] on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Guild Grumps: Episode 5| website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZnDZsBUkIA|accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref>
