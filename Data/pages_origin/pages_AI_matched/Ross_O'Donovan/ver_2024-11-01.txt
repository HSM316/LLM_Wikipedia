==Career==
O'Donovan began his career by posting animated shorts to Newgrounds under the name "RubberNinja". He would later establish a YouTube channel and begin uploading content there. His best known work was the series ''[[Good Game (TV program)|Gamer Tonight]]'', which was produced for the [[ABC2]] video game-based program ''[[Good Game (TV program)|Good Game]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/gamertonight|title=Newgrounds - ''Gamer Tonight''|access-date=25 June 2014|archive-date=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717010910/http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/gamertonight|url-status=live}}</ref> The series featured a fictitious talk show whose host, voiced by frequent-collaborator [[Arin Hanson]], would interview various types of gamers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2209471.htm|title=''Good Game'' - ''Gamer Tonight''|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=7 April 2008|access-date=25 June 2014|archive-date=18 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118210659/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2209471.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also created the show ''Gameoverse'', which featured Hanson in every speaking role. ''Gameoverse'' has since been put on hiatus, though O'Donovan has confirmed the series will return.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/33bd6q/gameoverse_reboot_confirmed/|title=''Gameoverse'' Reboot Confirmed|access-date=13 February 2016|archive-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305045842/https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/33bd6q/gameoverse_reboot_confirmed/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In August 2014, O'Donovan uploaded a video expressing his concerns with animation videos on YouTube. Discussing the changes made to YouTube's algorithms, he stated that the website was now accommodating live-action videos over animated videos due to the algorithm's emphasis on retention time and upload frequencies which would impede animation channels.<ref name="CartoonBrew">{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/is-youtube-making-it-harder-for-animators-to-make-money-102408.html|title=Is YouTube Making It Harder for Animators To Make Money?|first=Amid|last=Amidi|work=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=2 August 2014|access-date=February 20, 2022|archive-date=18 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718084839/https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/is-youtube-making-it-harder-for-animators-to-make-money-102408.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In spite of this, O'Donovan has continued releasing animations periodically.

In 2013, after [[Jon Jafari]]'s departure from the YouTube Let's Play series ''[[Game Grumps]],'' co-host Arin Hanson launched a second show on the ''Game Grumps'' platform. Originally conceptualized by O'Donovan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1kiiil/a_personal_message_from_ross/|title=A Personal Message From Ross|website=[[reddit]]|date=16 August 2013 |access-date=2016-03-10|archive-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305121938/https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1kiiil/a_personal_message_from_ross/|url-status=live}}</ref> the show ''Steam Train'' had O'Donovan joined by [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]], where both would play [[Personal computer|PC]] games (the title referencing online retailer [[Steam (service)|Steam]]).<ref>{{Citation |title=Welcome to Steam Train! | date=25 June 2013 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-PYLfduLE |language=en |access-date=2022-09-17 |archive-date=4 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104191953/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-PYLfduLE |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-06-26 |title=Fans Are Upset Over YouTube Duo 'Game Grumps' Break-Up |url=https://kotaku.com/fans-are-upset-over-youtube-duo-game-grumps-break-up-585225892 |access-date=2022-09-17 |website=Kotaku |language=en-us |archive-date=20 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920171635/https://kotaku.com/fans-are-upset-over-youtube-duo-game-grumps-break-up-585225892 |url-status=live |last=Amini |first=Tina}}</ref> Later episodes of the series would see O'Donovan paired with other members of the ''Game Grumps'' channel and other content creators.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In June 2015, O'Donovan launched a 5-episode miniseries on the ''Game Grumps'' channel called ''Guild Grumps''. O'Donovan mentored 4 members of the ''Game Grumps'' crew in a 5-day race to advance from Level 90 to Level 100 in the ''[[Warlords of Draenor]]'' expansion of ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guild Grumps Trailer |website=[[YouTube]] |date=4 June 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXieO5qz4jE |accessdate=9 March 2016 |archive-date=4 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104214830/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXieO5qz4jE |url-status=live }}</ref>

In August 2020, O'Donovan was the target of a controversial advertising campaign by [[Burger King]] and the ad agency [[Ogilvy (agency)|Ogilvy]]. The companies used a feature on Twitch that allows viewers to donate small amounts of money in order to broadcast unsolicited advertisements.

==Philanthropy==
During production of the series ''Guild Grumps,'' each participant had $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice if they reached the goal. If they did not, their donation would be split between those who won. In the end, O'Donovan was the sole winner and, combined with the participants' distributed funds, donated $5,000 to [[cancer research]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

As of 2015, O'Donovan and ''Game Grumps'' have raised over $70,000 by hosting charity [[streaming media|livestreams]] on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Guild Grumps: Episode 5|website=[[YouTube]]|date=12 June 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZnDZsBUkIA|accessdate=9 March 2016|archive-date=27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427225621/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZnDZsBUkIA|url-status=live}}</ref>
