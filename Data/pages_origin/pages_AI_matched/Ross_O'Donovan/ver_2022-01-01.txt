'''Ross Kenry O'Donovan''' (born 17 June 1987), also known as '''RubberNinja''' and '''RubberRoss''', is an [[Australian]] animator, voice actor, and Internet personality. He is known for his solo work as a Twitch streamer, as well as his [[YouTube]] and [[Newgrounds]] cartoons and animations. He co-hosted the internet show ''Steam Train'', a spin-off of YouTube [[Let's Play (gaming)|Let's Play]] [[webseries]] ''[[Game Grumps]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-PYLfduLE Welcome to ''Steam Train''!]</ref>

==Career==

===Animation===
After graduating from Corpus Christi, O'Donovan studied and instructed animation at the [[FTI (WA)|Film and Television Institute of Western Australia]] in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fti.asn.au/sites/default/files/documents/FTI%20Annual%20Report%202008.pdf|title=FTI 2008 Annual Report|date=6 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217092130/https://www.fti.asn.au/sites/default/files/documents/FTI%20Annual%20Report%202008.pdf|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> O'Donovan's best known work is the series ''[[Good Game (television series)|Gamer Tonight]]'', which is voiced and co-written by animator [[Arin Hanson]], and was produced for the [[ABC2]] video game-based program ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/gamertonight|title=Newgrounds - ''Gamer Tonight''}}</ref> The series features a fictitious talk show called ''Gamer Tonight with Richard Farkas'', whose host would interview various types of gamers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2209471.htm|title=''Good Game'' - ''Gamer Tonight''|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=7 April 2008}}</ref> He also created the show ''Gameoverse'', which featured Hanson in every speaking role. ''Gameoverse'' has since been put on hiatus, though O'Donovan has confirmed the series will return.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/33bd6q/gameoverse_reboot_confirmed/|title=''Gameoverse'' Reboot Confirmed}}</ref>
O'Donovan started animating on Newgrounds, under the name "RubberNinja." He then moved his animations to YouTube, but as a result of not being able to keep the username RubberNinja, he went under the name "RubberRoss." In January 2014, he received possession of the name RubberNinja, and uploaded a video on his old channel telling subscribers to transfer over to his new one. This video has since been removed.

In 2016, O'Donovan and Holly Conrad were invited to Conrad's alma mater, [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]], to discuss their careers on [[YouTube]] at the Graphic Voices conference hosted by student organizations at the university.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailynexus.com/2016-02-25/graphic-voices-showcases-new-media/|title=Graphic Voices Showcases New Media|website=The Daily Nexus|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>

===''Game Grumps''===
[[File:Game Grumps members.png|thumb|O'Donovan (right) with fellow Game Grump members [[Suzy Berhow]] (left), [[Arin Hanson]] (bottom center), and [[Barry Kramer (creator)|Barry Kramer]] (top center) in 2015]]
After [[Jon Jafari]]'s departure from ''[[Game Grumps]]'' in 2013, Hanson launched a second show on the ''Game Grumps'' platform, originally conceptualized by O'Donovan,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1kiiil/a_personal_message_from_ross/|title=A Personal Message From Ross|website=[[reddit]]|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> called ''Steam Train''. This would replace a then-empty timeslot. [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]] joined O'Donovan as co-host of the show, where both play [[Personal computer|PC]] games (the title references the retailer [[Steam (service)|Steam]]). This broadened the channel's output to three videos a day: on average, two standard ''Game Grumps'' episodes, and a single ''Steam Train'' episode. With the introduction of the show's second season, the parameters of ''Steam Train'' were expanded, allowing for O'Donovan and any member of ''Game Grumps'' to co-host (as opposed to only Avidan).

In addition to this, O'Donovan has acted as a co-host of other shows from the ''Game Grumps'' platform, including ''Grumpcade'', ''Steam Rolled'', and ''Hunting Monsters''. O'Donovan was also a frequent guest on ''Table Flip''. He has also authored multiple content-related animations for ''Game Grumps Animated''.

==Personal life==
Ross Kenry O'Donovan was born on 17 June 1987 in [[Perth, Western Australia]] to Irish parents. He graduated from [[Corpus Christi College, Perth|Corpus Christi College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rubberninja/status/499390961823145985|title=@takingbackbeccy yeah I believe it was applecross. I didn't go there though, I was a Corpus Christi boy myself.|first=Ross|last=O'Donovan|date=12 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref> His sister Rebecca is a journalist in Australia, and is married to [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] cricketer [[Shaun Marsh]]. On 29 September 2012, O'Donovan married Holly Conrad (born 22 May 1986), a [[cosplay]]er, propmaker, and [[Special effect|special effects artist]] who was featured in ''[[Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope]]'', as well as ''[[Heroes of Cosplay]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whengeekswed.com/blog/2012/11/20/holly-ross-space-and-time-wedding/|title=Holly + Ross' Space and Time Wedding - When Geeks Wed|last=Cassandra|website=When Geeks Wed|language=en-us|access-date=2016-03-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330011952/http://whengeekswed.com/blog/2012/11/20/holly-ross-space-and-time-wedding/|archivedate=March 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3786920/|title=Ross O'Donovan|website=IMDb}}</ref> On 19 September 2018, Conrad and O'Donovan announced on their respective Twitter pages that they would be splitting up amicably due to reasons connected with Conrad’s recent move to [[Seattle]].

On 9 April 2021, O’Donovan announced on Twitter that his mother had passed away due to [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://twitter.com/RubberNinja/status/1380377242216198146|title= This morning my mother passed peacefully surrounded by family. It gave me great pain not being able to be there due to Covid. Today I took one of her paintings and my Dad's song for her to make this. RIP Annette O'Donovan. I love you so much.|first=Ross|last=O’Donovan|date=8 April 2021}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
In June 2015, O'Donovan launched a 5-episode miniseries, released on the ''Game Grumps'' channel, called ''Guild Grumps''. O'Donovan mentored 4 members of the ''Game Grumps'' crew in a 5-day race to advance from Level 90 to Level 100 in the ''[[Warlords of Draenor]]'' expansion of ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guild Grumps Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXieO5qz4jE|accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref> Each participant had $1,000 to donate to a charity of their choice, if they reached the goal. If they did not, their donation would be split between those who won. In the end, O'Donovan was the sole winner, and, combined with the participants' distributed funds, donated $5,000 to [[cancer research]].

As of 2015, O'Donovan and ''Game Grumps'' have raised over $70,000 by hosting charity [[streaming media|livestreams]] on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Guild Grumps: Episode 5|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZnDZsBUkIA|accessdate=9 March 2016}}</ref>
