'''Neuroepidemiology''' is a science of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], [[prevalence]], [[risk factor]]s, [[natural history of disease|natural history]] and [[prognosis]] of neurological disorders, as well as of experimental neuroepidemiology, which is research based on [[clinical trial]]s of effectiveness or efficacy of various interventions in neurological disorders.

In 1982, [[Karger Publishers|Karger]] set up a new [[scientific journal|journal]] titled [[Neuroepidemiology (journal)|Neuroepidemiology]].<ref>[http://www.karger.com/ned Neuroepidemiology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This periodical was the first major international journal devoted to the study of neurological disease distribution and determinants of frequency in human populations. It publishes manuscripts on all aspects of epidemiology of neurological disorders, including clinical trials, [[public health]], [[health care delivery]], as well as [[research methodology]].

The founding editor-in-chief was [[Bruce Schoenberg]]. As of 2017, [[George Jelinek|Dr. George Jelinek]], Head of the Neuroepidemiology Unit at The University of Melbourne, was posted as Specialty Chief Editor of Frontiers in Neurology section.

== Congresses ==
To present advances in non-experimental and experimental (clinical trials) epidemiology of neurological disorders, the First International Congress on Clinical Neurology and Epidemiology was held in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/228910/ | title=1st International Congress on Clinical Neurology and Epidemiology, Abstracts | access-date=2021-11-12}}</ref>

==Programs and training==
Several institutions in the United States offer formal training and research experience in neuroepidemiology, including: 
*Training scholarships are offered for pre- and post-doctoral scholars by the Epidemiology Department at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health<ref>[https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/epidemiology/admissions-aid/financial-aid University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health Epidemiology Department]</ref><ref>[https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/epidemiology/research-practice/faculty-research#Neuroepidemiology]</ref>

In addition, the Center for Stroke Research in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation at the University of Illinois College of Medicine offers a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in neuroepidemiology.<ref>[http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments___programs/departments/neurology/education_and_training/neuroepidemiology_fellowship/ University of Illinois College of Medicine Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Fellowship in Neuroepidemiology]</ref> Michigan State University also offers a neuroepidemiology fellowship as part of the International Neurologic & Psychiatric Epidemiology Program.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://neurology.msu.edu/academics/fellowship_neuroepidemiology.shtml |title=Michigan State University International Neurologic & Psychiatric Epidemiology Program Neuroepidemiology Fellowship |access-date=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404192720/http://neurology.msu.edu/academics/fellowship_neuroepidemiology.shtml |archive-date=2013-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As the field of neuroepidemiology continues to expand, research groups have developed at some of the leading medical research institutes across the United States. Currently active research groups can be found at:
*The [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health]]'s e-Brain research group has multiple ongoing research projects.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/e.brain.pitt/ University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health e-Brain research group]</ref> Their conceptual model highlights the use of [[neuroimaging]] in their research.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.epidemiology.pitt.edu/documents/faculty/rosano/overall_research_model_to_pitt_web.pdf |title=conceptual model |access-date=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719112355/http://www.epidemiology.pitt.edu/documents/faculty/rosano/overall_research_model_to_pitt_web.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
*Harvard University's School of Public Health. At HSPH the Neuroepidemiology Research Group is actively investigation neurological diseases including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], among others.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/research/neuroepi/ Harvard University School of Public Health Neuroepidemiology Research Group]</ref> 
*The University of California, San Francisco has developed a Neuropidemiology Research Group through the USCF Department of Neurological Surgery.<ref>[http://neurosurgery.ucsf.edu/index.php/research_btrc_neuroepidemiology.html University of California, San Francisco Neuroepidemiology Research Group]</ref>

Other prominent organizations such as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and Kaiser Permanente have established research programs in neuroepiemiology.<ref>[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/aging/index.cfm National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dor.kaiser.org/external/research/topics/Neuroepidemiology/ |title=Kaiser Permanente |access-date=2012-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309215723/http://www.dor.kaiser.org/external/research/topics/Neuroepidemiology/ |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
