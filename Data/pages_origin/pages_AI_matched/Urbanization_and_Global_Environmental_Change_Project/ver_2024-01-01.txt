The '''Urbanization and Global Environmental Change Project''' ('''UGEC''') is one of the core research projects of the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP)]]. UGEC aims to understand the bi-directional interactions between [[urbanization]] and global [[environmental change]]. The UGEC International Project Office is located at [[Arizona State University]]. 

According to its Science Plan, UGEC aims to provide a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between global environmental change and urbanization at the local, regional, and global scales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sanchez-Rodriguez|first=Roberto |author2=Karen C.

# Processes within urban systems that contribute to global environmental change (e.g., the impact of urbanization on [[carbon emissions]]; the effects of urban land cover change on [[biodiversity]] and [[habitat degradation|habitat]]). 
# Pathways through which specific global environmental changes affect urban systems (e.g., [[effects of climate change|climate change impacts]] on urban areas; decline in [[ecosystem services]] on [[urban climate]] regulation). 
#Urban responses to global environmental change (e.g., urban strategies for [[climate change mitigation]] and adaptation). 
# Consequences of urban responses to global environmental change. 

Additionally, the goals of UGEC include:

* creating multidimensional integrative perspectives;
* promoting parallel and comparative analysis across regions and themes;
* utilizing cross-temporal and cross-spatial scale approaches; and
* outreaching and communicating UGEC-related scientific information to policy makers and the public.
