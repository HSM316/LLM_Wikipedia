The '''Offerman Building''' is a historic building at 503–513 [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]] in the [[Downtown Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. Designed by Danish architect Peter J. Lauritzen in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, the eight-story building was built between 1890 and 1892 as a commercial structure, housing the S. Wechsler & Brother department store. Although the lower stories remain in commercial use, the upper stories were converted into a 121-unit residential complex in the 2010s. The building is a [[New York City designated landmark]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The building has three distinct sections: the original wings on Fulton Street to the south and Duffield Street to the east, as well as a three-story glass annex on Bridge Street to the west that dates from the 2010s. On the Fulton and Duffield Street wings, the first and second stories of the facade are clad in stone, while brick and terracotta were used on the upper stories. The Fulton Street wing is mostly seven stories high (except for the central eight-story section), while the Duffield Street wing is six stories high. Inside, the building was originally used in its entirety as a department store, with various selling departments on each floor, as well as a small mechanical plant in the basement. The building's interior has been rearranged multiple times throughout the years; by the 2010s, only the basement and first two stories remained in retail use.

The building was developed by Brooklyn Sugar Refining Company president Henry Offerman, who agreed in late 1889 to lease the entire structure to S. Wechsler & Bro. (later Wechsler Bros. & Co.). The Offerman Building opened on May 1, 1891, and was expanded along Duffield Street in 1892 after the store's business grew significantly. Wechsler Bros. & Co. occupied the building until 1895, when Offerman took over the store. Joseph H. Bauland operated the store from 1897 to 1903, and Chapman & Co. then operated the store until 1907. The structure was then used as offices from 1909 to 1922, when Martin's department store moved into the building. Martin's occupied the Offerman Building for nearly six decades, moving out during 1979, after which the Laboz family's company United American Land bought the building. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the Laboz family leased out the lowest floors as retail space and converted the upper stories to apartments.

=== Facade ===
On the Fulton Street elevation of the facade, the first and second stories were originally clad with granite, with a light sandstone band above the second story; brick and terracotta are used on the upper stories.<ref name="n126504144" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS pp. 5–6" /> The vertical quality of the Fulton Street facade is emphasized by the use of vertical piers, similar to in [[early skyscrapers]].

The facade on Fulton Street is divided vertically into three [[Bay (architecture)|bays]]: a central section measuring eight stories tall, which is flanked by a pair of seven-story sections.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 5">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|p=7}}; {{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> There were originally five arches at ground level.<ref name="n126504144" /><ref name="NYCL p. 5; NPS p. 17">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|p=5}}; {{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|p=17}}</ref> The central section originally was decorated with a three-story arch measuring {{convert|25|ft}} wide. Each of the outer sections had two display windows measuring {{convert|12|ft}} high and {{convert|13|ft}} wide, with transom windows above.<ref name="n126504144" /> Running above the first floor was a [[cornice]] which divided the ground and second floors; this cornice was at the same height as the former Fulton Street Elevated.<ref name="NYCL p. 5; NPS p. 17" /> During the 1940s, [[Morris Lapidus]] designed a new central arch with a red granite frame and a grid of windows. This arch rises two and a half stories and is surrounded with ornament; above the center arch is a small [[colonnade]] with three windows separated by [[colonnette]]s.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 5" /> In the outer sections, the first and second stories were redesigned in the 2010s with a [[cast stone]] facade, in a simple imitation of the original design, and metal-and-glass storefronts. There are two smaller arches on either side of the central arch at the second story.<ref name="NPS p. 5" /> On the third story, each of the outer sections has four arched windows, supported by colonnettes. There are also lions with the initials "H. O." (standing for Henry Offerman) at either corner.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 5" />

The windows on the fourth through eighth floors were replaced in 2015.<ref name="NPS p. 6">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|p=6}}</ref> On the fourth to sixth stories, the outer sections of the facade each have two triple-height arches, with two window openings per story.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS pp. 5–6" /> The [[spandrel]] panels above the windows on these stories protrude from the facade; this was intended to create the impression of organic quality.<ref name="NYCL p. 4; NPS pp. 16–17" /> Within either of the outer sections, a [[cornice]] runs horizontally above the sixth story, and there are four rectangular windows on the seventh story. The center section of the facade has a quadruple-height arch that ascends to the seventh story; the central arch is divided vertically into three windows on each story.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS pp. 5–6">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|p=7}}; {{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|pp=5–6}}</ref> Only the center section rises to the eighth floor, where there are three windows.<ref name="NPS p. 6" /> There are molded Romanesque Revival decorations, such as faces and reliefs, on the sixth through eighth stories above the arches, and there are stone [[finial]]s atop the eighth floors.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|p=7}}; {{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|p=6}}</ref>

The third through sixth stories each have four windows, while the seventh story has five windows; the rest of the western facade is of plain brick.<ref name="NPS p. 6" /> The eastern facade of the Fulton Street wing was covered by an advertisement until the 2000s.<ref name="NYCL p. 7">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|ps=.|p=7}}</ref> After the 2010s renovation, the eastern facade has had two windows on each of the fourth to sixth stories, while the seventh story has had three windows.<ref name="NPS p. 6" /> There is a wooden water tower above the eastern section of the roof.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" />

==== Duffield Street wing ====
[[File:Offerman Building Duffield Street facade.jpg|thumb|View of the building from Duffield Street]]
The facade on Duffield Street is for the most part six stories tall and ten bays wide.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" /> The center eight bays are in two groups of four.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" /> All of the windows on Duffield Street date from the 2010s renovation. At the ground story, each bay has an arch supported on large granite [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]; the two center arches in each group are taller than the two outer arches.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" /> The arches generally feature storefronts that were installed in the 2010s; the southernmost arch serves as the building's residential entrance, which is covered by a glass canopy.<ref name="NPS p. 6" /> The arches originally had large windows that illuminated the back of the ground-level store.<ref name="n126504144" /> There is a deeply recessed window at the extreme northern and southern ends of the Duffield Street facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" />

On the second through fifth stories, there are quadruple-height arches supported by shallow [[pilaster]]s in the eight center bays.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" /> There are two windows on the center pilaster: one between the second and third stories, which is rectangular, and one between the third and fourth stories, which is arched.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> In the four bays immediately to the south of the center pilaster, there is a [[frieze]] with the words "1890 Offerman Building 1892" carved above the second floor.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" /> There are 23 arched windows on the sixth story, above which is a brick cornice with [[corbel]]s.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="NPS p. 6" /> At the center of the sixth story is a metal [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], which is painted red and bears the overlapping letters "H" and "O".<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS p. 6" />

The northern wall of this wing, measuring {{Convert|100|ft}} wide, has windows that are visible above the roofs of adjacent buildings. The western wall is {{cvt|130|ft}} wide and has eleven rectangular windows on each of the third through sixth floors.<ref name="NYCL p. 7; NPS pp. 6–7">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2005|p=7}}; {{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|pp=6–7}}</ref> There is a glass-and-metal penthouse above the Duffield Street wing.<ref name="NPS pp. 6–7">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|pp=6–7}}</ref> The southern wall has no windows and is clad in brick.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" />

==== Bridge Street wing ====
The Bridge Street wing, designed by Greenberg Farrow, was added in 2014 and wraps around the northeastern corner of Bridge and Fulton Street, extending to the Offerman Building's original northern end. The Bridge Street wing is two stories high and has a facade with metal and concrete frame, as well as full-height glass windows. The ground floor contains a storefront with a store entrance, while the second floor is reached through the original building. The structure has a flat roof above the second story.<ref name="NPS p. 7" />

=== Interior ===
The original building on Fulton Street had {{Convert|20000|ft2}} on each floor.<ref name="n126504144" /> The annex on Duffield Street increased the building's total size to approximately {{cvt|30000|ft2}} per floor or {{cvt|200000|ft2}} in total.<ref name="n126527844" /><ref name="n126480294" /> The building's framework may have included both cast-iron and steel columns;<ref name="NYCL p. 4; NPS pp. 16–17" /> the columns were placed in four rows and supported horizontal girders beneath each floor slab.<ref name="n126504144" /> Near the rear left of the building were originally two elevators and a staircase connecting all floors.<ref name="n126504144" /> Following an expansion in 1892, there were seven elevators in total: three freight elevators, one [[dumbwaiter]] for packages, and three passenger elevators.<ref name="n126527844" /><ref name="n126480294" />

The second basement houses a small electric plant installed by the Excelsior Electric Light Company.<ref name="Electrical Engineer. 1891 p. 523">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESQAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA523 |title=The Excelsior Plant, Offerman Building, Brooklyn |publisher=Electrical Engineer. |year=1891 |page=523 |issn=0097-1960 |issue=v. 11 |access-date=June 19, 2023 |archive-date=June 19, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230619220739/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESQAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA523 |url-status=live }}</ref> The plant consisted of four {{Cvt|120|hp}} boilers, four {{Cvt|60|hp}} engines (of which three were used to power the [[dynamo]]s for the building's [[Arc lamp|arc lights]]), and pumps to operate the elevators.<ref name="n126481739" /> The building was also outfitted with a central heating system, which at the time was still uncommon.<ref name="n126527844" /><ref name="n126480294" /> The ceiling of the first basement contained an extensive system of pipes, which was used to carry cash from various parts of the building to a central cash room.<ref name="n126481739" /> Reflectors were placed throughout the building to minimize the need for artificial light during the daytime.<ref name="n126504144" />

Although the whole building was originally used for retail purposes, the interiors have been renovated multiple times throughout the years. The first major renovation occurred in the 1940s, and some of the building's original decorations were removed after the second renovation in the 1980s, when the upper stories became offices. Following the third renovation in the 2010s, the building was split into commercial space on the lower two floors and residences above.<ref name="NPS p. 7">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2017|ps=.|p=7}}</ref>
