As a full-service library, it has over 80,000 items, and offers materials, programs, and services for all ages which include guest speakers, free movie nights and a monthly book club.

To reach the children's room, students pass through a "magic tunnel", an experience shared by many first-grade students in the city.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Hunneman |title=New Temecula library nears reality |url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2005/03/13/news/californian/21_29_123_12_05.txt |newspaper=[[North County Times]] |date=2005-03-12 |accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

After the city experienced tremendous growth, a second library, the [[Temecula Public Library]], opened on December 14, 2006.

Volunteer services, such as staffing a [[used bookstore]], are provided by the Friends of the Temecula Libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friendsofthetemeculalibraries.org/ |title=Carrying the Torch since 1979 |accessdate=2008-06-09 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=friendsofthetemeculalibraries.org}}</ref>
