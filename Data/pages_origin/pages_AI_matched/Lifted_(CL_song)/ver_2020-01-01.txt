==Critical reception==
Colette Bennett of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' said "something about [the song] seems too simple" and went on to say that "CL's rapping is strong as usual" and "the song has a chill, reggae-inspired vibe".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dailydot.com/upstream/cl-lifted-new-mv/|title = K-Pop Star CL Debuts American Rap Single, 'Lifted'|last1 = Bennett|first1 = Colette|access-date = September 21, 2016|date = August 18, 2016|work = [[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'}}s Tamar Herman stated that the song "diverges sharply from CL's image as one of South Korea's most prominent female rappers and eschews her typical aggressive style. Referencing drugs and liquor liberally while roaming around New York City, this isn't the same CL that K-pop fans are used to. Built for listening to on a hazy summer day, 'Lifted' takes a step back from CL's typical raps, aside from a quick bit at the beginning of the song."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7476920/cl-debut-single-lifted|title = K-Pop Star CL Reaches New Heights on Debut Single 'Lifted'|last1 = Herman|first1 = Tamar|access-date = September 21, 2016|date = August 18, 2016|work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher = [[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> Nolan Feeney of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' labeled it "a solid-gold banger".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/23/bob-weir-cl-danny-brown-grading-weeks-singles|title = Bob Weir, CL, Danny Brown, and more: Grading the week's best (and worst) new singles|last1 = Feeney|first1 = Nolan|access-date = September 21, 2016|date = August 23, 2016|work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>
