A '''flick''' is a [[unit of time]] equivalent to exactly 1/705,600,000 of a [[second]]. The figure was chosen so that frequencies of 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60, 90, 100 and 120 Hz, as well as 1/1000 divisions of all those, can be represented with [[integer]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OculusVR/Flicks|title=OculusVR/Flicks|website=GitHub|accessdate=21 October 2018}}</ref> The unit was launched in January 2018 by [[Facebook]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42787529|title=Facebook invents new unit of time|date=21 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> A flick is approximately 1.42 × 10<sup>−9</sup> s, which makes it larger than a [[nanosecond]] but much smaller than a [[microsecond]].

A similar unit for integer representation of temporal points was proposed in 2004 under the name TimeRef, splitting a second into 14,112,000 parts.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Etymology==
The word ''flick'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Film frame|frame]]'' (as in e.g. animation frame) and ''[[instruction cycle|tick]]'' (as in computer instruction cycle).<ref name="bbc" />
