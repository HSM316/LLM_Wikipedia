'''Dadabhoy Rustomji''' "'''Dady'''" '''Havewala''' (sometimes spelt '''Havewalla''') (27 November 1908 – 21 July 1982) was an Indian cricketer who played [[first-class cricket]] from 1934 to 1941.

Havewala became famous in India before he played first-class cricket. In the final of the Times of India Shield in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in December 1933, he scored 515 (with 32 sixes and 56 fours)<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1983, p. 1245.</ref> as well as taking 11 wickets.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/168/168078.html Bombay Baroda & Central India Railways v St Xavier's College, Mumbai 1933-34]</ref> It was the highest score in Indian cricket until 2013, when [[Prithvi Shaw]] made 546.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/prithvi-shaws-546-lights-harris-shield/86608 |title=Prithvi Shaw's 546 lights up Harris Shield |access-date=30 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811172720/http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/prithvi-shaws-546-lights-harris-shield/86608 |archive-date=11 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When Havewala was around 120, a ball bowled by the opposing captain G. N. Lalljee hit the stumps and deflected without dislodging the bails. After reaching 200 he wanted to retire but was asked by his captain to slog and get out. Havewala started to hit out and some of his [[six (cricket)|sixes]] landed among railway wagons in the [[Marine Lines railway station|Marine Drive]] yards. He reached his 300 after around a further twenty minutes, and ended the day at 453 [[not out]]. A large crowd attended the match on the next day, when Havewala was caught at deep mid off from a mishit.<ref>G. N. Lalljee, "Dady Havewalla's Monumental Innings", ''Anka, journal of the Association of Statisticians and Scorers of India'', July–September 1996.</ref>

Havewala made his first first-class century in 1935–36, playing for [[Mumbai cricket team|Bombay]] against [[Western India cricket team|Western India]].<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15655.html Bombay v Western India 1935-36]</ref> Earlier in the season he had scored 71 against the touring [[Australian cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1935–36|Australian side]], prompting [[Charlie Macartney]] to write, "I have seldom seen finer hitting than that by Havewalla."<ref>''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1983, p. 1246.</ref>

He made another century in 1937-38 for Maharaja of Patiala's XI against the strong touring English team Lord Tennyson's XI<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16485.html Maharaja of Patiala's XI Lord Tennyson's XI 1937-38]</ref> and was selected to play for [[India cricket team|India]] in the last two matches India played against [[Lord Tennyson's XI cricket team in India in 1937–38|Lord Tennyson's XI]]. He made 44 in the first match, India's second-top score in an innings victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=India v Lord Tennyson's XI 1937-38|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16500.html|website=CricketArchive|access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref> In later seasons Havewala's batting form declined and he played as a pace bowler.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bombay v Sind 1941-42|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17343.html|website=CricketArchive|access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref>
