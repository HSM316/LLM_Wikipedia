==Coaching career==

===Career beginnings===
Ayo's first experience in coaching began in his hometown in Sorsogon City, calling the shots for the Aemilianum College Knights varsity team, as well as his high school alma mater's varsity squad.<ref>{{cite web|title=AEMILIANUM KNIGHTS 2009|url=http://aemilianumtv.blogspot.com/2009/08/hit-counter-introducing-aemilianum.html|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> He also had a basketball clinic called ABC (Ayo Basketball Clinic) Ideas, which started as a means to fund an ailing basketball program for Aemilianum College, but was shut off a year after. By the time he became councilor, he continued to conduct basketball clinics for free, until he started getting the attention of then-national youth coach [[Eric Altamirano]], who invited him to the Nike Elite Basketball Camp, and later on, to the National Basketball Training Center.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacinto|first1=Christian|title=Ayo's system of trust puts Letran back on top|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/ayos-system-of-trust-puts-letran-back-on-tophr/|publisher=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>  In 2012, he joined the Alaska-Jr. NBA and JR. WNBA Camp and was awarded the Coach of the Year. His experience in the grassroots level and youth camps have earned him an invitation from then assistant coaches [[Glenn Capacio]] and Louie Gonzales to join the Kia Sorento (now [[Mahindra Enforcer (PBA team)|Mahindra Enforcer]]) coaching staff in the PBA under Coach Manny Pacquiao, which he accepted.<ref>{{cite web|title=JR.

===Letran Knights===
In 2014, Ayo was named the new head coach of his alma mater's varsity team, the [[Letran Knights]], besting the likes of former college teammate [[Kerby Raymundo]] and PBA legend and fellow Letran alumnus [[Samboy Lim]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How did Aldin Ayo get the Letran coaching job?

One year after taking over as head coach, Ayo led the UST Growling Tigers to the [[UAAP Season 82 basketball tournaments|UAAP Season 82 Men's Basketball Finals]] by winning against the [[FEU Tamaraws]] and [[UP Fighting Maroons]] in the stepladder semifinals before meeting the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]].

On September 4, 2020, Ayo resigned as Growling Tigers head coach due to him holding practices with the team in Sorsogon amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] which violates the [[COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines|quarantine protocols set by the Philippine government]]. The resulting controversy led to the departure of some of the players from UST namely [[CJ Cansino]], [[Rhenz Abando]], [[Brent Paraiso]], [[Ira Bataller]], and [[Jun Asuncion]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-04|title=Aldin Ayo steps down as UST head coach; school accepts resignation|url=https://tv5.espn.com/basketball/colleges/story/_/id/29798391/aldin-ayo-steps-ust-head-coach-school-accepts-resignation|access-date=2020-09-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref> As a result of this, the UAAP imposed an indefinite ban on Ayo which prevents him from taking any future role within the collegiate league.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Naredo |first1=Camille |title=Aldin Ayo banned indefinitely from the UAAP |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/09/09/20/aldin-ayo-banned-indefinitely-from-the-uaap |accessdate=September 9, 2020 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=September 9, 2020}}</ref>
