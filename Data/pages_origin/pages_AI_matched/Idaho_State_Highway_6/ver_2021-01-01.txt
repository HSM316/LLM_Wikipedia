'''State Highway 6''' ('''SH-6''') is a [[state highway]] in [[Idaho Panhandle|northern]] [[Idaho]] running from the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state line near [[Potlatch, Idaho|Potlatch]] to [[Santa, Idaho|Santa]]. {{nowrap|It is {{convert|40.645|mi|2}}}} in length and generally runs southwest {{nowrap|to northeast}}

==Route description==
SH-6 begins at the Washington state line in [[Latah County, Idaho|Latah County]] as a continuation of [[Washington State Route 272]], then heads east to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 95 in Idaho|U.S. 95]], with which it briefly overlaps before diverging and continuing east into Potlatch.  {{nowrap|It continues}} east to an intersection with [[Idaho State Highway 9|SH-9]] {{nowrap|near [[Harvard, Idaho|Harvard]].}}

SH-6 continues northeast and north across the [[Palouse River]] into [[Benewah County, Idaho|Benewah County]], generally north through White Pine Drive; and area of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[Western white pine|white pine]] trees in the [[Hoodoo Mountains]] in the [[St. Joe National Forest]]. It terminates at a junction with [[Idaho State Highway 3|SH-3]], west {{nowrap|of Santa.<ref name=ID-log/><ref name=ID-log-95/>}}
