== Discovery ==
[[Fossil]]s of ''Bretesuchus'' have been found in the [[El Brete]] locality, from the [[Maíz Gordo Formation]] of northwestern [[Argentina]] and date back to the [[Thanetian]] stage of the late [[Palaeocene]], about 58.7-55.8 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]].<ref name=Bretesuchus/> The highly bent [[premaxilla]] shows that it lies within the [[suborder]] [[Sebecosuchia]], a group of mostly [[South America]]n terrestrial carnivorous [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]] with distinctive laterally compressed snouts.<ref name=Bretesuchus/><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0087:ANSCFT]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Turner | first1 = A.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Bretesuchus.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Bretesuchus'' capturing an hypothetical notoungulate.]]
''Bretesuchus'' was named by [[Zulma Gasparini]], [[Marta Fernandez]] and [[Jaime E. Powell]] in [[1993 in paleontology|1993]] and the [[type species]] is ''Bretesuchus bonapartei''. The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] refers to the "El Brete" locality, where the fossil remains were found, and ''suchus'', [[Latin]]ized from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''souchos'', an Egyptian crocodile god. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honors [[Jose Bonaparte]].<ref name=Bretesuchus/>
