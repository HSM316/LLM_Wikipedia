'''Georges Ibrahim Abdallah''' ({{lang-ar|جورج إبراهيم عبدالله}}), born on 2 April 1951, is a Lebanese communist militant and the longest held prisoner in Europe. He is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of [[Charles R. Ray]] and [[Killing of Yacov Barsimantov|Yacov Barismantov]] in Lannemezan jail in France.

==Early life==
Born in the town [[Al Qoubaiyat]] in northern Lebanon, he joined the [[Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions]] (LARF) when the group formed following the discontinuation of the [[PFLP-EO]].<ref name=mipt/> Georges became leader of the organization, and conducted its operations from France, where he used the aliases of Salih al-Masri and Abdu-Qadir Saadi.<ref name=mipt/>

==Arrest==
In 1984, Abdallah was driving to [[Lyon]] from [[Switzerland]] to pick up a deposit for an apartment when he was pulled over by chance by French Police. He was found with a forged Algerian passport and subsequently arrested. Police found out his true identity during a police raid of his apartment where several guns were found. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 for the 1982 murder of [[Charles R. Ray|Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Ray]], an assistant [[United States|US]] [[military attaché]] and murder of [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Killing of Yacov Barsimantov|diplomat Yaakov Bar-Simantov]] outside his home in [[Paris]] on 3 April 1982, as well as involvement in the attempted assassination of former American consul in [[Strasbourg]] [[Robert O. Homme]], on 26 March 1984. The murders were for American and Israeli involvement in the [[1982 Lebanon War]] as well as their occupation of Lebanon.<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Nigel|title=Encyclopedia of Political Assassinations|date=15 August 2017|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-538-10239-8|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZMtDwAAQBAJ&q=charles+ray+encyclopedia+political+assassinations&pg=PA218}}</ref><ref name="france24">[http://www.france24.com/fr/20111228-georges-ibrahim-abdallah-condamne-justice-revolutionnaire-terroriste-liban-conflit-israelo-palestinien France24: Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, terroriste sans pardon] (in French)</ref>

After his capture, he testified "I do what I do because of the injustice done to human rights where Palestine is concerned."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/19/world/marxist-christians-in-a-lebanese-town-a-link-to-terror-bombing-in-paris.html|title=MARXIST CHRISTIANS IN A LEBANESE TOWN: A LINK TO Terror bombing in Paris|last=Times|first=Ihsan A. Hijazi and Special To the New York|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}</ref>

== Appeals for release ==
In 1999, Abdallah completed the minimum portion of his life sentence, but several requests for parole were denied. In 2003, the court granted him parole but the US [[Department of State]] objected to the court decision. [[Dominique Perben]], the [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] at the time, made an appeal against the release.

Every two years Abdallah has the right to ask for a new release date, which has been refused more than five times. New laws were created (Loi Dati 2008) for the prevention of reoffending, which were applied retroactively on his case.

On 10 January 2013, Abdallah was granted parole on appeal by the Chamber of Sentences Application of Paris on the condition of an order of deportation from France. Abdallah's lawyer said that his client hopes to return to Lebanon and take up a teaching job.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4331210,00.html|title=France: Lebanese involved in Israeli's murder paroled|newspaper=Ynetnews|date=10 January 2013}}</ref> [[Victoria Nuland]], spokeswoman of the US State Department, declared to the press the US government's objection to his release on 11 January 2013. The United States ambassador to France, [[Charles Rivkin]] stated "I am disappointed by the decision today.... Life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence for Mr Abdallah’s serious crimes, and there is legitimate concern that Mr. Abdallah would continue to represent a danger to the international community if he were allowed to go free."<ref>[http://www.jta.org/2013/01/11/news-opinion/world/france-paroling-lebanese-man-involved-in-murders-of-israeli-American Jewish Telegraph Agency: "France paroling Lebanese man involved in murders of Israeli, American" By Cnaan Liphshiz] January 11, 2013</ref>

14 January 2013 was the scheduled date for Abdallah to return to Lebanon after almost 30 years of imprisonment in France. However [[Manuel Valls]], the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], refused to sign an administrative paper for deporting Abdallah. As a result of Valls's refusal, court proceedings took place on 15 January 2013. The prosecutor, under the Minister of Justice's authority, made a second appeal against his release (the first appeal was on November 2012). 
A complaint was sent in June 2013 against France to the investigators of the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]]. Another complaint was sent to the French Supreme Court against Minister Valls for not signing the administrative paper necessary for Abdallah's release.

As of 2020, Abdallah is still incarcerated in France. He has done multiple [[hunger strikes]] in solidarity with Palestinian protestors. 

Several organizations support Abdallah's release such as [[Human Rights League (France)]], French Jewish Union for Peace and Association France-Palestine Solidarité.

==Personal life==
He is the uncle of [[Chloé Delaume]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2009/01/15/la-haine-s-etiole_302727|title = "La haine s'étiole"}}</ref>

== Honors ==
In December 2013, the French city of [[Bagnolet]] (a suburb located east of [[Paris]]) voted to make Abdallah an "honorary resident." The city council's motion (which did not mention Abdallah's role in Ray's murder) described him as a “communist activist” and a “political prisoner” who “belongs to the resistance movement of Lebanon" and is a "determined defender of the Palestinian just cause."<ref>[http://www.jta.org/2013/12/13/news-opinion/world/french-city-honors-killer-of-u-s-israeli-diplomats French locality honors killer of U.S., Israeli diplomats], ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'', December 13, 2013.</ref>
