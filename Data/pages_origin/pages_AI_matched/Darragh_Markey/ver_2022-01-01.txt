===St Patrick's Athletic===
====2015 season====
Ahead of the [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] senior team's [[2015 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2015 season]], Markey was called up to the first team for the season, given the number 21 shirt, he would also remain with the under 19's while still eligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=6600|title=2015 Squad No's Announced|website=stpatsfc.com}}</ref> He made his first team debut on 9 February 2015, aged just 17 years old, when he came off the bench in a 7–0 win at home to [[Tolka Rovers F.C.|Tolka Rovers]] in the [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/matches/detail/27414/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2015 Leinster Senior Cup Fourth Round – St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Tolka Rovers|website=extratime.ie}}</ref> Markey made late substitute appearances in the [[President of Ireland's Cup|President's Cup]] away to [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] and the first game of the [[2015 League of Ireland Premier Division]] season away to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], his first [[Derbies in the League of Ireland|Dublin Derby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/report.php?report=668|title=Dundalk (2) – St Patrick's Athletic (1)|website=stpatsfc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/matches/detail/27207/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2015 League of Ireland Premier Division – Shamrock Rovers -v- St. Patrick's Athletic|website=extratime.ie}}</ref> Markey went on to make a further 5 appearances in the first team that season.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://ie.soccerway.com/players/darragh-markey/395457/|title=Republic of Ireland – D. Markey – Profile with news, career statistics and history|publisher=Soccerway}}</ref>

====2016 season====
In January 2016, Markey went on trial with [[Scottish Premier League]] champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], scoring in a trial game vs [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/other-soccer/st-pats-teen-darragh-markey-18-scores-on-celtic-trial-34350418.html|title=St Pat's teen Darragh Markey (18) scores on Celtic trial|website=The Irish Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3909/airtricity-premier-division/2016/01/11/19203512/st-patricks-athletic-youth-darragh-markey-impresses-in|title=St Patrick's Athletic youth Darragh Markey impresses in Celtic trial |first=Ryan|last=Kelly|website=goal.com}}</ref> Nothing came of the move as Markey decided to take up the scholarship offer between St Pat's and [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUI Maynooth]], taking up a degree in finance at the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/league-of-ireland-u21-player-of-the-year-interview-2986356-Sep2016/|title=One of Irish football's most promising youngsters on studying finance and trials with Celtic|first=Paul|last=Fennessy|website=The42}}</ref> To secure the degree, Markey would have to get the necessary points on his [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Cert]], which he sat in June 2016. With the importance of his studies having to come before his football, the first half of 2016 turned out to be less productive for Markey as he made 7 league appearances and two league cup appearances that season (all 9 coming on from the substitutes bench) as Pat's won the [[2016 League of Ireland Cup|2016 League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.ie/domestic/news/st-pats-retain-ea-sports-cup-after-thrilling-final|title=St Pat's retain EA SPORTS Cup after thrilling final – Football Association of Ireland|website=fai.ie}}</ref>

====2017 season====
Markey changed squad number to the number 14 ahead of the [[2017 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2017 season]]. On 17 April Markey made his first start for the first team in a win over [[Bray Wanderers F.C.|Bray Wanderers]] in the [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/matches/detail/31049/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2017 League Cup Second Round – St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Bray Wanderers|website=extratime.ie}}</ref> He then made his first league start 4 days later against [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/30222/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2017 League of Ireland Premier Division – St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Cork City|website=extratime.ie}}</ref> His performances in these games stood out and earned him plaudits from fans, pundits and most importantly manager [[Liam Buckley]], who kept him in the starting 11. He was nominated for the [[League of Ireland Premier Division Player of the Month]] for May 2017 but just lost out to [[Ryan Delaney (Irish footballer)|Ryan Delaney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/league-of-ireland-swai-player-of-the-month-premier-division-nominees-3442465-Jun2017/|title=The nominees for May's League of Ireland Player of the Month have been announced|first=Aaron|last=Gallagher|website=The42}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/darragh-markey-15-june-2017-3444847-Jun2017/|title=Markey shining as an example of the new breed of Irish footballer|first=Paul|last=Dollery|website=The42}}</ref> He went on to make a total of 18 league appearances, 22 in all competitions and his form in those games saw him voted as [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] Young Player of the Year by the club's fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=7645|title=2017 Awards Night Winners|website=stpatsfc.com}}</ref>

====2018 season====
Markey's shirt number changed again to number 15 ahead of the [[2018 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2018 season]]. He started the season out of the starting 11, having to come off the bench in the first few games but regained his spot in the [[Midfielder (association football)#Attacking midfielder|Attacking midfielder]] role in the 0–0 draw with [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/32981/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2018 League of Ireland Premier Division – St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Dundalk|website=extratime.ie}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal on 15 May 2018 in a 5–2 win over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extratime.com/matches/detail/33040/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2018 League of Ireland Premier Division – St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Derry City|website=extratime.com}}</ref> His next goal came on 10 August when he opened the scoring in a 5–0 win over Inchicore Athletic in the [[2018 FAI Cup|FAI Cup First Round]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.extratime.com/matches/detail/34714/2/|title=Extratime.ie – Live Updates – 2018 FAI Cup First Round – Inchicore Athletic -v- St. Patrick's Athletic|website=extratime.com}}</ref> The season proved to be a disappointment for his side as they missed out on [[UEFA|European football]] once again, which saw the departure of [[Liam Buckley]] as manager. On a personal level for Markey however, the season was another big step in his development, making 36 appearances and scoring 2 goals.<ref name="auto"/>

====2019 season====
Following on from a full season as a regular starter, Markey was given the number 8 shirt for the [[2019 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2019 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=8214|title=Squad Numbers Unveiled|website=stpatsfc.com}}</ref> Markey had to wait until 15 March 2019 for his first appearance of the season under new manager [[Harry Kenny]], coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 loss away to [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ie.soccerway.com/matches/2019/03/15/ireland-republic/premier-league/waterford-united-fc/st-patricks-athletic-fc/2950196/|title=Waterford vs. St Patrick's Athletic – 15 March 2019|publisher=Soccerway}}</ref> He had to wait a month for his next appearance, making his first start of the season in a 1–1 draw away to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ie.soccerway.com/matches/2019/04/12/ireland-republic/premier-league/cork-city-football-club/st-patricks-athletic-fc/2950213/|title=Cork City vs. St Patrick's Athletic – 12 April 2019|publisher=Soccerway}}</ref> From then on he remained a mainstay in the team and on 17 May he scored his first goal of the season, opening the scoring in the [[Derbies in the League of Ireland|Dublin derby]] against [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] with a looping header over [[James Talbot (footballer)|James Talbot]] in the 40th minute.<ref>https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/match/st-patricks-athletic-vs-bohemians/id-025K469U30000000VUM100GLVVH56HPG {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref> Markey saw his first taste of [[UEFA|European football]] when he came off the bench away to [[IFK Norrköping]] of Sweden in a [[UEFA Europa League]] Qualifier, assisting [[Conor Clifford]]'s goal in a 2–1 loss for Pat's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/2027617--norrkoping-vs-st-patrick-s/lineups/?iv=true&referrer=%2fuefaeuropaleague%2fseason%3d2020%2fmatches%2fround%3d2001146%2fmatch%3d2027617%2flineups%2findex|title=Norrköping-St Patrick's &#124; Line-ups &#124; UEFA Europa League|publisher=UEFA}}</ref> With the side struggling in front of goal, manager [[Harry Kenny]] was replaced by [[Stephen O'Donnell (Irish footballer)|Stephen O'Donnell]] following a shock cup exit to [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|UCD]] in late August and in [[Stephen O'Donnell (Irish footballer)|O'Donnell]]'s first match, Markey scored in a 2–1 win away to [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] on 6 September 2019.<ref>https://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/match/finn-harps-fc-vs-st-patricks-athletic/id-025K46ADNK000000VUM100GLVVH56HPG {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref> He finished the season with 30 appearances and 2 goals in all competitions.<ref name="auto"/>

====2020 season====
The [[2020 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2020 season]] was a difficult one for Markey as the league season was halved due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland#Response|Coronavirus pandemic]] which also saw the [[2020 League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]] and [[2019–20 Leinster Senior Cup|Leinster Senior Cup]] abandoned.
