==History==
[[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] pioneer and philanthropist [[Eugene Preston Foster]] initiated the idea of a county park system<ref>[http://portal.countyofventura.org/portal/page/portal/GSA/parks_department_-_Directory/docs/HISTORY_OF_THE_VENTURA_COUNTY.pdf HISTORY OF THE VENTURA COUNTY PARKS DEPARTMENT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101070250/http://portal.countyofventura.org/portal/page/portal/GSA/parks_department_-_Directory/docs/HISTORY_OF_THE_VENTURA_COUNTY.pdf |date=November 1, 2014 }}</ref> in 1904; the {{convert|205|acre|km2|adj=on}} Foster Park was established in 1908. The concrete [[amphitheatre]] began construction in the summer of 1928<ref>{{cite news |title=Bowl will be started at Ventura |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1928-07-09 |page=A10 }}</ref> and was dedicated on November 26, 1928.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dedicate bowl near Ventura |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1928-11-25 |page=B8 |quote=With the dedication of Foster Bowl tomorrow afternoon Ventura county will have taken another important cultural stride. }}</ref>

The bowl was used frequently into the 1960s, but in the 1970s it saw less use as people started to shift to Libbey Bowl in [[Ojai]]. The bowl was occasionally used after the 1970s but fell into disrepair. An attempt to renovate Foster Park Bowl was mounted in 1988 by the Ventura County Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite news |first=Meg |last=Sullivan |title=Shakespeare, Sweat Revive Deteriorating Foster Bowl |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1988-09-08 |quote= The group, which has roamed from theater to theater in Ventura and Oxnard over its lifetime, hopes to persuade county officials to allow it to thoroughly renovate Foster Bowl as a permanent, year-round venue for children's theater and Broadway musicals.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-08/news/ve-2097_1_foster-bowl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Pool |title=Bowl-Bound Amphitheater |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1990-03-30 |page=B1 |quote=Ventura County parks officials have turned over the keys to the Foster Park Bowl to Elizabeth Harris in return for a promise that she will renovate and upgrade the open-air amphitheater that is tucked into the side of a hill between Ojai and Ventura. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-30/local/me-81_1_foster-park}}</ref>

As of 2009, Teenagers for The Preservation of Historical Landmarks, a student group based at [[Foothill Technology High School]], are working to get the necessary permits and release forms in order to go to the bowl and do an initial cleanup. The group is planning various fundraisers to pay for the stage to be reinforced, which a 2007 assessment stated would require $30,000 worth of work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
