'''Ida May Mellen''' (1877–1970) was an American [[ichthyologist]] and [[biologist]]. She worked at the [[New York Aquarium]] from 1916 to 1929.<ref name="SIA1">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Ida May Mellen (1877-1970) | work=Acc. 90-105 - Science Service, Records, 1920s-1970s, Smithsonian Institution Archives | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]] | url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_306346 | accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref>

She was born in [[New York City]] to Mary Davis and Andrew Jackson Mellen in 1877. After graduating from the [[Lockwood Academy]] in Brooklyn, Mellen attended Browne’s Business School, 76 Court Street, Brooklyn, from which she graduated in 1900.

She spent several years as a law reporter in New York while she also studied at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at Woods Hole (1908–1910). She joined the New York Aquarium in 1916 as secretary to Aquarium Director [[Charles Haskins Townsend|Charles H. Townsend]], and later became involved in the scientific work of the Aquarium.

Within a short time, she was writing articles for the ''Bulletin of the [[New York Zoological Society]],'' which operated the Aquarium. Her first article, “Some Babies of the Sea,” appeared in the ''Bulletin'' in March 1917. She frequently contributed to the ''Bulletin'' and published several books, including ''Fishes in the Home'' (1927).<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/viaf-NLA%7C000035794000  WorldCatAuthorities]</ref>

In 1929, she left the New York Aquarium. The reason for her departure is unclear. But over the years, she continued her own research and writing on a variety of topics, not just fish, and she published both fiction and nonfiction. She adopted the pseudonyms George Otis and Esmeralda de Mar for some of her work.

Mellen died in 1970. The fish [[platyhelminth]] parasite ''[[Neobenedenia|Neobenedenia melleni]]'' of aquarium fish was named in her honor.<ref>[http://folia.paru.cas.cz/pdfs/showpdf.php?pdf=20703 Folia Parasitologica 51: 109–122, 2004]</ref>
