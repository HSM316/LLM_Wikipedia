The '''Banco Convention of 1905''', between the United States and Mexico, was negotiated and signed in 1905<ref name="C1905"/> and ratified by both nations in 1907. It resulted in 247 exchanges of bancos (land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated by a cutoff often by the rapid erosion of the river channel) between the two nations from 1910 to 1976.<ref name="ibwc">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html |title=Treaties between the U.S. and Mexico |publisher=International Boundary and Water Commission |access-date=2015-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601081248/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html |archive-date=2015-06-01 }}</ref> Most of them were in the [[Lower Rio Grande Valley]], the [[Presidio Valley]] and the El Paso-Juarez Valley. In 1927, the convention was applied to the short international border on the Colorado River.<ref name="DOI"/>

==Background==
[[File:Kanuti River October 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a banco, created when a meander is cut off by a new, shorter channel, leaving a cut-off section of land surrounded by a U-shaped [[oxbow lake]].]]
[[File:Los Indios Banco -98 81959 W 26 36393 N.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial photo of Ringgold Banco, opposite Rio Grande City, Texas; exchanged from the United States to Mexico on September 26, 1949.]]
In 1884, a further treaty set out to clarify the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].  The [[Convention between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico touching the international boundary line where it follows the bed of the Rio Colorado|Convention of November 12, 1884]] established the rules for determining the location of the US-Mexico boundary when the meandering rivers of the international border transferred tracts of land from one bank of the river to the other.<ref name="Lee"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/TREATY_OF_1884.pdf|title=Convention Between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico, Touching the International Boundary Line where it follows the Bed of the Rio Colorado|date=November 12, 1884|access-date=2015-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006191148/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/TREATY_OF_1884.pdf|archive-date=October 6, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The treaty stated that if the river changed course gradually through a process of [[soil erosion]], then the boundary should follow the new course of the river.  However, a sudden change of course, for example one caused by a flood, would not affect the boundary. Nevertheless, the clarifications established in the treaty of 1884 did not resolve the question of land ownership.<ref name="Lee"/>

The [[Convention to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the changes which take place in the beds of the Rio Grande and Colorado River|Convention of March 1, 1889]] established the [[International Boundary and Water Commission|International Boundary Commission]] (IBC) to apply the rules in the 1884 Convention.<ref name="ibwc"/>  It was modified by the Banco Convention of March 20, 1905 to retain the courses of the Rio Grande and the Colorado River as international boundaries in the event of sudden changes.<ref name="ibwc"/>

Because the course of the Rio Grande was not static, to maintain the location of the river as the international boundary presented diplomatic and practical challenges.  The river changed course frequently where it flowed through areas of relatively loose [[alluvial soil]], doubling back on itself as it wound its way through the Lower Rio Grande Valley.  Especially in times of flooding, tracts of land called "bancos" were created by [[Avulsion (legal term)|avulsive changes]] that cut off entire [[Oxbow lake|oxbow-shaped meanders]].

The result of these cut-offs was often confusion regarding sovereignty, land ownership, and law enforcement.<ref name="Lee">{{cite book |title =Mexico and the United States |editor-last= Stacy| editor-first=Lee |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |page=146 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DSzyMGh8pNwC&dq=Mexico+United+States+treaty+of+1884&pg=PA146|year=2003| isbn= 9780761474029 |access-date= 2015-06-12}}</ref>  The purpose of the 1905 convention was to eliminate these bancos from the effects of Article II of the US-Mexico Convention of 1884, to which they otherwise would have been subject, and to establish a more definitive means to settle matters.  Any bancos larger than {{convert|250|ha}} or with a population over 200 were excluded from the 1905 convention.<ref name="C1905">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Convention_of_1905.pdf |title=Convention between the United States and Mexico for the Elimination of the Bancos in the Rio Grande from the Effects of Article II of the Treaty of November 12, 1884 (35 Stat.1863) |date=March 20, 1905 |access-date=2015-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009042029/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Convention_of_1905.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2015 }}</ref>

The [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] was charged with implementing the convention.

In 1927 under this convention, the U.S. acquired two bancos from Mexico at the [[Colorado River]] border with [[Arizona]]. Farmers Banco, covering {{cvt|583.4|acre|km2}}, a part of the [[Cocopah Indian Reservation]], was ceded to the U.S. with controversy.<ref name="DOI">{{cite book| publisher=United States.
