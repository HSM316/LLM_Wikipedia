The '''Sanctuary of Maria Santissima del Fiume''' is located in the territory of [[Alcamo]] ([[Province of Trapani]], in the [[Trunk Road]] 113 (strada statale 113), just after the junction Alcamo Ovest of [[Autostrada A29 (Italy)]].

== History ==
In July 1820 there were some insurrections in [[Naples]] and Sicily; the reason was the concession of the [[Constitution of Spain]] by [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], most of the population, on the contrary, would have liked the sicilian Constitution of 1812 .<ref name="Mira">F.M.Mirabella: Alcamensia p.101-103; ed.Sarograf, Alcamo, 1980</ref>
In Alcamo this rebellion, against taxes and the duty on wine,<ref name="Mira" /> was known as ''Lu ribeddu di lu 1820''; there were the assault against the Town Hall and the destruction of several documents,<ref name="Messi">Salvatore Messina: Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell’arte; ed. Campo, 2015</ref> they even put houses and notary publics on fire, killed some important people, including two police officers.

In [[Palermo]] the [[Bourbons]] were thrown out and they formed a provisional government that asked for independence; in order to suppress these insurrections, the king sent the general [[Florestano Pepe]] with about 60.000 soldiers from Naples. While Colonel Flugy was moving from [[Trapani]] towards Palermo, he was forced to withdraw with his troops as he was fought off by the rebels from Alcamo, rushed in great numbers in the area of the [[Crinisus (river)|Crimisus(river)]] (fiume [[Freddo]]).

The tradition assigns a miracle to ''Our Lady of the River'' (Madonna del Fiume), through the providential rains that stopped the Bourbon troops;<ref name="Cata">Carlo Cataldo: I Giardini di Adone p.248; Grafiche Campo, Alcamo, 1992</ref> in her honour they built a chapel.<ref name="Messi" /> General Pepe, being considered weak against the rebels, was obliged to return to Naples, and General [[Pietro Colletta]], who replaced him, suppressed the insurrection.

The poet ''Peppi Enia'', in his poem in eighths entitled  ''Lu ribeddu di lu 1820'', refers to the [[aedicula]] which today is located next to the chapel near the river, with these words:

''Pi stu triunfu di l'antichitati

''Sta figuredda a stu ciumi viditi.''<ref name="Cata" />

(That is: For this old triumph, you can see this ‘’fiuredda’’ near the river).
=== Description ===
The sanctuary was built in the early 1900s; inside it there is the statue of ''Our Lady of the River'', carved by ''Giuseppe Ospedale'' in 1925, and a [[fresco]] on the ceiling realized by ''Liborio Pirrone'', a painter from Alcamo.
In May the chapel is a centre of [[pilgrimages]], above all on Saturday mornings when they celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The feast, together with its rural festival, is held on the first Sunday of August.
