The Monkey's Paw was created in 2006 by the owner Stephen Fowler after moving from [[San Francisco]] in 2002 where he previously worked in numerous bookstores.<ref name=TS/><ref name=TT/> The impetus for opening the bookstore was due to the need to support his family with another income source.<ref name=TS/> The inspiration and book selection methods of the store is based on his work in a previous San Francisco bookstore that placed books that were too unique, specific, or unusual for a single-subject category under a miscellaneous section "Floop".<ref name=TS/> Many, including the owner, consider the store itself a showcase and homage to the printed [[book]], which they believe to be dying [[Medium (communication)|medium]].<ref name=TM/><ref name=TT>{{citation |first=Chris |last=Randle |journal=Toronto Standard |date=June 8, 2012 |title=Text/Book: Obscure Obsessions|url=http://www.torontostandard.com/culture/text-book-obscure-obsessions}}</ref> Due to the notoriety and uniqueness of the bookstore, Fowler was invited to join the [[International League of Antiquarian Booksellers]].<ref name=TM/>
