'''''The Red Kimono''''' is a 1925 American [[silent film]] drama about [[prostitution]] produced by [[Dorothy Davenport]] (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) and starring [[Priscilla Bonner]].

==Production background==
The film is notable today for being one of the few independent productions produced and written by women. This is the third of Davenport's "social conscience" releases, preceded by ''[[Human Wreckage]]'' (1923) on the topic of [[drug addiction]] (released five months after [[Wallace Reid]]'s death from [[morphine]]), and ''[[Broken Laws]]'' (1924) about excessive mother-love.

The film is based on a real case of [[prostitution]] that took place in [[New Orleans]] in 1917. This film, billing itself as a true story, used the real name of the woman played by Priscilla Bonner who as a consequence sued producer Dorothy Davenport and won.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Red {{sic|Kimono}}: The Saga of Gabriel Darley Melvin |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir |title=Guarding Life's Dark Secrets: Legal and Social Controls over Reputation, Propriety, and Privacy |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |edition= |year=2007 |pages=217â€“225 |isbn=978-0-8047-5739-3 }}</ref> The case, ''Melvin v Reid'' has been cited recently in the emerging "[[right to be forgotten]]" cases around the world as an early example of one's right to leave a past one wishes to forget. In the ruling of the California Appellate Court (Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931)) the Court stated, "any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation."{{cn|date=October 2017}}
