The '''false scorpionfish''' (''Centrogenys vaigiensis''), also known as '''prettyfins''', is a species of [[perciform]] fish, [[monotypic taxon|the only species]] in [[genus]] '''''Centrogenys''''', which in turn is the only genus in the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Centrogenyidae'''.<ref name="FishBase">{{FishBase | genus = Centrogenys | species = vaigiensis | month = January | year =2010}}</ref> They are pale grey or brown and usually grow no longer than {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}}. False scorpionfish are distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific, bounded by the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of Japan to the north and Australia to the south, the [[Nicobar Islands]] to the west and [[New Guinea]] to the east.

==Description==
False scorpionfishes can grow to a maximum length of {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}}, but are usually no longer than {{convert|9.3|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="FishBase"/> The [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]] (bony covering of gills) has two spines, the lower of which is more conspicuous.<ref name="FAO">{{cite journal|year=1999|title=The Living Marine Resource of the Western Central Pacific|journal=FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|volume=4|issue=Bony fishes part 2|issn=1020-6868|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/x2400e/x2400e43.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2010}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> False scorpionfish have 36 to 44 [[lateral line]] scales.<ref name="FAO"/>

False scorpionfishes have 13 or 14 dorsal fin spines and 9 to 11 branched dorsal rays.<ref name="FAO"/> The base of the anal fin is short, and has three spines and five segmented rays. The second anal fin spine is the longest. The pectoral fins have 12 to 14 rays, whereas pelvic fins have one spine and three rays.<ref name="FAO"/> A membrane connects the inner pelvic ray to the body.<ref name="FAO"/>

The body overall is pale brown or grey. The fins may be the same colour or lighter, or even clear.<ref name="FAO"/> The ventral side is paler than the dorsal side, and large brown or grey spots [[mottle]] the [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s and also the forward portion of the [[anal fin]]. False scorpionfish feed upon small fishes, shrimps, and crabs.<ref name="FAO"/>

===Mimicry===
The false scorpionfish [[mimicry|appears very similar]] to the true [[scorpionfish]], to the point of originally being described as a species of ''[[Scorpaena]]''.<ref name="jrandall">{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=John E.|year=2005|title=A Review of Mimicry in Marine Fishes|journal=Zoological Studies|volume=44|issue=3|pages=302–304|url=http://www.sinica.edu.tw/zool/zoolstud/44.3/299.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref> This similarity protects the false scorpionfish from predators, which would not prey upon the very venomous true scorpionfish.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are [[brackish]]-water or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] fish, living in the [[benthopelagic]] layer.<ref name="FishBase"/> Their range encompasses the Indo-West Pacific, from the [[Nicobar Islands]] to [[New Guinea]], southwards to northern Australia, and as far north as the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of Japan.<ref name="FishBase"/> False scorpionfish occur on rocky bottoms and reefs, almost always those with ample [[seagrass]] covering.<ref name="tuttle">{{cite book|last=Tomascik|first=Tomas|title=The ecology of the Indonesian seas, Part 2|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1997|pages=659|isbn=978-962-593-163-0}}</ref> They are most commonly found in shallow waters along the coast.<ref name="FishBase"/>

==Relationship to humans==
False scorpionfishes have little or no role in commercial [[fishery|fisheries]].<ref name="FAO"/> However, they are occasionally found in home [[aquarium|aquaria]].<ref name="FishBase"/><ref name="FAO"/>
