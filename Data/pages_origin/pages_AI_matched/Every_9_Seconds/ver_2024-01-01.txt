== Plot ==
Carrie Breiter ([[Amy Pietz]]) is a journalist who goes undercover as a crisis line worker. Her work connects her with Janet ([[O'Grady]]), an abused woman who calls the hotline trying to proclaim revenge against her abusive ex-husband, Richard ([[Christopher Meloni]]), and Missy, a teen who declines help from the crisis center and is attacked not long after by her abusive boyfriend. Richard, who had been jailed for domestic abuse, is released early and shows up at Janet's house, menacing her. Breiter, against colleagues' advice, determines to intervene and save Janet.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews. The ''Los Angeles Times'' called the plot "absurdly formulaic" and argued that the film cheapened its subject of domestic violence.<ref name="miller" /> The ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', although also finding the film familiar and exploitative, wrote: "If it encourages women in an abusive relationship to seek help, or get out, it's certainly worth network air time."<ref name="pennington">{{cite news |last1=Pennington |first1=Gail |title=George Eliot's 'Mill': A Murky Tale |agency=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=12 October 1997}}</ref> ''New York'' magazine praised the "first-rate performances" by its cast, particularly Christopher Meloni.<ref name="leonard">{{cite news |last1=Leonard |first1=John |title=John Leonard's Television Notes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LegCAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22every+9+seconds%22+%22review%22+%22gail%22&pg=PA141 |access-date=23 May 2023 |agency=New York Magazine |date=13 October 1997}}</ref>
