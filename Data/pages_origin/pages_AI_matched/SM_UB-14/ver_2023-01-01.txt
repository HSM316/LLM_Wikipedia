'''SM ''UB-14''''' was a German [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] in the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. The submarine was also known by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] designation of '''SM ''U-26'''''.

''UB-14'' was ordered in October 1914 and was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in November. ''UB-14'' was a little under {{convert|28|m|ft}} in length and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] between {{convert|127|and|141|t|LT}}, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two [[torpedo]]es for her two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and was also armed with a deck-mounted [[machine gun]]. ''UB-14'' was broken into sections and shipped by rail to the Austrian port [[Pula|Pola]] for reassembly. She was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in March 1915 as SM ''UB-14'' in the German Imperial Navy under the command of [[Oberleutnant zur See]] [[Heino von Heimburg]].<ref group=Note>"SM" stands for "Seiner Majestät" ({{lang-en|His Majesty's}}) and combined with the ''U'' for ''Unterseeboot'' would be translated as ''His Majesty's Submarine''.</ref>

Because Germany and Italy were not yet at war when ''UB-14'' entered service, she was transferred in name only to the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The submarine retained her German captain and crew, and remained under German command as a part of the ''Kaiserliche Marine''{{'}}s [[Pola Flotilla]]. During her first patrol in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], ''UB-14'' torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Italian armored cruiser|Amalfi||2|up=yes}}. While traveling to Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]) to join the [[Constantinople Flotilla]], ''UB-14'' attacked two British [[troopships]], sinking {{ship|HMT|Royal Edward||2}} with heavy loss of life, and seriously damaging {{ship|HMT|Southland||2}}. All three of ''UB-14''{{'}}s first victims were [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|among the largest ships]] attacked by U-boats during the war.

Although ''UB-14'' sank the British submarine {{HMS|E20}} in the [[Sea of Marmara]] in November 1915, she spent most of the rest of her career patrolling in the [[Black Sea]]. The U-boat had only limited success there, sinking only three ships through the end of the war. After the war ended, the submarine was disarmed at [[Sevastopol]] and scuttled off that port in early 1919.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dodson |first1=Aidan |last2=Cant |first2=Serena |title=Spoils of War: the fate of enemy fleets after the two World Wars |date=2020 |publisher=Seaforth |location=Barnsley |isbn=978-1-5267-4198-1 |pages=17, 128}}</ref>

== Design and construction ==
After the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]'s rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the [[German Imperial Navy]] found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off [[Flanders]].<!-- advance, caught w/o equipment --><ref name=Miller-46>Miller, pp. 46–47.</ref><ref name=Karau-48>Karau, p. 48.</ref><!-- nature of waters off Flanders --> Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914,<ref name=Karau-48 /> produced the [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about {{convert|28|m|ft}} long and displacing about {{convert|125|t|LT}} with two [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref group=Note>A further refinement of the design—replacing the torpedo tubes with [[mine (naval)|mine]] chutes but changing little else—evolved into the [[German Type UC I submarine|Type UC I]] coastal [[minelayer|minelaying]] submarine. See: Miller, p. 458.</ref>

''UB-14'' was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines—numbered {{SMU|UB-9||2}} to {{SMU|UB-15||2}}—ordered on 15 October from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]], just shy of two months after planning for the class began.<ref name=Miller-46 /><ref name=Williamson>Williamson, p. 12.</ref> ''UB-14'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] by Weser in Bremen on 9 November.<ref name=UB-14 /> As built, ''UB-14'' was {{convert|27.88|m|ftin}} long, {{convert|3.15|m|ftin}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]], and had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|3.03|m|ftin}}. She had a single {{convert|44|kW|bhp|order=flip|adj=on}} [[Körting Hannover|Körting]] 4-cylinder [[diesel engine]] for surface travel, and a single {{convert|89|kW|shp|order=flip|adj=on}} [[Siemens-Schuckert]] [[electric motor]] for underwater travel, both attached to a single [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]. Her top speeds were {{convert|7.45|kn}}, surfaced, and {{convert|6.24|kn}}, submerged.<ref name=Tarrant-172 /> At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to {{convert|1,500|nmi|lk=in}} on the surface before refueling, and up to {{convert|45|nmi}} submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, ''UB-14'' was rated to a diving depth of {{convert|50|m|ft}}, and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.

''UB-14'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[torpedo]]es in two bow [[torpedo tube]]s. She was also outfitted for a single {{convert|8|mm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} [[machine gun]] on deck. ''UB-14''{{'}}s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.<ref name=Karau-49>Karau, p. 49.</ref>

== Launching and commissioning ==
Most of the UB I boats were shipped to their port of operations by rail, where they were assembled, [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed, tested, and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed. Information on ''UB-14'' suggests that she may not have followed that pattern as closely as most other boats. According to several sources, ''UB-14'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 23 March 1915,<ref name=UB-14 /><ref name=Miramar /> and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the German Imperial Navy as SM ''UB-14'' on 25 March under the command of [[Oberleutnant zur See]] [[Heino von Heimburg]]<ref name=UB-14 /> a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander.<ref name=heimburg>{{cite Uboat.net

}}</ref> Those same sources are silent on ''UB-14''{{'}}s whereabouts at the time, but information on ''UB-14''{{'}} later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning may have occurred in Germany.

''UB-14'' was shipped by rail in June to the main Austrian naval base at [[Pula|Pola]], with an arrival date on the 12th.<ref>Stern, p. 26; Koburger, p. 84. Koburger reports on ''UB-14''{{'}}s imminent arrival as of "mid-year 1915"; other events he lists as concurrent with ''UB-14''{{'}}s journey happened in the first weeks of June.</ref> The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a [[complete knock down|knock down kit]]. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway [[flatcar]]s.<ref name=Karau-49 /> German engineers and technicians that accompanied earlier UB I boats to Pola worked under the supervision of [[Kapitänleutnant]] Hans Adam, head of the U-boat special command ({{lang-de|Sonderkommando}}).<ref name=Kob-82>Koburger, p. 82.</ref> Typically, the UB I assembly process took about two to three weeks.<ref name=Karau-49 /><ref name=Mess-UB3>Messimer, pp. 126–27.</ref>

While ''UB-14'' made her way to Austria-Hungary, von Heimburg and his German crew were assigned to ''UB-15'' at Pola. The submarine was temporarily commissioned into the German Imperial Navy before a subsequent transfer to the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as its {{SMU|U-11|Austria-Hungary|2}}.<ref name=Stern-24>Stern, p. 24.</ref> Von Heimburg and his German crew, with one Austrian officer aboard, gained valuable experience in ''UB-15''/''U-11'', sinking the {{ship|Italian submarine|Medusa|1911|2|up=yes}} on that U-boat's first patrol.<ref name=Stern-24-26>Stern, pp. 24–26. Stern provides an in-depth recounting of the sinking of ''Medusa'' with reproductions of von Heimburg's hand-drawn diagrams of the attack.</ref> ''UB-15''/''U-11'' was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 16 June, and von Heimburg and his crew were transferred intact on 21 June to ''UB-14'', which was still a few days from completion.<ref name=Stern-26>Stern, p. 26</ref>

[[File:Cruiser Amalfi.jpg|thumb|left|The {{ship|Italian armored cruiser|Amalfi||2|up=yes}} was sunk on ''UB-14''{{'}}s first patrol.]]
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Italy had declined to join its [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] partners—Germany and Austria-Hungary—in declaring war against the [[Entente Powers]], and opted to remain neutral. Pressure from the United Kingdom and France swayed Italy to sign the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Treaty of London]] on 26 April, in which Italy promised to leave the Triple Alliance and declare war against its former allies within a month in return for territorial gains after the end of the war. Because Italy initially declared war only on Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy were not officially at war. As a consequence, German submarines operating in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean were all assigned Austrian numbers and flew the flag of Austria-Hungary when making attacks on Italian vessels; ''UB-14'' was assigned the designation of ''U-26'' and entered onto the rolls of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, despite the fact that she remained completely under German control.<ref name=Sondhaus-279>Sondhaus, p. 279.</ref> According to historian Lawrence Sondhaus, this dual numbering system reflected the close submarine cooperation between the two countries and still makes it difficult to distinguish between submarines of the two navies.<ref name=Sondhaus-279 />

On 1 July, ''UB-14'' joined the [[Pola Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche U-Halbflotille Pola}}),<ref name=UB-14 /> and departed soon thereafter on her first patrol.<ref name=Stern-26 /> On the night of 6/7 July, Italian [[armored cruiser]]s that had recently been deployed at [[Venice]] undertook a "reconnaissance in force" off Pola in an attempt to discourage future Austrian sorties against the Italian coast.<ref name=Stern-26 /><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Great War: The Italian Advance | journal=The Independent: A Weekly Journal of Free Opinion | volume=83 | issue=3476 | page=75 | date=19 July 1915 }}</ref> When the Italian ships retired in the early morning hours of the 7th, ''UB-14'' was about {{convert|20|nmi}} off Venice. At dawn, the armored cruiser {{ship|Italian armored cruiser|Amalfi||2}} crossed paths with ''UB-14'' and was torpedoed. ''Amalfi'' quickly began listing to port and sank within 30 minutes with the loss of 67 men. At {{convert|10118|t|LT}} displacement, ''Amalfi'' was [[List of the largest ships hit by U-boats in World War I|one of the largest ships]] sunk by U-boats during the war.<ref name=large>{{cite Uboat.net

[[Enver Pasha]] and other Turkish leaders had been pleading with their German and Austrian allies to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help attack the British and French fleet pounding Turkish positions.<ref name=Halp-116>Halpern, p. 116.</ref> As part of the German response, ''UB-14'' was ordered to Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]) to join {{SMU|U-21|Germany|2}}; [[sister boat]]s {{SMU|UB-7||2}} and {{SMU|UB-8||2}}; and the [[German Type UC I submarine|UC I]] boats {{SMU|UC-14||2}} and {{SMU|UC-15||2}} in the [[Constantinople Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|U-Boote der Mittelmeer-Division in Konstantinopel}}).<ref name=Tarrant-23>Tarrant, p. 23.</ref> Since her intermediate refueling stop at [[Bodrum]] was beyond her limited range, ''UB-14'' departed Pola under tow from an Austrian destroyer on 15 July 1915.<ref name=Stern-26 /> ''UB-14''{{'}}s engine and [[gyrocompass]] broke down while off [[Crete]], leaving the boat dead in the water for a time,<ref name=Stern-26 /><ref group=Note>The single [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]/engine combo was a known weakness of the [[German Type UB I submarine|UB I]] design that was rectified in the larger [[German Type UB II submarine|Type UB II]]. See: Miller, p. 48; Williamson, p. 13.</ref> but temporary repairs by the crew enabled the boat to make Bodrum on the 24th. A repair crew from Constantinople was dispatched—having to travel by train and camel just to reach ''UB-14''—and the ship was ready to resume her journey on 13 August.<ref name=Stern-26 /><ref group=Note>Naval historian Paul Halpern (p. 149) reports that ''UB-14'' was involved in a scouting operation with the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the central Adriatic on 28 July. Given that ''UB-14'' needed towing assistance and nine days to make Bodrum, it seems unlikely that the submarine could accomplish a passage back to the Adriatic in four days time.</ref>

Shortly after departing Bodrum, ''UB-14'' had just cleared the Greek island of [[Kos]] and was off the nearby island of [[Kandeloussa]] when von Heimburg sighted several potential victims. The first ship seen was the British hospital ship {{ship|HMHS|Soudan||2}}, headed to Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the properly identified hospital ship, allowed ''Soudan'' to pass unmolested. The next ship was not so lucky, however. It was the unescorted {{ship|HMT|Royal Edward||2}}, a Canadian [[ocean liner]] pressed into [[troopship]] duties. ''Royal Edward'' was headed in the opposite direction from ''Soudan'': from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with reinforcements for the [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|British 29th Infantry]] and a small group with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], all of whom were destined for [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].<ref name=Wise-75-76>Wise and Baron, pp. 75–76.</ref> Von Heimburg launched one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2&nbsp;km) away and hit ''Royal Edward'' in the stern;<ref name=Wise-77 /><!-- number of torpedoes --> the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with a large loss of life.

Other sources report widely varying numbers of casualties, ranging from 132 on the low end (Tennent, pp. 36–37), to as many as 1,386 (Hendrickson, p. 270) or 1,865 (Gilbert, p. 185) on the upper end.</ref> ''Royal Edward'', at {{GRT|11,117|disp=long}}, was also among the largest ships hit by U-boats during the war.<ref name=large /> While evading the rescue ships, which included two French destroyers, ''UB-14''{{'}}s compass broke down again, forcing a return to Bodrum on the morning of the 15th.<ref name=Stern-27>Stern, p. 27.</ref>

[[File:HMT Southland after torpedo hit September 1915.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|HMT|Southland||2}} after the torpedo attack by ''UB-14'' on 2 September 1915]]
After repairs were completed at Bodrum, ''UB-14'' continued on her way with a passenger, [[Prince Heinrich XXXVII Reuss of Köstritz]] (of the [[Reuss Junior Line]]) who needed passage to Constantinople.<ref name=Stern-27 /> During the journey north, ''UB-14'' came upon another fully loaded troopship near the island of Efstratis, about {{convert|30|nmi}} from [[Lemnos]].

After the attack on ''Southland'', ''UB-14'' broke down again and put in at [[Çanakkale|Chanak]] to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British submarine {{HMS|E7||2}} entangled in Turkish [[antisubmarine net]]s off [[Nagara Point]]. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and ''UB-14''{{'}}s cook, a man by the name of <!-- no given name in source -->Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy ''E7''.

''UB-14'' was at Sevastopol after the Germany signed [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|the armistice treaty]] that ended all fighting on 11 November.
