The '''Battle of Shopian''' took place on 3 July 1819 between an expeditionary force from the [[Sikh Empire]] and Jabbar Khan, the governor of the [[Kashmir Valley]] province of the [[Durrani Empire]]. It was the decisive battle during the Sikh expedition into Kashmir in 1819.

== Background ==
From 1814 to 1819, the [[Sikh Empire]] was forced to send successive punitive expeditions against the hill states of [[Bhimber]], [[Rajauri]], [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]], [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], and others. By subduing rebellions in these states, the Sikh Empire was attempting to keep control of the routes through the [[Pir Panjal range]] and into Kashmir. However the Durrani Empire kept [[de facto]] control of the areas because the Pir Panjal Range blocked supplies and fresh troops to the Sikh armies.

By 1819, [[Azim Khan]] had taken a force of troops to [[Kabul]]. [[Birbal Dhar]], Azim Khan's revenue minister, traveled to [[Lahore]], the capital of the Sikh Empire, and asked Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] to annex Kashmir from the Durrani Empire.<ref>{{harvp|Nalwa|2009|p=45}}</ref> He informed Ranjit Singh that Azim Khan was no longer leading the Durrani forces in Kashmir, and supplied information on invasion routes into Kashmir.

== 1819 Kashmir expedition ==
The Sikh expeditionary force established two [[Armory (military)|armories]] for the expedition at [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]] and [[Wazirabad]].<ref name=Johar>{{harvp|Johar|2000}}</ref> On 20 April, Ranjit Singh ordered 30,000 men from Lahore to the hill states at the foot of the Pir Panjal range.<ref name=Johar/> The expedition was split into three columns: [[Misr Diwan Chand]] commanded the advance force, [[Kharak Singh]] commanded the rear guard, and Ranjit Singh commanded a reserve of 10,000 troops<ref name=Johar/> protecting the [[supply train]].<ref>{{harvp|Prinsep|1846|p=51}}</ref> The expeditionary force marched to [[Bhimber]] and resupplied, capturing the fort of a local [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]] without resistance.<ref name=Johar/> On 1 May, both columns of the Sikh Army reached [[Rajouri]] and its ruler, [[Raja]] Agarullah Khan, rebelled and forced a battle. [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] took command of a force and routed his army, which offered an [[unconditional surrender]] after losing most of its men and war supplies.<ref name=Johar/> His brother, [[Raja]] Rahimullah Khan, was appointed the [[Raja]] of [[Rajauri]] in return for assistance in navigating the 'Behram Pass' (Baramgala, {{coord|33.605|74.4136}}, the lower end of the [[Pir Panjal Pass]]).{{sfn|Johar|1985|pp=129–130}}

Once the Sikh forces reached the Behram Pass, the Durrani-appointed [[faujdar]] charged with guarding it fled to [[Srinagar]].{{sfn|Johar|1985|pp=129–130}} Mir Mohammad Khan, the [[kotwal]] of [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]], and  Mohammad Ali, the kotwal of [[Shopian]], attempted a defense at the Dhaki Deo and Maja passes but were defeated and surrendered to Misr Diwan Chand on 23 June 1819.<ref name=Prinsep52/> Kharak Singh now advanced to Surdee Thana.<ref name=Prinsep52/>{{#tag:ref|Surdee Thana is possibly modern-day [[Thannamang]]. Travel guides from later eras note a route through the Pir Panjal Range from Rajauri to a town named "Thanna" and from "Thanna" to [[Shopian]]<ref>{{harvp|Drew|1875|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Murray|1883|page=203}}</ref>|group=nb}} while Misr Diwan Chand split his force into three divisions and ordered them to cross the Pir Panjal Range through different passes.

== Battle ==
The army regrouped at Surai Ali{{#tag:ref|Also referred to as Serai Illahi<ref name=SMC1718>{{Harvp|Sikh Missionary College|pp=17–18}}</ref> and Serai Ali<ref name=Johar/>|group=nb}} on the road to Shopian. On 3 July 1819, the Sikh army attempted to march through Shopian to [[Srinagar]] but was stopped by a Durrani army headed by Jabbar Khan. The Durrani force had heavily [[Fortification|entrenched]] itself in preparation for the Sikh [[artillery]] attack and brought heavy artillery,<ref name=SMC1718/> which the Sikhs were unprepared for because they had brought only light guns.<ref>{{harvp|Chopra|1928|page=25}}</ref>

Once his artillery was in range, Misr Diwan Chand opened the battle with an [[Barrage (artillery)|artillery barrage]] and multiple infantry and cavalry charges. The Durrani army was able to hold back the Sikh attempts to storm their lines until the Sikhs began moving their guns forward. However, when Misr Diwan Chand was overseeing the movement of guns on the Sikh left flank, Jabbar Khan saw an opening and led the Durrani right flank which stormed Misr Diwan Chand's [[artillery battery]], captured two guns, and threw the Sikh left flank in "disarray".<ref>{{Harvp|Sikh Missionary College|p=19}}</ref> However the Durrani force attacking the Sikh left flank was exposed from their left and [[Akali Phoola Singh]], the commander of the Sikh right flank, rallied his troops and led his command in a charge across the battlefield to the artillery battery. After a close quarters fight which resulted in both sides resorting to using swords and daggers, the ill-trained Durrani soldiers proved to be ineffective against the much superior martial skills of the Sikh soldiers and sections of the Durrani force began to retreat and Jabbar Khan was wounded while escaping the battlefield.<ref name=Johar/>

== Aftermath ==
Although both sides sustained heavy losses, Jabbar Khan and his army fled from the battlefield away from Kashmir over the [[Indus]] river.<ref name=Prinsep53>{{harvp|Prinsep|1846|p=53}}</ref> When the Sikh army entered the city of Srinagar after the battle, Prince Kharak Singh guaranteed the personal safety of every citizen and ensured the city was not plundered. The peaceful capture of Srinagar was important as Srinagar, besides having a large [[Shawl]]-making industry, was also the center of trade between [[Punjab region|Panjab]], [[Tibet]], [[Skardu|Iskardo]], and [[Ladakh]].<ref name=Chopra26>{{harvp|Chopra|1928|page=26}}</ref>

After taking Srinagar, the Sikh army faced no major opposition in conquering [[Kashmir]]. However, when Ranjit Singh installed [[Moti Ram]], the son of Dewan Mokham Chand, as the new governor of Kashmir, he also sent a "large body of troops" with him to ensure tribute from strongholds within Kashmir that might attempt to resist Sikh rule.<ref name=Prinsep53/> The capture of Kashmir set the boundaries and borders of the Sikh Empire with Tibet. The conquest of Kashmir marked an "extensive addition" to the Sikh Empire and "significantly" increased the empire's revenue and landmass.<ref name=Chopra26/>
