'''German submarine ''U-1004''''' was a [[German Type VIIC submarine|Type VIIC/41]] [[U-boat]] built for [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for service during [[World War II]].
She was laid down on 15 January 1943 by [[Blohm & Voss]], [[Hamburg]] as yard number 204, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 27 October 1943 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 16 December 1943 under ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Hartmuth Schimmelpfennig.

==Design==
Like all [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC.2F41|Type VIIC/41]] [[U-boat]]s, ''U-1004'' had a displacement of {{convert|759|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|860|t|LT}} while submerged. She had a total length of {{convert|67.23|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|50.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a beam length of {{convert|6.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a draught length of {{convert|4.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} The submarine was powered by two [[Germaniawerft]] F46 [[supercharged]] six-cylinder four-stroke [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|2800 to 3200|PS|kW shp|-1}} and two [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|BBC]] GG UB 720/8 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|750|PS|kW shp}} for use while submerged. The boat was capable of operating at a depth of {{convert|250|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} and a submerged speed of {{convert|7.6|kn}}. When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|80|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} ''U-1004'' was fitted with five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen [[torpedo]]es or 26 TMA or TMB [[Naval mine]]s, one [[8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/35 naval gun]], (220 rounds), one [[3.7 cm Flak 18/36/37/43|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak M42]] and two [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. Its [[Ship's company|complement]] was between forty-four and sixty.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

==Service history==
The boat's service career began on 16 December 1943 with the [[31st U-boat Flotilla|31st Training Flotilla]], followed by active service with [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th Flotilla]] on 1 August 1944, then [[11th U-boat Flotilla|11th Flotilla]] on 1 November 1944. ''U-1004'' took part in no [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s. ''U-1004'' was sunk by naval gunfire on 1 December 1945 in the North Atlantic, in position {{coord|56|10|N|10|05|W|display=title, inline}}, as part of [[Operation Deadlight]].
