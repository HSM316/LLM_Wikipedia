"'''Best I Can'''" is a song by American band [[Queensrÿche]] appearing on their [[1990 in music|1990]] album ''[[Empire (Queensrÿche album)|Empire]]''. The song was released as the third single from the album. 

In a November 2010 interview with ''Get Ready To Rock'', front man Geoff Tate said of this uptempo track:

"It was a situation of us writing about handicapped people and their determination to reach their goals. A lot of people really embraced that song, people with serious disadvantages, and we are happy about that as it was a rallying song to get behind of and kind of inspired them to seek their goals and move in the right direction."
