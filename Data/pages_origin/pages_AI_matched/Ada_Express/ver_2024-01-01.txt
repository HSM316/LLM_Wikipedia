The '''Ada Express''' ({{lang-tr|Ada Ekspresi}}) is a limited stop regional train service operating between [[Gebze railway station|Gebze]], [[Kocaeli Province|Kocaeli]] and [[Adapazarı]]. It was inaugurated on 5 January 2015 as a replacement for the popular ''[[Adapazarı Express]]'' train service. However, unlike its predecessor, the ''Ada Express'' does not make local stops and run as often and it does not operate into central [[Adapazarı]]. Trains mostly consist of [[TCDD TVS2000|TVS2000]] cars and use [[TCDD E68000|E68000]] series locomotives for motive power. Turkey's [[TCDD E44000|National Electric Train]] has also been in use on the ''Ada Express'' since May 27, 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-27 |title=Milli elektrikli tren yolculu seferlerine başladı |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/gundem/milli-elektrikli-tren-yolculu-seferlerine-basladi/2907316 |access-date=2023-06-03 |website=www.aa.com.tr}}</ref>
