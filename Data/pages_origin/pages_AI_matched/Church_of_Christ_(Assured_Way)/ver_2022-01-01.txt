'''The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message - The Assured Way of the Lord, Inc.''', informally called '''The Assured Way''', is a [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|denomination]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] based in [[Independence, Missouri]]. The Assured Way church is one of four groups that trace their origin to the church founded by [[W. A. Draves|William Draves]] in 1943, after his split with [[Otto Fetting]], who had founded the [[Church of Christ (Fettingite)|Church of Christ]] (also known as the "Fettingites"). Although all four churches have similar names and nearly identical doctrines, they are not in communion and maintain separate legal organizations.<ref>Smith, "Scattering of the Hedrickites," 240-241</ref> The Assured Way church was legally incorporated by William Draves' son, Leonard Draves in 2004, six months after Leonard was removed from the ministry by other leaders of the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Inc. Leonard Draves had previously founded the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Inc., after breaking with the [[Church of Christ with the Elijah Message|Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Established Anew 1929]].<ref name=":0">Smith, "Scattering of the Hedrickites," 240</ref>

==History==

===Otto Fetting===
[[File:PastorOttoFetting1916 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Otto Fetting in 1916]]
The Assured Way church has its origin in the Fettingite movement of the [[Hedrickite]] expression of the Latter Day Saint religion. [[Otto Fetting]], an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] in the Temple Lot [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)|Church of Christ]], during the early twentieth century, claimed to be receiving a series of messages from an unearthly "messenger" he identified as [[John the Baptist]]. While the first eleven of these missives were accepted by the Temple Lot organization, the twelfth was not, leading to Fetting's departure from the Temple Lot organization in 1929, and his founding of the [[Church of Christ (Fettingite)|Fettingite]] organization.<ref>Smith, "Scattering of the Hedrickites," 235-236</ref> The Temple Lot organization has since repudiated all of Fetting's messages, including the first eleven, which they had originally endorsed, at least tentatively.

===William Draves===
[[File:W. A. Draves.jpg|thumb|100px|William A. Draves]]
Four years after Fetting's death, a Fettingite [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] named [[W.A. Draves|William A. Draves]] from [[Nucla, Colorado]] claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well. While the Fettingite organization was initially receptive to these new missives, it ultimately decided to reject them all, leading to a split in the church in 1943. Draves' adherents founded their own organization known as the [[Church of Christ with the Elijah Message|Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Established Anew 1929]].<ref>Shields, ''Divergent Paths,'' 143-144.</ref> Draves continued to claim revelations and recorded a total of 90 messages prior to his death in 1994. His adherents published these messages along with Fetting's in a book of scripture entitled ''[[The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel]]''.<ref>Shields, ''Divergent Paths,'' 146.</ref>

===Founding of the Assured Way church===
Prior to W.A. Draves's death in 1994 the final three messages he had recorded reflected leadership disputes within The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message.<ref>''The Journal of Latter Day Saint History'', Volumes 8-13, S.L. Shields, 1995, p. 17.</ref> These led to a division causing Apostles W.A. Draves, Leonard Draves and Mervyn Johnson to be blocked from church property by way of a restraining order.<ref>[https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/base/welcome.do Missouri Case.net] Case Number Search, Case Number 16CV94-08163 - THE CHURCH OF CHRIST V WILLIAM DRAVES ET AL</ref> After a short legal battle, a failure to reconcile, and the death of W.A. Draves six of the twelve leading Apostles decided to reincorporate the Church under the name The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Inc. in August 1994.<ref>[https://www.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/soskb/Corp.asp?685407 Missouri Secretary of State] Business Entity Search, Non-Profit Corporation, Domestic, Charter No. N00050582</ref> The remaining five Apostles, including those who filed the above restraining order, retained the corporate name "The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Established Anew 1929" and all properties including the headquarters building at 608 Lacy Rd. Independence, Missouri.

Less than a decade later in 2003, leaders in the new church organization removed Leonard Draves from ministry during a special apostles meeting. Draves responded by organizing an additional church known as the "Church of Christ with the Elijah Message (The Assured Way of the Lord)" in 2004.<ref name=":0"/> The parenthetical portion of the new name was added to give the new group a legal and separate distinction from the older Elijah Message churches.

The Assured Way church had six Apostles and four [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] serving in the United States as of 2010.<ref name=":1">''The Greater Light'', vol. 8, No. 7/8, pg. 76.</ref> A total of six "disciples" and three "vice bishops" each for the "East Africa Vineyard" and "West Africa Vineyard" had also been appointed.<ref name=":1"/>

The Church of Christ (Assured Way) was legally incorporated in the [[Missouri|State of Missouri]] as "The Church of Christ With the Elijah Message, The Assured Way of the Lord, Inc.", in 2004.<ref>[https://www.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/soskb/Corp.asp?1281432 Missouri Secretary of State] Business Entity Search, Non-Profit Corporation, Domestic, Charter No. N00566777.</ref>

The Assured Way church publishes an official monthly periodical called ''The Greater Light''.<ref>''The Greater Light'', vol. 7, number 8, pg. 123.</ref>

==Doctrine==
As with all Hedrickite organizations, the Church of Christ (Assured Way) beliefs are enumerated in the "[[Articles of Faith and Practice]]" first adopted by the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), and subsequently affirmed by the Church of Christ (Fettingite), the [[Church of Christ (Restored)]] and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message.<ref>''The Greater Light'', vol. 8, No. 7/8, pg. 74. See also [http://www.johnthebaptist.info/index_files/Page315.htm Articles of Faith and Practice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721214509/http://www.johnthebaptist.info/index_files/Page315.htm |date=2011-07-21 }} from the website of the Church of Christ (Assured Way).</ref> The articles accepted by the Fettingite, Elijah Message and Assured Way churches are all exactly identical, as the "messenger" commanded Fetting not to change them.<ref>See ''[http://www.johnthebaptist.info/index_files/Page482.htm The Word of the Lord, Brought to Mankind by an Angel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417172239/http://www.johnthebaptist.info/index_files/Page482.htm |date=2008-04-17 }}'', Message 1, verse 1.</ref>

Beliefs shared in common between the Assured Way church and other Hedrickite organizations include:

*Belief in the [[King James Version]] Bible and the [[Book of Mormon]] (called the [[Record of the Nephites]] in the Assured Way church);
*Rejection of a [[First Presidency]], [[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] and the office of [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]];
*Belief in a Quorum of [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Twelve Apostles]] as the highest earthly church authority, with all members being equal;
*Rejection of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]];
*Belief in the construction of a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] on the [[Temple Lot]] in Independence, Missouri at some future time;
*Rejection of [[baptism for the Dead]], [[polygamy]] and [[eternal marriage]];
*Belief that while [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] was indeed a true prophet of God, he made errors in judgment and teaching, and thus not everything he said or did is to be accepted as true doctrine or practice;
*Belief that [[revelation]] is not confined to holders of the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]], but may be given to any member of the church, male or female.  However, only males may hold the priesthood.
*Belief that clergy and members should abstain from [[alcoholic beverages]], [[tobacco]] and [[illegal drugs]] (there is no prohibition of [[coffee]] and [[tea]]).
*In common with other Fettingite churches, the Assured Way church believes in the revelations allegedly given to Otto Fetting and William Draves, also believing that when John the Baptist laid hands upon Fetting, he conferred what is referred to as "a greater authority" that had not previously been given, to "set in order" the scattered [[Latter Day Saint movement]].<ref>''The Greater Light'', vol. 8, No. 7/8, pp.80-81.</ref> This does not mean that the Assured Way church believes that the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] had been taken from the earth after Joseph Smith's time, but rather that the "messenger" (whom Fetting and Draves identified with John the Baptist) had come to bring order to the scattered Restoration Movement and give Fetting a special power and authority that Latter Day Saint leaders prior to him had lacked.<ref>''The Greater Light'', vol. 8, No. 7/8, pg. 80-84.</ref> The Church of Christ (Assured Way) believes that this authority continues within their organization today, which they regard as the sole legitimate church on earth.

Unlike some other Hedrickite churches (such as the Temple Lot church), the Assured Way church denies the idea of three beings in the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], insisting that the [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] and [[Holy Ghost]] are all one person.<ref>J. F. Solomon, ''60 Questions on the Godhead'', tract.</ref>
