The '''Botanischer Garten der Universität Ulm''' (28 hectares), also known as the '''Botanischer Garten Ulm''', is a [[botanical garden]] and [[arboretum]] maintained by the [[University of Ulm]]. It is located at Hans-Krebs-Weg, [[Ulm]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]].

The garden was begun in 1981 on a former shooting range southeast of the university on the Upper Eselsberg. Its first [[greenhouse]]s were built in 1986, its [[arboretum]] created in the years 1992-1996, and two additional tropical greenhouses were added in 1997. A farmer's garden was created in 1998, a [[rose]] garden in 1999-2000, and in 2001 an [[herb garden]] was created in cooperation with the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm.

Today the garden contains a medicinal garden, [[daylily]] garden, [[arboretum]], pond, rose garden, [[cottage garden]], and [[meadow]]. Its [[herbarium]] contains some 80,000 documents with a focus on [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[Central America]], including a tropical collection of about 50,000 specimens, about 20,000 specimens of [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, and some 10,000 [[phanerogam]]s. The garden is open to the public on weekdays at various hours.
