'''Bradley Mousley''' (born 3 January 1996) is an [[Australians|Australian]] [[tennis]] player. Mousley won the Australian Open boys' doubles title in both 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web | title = Aussie boys take out Open junior doubles crown | url = http://www.tennis.com.au/news/2013/01/25/aussie-boys-take-out-open-junior-doubles-crown | publisher=Tennis Australia| website = www.tennis.com.au | date = 25 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Bradley Mousley snares junior doubles title|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-bradley-mousley-snares-junior-doubles-title-20140124-31ehr.html|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=25 January 2014}}</ref>

In August 2014, Mousley received a one-year ban, backdated to 30 May 2014, after testing positive for [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] in March. Mousley had admitted he had taken the drug at a party in March, and was originally given a two-year ban, but since the drug was not taken with the intent to enhance his performance, the ban was dropped to 12 months.<ref>{{cite web| title = Australia's No1 junior tennis player Brad Mousley banned over ecstasy| url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/21/australias-no1-junior-tennis-player-banned-over-ecstasy-use | publisher= [[The Guardian]] | date = 21 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Australian junior tennis star Brad Mousley banned for taking ecstasy.|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-junior-tennis-star-brad-mousley-banned-for-taking-ecstasy-20140821-106kr1.html|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 August 2014}}</ref>

==Tennis career==

===2019===
Considering his efforts as a junior, Mousley reached his first senior ITF final, in [[Hua Hin]], at the relatively advanced age of 23.  Unfortunately he had injured his knee badly enough to withdraw from his singles semi-final earlier in the day, and struggled to move freely from the start of his doubles final.  He and [[Ajeet Rai]] were well-beaten by the top-seeded Ratiwatana twins in just 40 minutes.
