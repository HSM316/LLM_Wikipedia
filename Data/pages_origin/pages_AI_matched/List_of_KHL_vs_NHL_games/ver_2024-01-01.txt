{{Short description|None}}
Although the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] teams played against [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet league]] teams during the [[Super Series]] between 1976 and 1991, there were no games between [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] and NHL teams until 2008, when [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] played against the [[New York Rangers]] for the [[2008 Victoria Cup]]. Two years later, in 2010, marked the first time since 1990 that NHL teams played games on [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] ice.
