'''Koh Lian Pin''' (born 1976 in [[Singapore]]) is a Singaporean conservation scientist. He is Associate Vice President and Chief Sustainability Scientist at the [[National University of Singapore ]] (NUS), where he oversees and champions sustainability-related research. He employs a whole-of-University strategy to bridge academia with policy makers, industry and civil society, driving the change needed across all sectors to tackle the twin planetary crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.

By initiating and spearheading engagements with stakeholders locally and at international fora, Koh seeks to promote societal understanding of the world we live in, and amplify the university’s and Singapore’s contributions to sustainability efforts globally.

He is presently also the [[Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple]] Chair Professor of Conservation, and Director of the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions at NUS.

An internationally renowned name in the field of sustainability and environmental science, Koh is one of the most highly cited conservation scientists in the world, with over 20 years of international research experience under his belt. His previous stints include Swiss National Science Foundation Professor at [[ETH Zurich]], Chair of Applied Ecology and Conservation at the [[University of Adelaide]], Vice President of Science Partnerships and Innovation at [[Conservation International]] Foundation. He was also the Founding Director of [[Conservation Drones]], a non-profit organisation that seeks to introduce drone technology to conservation scientists and practitioners worldwide.

Koh has received multiple awards including the Frontiers Planet Prize, National Champion, in 2023, the [[Australian Research Council|Australian Research Council Future Fellowship]] Level II in 2014, the [[Swiss National Science Foundation|Swiss National Science Foundation Professorship]] in 2011, the [[ETH Zurich|ETH Fellowship]] in 2008, and was also named a [[Young Global Leaders|World Economic Forum Young Global Leader]] in 2013.

In 2020, Koh received a prestigious award from the National Research Foundation of the Singapore [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]] under its Returning Singaporean Scientists Scheme.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Returning Singaporean Scientists Scheme |url=https://www.nrf.gov.sg/programmes/returning-singaporean-scientists-scheme |access-date=2023-02-28 |website=www.nrf.gov.sg}}</ref> Established in 2013, the Scheme seeks to attract outstanding overseas-based Singaporean research leaders back to Singapore to take up leadership positions in Singapore's autonomous universities and publicly funded research institutes. Koh was the sixth recipient of the award.

On 14 January 2021, Koh was appointed as one of nine [[Nominated Members of Parliament]] (NMP) in the [[14th Parliament of Singapore]], which began on 21 January 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abdullah |first1=Zhaki |title=Nine new Nominated Members of Parliament to be appointed |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-nmp-nominated-members-of-parliament-13959126 |website=CNA |access-date=19 January 2021 |date=14 January 2021}}</ref>

== Education ==
Koh studied at [[Hwa Chong Institution]] for his pre-tertiary education in Singapore. He completed his Bachelor of Science (with First Class Honours) and Master of Science degrees at the [[National University of Singapore]] in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Koh received his PhD from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at [[Princeton University]], [[New Jersey]], US in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Team|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/dwilcove/meet-team|language=en}}</ref> Following that, he received postdoctoral training at [[ETH Zurich]].

His more recent research as Director of the [http://www.nus.edu.sg/cncs Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions] seeks to produce policy-relevant science on nature-based climate solutions – tackling climate change by protecting and better managing natural ecosystems – to address knowledge gaps, build capacity and deliver pragmatic solutions and innovations to inform climate policies, strategies and actions to achieve the centre's vision.

Koh’s research is complemented by his rich work in advocacy, which has seen him offer a science-based perspective to socioeconomic and environmental issues on both local and global platforms, including speaking at the United Nations Climate Change Conferences ([[COP27]] in Sharm El Sheik and [[COP28]] in Dubai), [[TED Global]] and TEDx conferences, among others.
