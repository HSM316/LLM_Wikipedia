The historic house at 38 Rangeley Road in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]] is one of three Panel Brick in an exclusive late 19th century subdivision.  The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989 as the '''Samuel Elder House''',<ref name="nris"/> on the incorrect belief that it was the home of Samuel Elder, a prominent Boston lawyer.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Description and history==
The Rangeley Estate subdivision was a high-end residential development, located southwest of Winchester center on the west side of the railroad tracks.  The land was purchased by David Skillings, a lumber businessman from [[Maine]], and developed by him into an exclusive gated development known as Rangeley Park (its wall and pillars that supported a gate are still visible on Church Street, at the northern end of the development).  This house was built by Skillings in 1875â€“76 as a rental property.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=WNT.394|title=NRHP nomination and MACRIS inventory record for Samuel Elder House|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-03-13}}</ref>  The house has incorrectly been described as the residence of Samuel J. Elder, one of the founding editors of ''[[The Yale Record]]'',<ref>Elder, Margaret M. (1925). ''The life of Samuel J. Elder''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 325</ref> the world's oldest humor magazine. This error occurred because the street number of the house is 38, but the number 38 had earlier been associated with a different house in the Rangeley neighborhood where Samuel Elder lived.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The house is set on a sweeping curve of Rangeley Road in the southern part of the Skillings development, opposite Meadowcroft Road.  It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, built in a Ruskinian Gothic style to a design by George Dutton Rand.  It is faced in polychrome (red and black) brick, with additional trim elements in brownstone.  The main facade is asymmetrical, with the entrance set in a segmented-arch opening.  A single-story porch extends across the facade, supported by bracketed posts, with a balustrade with a jigsawn trefoil pattern.<ref name="NRHP"/>
