{{Short description|Business that provides money transfer services or payment instruments}}
In the legal code of the [[United States]], a '''money transmitter''' or '''money transfer service''' is a business entity that provides money transfer services or payment instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1201&ChapterID=20 |title=Illinois Compiled Statutes -FINANCIAL REGULATION Transmitters of Money Act|date=January 1, 1995}}</ref>  Money transmitters in the US are part of a larger group of entities called [[money service business]]es or MSBs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fincen.gov/financial_institutions/msb/amimsb.html |title=FinCEN - Am I an MSB |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref> Under federal law, 18 USC § 1960, businesses are required to register for a money transmitter license where their activity falls within the state definition of a money transmitter.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1960 |title=18 UCS § 1960 |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Regulation==
Forty-nine US states (sans [[Montana]]) regulate (i.e., require licensure for) money transmitters although the laws vary from one state to the other.<ref>{{cite web|last=Atlas |first=Adam |url=http://moneytransmitterlicense.blogspot.com/ |title=Money Transmitter Licensing |publisher=Moneytransmitterlicense.blogspot.com |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref> Most of the states require a money transmitter surety bond with widely ranging amounts from as little as $25,000 to over $1 million and maintaining a minimum [[capital requirement]].  There is an association of state regulators, the Money Transfer Regulators Association (MTRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtraweb.org |title=MTRA – Money Transmitter Regulators Association; |publisher=Mtraweb.org |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref> that seeks to create uniformity and common practices and efficient and effective regulation of money transmission industry in the United States of America. The MTRA membership consists of state regulatory authorities in charge of regulating money transmitters and sellers of traveler’s checks, [[Money order|money orders]], drafts and other money instruments. In the Spring of 2019, the MTRA created the Industry Advisory Council (“IAC”) in order to consult, advise and assist the MTRA Board of Directors on issues relating to money services business regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtraweb.org/about/industry-advisory-council/ |title=Industry Advisory Council IAC |publisher=MTRA |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref>

Through their Vision 2020 program, US state regulators, as the primary regulators of non-bank and fintech firms, committed to fostering innovation are transforming the licensing process, harmonizing supervision, engaging fintech companies, assisting state banking departments, making it easier for banks to provide services to non-banks, and make supervision more efficient for third parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csbs.org/vision2020 |title=VISION2020 |publisher=CSBS |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref>

Money transmitters created an association with other MSBs, the Money Services Business Association (MSBA) which was launched in October 2015 as an industry led organization that supports the non-bank financial services industry in the United States and encourages the continued innovation and development in the payments industry while promoting the education and communication with US federal and state regulators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msbassociation.org/ |title=MSBA - The Money Services Business Association |publisher=msbassociation |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref> As of September 5, 2018, the MSBA integrated into its operation the services and capabilities of the National Money Transmitters Association (NMTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msbassociation.org/nmta |title= NMTA  |publisher=msbassociation |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref>  Together with the MSBA and other industry associations, the International Money Transfer Conferences (IMTC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imtconferences.com |title=International Money Transfers and Cross-Border Conferences IMTC |publisher=Imtconferences.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref> brings together the global money transfer industry once a year for the IMTC WORLD conference, in Miami, Florida. In 2017 the IMTC brought together more than 450 participants, 67% from the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://imtconferences.com/who-comes-to-imtc/ |title=IMTC  |publisher=Imtconferences.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-08}}</ref>

The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) of the U.S. Treasury Department requires MSBs to register.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/financial_institutions/msb/msb.registration.html |title=Money Services Business (MSB) Registration |publisher=FinCEN |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref>  It is also a felony to engage in money transmission without a license in any state that requires a license to operate.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.mcgeorge.edu/Documents/Publications/07_Schouten_MasterMLR39.pdf |title=Unlicensed Money Transmitting Businesses and Mens Rea under the USA PATRIOT Act |publisher=McGeorge Law Review |date=2008 |author=Andrew Schout |volume=39 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref>  Internet and mobile-based payment services are also required to seek a state money transmitter license to offer services to individuals residing in the state.

FINCEN has also ruled that [[Informal Value Transfer Systems]] (IVTS) are considered money transmitters for the purposes of registration and licensing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/advisory/pdf/advis33.pdf |title=FinCEN Advisory - Informal Value Transfer Systems (IVTS) |date=March 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205556/http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/advisory/pdf/advis33.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref> [[FINCEN]] defines an IVTS as "any system, mechanism, or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making the funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographic location, whether or not in the same form". These are known as [[Hawala]] in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, as "hundi" in India and '"fei ch’ien" in China.

In regulations enacted in 2012 under the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/ |title=CFPB > Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |publisher=Consumerfinance.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref> extended its regulation under a "Remittance Rule" that added some additional protection for US consumers who send money electronically to foreign countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/remittances-transfer-rule-amendment-to-regulation-e/ |title=Remittance transfer rule (amendment to Regulation E) |publisher=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref> The rule targets any [[remittance]] institution defined as consumer-to-consumer transfers of low monetary value, made via money transmitters, [[bank]]s or [[credit union]]s, through [[wire transfer]]s or [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH) transactions, to businesses as well as to individuals in foreign countries.
