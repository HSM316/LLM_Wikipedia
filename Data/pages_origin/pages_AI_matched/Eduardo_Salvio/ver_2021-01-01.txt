===Lanús===
Salvio was born in [[Avellaneda]], a port city in the [[Buenos Aires Province|province]] of [[Buenos Aires]]. At only 17, he was promoted to the first team of [[Club Atlético Lanús]] for the [[2007–08 Argentine Primera División season|2007 Apertura]], but did not appear in any games in the tournament as the ''Granate'' finished in top position.

Salvio made his debut for Lanús' first team on 24 August 2008, in a game against [[Boca Juniors]]. He scored his first goal(s) for the club in a 4–2 win against [[Argentinos Juniors]], exactly two months later.<ref>[http://www.futbolxxi.com/Sintesis.aspx?ID=7054&Lan%C3%BAs&Argentinos&Clausura%2008&t=1 Lanús 4–2 Argentinos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604141700/http://www.futbolxxi.com/Sintesis.aspx?ID=7054&Lan%C3%BAs&Argentinos&Clausura%2008&t=1 |date=4 June 2012 }}; at Futbol XXI (Spanish)</ref> Overall, he netted nine goals in [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División season|the season]] as the team finished fourth overall, and was also its joint-leading goal scorer, along with [[José Sand]].

On 20 February 2011 he scored the first goal in a 2–0 away win against city rivals [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]]<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en/news/91/portugal/2011/02/21/2362914/sporting-0-2-benfica-salvio-and-gaitan-secure-derby-day-win Sporting 0–2 Benfica: Salvio and Gaitan secure Derby Day win for ten-man Eagles]; Goal.com, 21 February 2011</ref> and, three days later, he netted his first goal in European competition, with an impressive 20-yard strike against [[VfB Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] in the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League's round of 32]] (2–0 away success, 4–1 on aggregate);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000129/match=2003796/index.html|title=Benfica make it 16 in a row at Stuttgart|publisher=UEFA.com|date=24 February 2011|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> to finalize that week, in a home [[Primeira Liga|league]] match against [[C.S.
