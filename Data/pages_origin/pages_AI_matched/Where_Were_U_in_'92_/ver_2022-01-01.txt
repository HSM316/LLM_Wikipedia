'''''Where Were U In '92?''''' is the debut studio album by British [[electronic music|electronic]] producer [[Zomby]], released in 2008 by [[Werk Discs]].

The album's title refers to the opening line from the [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] song "XR2" and is a homage to the [[rave]] scene of the early 1990s, reflected by Zomby's mixture of his usual [[chiptune]]-inflected [[UK garage]] style with the more upbeat, [[rave music|rave]] stylings of [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat house]]. Zomby used equipment from the period, such as the [[Akai#Audio Samplers .2F Music Production Center|Akai S2000]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] and [[Atari ST]] computer.<ref name="pitchfork"/><ref>http://www.4ad.com/artists/zomby</ref>
