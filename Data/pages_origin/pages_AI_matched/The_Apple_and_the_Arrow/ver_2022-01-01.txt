''''' The Apple and the Arrow''''' is a children's [[novella]] written and illustrated by [[Mary and Conrad Buff]], published by [[Houghton Mifflin]] in 1951. It retells the legend of [[William Tell]] from the viewpoint of his 12-year-old son Walter. It is set in 1291, during the political upheaval that led to the [[foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy]].

The Buffs were one runner-up for the 1952 [[Newbery Medal]] from the [[American Library Association]], recognizing the previous year's "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children". ''The Apple and the Arrow'' is called a Newbery Honor Book in retrospect and may display a silver seal.<ref name=newbery/>
