The '''Emblem of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]''' was first used from 1946 until the end of communist rule in 1990. Following the communist coup d’etat was held against the government of King Simeon on 9 September 1944, the insurgents used royal flags defaced by cutting out the crown and the royal cyphers. Around the arms was a garland of branches of oak and olive. On 15 September 1946, the People's Republic was proclaimed. On 6 December 1947 an emblem patterned after the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]] was adopted that consisted of a [[red star|red five-pointed star]] with eight ears of wheat or tied with a ribbon Gules inscribed with the motto: '''9 IX 1944'''. <ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.5.%20Gerbove%20na%20narodnata%20republika.htm |first=Ivan |last=Voynikov |title=History of the Bulgarian State Symbols |chapter=Chapter V|language=Bulgarian}}</ref> 

By 1948, the ribbon was changed to the colors of the [[flag of Bulgaria]]. However in 1967, the design of the emblem has changed slightly from the previous version with the white wheat replacing the gold. The most recent version of the emblem was used from 1971 with the emblem indicated the year 681, the year of the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]] was added next to 1944.
