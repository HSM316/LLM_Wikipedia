The '''Emblem of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Герб на Народна Република България ''(Герб на НРБ)'') was first used from 1946 until [[People's Republic of Bulgaria#End of the People's Republic|the end of communist rule in 1990]]. Following the communist [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'état|September 9, 1944 coup d'état]], the insurgents used royal flags defaced by cutting out the crown and the royal cyphers. Around the arms was a garland of branches of oak and olive. On 15 September 1946, the People's Republic was proclaimed. On 6 December 1947 an emblem patterned after the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]] was adopted which consisted of a [[Red star|red five-pointed star]] with eight ears of wheat or tied with a red ribbon inscribed with the motto '''9 IX 1944'''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.5.%20Gerbove%20na%20narodnata%20republika.htm |first=Ivan |last=Voynikov |title=History of the Bulgarian State Symbols |chapter=Chapter V |language=bg |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-date=2016-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913030949/http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.5.%20Gerbove%20na%20narodnata%20republika.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

In 1948, the ribbon was changed to the colors of the [[flag of Bulgaria]]. In 1967, the design of the emblem was changed slightly, with the white wheat replacing the gold. The most recent version of the emblem was used from 1971 with the motto changed to '''681/1944''', with 681 indicating the year of the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparuh]].

A new [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] was adopted in 1997 and replaced the Emblem of the People's Republic.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.6.%20Epopeyata%20okolo%20noviya%20gerb.htm |first=Ivan |last=Voynikov |title=History of the Bulgarian State Symbols |chapter=Chapter VI |language=bg |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-date=2016-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913030110/http://protobulgarians.com/Kniga%20za%20gerbovete/I.6.%20Epopeyata%20okolo%20noviya%20gerb.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>
