== Cairo Tower ==
{{review|section|date=January 2014}}
{{main|Cairo Tower}}
The Cairo Tower on [[Gezira Island]], was the highest concrete structure in the world when it was completed, standing 187 meters tall. Shebib was the project's architect in chief, structural engineer and its global contractor. In 1961 the tower's official inauguration took place. The design of the tower is of [[Pharaonic]] influence appearing in the shape of a tall lotus flower made up of 8 million small mosaic lozenges. As the lozenges ascend towards the top of the tower, they are stretched on a vertical axis creating an impression of an upward movement enhancing the figure of the lotus flower. With a diameter of fourteen meters, the tower rests on a steel-reinforced concrete slab, the dimension of which is quite impressive. At the time of its construction, more than five hundred workers were required.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://egyptianstreets.com/2019/11/01/how-the-cairo-tower-gave-birth-to-modern-egypt/|title=CHow the Cairo Tower Gave Birth to Modern Egypt|website=egyptianstreets}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/356958/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-prosecution-orders-investigation-into-leakin.aspx|title=Egypt prosecution orders investigation into leaking of student's suicide video at Cairo Tower|website=ahram}}</ref>
The Cairo Tower is also characterized by purity of lines and by the truthfulness of primal material. The absence of any superfluous decorations and the utilization of the naked concrete bring the viewer's eyes and attention to yet another symbol of eternal Egypt. At the top of the tower, one finds a revolving restaurant, a cafeteria and a [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] from which numerous tourists can admire the Cairo panorama.

== Al-Ahram Building (1968) ==

The Al-Ahram Bldg. is the home of [[Al-Ahram]], the leading Arab newspaper. Here also Shebib was the project's architect in chief, structural and site engineer. The surface of this building is 30,000 square meters which includes space occupied by the editorial, printing and administration services, as well as the public areas.

== Dome roofs ==
In 1946, Shebib built the concrete dome roof of the 800 sq.m. Ali Baba Cinema, in the [[Boulaq]] district, using a technology that he subsequently patented. It consisted of a unique method whereby the concrete roof of a building is poured onto a mould on the ground and, once the concrete has set, is slowly raised into position to a height of 12 meters with the use of jacks. A similar dome roof, supported by only eight pillars, was used in the construction of [[De Soto (automobile)|De Soto]]'s Sales & Service Bldg for the Cairo Motor Company.

== Other projects ==
Shebib was also involved in several construction projects including apartment buildings, schools, churches, factories, commercial buildings, cinemas, individual residences and villas. His projects made use of structural elements of various types, such as mushroom structural supports, and thin concrete shell [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s, which became a signature element of his work. Although various types of foundations were used, he developed a special type of concrete ground slab foundations that made good use of thin vaults in the shape of [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s. Shebib also developed a pyramidal type of foundation.
