'''''Grimpoteuthis meangensis''''' is known from either one or two specimens, though the second may be of a completely different species. The first was damaged. Both were found by [[William Evans Hoyle]] within one year of each other, and no other animals of the species have been identified since 1886.<ref name="TOL">{{cite web |last1=Vecchione |first1=Michael |last2=Young |first2=Richard E. |title=Grimpoteuthis meangensis |url=http://tolweb.org/Grimpoteuthis_meangensis/20124 |website=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>

==Description and habitat==
The [[type specimen]], or original specimen, was found off the south Philippines. It lives about 1,000 meters beneath the water's surface.<ref name="IUCN" /> Like other members of its family, [[Opisthoteuthidae]], ''G. meangensis'' could be [[demersal]]. The second specimen was discovered 2,000 meters south of where the first specimen was found.<ref name="IUCN" /><ref name="TOL" />

This octopus' mantle reaches 53 millimeters long, and it weighs at least 1,345 grams when wet.<ref name="FAO">{{cite book|editor1-last=Jereb|editor1-first=Patrizia|editor2-last=Roper|editor2-first=Clyde F.E.|editor3-last=Norman|editor3-first=Mark D.|editor4-last=Finn|editor4-first=Julian K.|title=Cephalopods of the World: an Annotated and Illustrated Catalog of Cephalopods Known to Date Volume 3.

Like other [[Cirrata|cirrates]], ''G. meangensis'' has a web covering its arms to some degree; the web of ''G. meangensis'' covers the majority of its arms. The [[Cirrus (biology)|cirri]] on these arms are short.<ref name="TOL" />

The fins ''G. meangensis'' uses to swim almost equal its body length; its eyes are large. The [[Cirrate shell|shell]] within its body has a shape which differentiates it from other members of the genus ''Grimpoteuthis''.<ref name="TOL" />
