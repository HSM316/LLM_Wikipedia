The record features Michael Nestor on guitars, vocals and keyboards, Frank Corl on percussion, and Kresimir Tokic on bass, replacing founding bassist David Hirner.{{sfn|The Seldon Plan|2012}} ''[[The Big Takeover]]'' named the record a top 10 and wrote, "Their brisk indie pop and angular post-rock has given way to languid, hazy dreampop/shoegaze..." {{sfn|Suppanz|2013}} The slower music, and "hazy, dreamy guitarwork" is departure from previous Seldon Plan work. ''Independent Clauses'' writes that the songs on this EP, "...are consistently welcoming..." and compares ''That Time You Dreamed'' to [[Copeland (band)|Copeland]]. {{sfn|Zahora|2013}}
