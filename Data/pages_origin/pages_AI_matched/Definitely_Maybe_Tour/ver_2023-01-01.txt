'''Definitely Maybe Tour''' was a world [[concert tour]] by English band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in support of their hugely successful debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''. The tour, which spanned the UK, Europe, Japan, the US and Canada, included 143 shows over a period of several months in 1994 and 1995 amidst 10 different tour legs. The tour started on 6 February 1994 with a short concert at Gleneagles, Scotland, and ended on 22 April 1995 at the [[Sheffield Arena]]. The latter show featured an acoustic debut of the future hit "[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/oasis-dlbia-20-10960|title=Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger: 12 Things You Didn't Know|website=[[NME]] |date=19 February 2016}}</ref> and was also the last concert to feature original drummer [[Tony McCarroll]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/oasis/1995/sheffield-arena-sheffield-england-33d798c5.html|title=Oasis Setlist at Sheffield Arena, Sheffield|website=setlist.fm}}</ref>

''Definitely Maybe'' was released midway through the tour and was widely acclaimed,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/15-reasons-why-oasis-definitely-maybe-is-definitely-amazing-1419380|title=15 reasons why Oasis' 'Definitely Maybe' is definitely amazing - NME|website=[[NME]] |date=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/w4xm/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Oasis - Definitely Maybe|first=Lou|last=Thomas}}</ref> propelling Oasis to become one of the foremost British acts and put them squarely at the forefront of the emerging [[Britpop]] scene. The Gallagher brothers regularly made tabloid headlines for their frequent fallouts and rockstar lifestyles, and the tour had several disruptions and cancellations. One such occasion occurred when the band used drugs prior to the 29 September 1994 gig at the legendary [[Whisky a Go Go]] in California. The gig was a failure with numerous mistakes and afterwards, Noel left the band for several days. He was ultimately tracked down by the band's management and persuaded to continue the tour. Noel wrote the song "[[Talk Tonight]]" during this time while away from the band.

The [[Cliffs Pavilion]] gig on 17 April 1995 was filmed and later released as the Oasis VHS/DVD ''[[Live by the Sea]]''.

==Set list==
The band's typical [[set list]] was:

#"[[Rock 'N' Roll Star]]"
#"Columbia"
#"Digsy's Dinner"
#"[[Shakermaker]]"
#"[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]"
#"Bring It On Down"
#"Up In The Sky"
#"[[Slide Away (Oasis song)|Slide Away]]"
#"[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]"
#"Married With Children"
#"[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]" (only during the second half of the tour, when it became a staple of their Set List)
#"[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]"
#"[[I Am the Walrus]]"

Other songs performed (Often in an acoustic set halfway through the show with Noel performing on his own):
*"[[Talk Tonight]]"
*"Listen Up"
*"Fade Away"
*"Take Me Away"
*"D'yer Wanna Be A Spaceman"
*"Sad Song"
