He co-wrote "[[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)]]", which became a #9 hit for [[Marvin Gaye]] in 1971.

Nyx was born in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], but moved to [[Detroit]] in the 1930s, where he married twice and raised a family of eight children.  He supported them through jobs requiring menial labor.<ref name=motowenc/>    At one time he was a resident of the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects]], where notable figures such as [[Diana Ross]] grew up.<ref name=tucker>{{cite web|url=http://board.okayplayer.com/okp.php?az=printer_friendly&forum=17&topic_id=19625&mesg_id=19638

His start in the music business was working as a janitor and handyman for Tri-Phi/Harvey Records, which was owned by the husband and wife team of [[Harvey Fuqua]] and [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua]], sister of [[Berry Gordy]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-nyx-jr-mn0001818105/biography|title=James Nyx Jr.|last=Hamilton|first=Andrew|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

He began to bring lyric ideas to Harvey, who collaborated with him on a few songs, including 1961's "Grieving About A Love," recorded by Lorri Rudolph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Lorri-Rudolph-Dont-Let-Them-Tell-Me-Tell-Me-Yourself-Grieving-About-A-Love/release/3093886|title=Lorri Rudolph – Don't Let Them Tell Me (Tell Me Yourself) / Grieving About A Love|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>  and 1963's "What Can You Do Now" recorded by Harvey and Ann.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Harvey-Ann-What-Can-You-Do-Now/master/597109|title=Harvey & Ann – What Can You Do Now|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

When Fuqua sold his labels to Motown Records in 1963, Nyx came along, signing to Jobete Music as a songwriter, but also working as a janitor and an elevator operator.  He continued to write with Fuqua, and also Marvin Gaye, but most of his early songwriting work was shelved.<ref name=allmusic/>

In July 1970, Gaye produced a song for [[The Originals (band)|The Originals]], a Gaye/Nyx composition called "We Can Make It Baby."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Originals-We-Can-Make-It-Baby-I-Like-Your-Style/master/429544|title=Originals, The – We Can Make It Baby|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

Nyx's real breakthrough came a year later, when Gaye needed collaborators to help with lyrics for his next project, the sessions that became the landmark album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]''. Nyx co-wrote three tracks on the album, "[[What's Happening Brother]]," "[[God Is Love (song)|God Is Love]]," and most famously, "[[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)]]."

Motown left Detroit the following year, but Nyx did not go with them.  He stayed and continued writing songs for a Detroit company named KellGriff Music. One such effort, 1974's "Outta My Life/I'm One Who Know" by the Brewster Crew on Lifeline records (T. Rodgers/J. Nyx Jr.) was arranged by [[David Van De Pitte]], who famously did the orchestrations for "What's Going On."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Brewster-Crew-Outta-My-Life-Im-One-Who-Know/release/2891628|title=Brewster Crew – Outta My Life / I'm One Who Know|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990s, samples of "Inner City Blues" were often used on R&B and rap records, providing Nyx with royalty income.<ref name=motowenc/>
