The '''National Institutes of Health''' ('''NIH''') is the national health research center of the [[Philippines]] that is responsible for [[biomedicine|biomedical]] and [[public health]] research.

== History ==
The National Institutes of Health was created on January 26, 1996 by the [[University of the Philippines]] Board of Regents to enhance research undertakings of [[University of the Philippines Manila|UP Manila]] with regards to public health. It serves as an institutional home of a network of researchers and research institutions. Eventually, NIH was established as the national health research center of the Philippines through the ''Health Research and Development Act of 1998'', otherwise known as ''Republic Act 8503''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nih.upm.edu.ph/about-nih/historical-highlights |title=Historical Highlights |publisher=University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Health |access-date=October 26, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="PCWGovPH-RA8503">{{cite web |title=Republic Act 8503 |url=https://pcw.gov.ph/law/republic-act-8503 |website=Philippine Commission on Women |access-date=19 April 2020 |date=13 February 1998}}</ref>

In March 2018, NIH celebrated its 20th anniversary by organizing a scientific conference focusing on the importance of work, health and well-being of the Filipino people at the Bayanihan Center, UNILAB, Pasig.<ref>{{Cite web|last=MPRO_admin|title=NIH marks 20th anniversary with scientific conference|url=https://www.up.edu.ph/nih-marks-20th-anniversary-with-scientific-conference/|access-date=2021-02-19|website=University of the Philippines|language=en-US}}</ref>
