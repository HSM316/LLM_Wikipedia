On April 24, [[Commander]] Lewis Clark, of the [[Brazil Squadron|South Atlantic Squadron]], was sailing to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean coast]] of Colombia, when the lookouts aboard the ''Alliance'' sighted the one-gun ''Ambrose Light''. It was flying a strange flag featuring a red cross over a white background so the Americans assumed the vessel was a [[pirate ship]]. A chase began. The Americans were preparing to fire a shot over the vessel's bow when a Colombian ensign was observed and the ''Ambrose Light'' came to a halt. Commander Clark put [[Lieutenant]] M. Fisher, and a boarding party, on the rebel ship and it was found to have been armed with one cannon and sixty heavily armed sailors. A large cache of ammunition was also discovered. The Colombians revealed their [[letter of marque]] from the rebel leader [[Pedro Lara]], giving the men of ''Ambrose Light'' permission to [[naval blockade|blockade]] Cartagena. Commander Clark disregarded this and took the rebels prisoner and the brigantine as a prize. The ship was put under the command of Lieutenant Fisher with ten others and sent to be condemned in [[New York (state)|New York]]. After arriving on June 1, a [[stowaway]] was found, starving to death, hiding behind some casks in the cargo hold. The man immediately received medical attention.

==Legal case==
Following the court proceedings, it was agreed that ''Alliance'' had lawfully seized the rebels as pirates because Pedro Lara, as a rebel, had no right to commission warships.

After a legal decision, the ship was returned to her Colombian owners, in return for costs. The court ruled that the ship could legally be used to transport troops between Colombian ports during the Colombian Civil War.<ref>{{cite news |title= The Ambrose Light Not a Privateer |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/07/03/103026697.pdf |work=The New York Times |date= 1885-07-03|access-date=21 April 2009 }}</ref> When fighting broke out in Cartagena, American [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas F.

This incident was the basis for a decision in [[case law]] that defines who can be called a [[pirate]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
