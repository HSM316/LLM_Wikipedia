It is composed of [[rail trail]], [[Menomonee River]]-following, and on-street segments. The trail sees approximately 200,000 users each year.

==History==
Planning for the project began in 1991 when the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] directed the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to study the feasibility of creating a park next to [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. At the time, the proposed park was referred to as Henry Aaron State Park. Input from local stakeholders, such as a recommendation by then-mayor [[John Norquist]]'s Bicycle Task Force to develop an east-west trail through the [[Menomonee Valley]],<ref name="Maher" />{{Rp|61}} led to the project focus changing toward creating a multi-mile urban greenway along the [[Menomonee River]]. This greenway was originally named the Menomonee River Greenway, then renamed the Henry Aaron State Park Trail. A report by the DNR suggested that developing the trail would help remediate over a century of industrial pollution of the river, meet demand for more public open spaces, and reverse the effects of inner-city abandonment. The trail was envisioned to follow the southern edge of the river from South 2nd Street to Doyne Park, where it would meet the Milwaukee County 76 Bike Trail (now [[Oak Leaf Trail]]). The plan was approved by then-governor [[Tommy Thompson]] in 1997.<ref name="plan">{{Cite web |date=October 23, 1996 |title=Henry Aaron State Park Trail Feasibility Study, Master Plan and Environmental Assessment |url=https://widnr.widen.net/s/vjt7lfcwlf/fl_mp_henryaaronst_masterplan_1996 |access-date=November 21, 2023 |website=[[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]]}}</ref>{{Rp|pp=i,1,2,4–10}}

The trail begins on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Lakeshore State Park]], near [[Henry Maier Festival Park]]. It travels west on city streets through Milwaukee until reaching West Pittsburgh Avenue, where a ramp leads up to the Sixth Street South Viaduct. Going north, at the intersection with West Canal Street, the trail borders the roadway westward until approaching South 37th Street, where it becomes a rail trail. It continues west, traveling through the [[Milwaukee Soldiers Home (Old Main)]] and [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]] and passing near the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] before ending at an intersection with the [[Oak Leaf Trail]] at Underwood Parkway in [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin]].<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=https://www.hankaaronstatetrail.org/s/HASTMAP2021_Final_022621.pdf |title=Hank Aaron State Trail Map |publisher=Friends of Hank Aaron State Trail |access-date=December 18, 2022}}</ref> The elevation increases by {{Convert|272|ft|m}} when traveling westward.<ref name="nickel" />

==Recognition==
Before the trail was formally dedicated in 2000, the [[White House Millennium Council]] designated it a [[National Millennium Trails|Millennium Legacy Trail]] due to "its respectful celebration of the past, its connection to the community, and its far-reaching vision for the future."<ref name="dedication">{{Cite news |last=Sandin |first=Jo |date=August 14, 2000 |title=Trail to debut, telling story of champion, river |pages=01 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |url=https://0-infoweb-newsbank-com.countycat.mcfls.org/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D8DE8DE83992E4A&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB82DF44DC5522D |url-access=registration |access-date=November 19, 2023 |via=[[NewsBank]] }}</ref>

At the dedication ceremony, Hank Aaron spoke to how honored he was to have the trail named after him and hoped future generations would see how much being welcomed by the people of Milwaukee meant to "a young baseball player so many, many years ago." When informed about progress on developing the trail, he expressed pleasure at the number of children and diverse neighborhoods that would have access to it. He regularly traveled to Milwaukee to be at trail-related events over the years until his death in 2021.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Zani |first=Andrea |date=Summer 2021 |title=Legacy of a Legend |url=https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/wnrmag/2021/Summer/Aaron |magazine=Wisconsin Natural Resources Magazine |access-date=November 21, 2023}}</ref>

The route of the trail through Three Bridges Park won an Honor Award from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2011 for how it accommodated the large age range of students at the nearby [[Urban Ecology Center]] without unnecessarily dividing the park.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Making a Wild Place in Milwaukee’s Urban Menomonee Valley |url=https://www.asla.org/2011awards/436.html |access-date=November 18, 2023 |website=[[American Society of Landscape Architects]]}}</ref>
