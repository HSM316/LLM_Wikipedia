{{nihongo||秋田音頭|'''Akita Ondo'''|extra=meaning "the Akita Marching Song"}} is a [[folk song]] of [[Akita prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It is said that it was created when [[Kubota domain]] in Akita prefecture was inspected by [[Yoshitaka Satake]] in 1663. It was originally known simply as the "Ondo" ("Marching Song"), but it is said that around the beginning of the [[Meiji era]] it became known as the "Akita Ondo".

The unique characteristic of the Akita Ondo is its litany of humorous lyrics, accompanied by instruments like the [[shamisen]], [[flute]], and [[bell (instrument)|bell]]. Besides the initial cry "yātonā" (or "yātosei"), few [[interval (music)|musical intervals]] are used. The verses are simply laid out upon a 7-7-9 rhythm, in style similar to modern [[rapping|rap music]].
