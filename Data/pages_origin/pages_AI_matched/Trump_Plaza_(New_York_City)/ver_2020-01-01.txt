'''Trump Plaza''' is a 36-story [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] and retail building named after [[Donald Trump]] and located at 167 East [[61st Street (Manhattan)|61st Street]] in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name=Emp/> The property, designed by 
[[Philip Birnbaum (architect)|Philip Birnbaum]] and built at a cost of $125 million, was opened in 1984.

==History==
===Construction===
Construction of Trump Plaza began in 1982, at the intersection of East [[61st Street (Manhattan)|61st Street]] and [[Third Avenue]].<ref name=Emp>{{cite web|title=Trump Plaza Apartments|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115139/trump-plaza-apartments-new-york-city-ny-usa|publisher=[[Emporis]]|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]] negotiated a 40-year deal with the owner of the land in which the building would pay an annual rent of approximately $1.2 million until 2023.<ref name=Rising>{{cite news|last=Satow|first=Julie|title=Rising Costs a Concern for Land-Lease Building Owners|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/realestate/rising-costs-a-concern-for-land-lease-building-owners-in-new-york.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|last=Carlyle|first=Erin|title=Manhattan's Trump Plaza Apartment Owners Face $1 Million Fee|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2014/11/06/manhattans-trump-plaza-apartment-owners-face-1-million-fee/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=November 6, 2014}}</ref> Trump chose to name the project Trump Plaza to capitalize on the marketing success of his nearby [[Trump Tower]]. The project, initially expected to cost $50 million, was to contain 180 [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] units, located above {{convert|12000|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space that would be situated on the ground floor.<ref name=NYT1983/>

Two project offices on East 61st Street, made of [[brownstone]], were to be converted into apartments after the main structure was completed.<ref name=NYT1983/> Trump said that despite the popularity of condominiums in New York at that time, "I wanted to buck the trend. There are a lot of people who want to live in a cooperative. […] Many people find a co-op's exclusivity, the unity it gives a building, comforting. This exclusivity can be used negatively, but it has positive aspects as well."<ref name=NYT1983/> Units would range from {{convert|1200|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1900|sqft|abbr=on}}, with prices between $285,000 and $1 million.<ref name=NYT1983>{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Lee A.|title=About Real Estate; Upper East Side Attracts Two Mixed-Use Projects|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/07/business/about-real-estate-upper-east-side-attracts-two-mixed-use-projects.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1983}}</ref>

The concrete and concrete workers union labor for the building was supplied by mobster [[Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno]] . Salerno and Trump were linked through [[Roy Cohn]], who represented both of them. In 1986 [[Rudy Giuliani]] and the SDNY indicted Salerno on racketeering linked to the [[bid rigging]] of concrete and construction on Trump Plaza, as well as other buildings built in the era.<ref name="roll_TheR">{{Cite web |title=The Real-Life Mob Families of 'The Irishman'?

Trump Plaza was opened in March 1984, with 145 units.<ref>{{cite news|last=Oser|first=Alan S.|title=Retailers' Locations; Movement at the Alexander's Site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/realestate/perspectives-retailers-locations-movement-at-the-alexander-s-site.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=December 15, 1985|quote=Trump Plaza, a 145-unit cooperative on the west side of the avenue between 60th and 61st Street, opened in March 1984 […].}}</ref> Notable residents included former Kentucky governor [[John Y.

As of 1999, Trump still owned a few apartment units, as well as retail space and the property's parking garage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Salkin|first=Allen|title=Trump: The Smarts of the Deal|url=https://nypost.com/1999/04/18/trump-the-smarts-of-the-deal-how-donald-uses-mostly-other-peoples-money-to-build-a-kingdom-in-his-name/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[New York Post]]|date=April 18, 1999}}</ref> As of 2015, the property is operated by [[Douglas Elliman]] Property Management.<ref name=Rising/> In 2016, to remain competitive with newer residential projects, Trump Plaza's basement gym facility was converted into a children's playroom, while the gym was relocated to a space on the first and second floor that was previously used as an apartment by the [[building superintendent]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Joanne|title=Insert a Gym, Then a Lounge: Older Buildings Add Amenities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/realestate/older-buildings-add-amenities-to-compete.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>

==Design==
Trump Plaza was designed by Philip Birnbaum and was built out in a Y-shape.<ref name=NYT1983/> The structure is made of [[limestone]], glass, and metal,<ref name=Look/> and includes five apartments on each floor,<ref name=Defining/> while the building includes a total of {{convert|340000|sqft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=NYT1983/> Trump, who sometimes exaggerated the number of floors in his buildings, stated that Trump Plaza was 39 stories high while it is actually 36 stories.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cheshes|first=Jay|title=Edifice Complex: Does The Donald have a size problem?|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/shortlist/trump/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=November 30, 2001}}</ref>

Although Birnbaum was known for simple building designs in New York City, architectural critic [[Paul Goldberger]] stated that Trump Plaza "looks as if it might be the finest building in [[Caracas]] – all of this sleekness is [[chic]] in a particularly Latin way, quite uncharacteristic of New York, despite the lavish use of limestone." Goldberger also stated that no one "could possibly mistake it for yet another Third Avenue high-rise."<ref name=Defining>{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Defining Luxury in New York's New Apartments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/16/garden/defining-luxury-in-new-york-s-new-apartments.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1984}}</ref> Goldberger later called it "a better and more striking building than the typical Third Avenue brick box, but it is nothing if not showy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|title=Trump: Symbol of a Gaudy, Impatient Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/31/arts/architecture-view-trump-symbol-of-a-gaudy-impatient-time.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 31, 1988}}</ref>

Birnbaum was subsequently hired to design a nearby high-rise condominium known as the Savoy, to be built at the opposite intersection corner diagonally across from Trump Plaza. Birnbaum gave the Savoy a similar design to Trump Plaza, as he envisioned the buildings as the gateway to upper Third Avenue. In April 1984, Trump sued Birnbaum and Morton Olshan, owner of the Savoy, for allegedly copying the design of his building. Trump sought $60 million in damages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postings; Building Higher|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/22/realestate/postings-building-higher.html|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Builder Donald Trump Monday sued his former architect|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/04/30/Builder-Donald-Trump-Monday-sued-his-former-architect-and/6055452145600/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=April 30, 1984}}</ref> A settlement was reached in October 1984, after Olshan agreed to have his building redesigned.

In 2016, [[Steve Cuozzo]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' stated that the area around Trump Plaza had been "a lost highway of tenements and boxy, bland apartment buildings" and that the project "inspired four more similarly configured towers on the avenue and lent some badly needed class to uptown east of [[Lexington Avenue]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cuozzo|first=Steve|title=How Donald Trump helped save New York City|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/07/how-donald-trump-helped-save-new-york-city/|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=New York Post|date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>

An Italian restaurant named Alo Alo, owned by film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and Brazilian business partner Ricardo Amaral, opened inside the building in 1985.
