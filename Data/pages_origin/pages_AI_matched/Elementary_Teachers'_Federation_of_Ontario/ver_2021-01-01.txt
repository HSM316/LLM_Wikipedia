ETFO's 81,000 members join l'Association des enseignantes et des enseignants Franco-ontariens (representing approximately 8,000 members), the [[Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association]] (representing approximately 45,000 members) and the [[Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation]] (representing approximately 60,000 members) to form the [[Ontario Teachers' Federation]].<ref>Welcome to ETFO, Published by ETFO, Toronto, ON (2011)</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Unions in the time of revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/unionsintimeofre0000resh|url-access=registration|first1=Yonatan|last1=Reshef|first2=Sandra|last2=Rastin|page=[https://archive.org/details/unionsintimeofre0000resh/page/87 87]|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-8753-1}}</ref> ETFO is also a member of the [[Canadian Teachers' Federation]] and [[Education International]].

In addition to the 4 released officers, ETFO's provincial governing body includes one representative to the [[Ontario Teachers' Federation]] (OTF Table Officer), and as many additional officers required to make up the 14-member Executive. Of those remaining positions, 4 of them are open to women only.

All Provincial Executive positions are elected by the general membership at ETFO's Annual Meeting held each summer in August. All terms last 2 years.

===ETFO locals===

Each school board in Ontario has at least 1 ETFO Local serving members who work within that school board. Teacher Locals are present in all school boards, 1 Local (James Bay) has only a Teacher Local, 10 boards have DECE (Dedicated Early Childhood Educator) Locals, and 2 boards have ESP and one of those 2 (Renfrew County) also has a PSP Local.

The objectives and priorities of ETFO are contained in the constitution:

While all boards now have DECEs as a result of the implementation of Full Day Kindergarten for children aged 4 – 6, not all of those educators are represented by ETFO.
