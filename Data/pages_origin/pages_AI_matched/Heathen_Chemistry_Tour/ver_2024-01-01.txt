The '''Heathen Chemistry World Tour''' was a [[concert tour]] by English band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], which took place between 2002 and 2003. The tour was in promotion of their record ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]''. While the tour was successful, it was plagued by major incidents including lead singer [[Liam Gallagher]]'s voice giving out during three of the band's gigs and resulted in him walking off stage and guitarist [[Noel Gallagher]] had to take over on vocals, a car crash that left Noel, bassist [[Andy Bell (Welsh musician)|Andy Bell]] and touring keyboardist [[Jay Darlington]] in hospital and resulted in the North American leg getting cut short<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dotmusic.com/news//August2002/news26089.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020819071202/http://www.dotmusic.com/news//August2002/news26089.asp | archive-date=2002-08-19 | title=Dotmusic - news - More Oasis cancellations }}</ref> and a bar brawl in [[Munich]], Germany involving Liam, drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] and several members of their crew that left Liam getting his teeth knocked out,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3685545.stm | title=Brawling Oasis singer 'on drugs' | date=5 May 2004 }}</ref> White getting brain scans,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2383329 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817034301/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2383329 | archive-date=2011-08-17 | title=- the Scotsman }}</ref> Liam getting fined with £35,000<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4032185.stm | title=Oasis star fined for German brawl | date=22 November 2004 }}</ref> and the German leg getting pushed into March 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/altnews/021209_oasis.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021225091845/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/altnews/021209_oasis.shtml | archive-date=2002-12-25 | title=BBC - Radio 1 News - Oasis }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oasisinet.com/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030201095834/http://www.oasisinet.com/ | archive-date=2003-02-01 | title=Welcome to the official oasis website }}</ref> This is the band's last world tour with White, before his dismissal in January 2004.
