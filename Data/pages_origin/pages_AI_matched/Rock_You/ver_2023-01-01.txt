"'''Rock You'''" is a [[hard rock]] song written by [[Bob Halligan, Jr.]], and the first track from [[Helix (band)|Helix]]'s 1984 album ''[[Walkin' the Razor's Edge]]''. It is best known for its [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] [[refrain]] of "Gimme an R, O, C, K." It peaked at number 27 on the RPM Pop Chart in Canada, although it received much higher levels of play on Canadian rock radio stations, but no national rock track chart exists for Canada for this time period.<ref name="RPM">{{cite web|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.9628&type=2&interval=24&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles - Volume 41, No. 16, December 22 1984 |publisher= Library and Archives Canada |accessdate= 19 August 2013}}</ref>

==Helix versions==
Songwriter [[Bob Halligan, Jr.|Bob Halligan]] offered the band "Rock You" while they were looking for extra material for ''[[Walkin' the Razor's Edge]]'' in 1984.  "Rock You" was road tested in concert, played for the first time at the Alrosa Villa in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref>[http://www.planethelix.com/Albums/Album04.htm Planet Helix: Walkin' the Razor's Edge]</ref>  Helix vocalist [[Brian Vollmer]] claims that he wrote a new verse for the song but was denied a co-writing credit.<ref>Brian Vollmer interview with Paul Suter 2009, ''Walkin' the Razors Edge'' Rock Candy liner notes, page 6</ref>  The track was produced by the band with [[Rodney Mills]], who was brought in due to his earlier mixing work with [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]].<ref name="book">{{cite book | author=Vollmer, Brian| title= Gimme An R! the story of Brian Vollmer, lead vocalist of Helix| publisher=Ball Media Corporation | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-9739849-0-3}}</ref>

A brand new acoustic studio version was recorded and released in 2010 on the band's ''[[Smash Hits...Unplugged!]]'' CD.  This version was produced by Aaron Murray, [[Sean Kelly (Canadian musician)|Sean Kelly]] and Vollmer.<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/149100 HELIX - More Smash Hits Unplugged Details Revealed]</ref>

The chorus of "Rock You" has lent itself to Vollmer's [[autobiography]], ''Gimme An R!'', as well as many Helix T-shirts and merchandise.

===Labatt's Blue version===
Prior to the album or the single's release, Helix struck a deal with the [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to use the music with new lyrics for a beer commercial.  A clip of that version can be heard on the DVD ''[[30 Years Of Helix: No Rest For The Wicked]]''.

===Music video===
The [[music video]] for "Rock You", filmed in a [[quarry]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], is perhaps best known for the image of guitar player Brent Doerner emerging from the water to play his guitar solo.<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/58394 BRENT DOERNER interview by Michael A. Ladano - "If You Don't Write Good Songs, It Ain't Gonna Fly Baby"]</ref>  The video is available on the Helix DVD ''[[S.E.X. Rated]]''. The uncensored version of the video was banned from [[MTV]] for nudity.

===Live versions===
Four live versions of "Rock You" have been officially released by the band.  A contemporary live recording was released on the promotional [[extended play|EP]] ''Live At The Marquee'', and the 2009 Rock Candy reissue of ''[[Walkin' the Razor's Edge]]''.  A 1991 recording appeared on 1998's ''[[half-ALIVE]]''.  It was filmed in 2004 for the live DVD ''[[30th Anniversary Concert]]'', and another live version was released on [[iTunes]] from the 2005 [[Sweden Rock Festival]].

===In popular culture===
On the Canadian television program [[Trailer Park Boys]], "Rock You" was the subject of discussion among the main characters.  This was based on the call-and-response [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, "Gimme an R, O, C, K," where the crowd responds with each letter.  You can find the discussion [[q:Trailer Park Boys#Closer to the Heart|here on Wikiquote]].  On the DVD of Season 3, there is a deleted scene featuring [[Brian Vollmer]] and the Trailer Park Boys, using the "Gimme an R" lyric in another joke.
In the spin-off series [[Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series]], this song is referenced multiple times, and played shortly in the season one finale.

===Helix/Sum 41 controversy===
After Sum 41's version of "Rock You" was released, [[Brian Vollmer]] and [[Glen "Archie" Gamble]] were to meet Sum 41 at a ''FUBAR'' promotional event, only to find the Sum 41 members uninterested in meeting or talking to them.  Later that day on a television broadcast, Sum 41 stated that Helix were "rock gods" and claimed to be fans.  This snubbing caused Vollmer to refer to them as "Scum 41" on occasion.<ref name="book" />
