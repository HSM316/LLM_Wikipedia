==Life and Times==
Brandon Lowry grew up in Stoystown, Pennsylvania. In his early years, Brandon studied piano and experimented with bootleg tape recording. His father worked in a factory and coal plant to support the family. After high school, Lowry studied classical piano at Duquesne University. He graduated from college, and after an early stint as a cruise ship pianist, Lowry's musical career came to fruition in 2007 after moving to New York City. He quickly came into demand as a session player, songwriter, and music producer. In 2008, he co-founded a music production team [[Robopop]] with Daniel Omelio. Soon after, Robopop went on to cowrite and coproduce "[[Stereo Hearts]]" by [[Gym Class Heroes]], featuring [[Adam Levine]]. The record was certified 3× platinum in the United States, 3× platinum in Australia and 2× platinum in Canada and reached #1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' US Pop Songs Chart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

After the success of "Stereo Hearts", Robopop coproduced the song "[[Video Games (Lana Del Rey song)|Video Games]]", the first breakout release from artist [[Lana Del Rey]]. "Video Games" was a huge success and its album ''[[Born to Die (Lana Del Rey album)|Born to Die]]'' has gone on to sell over 5,000,000 units worldwide. Lowry also played the piano part on the recording and was credited as a mixing engineer. After "Video Games", Lowry split off from Robopop and reemerged under a new alter ego Sterling Fox.

In 2013, Sterling cowrote the dance crossover hit "[[Take Me Home (Cash Cash song)|Take Me Home]]" by [[Cash Cash]], which was certified gold in the US and reach #5 in the UK. In 2014, Sterling produced and cowrote the #1 iTunes hit single "[[Wasted Love (Matt McAndrew song)|Wasted Love]]" for ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' Season 7 finalist [[Matt McAndrew]].

As a vocalist, Fox has worked on a number of electronic collaborations, including cowriting and singing the song "Shame on Me" from [[Avicii]]'s album ''[[True (Avicii album)|True]]'' and also writing and singing the song "Talk to Myself" from Avicii's 2nd album [[Stories (Avicii album)|Stories]].

In 2015, he cowrote the [[Adam Lambert]] single Ghost Town with [[Max Martin]], which would go on to become certified Gold in the US. He also added the whistle part to the hook.

Fox would also contribute writing to Where the Devil Don't Go for [[Elle King]]'s album [[Love Stuff]], which became one of the top selling Rock albums of the year. In 2016, it was featured in the Season 4 theatrical trailer for [[Orange is the New Black]].

In 2016, he cowrote "Man on the Moon" and "If I'm Dancing" on the [[Britney Spears]] album [[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]] and additionally added guitar and background vocals on "Man on the Moon".

Over his career, he has written songs with the likes of  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Max Martin]], [[Julia Michaels]], and others, and his works have been performed live by the likes of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[One Direction]], and [[Maroon 5]].

In 2017 Fox performed at [[SXSW]] and was subsequently threatened with arrest by festival coordinators for using a large collage of corporate logo parodies as his stage backdrop while street performing throughout the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Immediately after the inauguration of [[Donald Trump]] as US president, Lowry moved to Montreal, Canada for a year.

In 2018, Lowry retired his Sterling Fox pseudonym and introduced a new project called Baby Fuzz. Baby Fuzz released several singles and music videos in 2018 and 2019 to critical acclaim. In March 2019, Baby Fuzz independently released its debut album ''Plastic Paradise''.

Lowry is currently still writing songs for others, running a small indie label Blanket Fort, and also touring and releasing music as Baby Fuzz.
