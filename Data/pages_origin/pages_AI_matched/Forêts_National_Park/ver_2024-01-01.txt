==History==
[[File:Cloître d'Auberive.jpg|thumb|left|Auberive Abbey, located within Forêts National Park]]
The idea for the park was put forth in 2009, with numerous working groups and studies involved in over a decade in identifying strengths and weaknesses for what it could accomplish, as well as otherwise developing and defining its boundaries so that it would be a coherent, sensible whole.

The park was formally established on 7 November 2019, by publication of an official decree signed by Prime Minister [[Édouard Philippe]] in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]''.<ref name="Décret du 06/11/19">[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=09CEECC1F0C9C667F881F73AEA2EBBBD.tplgfr30s_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000039333912&dateTexte=&oldAction=rechJO&categorieLien=id&idJO=JORFCONT000039333869 "Décret n° 2019-1132 du 6 novembre 2019 créant le Parc national de forêts"].</ref> It is the eleventh [[List of national parks of France|national park of France]] to be created<ref>[https://www.lefigaro.fr/voyages/la-foret-coeur-du-11e-parc-national-francais-inaugure-cette-semaine-20191106."Découverte en avant-première du 11e Parc National dans les forêts de Champagne et Bourgogne"]{{Dead link|date=November 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Philippe Viguié-Desplaces, ''Le Figaro'', 6 November 2019</ref> and the second largest behind the [[Guiana Amazonian Park|Amazonian Park of Guiana]] in South America. Like a [[Overseas departments and regions of France|number of overseas areas]], [[French Guiana]] is defined to be a department and region. Its park is officially the largest in the [[European Union]].
