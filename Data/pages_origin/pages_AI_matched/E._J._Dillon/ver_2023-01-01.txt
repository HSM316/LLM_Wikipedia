==Biography==
He was born on 21 March 1854 in [[Dublin, Ireland]], the son of an Irish father and an English mother.<ref name=obit/>

Dillon initially trained for the priesthood; however, he abandoned all plans for a career in the church when he was 21, and immersed himself in the study of Oriental languages at the [[Collège de France]] in [[Paris]]. He later was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] by the [[University of Leipzig]], and obtained two further doctorates, in Oriental Languages and Literature from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], and in [[Comparative linguistics|Comparative Philology]] from the [[Kharkiv University|University of Kharkiv]].<ref name="DNB">Baylen, Joseph: ‘Dillon, Emile Joseph (1854–1933)’, in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32828, accessed 26 Oct 2009]</ref>

He was  Russian correspondent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' from 1887 to 1914 and, for a short time, was professor of [[Sanskrit]], [[Armenian language|Classical Armenian]], and Comparative Philology at the University of Kharkiv. He was a friend and associate of the Russian statesman [[Sergei Witte]], whom he accompanied in 1905 to the [[Treaty of Portsmouth|peace conference]] at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] which formally brought to an end the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref>Harcave, Sidney.

When working as a journalist, Dillon occasionally disguised himself in order to observe the action from closer quarters, as was the case when he was sent by ''The Daily Telegraph'' to report on the [[Hamidian massacres|Turkish massacres of Armenians]] in 1894-1895.<ref>Ayerst, David.
