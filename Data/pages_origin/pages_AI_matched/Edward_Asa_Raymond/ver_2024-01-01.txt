In 1860, at a meeting of the Supreme Council, he "refused to act on a motion, blocked a motion to adjourn, and then declared the Council closed.  The next day, immediately after the opening and the reading of the minutes, he closed the Council '<nowiki/>''sine die,'''  or indefinitely, and walked out."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scottish Rite Boston |url=https://www.scottishriteboston.net/en/page.php?id=160 |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=www.scottishriteboston.net}}</ref>  Killian Henry Van Rensselaer was elected as Lieutenant Grand Commander in his absence, who then served as acting Grand Commander.

The end of his tenure as Grand Commander created a schism in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, which resulted in two competing organizations that both claimed legitimacy. This schism was eventually resolved in 1867, three years after Raymond's death in 1864 in Brookline, Massachusetts.<ref name="schism" /><ref name="amicable">{{cite web | url=http://amicablelodge.com/?page_id=2 | title=About Amicable Lodge| year=2012}} "During its 205 year history, Amicable Lodge [has had many prominent members] ...
