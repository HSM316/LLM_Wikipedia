'''''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American rock band [[Trenchmouth]], released in January 1995 by [[EastWest Records]], becoming the band's only album on a major label. Disillusioned with how they felt they did not have a place in the scene and time period they shared with bands such as [[Fugazi]], [[Nation of Ulysses]] and [[Jawbox]], Trenchmouth decided to change directions and recorded the album with producer and mixer Brad Wood in July 1994. The aggressive and eclectic album combines influences and styles of [[noise rock]], [[post-punk]], [[no wave]], [[dub music|dub]], [[ska]] and [[jazz]].

The album incorporates [[walking bassline]]s, mutating [[time signature]]s, [[polyrhythm]]s, [[guitar feedback]], [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and elaborate guitar phasing. Vocalist Damon Locks uses a unique speak-singing style, while drummer [[Fred Armisen]]'s percussive style uses change-ups and conspicuous use of [[drum roll]]s. More melodic in the album are guitarist Chris de Zutter and bassist Wayne Montana. Upon release, the album was commercially unsuccessful, despite reaching number 39 on the [[CMJ New Music Monthly|Top 75 Alternative Radio Play]] chart, but it did receive favourable reviews from music critics. The album has been posed as a "meaner" and "less tuneful" precedent to several [[post-punk revival]] bands in the mid-2000s.

==Background and recording==
Trenchmouth formed in [[Chicago]] in 1988. Described by Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] as "[a] completely uncategorizable quartet,"<ref name="Kellman">{{cite web|last1=Kellman|first1=Andy|title=AllMusic Review by Andy Kellman|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/trenchmouth-mn0000747058/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=6 November 2017}}</ref> the band incorporated a variety of diverse genres into their music,<ref name="Kellman" /> fusing Caribbean rhythms with the energy of [[hardcore punk]], the "ass-grabbing power" of [[funk]] and numerous [[jazz]] characteristics.<ref name="Woodlief" /> Though their debut album ''Construction of New Action'' (1991) established the group's unique musical style, with hints of funk, [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]], it was not until their second album ''Inside the Future'' (1993) that the band's musical style became more aggressive, hinting towards the eventual direction taken on ''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun''.<ref name="Woodlief" />

Vocalist Damon Locks felt the band "were never in vogue," saying that other bands which Trenchmouth were friends with and played with, such as [[Fugazi]], [[Nation of Ulysses]] and [[Jawbox]], "seemed to have a place in that time period. [...] They had a place in that scene, and we didn't."<ref name="Holub">{{cite web|last1=Holub|first1=Anne|title=The Eternals and Skybox: Sound Like Chicago?|url=http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2007/02/01/the_eternals_an/|website=Gapers Block|accessdate=November 6, 2017|date=February 1, 2007}}</ref> It was with ''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' that the band figured they could not "win," so instead decided to, as Locks called it, "do our own thing."<ref name="Holub" /> The sound that Damon Locks and bassist Wayne Montana styled in their subsequent band [[The Eternals]] was first experimented with during this period.<ref name="Holub" /> ''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' was recorded at Idful Studios in July 1994 with recording and mixing by Brad Wood.<ref name="booklet1">{{cite AV media notes| title = Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun| others= Trenchmouth| year = 1995| type = liner| publisher = EastWest Records}}</ref> A radio excerpt in the song "A Man Without Lungs" was taken from ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', incorporated with permission from Radio Yesteryear.<ref name="booklet1" />

==Musical style==
[[File:Fred Armisen.jpg|thumb|[[Fred Armisen]] (pictured in 2008) makes conspicuous usage of [[tom-tom]]s, [[drum roll]]s and percussion change-ups on the album.]]
''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' takes the [[noise rock]] sound like that of the [[Touch and Go (band)|Touch & Go]] and [[Amphetamine Reptile]] labels and applies it to a [[post-punk]] style reminiscent of first-wave post-punk groups [[Gang of Four]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[the Pop Group]] and [[A Certain Ratio]].<ref name="Earles">{{cite web|last1=Earles|first1=Andrew|title=Blame Nirvana: The 40 Weirdest Post-‘Nevermind’ Major-Label Albums|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/01/blame-nirvana-40-weirdest-post-nevermind-major-label-albums/130103-trenchmouth_0/|website=Spin|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=8 January 2013}}</ref> Influences on the album include [[punk rock]], [[no wave]], [[dub music|dub]] and [[ska]],<ref name="Glazer" /> and it incorporates [[walking bassline]]s, extravagant guitar phasing and evolving time signatures.<ref name="Glazer" /> Chauncey Hollingsworth of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' felt the album "taps a murky vein somewhere between tribal [[punk jazz|punk-jazz]] and an aborted art project,"<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> while Devon Jackson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt the album "teeters on the edge" of controlled chaos and sophisticated [[polyrhythm]]ic [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]].<ref name="Jackson" /> Unlike the other songs, opening song "Washington, Washington" features a consistent [[4/4 beat]] throughout its two minute duration.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terich|first1=Jeff|title=The 90-Minute Guide: Post-Hardcore|url=http://www.treblezine.com/the-90-minute-guide-post-hardcore/|website=Treblezine|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=24 April 2007}}</ref> "How I Became Invincible" features jagged rhythms,<ref name="Woodlief" /> and a frenzied bassline, as does "How I Became Invincible."<ref name="Fisher" /> "A Man Without Lungs" has been described as "new Trench-dub."<ref name="Woodlief" /> "Doing the Flammability" has been described as an insistent tumult.<ref name="Woodlief" />

Vocalist Damon Locks relies upon lyrical repetition "as an instrument of sorts," and uses rhyming "word-jazz" over the music's free-form "anti-harmonies."<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> His unusual vocals incorporate a speak-singing style,<ref name="Glazer" /> described by one writer as neither singing nor shouting but a spoken, maddening voice.<ref name="Fisher" /> His vocals have been compared to [[Jello Biafra]],<ref name="Fisher" /> [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]],<ref name="Earles" /> [[Matt Lukin]]<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> and [[N.W.A.]]-era [[Ice Cube]].<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> Joshua Glazer of [[AllMusic]] describes the lyrics as teeming "with occupational imagery that mirrors the goose-stepping rhythms and espionage riffs. Vocalist Damon Locks schizophrenically switches from oppressor to resistance by speak-singing in the disturbed cadence of a mad dictator or shell-shocked survivor. Calling out the warning 'they got lights for eyes and submachine guns/they're rolling over houses like they were made of marzipan,' Locks confirms that ''Trenchmouth Vs. the Light of the Sun'' is an armed conflict."<ref name="Glazer" />

[[Fred Armisen]]'s drumming is jagged and powerful,<ref name="Fisher" /> and incorporates percussion change-ups.<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> He rarely plays a simple rock beat and instead makes prominent usage of [[tom-tom]]s and [[drum roll]]s, though his drumming stops short from being technical.<ref name="Fisher" /> Damon Locks also provides some of his own percussion, helping to contribute towards the album's unusual percussive sound.<ref name="Jenkins" /> The melodies on the album are provided by the guitar and bass.<ref name="Fisher" /> Guitarist Chris de Zutter's guitar work ranges from bombastic [[post-hardcore]] to [[jazz]]-inspired inflection.<ref name="Woodlief" /> Using either simplistic chords or riffs, he plays with a stark, angular tone, and uses [[guitar feedback]] at his most chaotic.<ref name="Fisher" /> Wayne Montana's bass provides a "bizarre undercurrent" with his rapid, walking basslines, contributing towards the absence of any solid bottom in the music.<ref name="Fisher" />

==Release==
Released on January 17, 1995, ''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' was the band's only album on major label [[EastWest Records]].<ref name="Earles" /> In 2013, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' included the album at number 30 in their list of "The 40 Weirdest Post-‘Nevermind’ Major-Label Albums." They felt that "[a]side from [[Fugazi]]'s toe-dips into similar territory (and what little Gang of Four you could hear in the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), the mainstream precedent for [the band's musical style] was a small, specialist group of mid-'90s record collectors. So, just think of Trenchmouth's lone major-label album as an early, meaner, less tuneful version of what [[Bloc Party]], [[Futureheads]], and [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] would flourish with ten years later."<ref name="Earles" /> The album's liner notes list Candy Machine's ''A Modest Proposal'' (1994) as a "must have" album.<ref name="Earles" /> Though the album was not a commercial success, it reached number 39 on the ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' Top 75 Alternative Radio Play chart.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Top 75 Alternative Radio Play|journal=CMJ New Music Monthly|date=May 1995|volume=21|page=54|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LC0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=trenchmouth+vs+the+light+of+the+sun&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjjYHQnarXAhWG1RQKHcAKDpwQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=trenchmouth%20vs%20the%20light%20of%20the%20sun&f=false|accessdate=6 November 2017}}</ref>

''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' received positive reviews from critics. Devon Jackson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the album A– and wrote that: "At once hypnotic and herky-jerky, the harsh vocals and harsher guitars complement a percussive collision reminiscent of [[the Clash]]. More for intellectual moshers than for the musically squeamish."<ref name="Jackson" /> Mark Jenkins of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reviewed the album alongside Candy Machine's ''A Modest Proposal''. He said both bands "play brittle art-[[funk]] that draws on the tradition of [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Pere Ubu]], [[the Pop Group]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] and other left-field types." He said ''Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun'' resembles ''A Modest Proposal'', "without quite so many low-key, recitative interludes. Despite a similar sound, the Chicago quartet provides a few more distinctive details."<ref name="Jenkins" />

Mark Woodlief of ''[[Trouser Press]]'' said that the album "steers Trenchmouth further towards infinity." He felt that "DeZutter turns in his finest work here, from post-hardcore bombast to jazz-inspired inflection, and the band's earnest, precise approach is richer and more intriguing than before."<ref name="Woodlief" /> Chauncey Hollingsworth of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' was more reserved, and while comparing the album to "an alternately plodding and frenetic soundtrack to some Image Union film short," also concluded that the album was "[h]ard to appreciate as art; harder as music."<ref name="Hollingsworth" /> Tyler Fisher of [[Sputnikmusic]] said the album is "a difficult release. The sound is bizarre, chaotic, and jarring. Myself, I hated it on the first few listens. However, going into the album expecting to chaos, I was able to appreciate the rhythmic intricacy and complexity of the songs at their best. Still, a lack of variety and poor production plague the album."<ref name="Fisher" />

[[AllMusic]]'s Joshua Glazer rated the album four and a half stars out of five and named it an "Album Pick". He felt the album captures the aggressive musical palette of the band which consistently "teeters on the edge of chaos while maintaining a ridged form." He commented that: "Mutating time signatures, elaborate guitar phrasing, and fast-walking basslines may traditionally signify 1970s prog-rock obesity, but the Chicago quartet Trenchmouth takes these elements to a field far more left of center."<ref name="Glazer" /> Andrew Earles of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' retrospectively felt the album was a more angular precedent to several [[post-punk revival]] bands active in the mid-2000s.<ref name="Earles" />
