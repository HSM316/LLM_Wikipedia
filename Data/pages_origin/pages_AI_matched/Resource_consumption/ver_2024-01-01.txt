'''Resource consumption''' is about the [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]], or less often, [[renewable resource]]s. Specifically, it may refer to:

* [[water consumption]]
* [[energy consumption]]
** [[electric energy consumption]]
** [[world energy consumption]]
* [[natural gas consumption]]/[[gas depletion]]
* [[oil consumption]]/[[oil depletion]]
* [[logging]]/[[deforestation]]
* [[fishing]]/[[overfishing]] 
* [[land use]]/[[land loss]] or
* [[resource depletion]] and
* general [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and associated [[environmental degradation]]

Measures of resource consumption are [[resource intensity]] and [[resource efficiency]]. [[Industrialization]] and [[globalization|globalized]] [[global markets|markets]] have increased the tendency for [[overconsumption]] of resources. The resource consumption rate of a nation does not usually correspond with the primary resource availability, this is called [[resource curse]].

[[Sustainable consumption|Unsustainable consumption]] by the steadily [[population growth|growing]] [[human population]] may lead to [[resource depletion]] and a shrinking of the earth's [[carrying capacity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monthlyreview.org/2013/01/01/global-resource-depletion/|title=Global Resource Depletion - Is Population the Problem?|author=Fred Magdoff|publisher= [[Monthly Review]]|year=2013}}</ref>
