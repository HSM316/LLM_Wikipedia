==Early life==
Descended from early pioneers of the [[Plymouth Colony]] in [[Massachusetts]], Hub Hoxie was born in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]], [[Wayne County, New York]] on December 18, 1830 to Benjamin Tobey Hoxie and Ruth Peck; his siblings were Melissa Peck Hoxie Fagen, Melville Benjamin Hoxie, Rose M. Hoxie Stevens Hoyt, and William H. Hoxie.

When he was five years old, his parents moved the family to where [[Des Moines, Iowa]] now stands.  There his family worked the trading post near Fort Des Moines No. 2, and young Herbert assisted his father in farming and in trading with the Indians. By 1840, his father kept the Hoxie House — later known as the Jefferson Hotel. Hub's father was also a trustee of the [[Organisation of the Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Society]] by 1844.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |title=Hoxie of Fairfield: From Underground Railroad to Railroad Magnate |access-date=2014-08-05 |archive-date=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005409/http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Gold Fever==
In 1850, Hub traveled overland to [[California]] to seek his fortune in the [[California Gold Rush|gold rush]].<ref>The New York Times, New York, New York, New York, 24 Nov 1886.</ref> His sister, Melissa, joined him and married Dr. Pierce Bye Fagan.  Not as lucky as Melissa's husband, Hub returned to Iowa, where he became interested in politics.  In 1857 married Anna Maria Patrick, the niece of Des Moines' founding father, Thomas Mitchell, who in around 1844 became [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk County]]'s first permanent English-speaking settler, its first sheriff and later a state legislator.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |title=Hoxie of Fairfield: From Underground Railroad to Railroad Magnate |access-date=2014-08-05 |archive-date=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005409/http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Their only child, a son named Seward, died at the age of three.

==Early Republican and abolitionist==
Hub joined the new Republican Party with Thomas Mitchell and helped the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Grinnell, Josiah. "Men and Events of Forty Years". D. Lothrop Company, 1901</ref>  Hub rose from secretary to chairman of the Republican State Central Committee by 1860 when [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the presidency and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] took control of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=187|title = Details Page - the Biographical Dictionary of Iowa - the University of Iowa Libraries}}</ref>

===United States Marshal during the Civil War===
During the war, Hoxie's influence within the party and in state politics increased as he allied himself with Republican power players such as [[James W. Grimes]], [[William B. Allison]], [[John A. Kasson]] and [[Grenville M. Dodge]]. This last political ally supported Hoxie's bid for the position of [[United States Marshal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |title=Hoxie of Fairfield: From Underground Railroad to Railroad Magnate |access-date=2014-08-05 |archive-date=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005409/http://fairfieldiowahistory.com/herbert-m-hoxie/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Hub Hoxie served the Lincoln Administration as Iowa's first Republican [[United States Attorney]].

==Railroad Executive==
===The Union Pacific Railroad ===
Letters exchanged Dodge, a Union Officer in the war, and Hoxie during [[American Civil War]], reveal that the two men remained close and fought for their cause, each in his own way.  Hoxie and other prominent Republicans pushed hard for Dodge's promotion to [[Brigadier General]]. Hoxie believed that Dodge possessed "a kind of general supervision of affairs civil and military in the state."   At Hoxie's death, Dodge described his life and behind-the-scenes contributions to Iowa politics when he said: "We want some Hoxies in the Republican party just now."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=187|title = Details Page - the Biographical Dictionary of Iowa - the University of Iowa Libraries}}</ref>

With the war coming to an end, Hoxie and Dodge used their positions to advance the causes of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and [[Thomas C. Durant|Thomas Durant]].  In August 1864, Hub Hoxie submitted a plan to build and equip the first 100 miles of the railroad at a charge of $50,000 per mile.  In September, his contract was amended to include an additional 147 miles for a total contract price of $12.35 million.  A special committee of Union Pacific's Board of Directors that included [[John Adams Dix]], George T.M. Davis and [[Cornelius Bushnell]] formally accepted it on September 23, 1864.<ref>Bain, David H., "Empire Express" by Penguin, (2000)</ref>

Chief Engineer Peter Dey resigned over the high price of the contract—he had estimated it to be $27,000 per mile-he considered this to be "another of Durant's schemes."<ref>Klein, Maury. "The Union Pacific" by the University of Minnesota Press. (2006)</ref>  Hoxie assigned his contract, at the direction of Durant, to [[Crédit Mobilier of America]] and others in exchange for cash, stock and a position in the company, all three of which he received.

===Hoxie and Jay Gould===
In late 1870 Hub moved to [[Palestine, Texas]], where he was general superintendent of the International Railroad.  Two years later, he became general manager of the [[International & Great Northern]] and of the [[Texas & Pacific Railroad]] in 1880. He also managed the Iron Mountain and the St. Louis & Southern. In 1883 Hoxie became first vice-president for [[Jay Gould]] and his Southwestern system. In 1885 he became Gould's general manager, headquartered in [[St. Louis, MO]].

==Death and legacy==
Hub Hoxie died from complications from surgery on his kidney stones on November 23, 1886, at the Bradbury Apartment House, Broadway and 40th Street in New York City. Hub Hoxie is the namesake of [[Hoxie, Arkansas]] and [[Hoxie, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hwy24.org/uploads/2/6/1/8/26189167/28_town_names.pdf | title=Origin of Town Names | publisher=Solomon Valley Highway 24 Heritage Alliance | accessdate=9 April 2018 | pages=6}}</ref>
