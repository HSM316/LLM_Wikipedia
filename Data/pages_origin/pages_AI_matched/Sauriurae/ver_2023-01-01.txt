{{Short description|Subclass of birds}}
'''Sauriurae''' (meaning "lizard tails" in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) is a now-deprecated [[Class (biology)|subclass]] of [[bird]]s created by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866. It was intended to include ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and distinguish it from all other birds then known, which he grouped in the sister-group [[Ornithurae]] ("bird tails"). The distinction Haeckel referred to in this name is that ''Archaeopteryx'' possesses a long, reptile-like tail, while all other birds known to him had short tails with few vertebrae, fused at the end into a [[pygostyle]].<ref name="Haeckel1886">Haeckel, Ernst. (1866) "Generelle Morphologie der Organismen" Berlin: Georg Reimer. 462 pp.</ref> The unit was not much referred to, and when [[Hans Friedrich Gadow]] in 1893 erected [[Archaeornithes]] for basically the same fossils, this became the common name for the early [[reptile]]-like [[evolutionary grade|grade]] of birds.

Ji Qiang and Larry Martin have continued to refer to the Sauriurae as a valid natural group.<ref name="jiji1996">Ji, Q., and Ji, S. (1996). "On discovery of the earliest bird fossil in China and the origin of birds." ''Chinese Geology'' '''10''' (233): 30-33.</ref> However, researchers like Jacques Gauthier (2001)<ref name="Gauthier&deQueiroz2001" >Gauthier, Jacques, de Queiroz, Kevin. (2001) "Feathered dinosaurs, flying dinosaurs, crown dinosaurs, and the name 'Aves'". in "New Perspective on the Origin and Evolution of Birds: Proceedings of the International Symposium in Honor of John H. Ostrom" Yale Peabody Museum. Yale University. New Haven, Conn. USA</ref> and [[Julia Clarke]] (2002)<ref name="Clarke&Norell2002">Clarke,,Julia. A. , Norell,  Mark. A. (2002) "The Morphology and Phylogenetic Position of Apsaravis ukhaana from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia" American Museum Novitates, No. 3387, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY 10024. </ref> have found that fossils found after Haeckel's time have bridged the gap between long and short-tailed [[Avialae]]. In their view, any grouping of avialans with long tails must exclude some of their descendantsâ€”making Sauriurae a [[paraphyletic]] and, thus, an invalid group under current systems of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]].
