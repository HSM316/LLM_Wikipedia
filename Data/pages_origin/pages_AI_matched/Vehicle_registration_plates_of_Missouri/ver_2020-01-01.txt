The U.S. state of [[Missouri]] first required its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s in 1907. Registrants provided their own [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]s for display until 1911, when the state began to issue plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leatherlicenseplates.com/old-missouri-license-plates-vintage-missouri-license-plates/ |title=Old Missouri License Plates |publisher=LeatherLicensePlates.com |accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref>

Plates are currently manufactured at the [[Jefferson City Correctional Center]] and are issued by the [[Missouri Department of Revenue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dor.mo.gov/motorv/licplate.php#about |title=About Missouri License Plates |publisher=Missouri Department of Revenue |accessdate=September 2, 2019}}</ref> Front and rear plates are required on all vehicles except for motorcycles.

In 1956, the United States, Canada, and Mexico came to an agreement with the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]], the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]] and the [[National Safety Council]] that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for [[motorcycle]]s) at {{convert|6|in|cm}} in height by {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width, with standardized mounting holes.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Garrish |first=Christopher |date=October 2016 |title=Reconsidering the Standard Plate Size |magazine=Plates |publisher=[[Automobile License Plate Collectors Association]] |volume=62 |number=5}}</ref> The 1955 (dated 1956) issue was the first Missouri license plate that complied with these standards.

==Month coding==
{{More citations needed|date=August 2008}}
Since June 2008, serials on passenger and truck plates are coded by the month of the registration's expiration. The first letter of the serial constitutes this code. Once all available combinations beginning with the first letter assigned to that month are issued, a second code letter may be used for that month.
