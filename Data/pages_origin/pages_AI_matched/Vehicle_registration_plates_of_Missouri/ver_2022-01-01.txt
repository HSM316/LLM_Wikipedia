The U.S. state of [[Missouri]] first required its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s in 1907. Registrants provided their own [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]s for display until 1911, when the state began to issue plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leatherlicenseplates.com/old-missouri-license-plates-vintage-missouri-license-plates/ |title=Old Missouri License Plates |publisher=LeatherLicensePlates.com |access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>

{{As of|2021}}, plates are manufactured at the [[Jefferson City Correctional Center]] and are issued by the [[Missouri Department of Revenue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dor.mo.gov/motorv/licplate.php#about |title=About Missouri License Plates |publisher=Missouri Department of Revenue |access-date=September 2, 2019}}</ref> Front and rear plates are required for most classes of vehicles, while only rear plates are required for motorcycles and trailers.

In 1956, the United States, Canada, and Mexico came to an agreement with the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]], the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]] and the [[National Safety Council]] that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for [[motorcycle]]s) at {{convert|6|in|cm}} in height by {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width, with standardized mounting holes.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Garrish |first=Christopher |date=October 2016 |title=Reconsidering the Standard Plate Size |magazine=Plates |publisher=[[Automobile License Plate Collectors Association]] |volume=62 |number=5}}</ref> The 1955 (dated 1956) issue was the first Missouri license plate that complied with these standards.

==Month coding==
{{More citations needed|date=August 2008}}
Missouri implemented a monthly staggered registration system in 1949, when it introduced its first multi-year passenger plate. At first, serials were in an all-numeric format, with a block allocated to each month. When these were exhausted, a new format was introduced, featuring a one-letter prefix corresponding to the month. When new multi-year plates were introduced in 1956, the same all-numeric and one-letter serial formats were used, with some months then exhausting their one-letter serials and introducing a two-letter format (the first letter still corresponding to the month).<ref name="allaboutlicenseplatesMO"/>

Two-letter serial formats were used exclusively from 1962 through 1978, including the twelve-year period in which Missouri reverted to the use of single-year plates (1967–78). An ABC-123 format was introduced in 1979 with the maroon "Show-Me State" plate, which was issued through 1996; months which exhausted their allocations subsequently used the A1B-234 and 1A2-34B formats.<ref name="allaboutlicenseplatesMO"/>

Throughout this period, the first letter in the serial continued to correspond to the month. Increasing demand resulted in each of the months from April through September being assigned a second letter code in the mid-1960s. March and October were assigned second letters in the mid-1970s, and by the 1990s all twelve months were using two letters.<ref>{{cite web |last=Turnbull |first=Andrew |title=Coding the Month: The Secrets of Staggered Registration, Part 3 |url=http://www.andrewturnbull.net/plates/monthcodes.html |publisher=The Andrew Turnbull Network |access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref>

Since June 2008, serials on passenger and truck plates are coded by the month of the registration's expiration. The first letter of the serial constitutes this code. Once all available combinations beginning with the first letter assigned to that month are issued, a second code letter may be used for that month.

==Optional types==
Optional types on this base continue to be issued, likely until January 2009. Most, if not all, optional types on this base were available in personalized format and with certain non-passenger designations. Where applicable, this designation was printed in a small rectangle screened in the upper right corner of the plate.
