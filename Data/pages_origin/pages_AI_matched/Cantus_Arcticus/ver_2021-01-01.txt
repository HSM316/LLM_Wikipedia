Subtitled ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra'', it incorporates tape recordings of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] recorded near the [[Arctic Circle]], and on the [[bog]]s of [[Liminka]], in northern Finland.

The work is in three movements: ''The bog'' opens with a [[Western concert flute|flute]] duet, after which the other [[woodwind]]s join in, followed by the birds. The second movement, ''Melancholy'', features a slowed-down recording of the song of the [[shore lark]]. The final movement, ''Swans migrating'', takes the form of a long [[crescendo]] for orchestra, with the sounds of [[whooper swan]]s. At the end both birdsong and orchestra fade, as if into the distance.<ref>CD liner notes, ''Cantus Arcticus'', Ondine ODE 1041-2</ref>
