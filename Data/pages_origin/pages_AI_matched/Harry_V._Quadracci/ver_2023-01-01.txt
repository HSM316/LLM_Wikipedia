== Work at Krueger ==
Quadracci worked at W.A.Krueger, but eventually left when a managerial disagreement led to a strike. He was not included when the president of the company reached a settlement, and he felt the negotiating was done behind his back. He interpreted it as a signal that he would not eventually fulfill the role as president of the company. He then left to form his own company.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.anbhf.org/laureates/quadracci.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 4, 2014 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150431/http://www.anbhf.org/laureates/quadracci.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>
