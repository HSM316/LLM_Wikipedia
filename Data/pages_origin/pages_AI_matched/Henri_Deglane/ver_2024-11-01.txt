'''Henri Deglane''' (22 June 1902 &ndash; 7 July 1975) was a French [[sport wrestling|wrestler]]. He was an Olympic Champion in [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] and [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|AWA World Champion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/58059 |title=Henri Deglane |work=Olympedia |access-date=17 December 2021}}</ref>

In May 1931, Deglane faced [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] for the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version)|AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in Montreal in a two-out-of-three falls match. After two falls, Deglane had feigned being bitten by Lewis, when in reality he had been bitten in the locker room. This led to Deglane being awarded the title via disqualification and a dispute over who was actually acknowledged as champion over the next two years.<ref>{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Solomon|title=Pro Wrestling FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the World's Most Entertaining Spectacle|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2015|pages=408|isbn=9781617136276}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Larry|last=Matysik|title=50 Greatest Professional Wrestlers of All Time: The Definitive Shoot|publisher=ECW Press|year=2013|pages=320|isbn=9781770903050}}</ref>
