'''''Nagalit ang Buwan sa Haba ng Gabi''''' ({{translation|''The Moon Got Mad at the Long Night''}}) is a 1983 Filipino drama film written and directed by [[Danny Zialcita]]. It depicts and tackles the love affairs, homosexuality, and adultery.

The film revolves the seemingly normal love polygon - Delza (Laurice Guillen), the long-suffering and problematic wife; Stella (Gloria Diaz), the mistress; and Miguel (Dindo Fernando), the adulterous husband. There are a few more cornerstones in this love polygon, like Dimitri (Eddie Garcia), Stella's husband who is gay and Raul (Tommy Abuel), Delza's ex-boyfriend as well as some other characters that would make a huge connection to the story filled with fiascoes of marriage and affairs.

The film was digitally restored and remastered in high-definition by the [[ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project]] and Central Digital Lab. The restored version was premiered on November 17, 2016, at Trinoma Cinema 1.<ref>{{YouTube|id=wLD6Rtq_SkM|title=ABS-CBN Film Restoration: Nagalit Ang Buwan Sa Haba Ng Gabi Before and After Teaser}}</ref>

==Reception==
According to a mixed-positive review by Reverse Delay regarding the film and its restoration, “The newly-restored classic proves that we have been fascinated with romance-dramas about infidelity for so long now.” and “Old films can show us how far we have come; if not as a society, then at least as a film-producing culture. Although, equally often, these historical works reveal precisely how much we have stayed the same.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reversedelay.net/2016/12/21/review-nagalit-ang-buwan-sa-haba-ng-gabi-1983-restored-2016-by-danny-zialcita/|title=Review: 'Nagalit ang Buwan sa Haba ng Gabi' (Danny Zialcita, 1983)|date=December 21, 2016 |website=Reverse Delay |access-date=March 17, 2021}}</ref>
