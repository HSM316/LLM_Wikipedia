The '''Integrated Global System Model''' ('''IGSM''') is an [[Integrated assessment modelling|Integrated Assessment Model]] (IAM) developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) [[Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change]].

==History==

IGSM was introduced in 1999 in a paper by [[Ronald Prinn]] et al. in a paper in ''[[Climatic Change]]''<ref name=v1-1999>{{cite journal|url=http://eomf.ou.edu/media/docs/upload/Prinn_1999_IGSM.pdf|title = Integrated Global System Model for Climate Policy Assessment: Feedbacks and Sensitivity Studies|last = Prinn|first = Ronald|last2 = Jocoby|first2 = Henry|last3 = Sokolov|first3 = Andrei|journal = [[Climatic Change]]|volume = 41|issue = 3/4|pages = 469–546|date = 1999|accessdate = June 28, 2014|display-authors=etal|doi = 10.1023/A:1005326126726}}</ref> Version 2 was released in 2005.<ref name=v2-2005/>
