==Release==
The film was a moderate hit at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/97/Oct/a-z/atoz-3.htm |title=A-Z (III) |work=Indolink Tamil |accessdate=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927193802/http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/97/Oct/a-z/atoz-3.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name by producers C. H. Ganeswara Rao and P. Indira in 2000.

N. Pandian later began work on ''Perazhagi'' starring [[Ajith Kumar]] in 1998 for Shogun Films, and a further project for [[Anbalaya Films]] simultaneously. Neither film eventually materialised, and as a result, his next release was ''[[365 Kadhal Kadithangal]]'' in 2010.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20030814102411/http://www.dinakaran.com/cinema/english/cinenews/17-04-98/cinenews.htm#1</ref>

The producer Ashok Samrat, encouraged by the success of ''Priyam'', began another venture soon after titled ''Kalvettu'' featuring [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] and [[Divya Unni]]. The film was later stalled due to production trouble, and Samrat opted out of the film industry.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20010515042211/http://www.cinesouth.com/masala/23082000/news02.shtml</ref>
