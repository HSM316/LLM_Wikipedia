==Description==
It is a woody [[Perennial plant|perennial]] bush-like tree 1–5 meters in height.  Its stems are erect and covered in small hairs called [[trichome]]s. Its oblong, leathery, blueish-green leaves lack distinct [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s and are blunt or notched at their tips. The leaves are 3-15 long by 2-7 centimeters wide. Its flowers are solitary on 3 centimeter long [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s. The outer petals of the flowers are orange. Its [[berry]]-fruit are golden yellow to orange with white flesh and black seeds.<ref name="Plantaemattogrossenses">{{cite book |last= Rodrigues|first=João Barbosa |date=1898 |title=Plantae mattogrossenses, ou, relação de plantas novas : colhidas, classificadas e desengadas |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/213591  |language=Portuguese, Latin|location=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Leuzinger |page=5}}</ref><ref name="Maasde Kamer2001">{{cite journal|last1=Maas|first1=Paul J.

The single leaf has an oval shape, smooth margin and rounded blade tip. The leaf [[Phyllotaxis|phyllotaxy]] is alternately attached along the stems of the plant. This is called alternate arrangement as the stems grow staggered at different heights from each other. The venation in the leaf blade is [[Pinnation|pinnate]]. It has a single [https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/midrib midrib] and secondary veins branching off the midvein.

== Reproductive biology ==
The pollen of ''Annona aurantiaca'' is shed as permanent tetrads.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=James W. |date=1971 |title=Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae |jstor=41764703 |journal=Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University |volume=202 |pages=1–130}}</ref> Its flowers open over a two night period with a female phase on the first night, and a male phase on the second night. It is pollinated by the scarab beetle ''[[Cyclocephala]] atricapilla''.<ref name="Gottsberger1989">{{cite journal|last1=Gottsberger|first1=Gerhard|title=Beetle pollination and flowering rhythm of Annona spp. (Annonaceae) in Brazil|journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=167 |issue=3-4 |year=1989 |pages=165–187 |issn=0378-2697 |doi=10.1007/BF00936404}}</ref>

== Uses ==
The pulp of the fruit has been reported to be edible <ref name="TeixeiraMelo2019">{{cite journal|last1=Teixeira|first1=Nayane|last2=Melo|first2=Jean C.S.|last3=Batista|first3=Luiz F.|last4=Paula-Souza|first4=Juliana|last5=Fronza|first5=Pãmella|last6=Brandão|first6=Maria G.L.|title=Edible fruits from Brazilian biodiversity: A review on their sensorial characteristics versus bioactivity as tool to select research |journal=Food Research International |volume=119 |year=2019 |pages=325–348 |issn=0963-9969 |doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2019.01.058}}</ref> and stores well outside.<ref name=":0" />  Although the berry-like fruit pulp is sweet and edible, the seed is poisonous.<ref name=":0" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
A. aurantiaca is native to South America and is widely distributed, particularly in the savanna ([[Cerrado]]) and [[List of Brazilian National Forests|forests]] of Brazil.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunshine-seeds.de/Annona-aurantiaca-45280p.html?language=en|title=Annona aurantiaca - Fruit & Useful Plants, A|website=www.sunshine-seeds.de|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>  It grows ideally in shaded areas<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/herbcat/navigator.do|title=Kew Herbarium Catalogue|website=apps.kew.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> in sandy, clay soil.<ref name=Plantaemattogrossenses/> This plant is considered fast-growing and develops into a small shrub-like tree reaching approximately 4 meters at maturity.<ref name=":0"/>

== Growth and propagation ==
In its native climate, the growing season is year-round.  The seeds can [[Germination|germinate]] between 25-28 degrees Celsius and germination takes between 2 and 6 weeks.  Propagation can be achieved by [[sowing]] the seeds directly or by planting [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. A consistent temperature of 15-20 degrees Celsius is required for successful sowing.  Prior to sowing, hot water may be poured over the seeds and the seeds must be allowed to soak for 24 to 48 hours to reduce germination time.<ref name=":0" /> This plant requires consistently moist soil to thrive but can tolerate both bright sunlight and partial shade.  While requiring consistent moisture, the seed can be planted in potting soil mixed with sand or [[perlite]] to ensure proper drainage.  The long term use of fertilizer is also effective at assisting in sowing.  This plant tends to encounter pests such as spider mites ([[Tetranychus urticae]]) particularly in the dry, humid months.  To maintain plant health during [[overwintering]], considered between the temperatures of 10-15 degrees Celsius, enough water must be added so that the roots do not dry out completely.<ref name=":0" />
