The '''Mikwam River''' is a tributary of the [[Burntbush River]], flowing in the [[Cochrane District]] in [[northeastern Ontario]], in [[Canada]].

Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The west side of this slope is served by the Ontario road 652.

The surface of the river is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, but safe circulation on the ice generally occurs from mid-November to the end of April.

== Geography ==
The hydrographic slopes adjacent to the Mikwam River are:
*North side: [[Burntbush River]], [[North Burntbush River]], [[Lawagamau River]];
*East side: [[Burntbush River]], [[Turcotte River]];
*South side: [[South Mikwam River]], [[Little Mikwam River]], Porphyry Creek, [[Kabika River (Ontario)]], [[East Kabika River]], [[Seguin River]];
*West side: [[South Floodwood River South]], Floodwood River, [[Little Abitibi River]].

The Mikwam river takes its source from a mountain stream (altitude: {{convert|343|m}}).

From its source, the Mikwam River flows on {{convert|87.8|km}} according to the following segments:
*{{convert|7.4|km}} to the south boundary of the township of Newman, passing on the eastern side of a mountain whose summit reaches {{convert|391|m}};
*{{convert|9.9|km}} northeast by forming a S entering in Newman Township, to the confluence of the East Mikwam River;
*{{convert|5.0|km}} to the north through marsh areas to the south shore of Snare Lake;
*{{convert|12.4|km}} to the north, including {{convert|3.3|km}} across Springer Lake to the southern boundary of Blakelock Township;
*{{convert|12.8|km}} to the north, crossing Lake Magishan and {{convert|4.7|km}} across Lake Mikwam to its mouth. Note: Lake Mikwam receives on the west side the discharge of Lake Brayley and on the east side, the [[Little Mikwam River]];
*{{convert|18.0|km}} northeast, then southeasterly when entering Hoblitzell Township, to Porphyry Creek (coming from the South).<ref>Distances measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources of Canada.</ref>

The confluence of the Mikwam River is located in Hoblitzell Township, at {{convert|29.3|km}} west of the [[Ontario]] - [[Quebec]]; to the west of the mouth of the [[Burntbush River]]; to the southeast of a bay south of [[Kesagami Lake]] and to the east of the Ontario road 652.
